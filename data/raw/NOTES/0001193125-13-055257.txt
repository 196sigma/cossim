Financial Statements and Supplementary Data 
Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm 
To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of Innospec Inc.:
We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets
of Innospec Inc. and its subsidiaries Innospec as of December31, 2012 and 2011, and the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income and accumulated other comprehensive loss, cash flows and stockholders
equity for each of the years then ended. We also have audited Innospecs internal control over financial reporting as of December31, 2012, based on criteria established in Internal Control Integrated Framework issued by the
Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission COSO. Innospecs management is responsible for these consolidated financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its
assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Managements Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting appearing in item 9A of the Form 10-K. Our responsibility is
to express an opinion on these consolidated financial statements and an opinion on Innospecs internal control over financial reporting based on our audits. 
We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public
Company Accounting Oversight Board United States. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement and whether effective internal
control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audits of the consolidated financial statements included examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing
the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, and evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control
over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other procedures
as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions. 
A companys internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial
reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A companys internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that
1pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; 2provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as
necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors
of the company; and 3provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the companys assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect
misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may
deteriorate.  In our opinion, the consolidated financial
statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Innospec as of December31, 2012 and 2011, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for the years then ended, in conformity with U.S.
generally accepted accounting principles. Also in our opinion, Innospec maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December31, 2012, based on criteria established in Internal Control
Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission.  Innospec acquired Strata Control Services, Inc. Strata on December 24, 2012, and management excluded from its assessment of the effectiveness of Innospecs internal control over
financial reporting as of December31, 2012, Stratas internal control over financial reporting associated with total assets of $594 million included in the consolidated financial statements of Innospec as of and for the year ended
December31, 2012. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting of Innospec also excluded an evaluation of the internal control over financial reporting of Strata.

58 Table of Contents NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 
Note 1.Nature of Operations 
Innospec develops, manufactures, blends, markets and
supplies fuel additives, personal care and fragrance products and other specialty chemicals. Our products are sold primarily to oil refineries, personal care and fragrance companies, and other chemical and industrial companies throughout the world.
Our fuel additives help improve fuel efficiency, boost engine performance and reduce harmful emissions. Our other specialty chemicals provide effective technology-based solutions for our customers processes or products focused in the Personal
Care; Polymers; and Fragrance Ingredients markets. Principal product lines and reportable segments are Fuel Specialties, Performance Chemicals and Octane Additives. 
See Note 3 for financial information on the Companys reportable
segments.  Following a review of internally developed software and
other costs capitalized in 2011, a reclassification of $16 million has been made in the fourth quarter of 2012, from internally developed software and other costs to property, plant and equipment, for costs related to the development of new
information technology infrastructure. Prior year comparatives have not been conformed to current year classifications. 
Note 2.Accounting Policies 
Basis of preparation: The consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance
with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America and include all subsidiaries of the Company where the Company has a controlling financial interest. All significant intercompany accounts and balances have been eliminated
upon consolidation. All acquisitions are accounted for as purchases and the results of operations of the acquired businesses are included in the consolidated financial statements from the date of acquisition. 
Use of estimates: The preparation of the consolidated financial statements, in accordance with generally
accepted accounting principles in the United States of America, requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. Actual results could differ from
those estimates. 
Cash equivalents: Investment securities with maturities of three months or less when
purchased are considered to be cash equivalents. 
Short-term investments: Investment securities with maturities of more than 3 months and less than 12 months
when purchased are considered to be short-term investments. 
Trade and other accounts receivable: The Company records trade and other accounts
receivable at net realizable value and maintains allowances for customers not making required payments. The Company determines the adequacy of allowances by periodically evaluating each customer receivable considering our customers financial
condition, credit history and current economic conditions. 
59 Table of Contents NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTSContinued  Inventories: Inventories are stated at the lower of cost FIFO method or market value. Cost includes
materials, labor and an appropriate proportion of plant overheads. The Company accrues volume discounts where it is probable that the required volume will be attained and the amount can be reasonably estimated. The discounts are recorded as a
reduction in the cost of materials based on projected purchases over the period of the agreement. Inventories are adjusted for estimated obsolescence and written down to market value based on estimates of future demand and market conditions.
Property, plant and equipment: Property, plant and equipment are stated at cost less
accumulated depreciation. Depreciation is provided over the estimated useful lives of the assets using the straight-line method and is allocated between cost of goods sold and operating expenses. The cost of additions and improvements are
capitalized. Maintenance and repairs are charged to expenses. When assets are sold or retired the associated cost and accumulated depreciation are removed from the consolidated financial statements and any related gain or loss is included in
earnings. The estimated useful lives of the major classes of depreciable assets are as follows:  Buildings 7to25years Equipment 3 to 10 years 
Goodwill and other intangible assets: Goodwill and other intangible assets
deemed to have indefinite lives are not amortized but are subject to at least annual impairment tests based on projected post-tax cash flows discounted at the Companys weighted average cost of capital. The annual measurement date for
impairment testing of the goodwill relating to the Fuel Specialties and Performance Chemicals segments is December31. At this date we performed annual impairment tests and concluded that there had been no impairment of goodwill in respect of
those reporting segments. Octane Additives segment goodwill is tested for impairment at the end of each quarter. As expected the decline in the Octane Additives market has resulted in quarterly impairment charges being incurred from the first
quarter of 2004 onwards. It is highly likely that further quarterly charges will be incurred in future years as the market continues to decline. The Company capitalizes software development costs, including licenses, subsequent to the establishment
of technological feasibility. Other intangible assets deemed to have finite lives, including software development costs and licenses, are amortized using the straight-line method over their estimated useful lives and tested for any potential
impairment when events occur or circumstances change which suggest that an impairment may have occurred. 
Deferred finance costs: The costs relating to debt financing are capitalized, separately disclosed in
the consolidated balance sheets and amortized using the effective interest method over the expected life of the debt financing facility. 
Impairment of long-lived assets: The Company reviews the carrying value of
its long-lived assets, including buildings and equipment, whenever changes in circumstances suggest that the carrying values may be impaired. In order to facilitate this test the Company groups
60 Table of Contents NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTSContinued 
together assets at the lowest possible level for which cash flow information is available. Undiscounted future cash flows expected to result from the assets are compared with the carrying value
of the assets and if they are lower an impairment loss may be recognized. The amount of the impairment loss is the difference between the fair value and the carrying value of the assets. Fair values are determined using post-tax cash flows
discounted at the Companys weighted average cost of capital. 
Derivative instruments: The Company uses various derivative instruments including forward currency
contracts, options, interest rate swaps and commodity swaps to manage certain exposures. These instruments are entered into under the Companys corporate risk management policy to minimize exposure and are not for speculative trading purposes.
The Company recognizes all derivatives as either non-current assets or liabilities in the consolidated balance sheet and measures those instruments at fair value. Changes in the fair value of derivatives that are not designated as hedges, or do not
meet the requirements for hedge accounting, are recognized in earnings. Derivatives which are designated as hedges are tested for effectiveness on a quarterly basis, and marked to market. The ineffective portion of the derivatives change in
value is recognized in earnings. The effective portion is recognized in other comprehensive income until the hedged item is recognized in earnings. 
Environmental compliance and remediation: Environmental compliance costs include ongoing
maintenance, monitoring and similar costs. We recognize environmental liabilities when they are probable and costs can be reasonably estimated, and asset retirement obligations when there is a legal obligation and costs can be reasonably estimated.
Such accruals are adjusted as further information develops or circumstances change. Costs of future obligations are discounted to their present values using the Companys credit-adjusted risk-free rate. 
Acquisition-related contingent and deferred consideration: Deferred consideration payable in cash
is discounted to its fair value. Where deferred consideration is contingent upon pre-determined financial targets, an estimate of the fair value of the likely consideration payable is made. This contingent deferred consideration is re-assessed
annually and a corresponding adjustment is recognized in operating income, and the associated liability, to reflect the passage of time accretion expense and any revisions to the amount or timing of the initial measurement. 
Revenue recognition: The Company supplies products to customers from its various manufacturing
sites, and in some instances from containers held on customer sites, under a variety of standard shipping terms and conditions. In each case revenue is recognized when legal title, which is defined and generally accepted in the standard terms and
conditions, and risk of loss transfers between the Company and the customer. Provisions for sales discounts and rebates to customers are based upon the terms of sales contracts and are recorded in the same period as the related sales as a deduction
from revenue. The Company estimates the provision for sales discounts and rebates based on the terms of each agreement at the time of shipping. 
61 Table of Contents NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTSContinued  Components of net sales: All amounts billed to customers relating to shipping and handling are
classified as net sales.Shipping and handling costs incurred by the Company are classified as cost of goods sold. 
Components of cost of goods sold: Cost of goods sold is comprised of raw material
costs including inbound freight, duty and non-recoverable taxes, inbound handling costs associated with the receipt of raw materials, packaging materials, manufacturing costs including labor costs, maintenance and utility costs, plant and
engineering overheads, amortization expense for certain other intangible assets, warehousing and outbound shipping costs and handling costs. Inventory losses and provisions and the costs of customer claims are also recognized in the cost of goods
line item. 
Components of selling, general and administrative expenses:
Selling expenses comprise the costs of the direct sales force, and the sales management and customer service departments required to support them. It also comprises commission charges, the costs of sales conferences and trade shows, the cost of
advertising and promotions, amortization expense for certain other intangible assets, and the cost of bad and doubtful debts. General and administrative expenses comprise the cost of support functions including accounting, human resources,
information technology and the cost of group functions including corporate management, finance, tax, treasury, investor relations and legal departments. Provision of managements best estimate of legal and settlement costs for litigation in
which the Company is involved is made and reported in the administrative expense line item. 
Research and development expenses: Research, development and testing costs are
expensed to the income statement as incurred. 
Earnings per share: Basic earnings per share is based on the weighted average number of common
shares outstanding during the period. Diluted earnings per share includes the effect of options that are dilutive and outstanding during the period. 
Foreign currencies: The Companys policy is that exchange
differences arising on the translation of the balance sheets of entities that have functional currencies other than the U.S. dollar are taken to a separate equity reserve, the cumulative translation adjustment. In entities where the U.S. dollar is
the functional currency no gains or losses on translation occur, and gains or losses on monetary assets relating to currencies other than the U.S. dollar are taken to the income statement. Gains or losses on foreign currency translations are
included in other net income/expense in the income statement. 
Share based compensation plans: The Company accounts for employee
stock options under the fair value method. Accordingly, share based compensation is measured at the grant date based on the fair value of the options. The Company uses the straight-line attribution method to recognize share based compensation costs
over the service period of the option. 
62 Table of Contents NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTSContinued  Pension plans and other post-employment benefits: The Company recognizes the
funded status of defined benefit post-retirement plans on the consolidated balance sheets and changes in the funded status in comprehensive income. The measurement date of the plans funded status is the same as the Companys fiscal
year-end. 
Income taxes: The Company provides for income taxes by recognizing deferred tax assets and liabilities for
the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and the relevant tax bases of the assets and liabilities. When appropriate, the Company evaluates the need for a valuation allowance to
reduce deferred tax assets. The Company recognizes future tax benefits to the extent that realization of such benefits is more likely than not. The effect on deferred taxes of a change in tax rates is recognized in the period that includes the
enactment date. Income tax positions must meet a more likely than not recognition criteria to be recognized. The Company recognizes accrued interest and penalties associated with uncertain tax positions as part of income taxes in our consolidated
statements of income. 
Note 3.Segmental Reporting and Geographical Area Data 
Innospec divides its business into three segments for
management and reporting purposes: Fuel Specialties, Performance Chemicals and Octane Additives. On September20, 2012, the Company announced its Active Chemicals segment would be renamed Performance Chemicals, effective October1, 2012,
to make the purpose of its products clearer to the customers it serves. The Fuel Specialties and Performance Chemicals segments operate in markets where we actively seek growth opportunities although their ultimate customers are different. The
Octane Additives segment is generally characterized by volatile and declining demand.  In 2012, the Company had a significant customer in the Fuel Specialties segment, Royal Dutch Shell plc and its affiliates Shell, which accounted for $829 million 11%of our net group
sales. In 2011 and 2010, Shell accounted for $787 million 10%and $678 million 10%of our net group sales, respectively.

Gross cost is net of $87 million, $03 million and $2895
million of historical accumulated amortization in respect of the Fuel Specialties, Performance Chemicals and Octane Additives reporting segments, respectively. 
The Companys reporting units, the level at which goodwill is tested for impairment, are consistent with the reportable segments: Fuel Specialties,
Performance Chemicals and Octane Additives. The components in each segment including products, markets and competitors have similar economic characteristics and the segments, therefore, reflect the lowest level at which operations and cash flows
can be clearly distinguished, operationally and for financial reporting purposes, from the rest of the Company.  The Company tests goodwill annually for impairment, or between years if events occur or circumstances change which suggest that an impairment may have occurred. 
To determine the fair value of each of our segments we utilize a discounted
cash flow methodology based on the forecasted future after-tax cash flows from operations for each 
68 Table of Contents NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTSContinued 
since we believe this provides the best approximation of fair value. This methodology requires us to make assumptions and estimates including those in respect of future revenue growth and gross
margins, which are based upon our long range plans, and the Companys weighted average cost of capital. Our long range plans are regularly updated as part of our planning processes and are reviewed and approved by management and our Board of
Directors. We assume terminal values for the Fuel Specialties and Performance Chemicals reporting units which are added to the present value of the relevant forecasted future cash flows. We assume no terminal value for the Octane Additives reporting
unit beyond its estimated future life. The discounted cash flow methodology does not assume a control premium. We use a discount rate equivalent to the Companys weighted average cost of capital which is estimated by reference to the overall
after-tax rate of return required by equity and debt market participants in the Company. We assign assets and liabilities, including deferred taxes and goodwill, to our reporting units if the asset or liability relates to the operations of that
reporting unit and is included in determining the fair value of the reporting unit. Cash and debt obligations are excluded from the carrying value of our reporting units. 
In 2012 some of the assumptions and estimates underpinning our discounted
cash flows were revised as part of our planning processes although the methodology was unchanged. The most significant revisions were that the Companys weighted average cost of capital was changed to reflect the changing proportion of debt to
equity funding of the Company.  The Company elected to perform its
annual tests in respect of Fuel Specialties and Performance Chemicals goodwill as at December31 each year.At December31, 2012 we had $1176 million and $301 million of goodwill relating to our Fuel Specialties and Performance
Chemicals segments, respectively.At this date we performed annual impairment tests and concluded that there had been no impairment of goodwill in respect of those reporting segments.  In light of the continuing decline in the Octane Additives market globally, as the Company makes sales of Octane Additives in
each quarter, the remaining sales and corresponding cash flows that can be derived from the Octane Additives segment are reduced, and accordingly the fair value of the Octane Additives reporting unit is reduced. As a result, the Company determined
that quarterly impairment tests be performed from January1, 2004 and any impairment charge arising be recognized in the relevant quarter. As a result of the Octane Additives impairment tests performed during 2012, 2011 and 2010 impairment
charges of $12 million, $20 million and $22 million, respectively, have been recognized.These charges are non-cash in nature and have no impact on taxation.There was $13 million of goodwill remaining at December31, 2012 which
relates to the Octane Additives segment. Given the quantum and predictability of the remaining future cash flows from the Octane Additives segment, the Company expects goodwill impairment charges to be recognized in the income statement on an
approximate straight-line basis to December31, 2013.

The table below presents the impact a change in the following significant assumptions would have had on
our impairment charge recognized at December31, 2012 in respect of goodwill, other intangible assets and property, plant and equipment assuming all other assumptions and factors remained constant:  in millions Approximate Increase/Decreaseto

quarterly impairment tests are reasonable, but that they are judgmental, and variations in any of the assumptions may result in materially different calculations of impairment charges, if any.  Acquisitions 
On December24, 2012, the Company acquired 100% of the voting equity interests in Strata Control Services, Inc. Strata, a private
company based in Crowley, Louisiana, for a consideration of approximately $600 million. Strata is a leading supplier of mud and fluid loss solutions to oil and gas drilling operations, with annual sales in 2012 of approximately $200 million. Its
products and services prevent the unnecessary loss of valuable materials into the formation matrix thereby lowering the cost of operations. We acquired Strata in order to build out our presence in the growing market that it serves.

comprises $531 million paid immediately on December24, 2012, and $50 million payable in cash in 2015 contingent upon the achievement of certain pre-determined financial targets which we
currently expect to be achieved. For accounting purposes only, we are required under GAAP, in accordance with our accounting policy, to discount this acquisition-related contingent consideration to its fair value of $43million. In addition,

Ethyl 
An intangible asset of $284 million was recognized in the second quarter of
2007 in respect of Ethyl Corporation foregoing their entitlement effective April1, 2007 to a share of the future income stream under the sales and marketing agreements to market and sell TEL. In 2008, contract provisions no longer deemed
necessary of $63 million were offset against the intangible asset. The amount attributed to the Octane Additives reporting segment was being amortized straight-line to December31, 2012 and the amount attributed to the Fuel Specialties
reporting segment is being amortized straight-line to December31, 2017. Effective October1,2011, the Company extended its estimate for the future life of the Octane Additives segment from December31, 2012 to December31,
2013 and therefore prospectively adjusted the amortization period for the amount attributed to the Octane Additives segment. An amortization expense of $16 million was recognized in 2012 2011 $19 million in cost of goods sold. 
Technology 
Following the acquisition of the remaining 50% of Innospec Fuel Specialties
LLC on July8, 2004, the Company recognized an intangible asset of $23 million in respect of various technological approvals the business has received from certain military and civilian authorities. The approvals act as a barrier to entry to
any potential competitor in the market who would wish to supply these products. 
72 Table of Contents NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTSContinued 
An intangible asset of $48 million was recognized in respect of a number of specialized manufacturing
processes carried out by Innospec Widnes Limited following the acquisition of that entity in August 2004.  Both of these assets have an expected life of 10 years and are being amortized on a straight-line basis over this period. No residual value is anticipated. An amortization expense of $07million was
recognized in 2012 2011 $07 million in cost of goods sold.  Customer relationships  Following the acquisition of Finetex now merged into Innospec Active Chemicals LLC in January 2005, the Company recognized an intangible asset totaling $71 million, $42million of which was in
relation to customer lists acquired. This asset has an expected life of 13 years and is being amortized on a straight-line basis over this period. No residual value is anticipated. 
Intangible assets were recognized in 2004 in respect of both the Innospec
Fuel Specialties LLC $90 million and Innospec Widnes Limited $28 million acquisitions, and relate to ongoing customer relationships. These have an expected life of 10 years and are being amortized on a straight-line basis over that period. No
residual value is anticipated.  An amortization expense of $15
million was recognized in 2012 2011 $15 million in selling, general and administrative expenses. 
Patents 
Following the acquisition of Finetex, the Company recognized an intangible asset of $29million in respect of patents and trademarks. These have an
expected life of 10 years and are being amortized on a straight-line basis over that period. An amortization expense of $03million was recognized in 2012 2011 $03 million in cost of goods sold. 
Internally developed software and other
costs  We are continuing with the implementation of a new,
company-wide, information system platform.At December31, 2012 we had capitalized $101 million 2011 $31 million in relation to this internally developed software. No amortization was recognized in 2012 2011 $00

On December24, 2012, the Company acquired 100% of the
voting equity interests in Strata. The purchase price allocation and related valuation process is not yet complete. We have however provisionally allocated $480 million of the purchase price to other intangible assets which we expect to amortize on
a straight-line basis to the income statement over a weighted average expected life of 13 years. Final determination of the fair values may result in further adjustments to these estimates.

Amortization expense 
The aggregate other intangible asset amortization expense was $41 million 44million and $47 million in 2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively, of which $26 million, $29million and $31 million, respectively, was recognized in cost of goods sold, and the remainder was recognized in selling, general and
administrative expenses.  Future amortization expense is estimated
to be $100 million, $105 million and $95 million for 2013, 2014, and 2015 respectively. 
Note 8. Deferred Finance Costs 
On December14, 2011, we entered into a new five-year
revolving credit facility and $17million of refinancing costs were capitalized. These are being amortized over the expected life of the revolving credit facility using the effective interest method. Deferred finance costs associated with the
previous finance facility became fully amortized in the third quarter of 2011.  in millions

Note 9. Pension Plans 
United Kingdom plan
The Company maintains a defined benefit pension plan the
Plan covering a number of its current and former employees in the United Kingdom, although it does also have other much smaller pension arrangements in the U.S. and overseas. The Plan is closed to future service accrual but has a large
number of deferred and current pensioners. The Projected Benefit Obligation PBO is based on final salary and years of credited service reduced by social security benefits according to a plan formula. Normal retirement age is 65 but
provisions are made for early retirement. The Plans assets are invested by two investment management companies in funds holding United Kingdom and overseas equities, United Kingdom and overseas fixed interest securities, index linked
securities, property unit trusts and cash or cash equivalents. The trustees investment policy is to seek to achieve specified objectives through investing in a suitable mixture of real and monetary assets. The trustees recognize that the
returns on real assets, while expected to be greater over the long-term than those on monetary assets, are likely to be more volatile. A mixture across asset classes should nevertheless provide the level of returns required by the Plan to meet its
liabilities at an acceptable level of risk for the trustees and an acceptable level of cost to the Company. 
74 Table of Contents NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTSContinued 
The Company closed the Plan to future service accrual with effect from March31, 2010 and
accordingly we recorded a non-cash curtailment loss of $82 million in the first quarter of 2010. During the second quarter of 2010 the Company implemented a pension increase exchange PIE program for current pensioners, effective
April1, 2010, which reduced the PBO by $171 million. This reduction in PBO resulted in a prior service credit which is being amortized using the straight-line method over the remaining life expectancy of Plan pensioners of 15 years commencing
April1, 2010. The PIE program provided pensioners with the option of receiving a one-off immediate increase to their pension in lieu of future non-statutory increases. During the fourth quarter of 2010 the Company implemented an enhanced
transfer value ETV program for deferred pensioners which reduced the PBO by $157 million and resulted in a settlement loss of $11 million. The ETV program provided deferred pensioners with the option of transferring their existing
pension entitlement from the Plan to another vehicle in exchange for an enhancement to the standard terms available for such a transfer. 
Since April 2010 the Company has been contributing 58million approximately $9 million per calendar year to the Plan in accordance with a
10-year actuarial deficit recovery plan agreed with the trustees. The Company expects its annual cash contribution from January1, 2013 to be approximately $11 million.  in millions

The discount rate used represents the annualized yield based on a cash flow matched methodology with
reference to an AA corporate bond spot curve and having regard to the duration of the Plans liabilities. The inflation rate is derived using a similar cash flow matched methodology as used for the discount rate but having regard to the
difference between yields on fixed interest and index linked United Kingdom government gilts. The rate of increase in compensation levels is no longer relevant since the Company closed the Plan to future service accrual with effect from
March31, 2010. A 025% change in the discount rate assumption would change the PBO by approximately $26 million and the net pension charge for 2013 by approximately $08 million. A 025% change in the level of price inflation assumption would
change the PBO by approximately $23 million and the net pension charge for 2013 by approximately $21 million. Following guidance issued by the United Kingdom government during 2010, and agreement from the Plan trustees, the Company changed the
inflation rate measure from the Retail Prices Index to the Consumers Prices Index resulting in a reduction in actuarial net losses on an accounting basis of approximately $47 million.  The current investment strategy of the Plan is to obtain an asset allocation of 65% debt securities and 35% equity securities
in order to achieve a more predictable return on assets. As at December31, 2012 and 2011, approximately 55% of the Plans assets were held in index-tracking funds with one investment management company. Approximately 25% of the
Plans assets were invested in United Kingdom government gilts. No more than 5% of the Plans assets were invested in any one individual companys investment funds.

The Company or one of its subsidiaries files income tax returns with the U.S. federal government, and
various state and foreign jurisdictions. As at December31, 2012, the Companys German subsidiaries were subject to tax audits in Germany and the Companys United Kingdom subsidiaries were subject to tax audits in the United Kingdom.
The Company does not currently anticipate that adjustments, if any, arising out of these tax audits would result in a material change to its financial position as at December31, 2012.  The Company and its U.S. subsidiaries remain open to federal income tax examination by the IRS for years 2009 onwards. The
Company and its U.S. subsidiaries received notification in January 2013, of a federal income tax examination by the IRS for 2009. The Company does not currently anticipate that adjustments, if any, arising out of this tax audit would result in a

As a result of the Companys assessment of its net
deferred tax assets at December31, 2012, the Company considers it more likely than not that no valuation allowance is required for $03 million 2011 $08 million of its net operating loss carry forwards and that no valuation allowance
is required against its foreign tax credit carry forwards 2011 $75 million. 
84 Table of Contents NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTSContinued 
The net operating loss carry forwards arose in the U.S. in the current period and prior periods as a
result of trading and state tax losses. It is expected that sufficient taxable profits will be generated against which these net operating loss carry forwards can be relieved prior to their expiration in 2021. The foreign tax credit carry forwards
arose in the U.S. in prior periods. The Company has determined that future foreign income inclusions will be sufficient to utilize all of the $55 million 2011 $121 million of the foreign tax credit carry forwards prior to their expiration
in 2017 and 2021 and therefore no valuation allowance is required. 
Should it be determined in the future that it is no longer more likely than not that these assets will be realized, a valuation allowance would be
required, and the Companys operating results would be adversely affected during the period in which such a determination would be made. 
During 2012 a dividend of $1100 million was remitted from the Companys overseas subsidiaries to the U.S. The dividend was remitted to provide
funding for the Companys acquisition program. The Company is in a position to control whether or not to repatriate foreign earnings and we intend to permanently reinvest earnings overseas to fund overseas subsidiaries. No taxes have been
provided for the unremitted earnings of our overseas subsidiaries as any tax basis differences relating to investments in these overseas subsidiaries are considered to be permanent in duration. The amount of unremitted earnings at December31,
2012 and 2011 was approximately $717 million and $665 million, respectively. If these earnings are remitted, additional taxes could result after offsetting foreign income taxes paid although the calculation of the additional taxes is not practical
at this time.

On December14, 2011, we entered into a five-year
revolving credit facility which provides for borrowings by us of up to $1000 million. The facility carries an interest rate based on U.S. LIBOR plus a margin of between 150% and 225% which is dependent on the Companys ratio of net debt to
EBITDA. EBITDA is a non-GAAP measure of liquidity defined in the credit facility. The facility can be drawn down until it expires on December14, 2016. We repaid the previous finance facility, which was due to expire on February6, 2012,
upon entering into the new credit facility. 
85 Table of Contents NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTSContinued 
The Companys credit facility contains restrictive clauses which may constrain our activities and
limit our operational and financial flexibility. The facility obliges the lenders to comply with a request for utilization of finance unless there is an event of default outstanding. Events of default are defined in the credit facility and include a
material adverse change to our assets, operations or financial condition. The facility contains a number of restrictions that limit our ability, amongst other things, and subject to certain limited exceptions, to incur additional indebtedness,
pledge our assets as security, guarantee obligations of third parties, make investments, undergo a merger or consolidation, dispose of assets, or materially change our line of business.  In addition, the credit facility contains terms which, if breached, would result in it becoming repayable on demand. It
requires, among other matters, compliance with the following financial covenant ratios measured on a quarterly basis: 1the ratio of net debt to EBITDA shall not be greater than 25:1 and 2the ratio of EBITDA to net interest shall not
be less than 40:1. Management has determined that the Company has not breached these covenants throughout the period to December31, 2012 and expects to not breach these covenants for the next 12 months. The credit facility is secured by a
number of fixed and floating charges over certain assets which include key operating sites of the Company and its subsidiaries. 
On September13, 2011, the Company settled the NewMarket Corporation civil complaint. The settlement agreement included the Company issuing a $150
million promissory note to NewMarket Corporation payable in three equal annual installments carrying simple interest at 1%per annum, the first installment of which was paid on September7, 2012. 
The weighted average rate of interest on borrowings was 16% at
December31, 2012 and 34% at December31, 2011. Payments of interest on long-term debt were $05 million, $18 million and $20 million in 2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively.  The net cash outflows in respect of refinancing costs were $00 million, $17 million and $00 million in 2012, 2011 and 2010,
respectively. 
Note 12.Plant Closure Provisions 
The principal site giving rise to environmental
remediation liabilities is the Octane Additives manufacturing site at Ellesmere Port in the United Kingdom, which management believes is the last ongoing manufacturer of TEL. There are also environmental remediation liabilities on a much smaller
scale in respect of our other manufacturing sites in the U.S. and Europe. The liability for estimated closure costs of Innospecs Octane Additives manufacturing facilities includes costs for decontamination and environmental remediation
activities remediation when demand for TEL diminishes. Severance provisions have been made in relation to Corporate personnel and personnel in each of the three reporting segments.

Amounts due within one year refer to provisions where
expenditure is expected to arise within one year of the balance sheet date. Severance charges are recognized in the income statement as restructuring costs along with other restructuring costs. Remediation costs are recognized in cost of goods sold.
Severance 
A charge of $02 million was recognized in respect of a reduction in EMEA
headcount.  Other restructuring 
A residual accrual of $01 million, in respect of the relocation of a U.S.
sales and administration facility, was released in 2011. 
87 Table of Contents NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTSContinued 
Remediation 
The remediation provision represents the Companys liability for
environmental liabilities and asset retirement obligations. The accretion expense recognized in 2012 was $25 million. The remediation charge also included a further $15 million primarily in respect of changes in the expected cost and scope of
future remediation activities.  We recognize environmental
liabilities when they are probable and costs can be reasonably estimated, and asset retirement obligations when there is a legal obligation and costs can be reasonably estimated. The Company has to anticipate the program of work required and the
associated future expected costs, and comply with environmental legislation in the countries in which it operates or has operated in. The Company views the costs of vacating our Ellesmere Port site as contingent upon if and when it vacates the site
because there is no present intention to do so. The Company has further determined that, due to the uncertain product life of TEL particularly in the market for aviation gasoline and other products being manufactured on the site, there are
uncertainties as to the probability and timing of the expected costs. Such uncertainties have been considered in estimating the provision. 
Remediation expenditure against provisions was $21 million, $31 million and $27 million in 2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively.

In the third quarter of 2012, the Company recognized a $01 million profit following the disposal of

in Elmwood Park, New Jersey. 
Note 15.Fair Value Measurements 
Fair value is the price that would be received to sell an
asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date exit price. The Company utilizes a mid-market pricing convention for valuing the majority of its assets and liabilities measured
and reported at fair value. The Company utilizes market data or assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability, including assumptions about risk and the risks inherent in the inputs to the valuation technique. These
inputs can be readily observable, market corroborated or generally unobservable. The Company primarily applies the market approach for recurring fair value measurements and endeavors to utilize the best available information. Accordingly, the
Company utilizes valuation techniques that maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs. The Company is able to classify fair value balances based on the observability of those inputs. The Company gives the
highest priority to unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities Level 1 measurement and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs Level 3 measurement. Financial assets and liabilities are classified in their
entirety based on the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement. The Companys assessment of the significance of a particular input to the fair value measurement requires judgment and may affect the valuation of
fair value assets and liabilities and their placement within the fair value hierarchy Levels. In 2012, the Company evaluated the fair value hierarchy levels assigned to its assets and liabilities, and concluded that there should be no transfers into
or out of Levels 1, 2 and 3.

the fair values of financial instruments:  Cash and cash
equivalents, and short-term investments: The carrying amount approximates fair value because of the short-term maturities of such instruments. 
Long-term debt: Long-term debt comprises the revolving credit facility and the promissory note, which were entered into in December 2011 and
September 2011, respectively. The carrying amount of long-term debt approximates fair value.  Acquisition-related contingent consideration: Deferred consideration payable in cash is discounted to its fair value. Where deferred consideration is contingent upon pre-determined financial
targets, an estimate of the fair value of the likely consideration payable is made. 
90 Table of Contents NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTSContinued 
Derivatives: The fair value of derivatives relating to interest rate swaps, foreign currency
forward exchange contracts and commodity swaps are derived from current settlement prices and comparable contracts using current assumptions. 
The cumulative gains and losses on the interest rate swaps and commodity swaps are summarized as follows:  in millions
2012 2011 Balance at January1 01 12 Change in fair value 00 11 
Balance at December31 01 01 
On June12, 2009, the Company entered into $500
million of interest rate swaps which were amortized and matured between February 2010 and February 2012 in line with the long-term debt maturity profile of our previous finance facility. We repaid the previous finance facility upon entering into the
new credit facility in December 2011, at which point the remaining interest rate swaps were rendered ineffective and the associated fair value loss of $01 million recognized in earnings. The interest rate swaps qualified for hedge accounting until
this point.  The commodity swaps are used to manage the
Companys cash flow exposure to raw material cost volatility. They were designated as cash flow hedges and qualified for hedge accounting throughout the year ended December31, 2011. At March31, 2012, the commodity hedges were
determined to be ineffective and consequently a gain of $01 million was recognized in earnings. The commodity hedges will likely remain ineffective for the remainder of their term and accordingly all subsequent changes in their fair value are being
recognized in earnings. At December31, 2011, the commodity hedges were determined to be effective and consequently an unrealized gain of $02 million was recorded in other comprehensive income. 
Foreign currency forward exchange contracts primarily relate to contracts
entered into to hedge future known transactions or hedge balance sheet net cash positions. The movements in the carrying amounts and fair values of these contracts are largely due to changes in exchange rates against the U.S. dollar. 
Note 16.Derivative Instruments and Risk Management 
The Company has limited involvement with derivative
instruments and does not trade them. The Company does use derivatives to manage certain interest rate, foreign currency exchange rate and raw material cost exposures. 
As at December31, 2012 and 2011 the Company had no interest rate
instruments designated as effective hedges. The interest rate swaps which expired on February6, 2012 were ineffective at December31, 2011 because the Companys previous finance facility, which carried the corresponding floating rate
debt obligations, had been repaid. Accordingly, a loss of $01 million was recognized in earnings in 2011.

Food Program OFFP, the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act FCPA, the U.S. Cuban Assets Control Regulations CACR and United Kingdom anti-bribery laws. The settlement consists of fines, penalties and
disgorgements which are payable over a period of four years commencing 2010. As at December31, 2012, the expected schedule of payments was as follows:  in millions

For accounting purposes only, we are required under GAAP, in accordance with our accounting policy, to

Settlement of NewMarket Corporation civil complaint  As we have previously disclosed, the Company and its subsidiaries, Alcor Chemie Vertriebs GmbH and Innospec Limited, were the subject of two civil actions brought by NewMarket Corporation and its
subsidiary, Afton Chemical Corporation collectively, NewMarket. NewMarket and the Company agreed to settle these actions pursuant to the terms of a settlement agreement between them signed on September13, 2011 which provided for
mutual releases of the parties and dismissal of the actions with prejudice. Under the settlement agreement, the Company will pay NewMarket an aggregate amount of approximately $450 million, payable in a combination of cash, a promissory note and
stock, of which $250 million was paid in cash in September 2011, $150 million is payable in three equal annual installments under the promissory note carrying simple interest at 1%per annum the first installment of which was paid on
September7, 2012, and approximately $50 million was paid in the form of 195,313 shares of the Companys common stock transferred to NewMarket in September 2011. 
Other legal matters 
While we are involved from time to time in claims and legal proceedings that
result from, and are incidental to, the conduct of our business including business and commercial litigation, employee and product liability claims, there are no other material pending legal proceedings to which the Company or any of its
subsidiaries is a party, or of which any of their property is subject. It is possible however, that an adverse resolution of an unexpectedly large number of such individual items could in the aggregate have a material adverse effect on results of
operations for a particular year or quarter.  Guarantees
The Company and certain of the Companys
consolidated subsidiaries are contingently liable for certain obligations of affiliated companies primarily in the form of guarantees of debt and performance under contracts entered into as a normal business practice. This includes guarantees of
non-U.S. excise taxes and customs duties. As at December31, 2012, such contingent liabilities which are not recognized as liabilities in the consolidated financial statements amounted to $77 million. 
Under the terms of the guarantee arrangements, generally the Company would be
required to perform should the affiliated company fail to fulfill its obligations under the arrangements. In some cases, the guarantee arrangements have recourse provisions that would enable the Company to recover any payments made under the terms
of the guarantees from securities held of the guaranteed parties assets. 
94 Table of Contents NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTSContinued 
The Company and its affiliates have numerous long-term sales and purchase commitments in their various
business activities, which are expected to be fulfilled with no adverse consequences material to the Company.

Note 19.Share Based Compensation Plans 
Stock option plans
The Company has five active stock option plans, two of which
provide for the grant of stock options to employees, one provides for the grant of stock options to non-employee directors, and another provides for the grant of stock options to key executives on a matching basis provided they use a proportion of
their annual bonus to purchase common stock in the Company on the open market or from the Company. The fifth plan is a savings plan which provides for the grant of stock options to all Company employees provided they commit to make regular savings
over a pre-defined period which can then be used to purchase common stock upon vesting of the options. The stock options have vesting periods ranging from 24months to 6 years and in all cases stock options granted expire within 10 years of the
date of grant. All grants are at the sole discretion of the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors. Grants may be priced at market value or at a premium or discount. The aggregate number of shares of common stock reserved for issuance
which can be granted under the plans is 2,640,000.

SEUs from time to time as a long-term performance incentive. SEUs have vesting periods ranging from 11 months to 4 years and in all cases SEUs granted expire within 10 years of the date of grant. Grants may be priced at market value or
at a premium or discount. There is no limit to the number of SEUs that can be granted. The liability for SEUs is located in the current portion of accrued liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets until they are cash settled. 
SEUs can have certain performance related measures dependent upon external
factors such as the Companys stock price. In such cases the fair value of SEUs is calculated using the Monte Carlo model. The following assumptions were used in the Monte Carlo model: 2012 2011 2010 Dividend yield 00 00 05 Volatility 438 642 789 Risk free interest rate 036 036 105  97 Table of Contents NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTSContinued

life of the award subject to a revaluation to fair value each quarter. The revaluation may result in a charge or a credit to the income statement in the quarter dependent upon our share price and other performance criteria. The weighted-average
remaining vesting period of non-vested SEUs is 085 years.  The
total intrinsic value of SEUs exercised in 2012, 2011 and 2010 was $13 million, $04million and $04 million, respectively. The amount of cash received from the exercise of SEU awards in 2012, 2011 and 2010 was $04 million, $00 million and

December 2012. The amount of bonus earned was a set cash amount for each one percentage point of out-performance. The maximum bonus under this plan was payable for an out-performance versus the Russell 2000 Index of 30%. The maximum bonus under this
plan, in respect of the current participants, was $8 million 2011 $8 million, 2010 $8 million. No bonus was payable under this plan if the Innospec stock price had not out-performed the Russell 2000 Index by more than 10% over the
five year period, or the Russell 2000 Index had fallen in value over the same period.The fair value of these liability cash-settled stock appreciation rights was calculated on a quarterly basis using a Monte Carlo model and summarized as

Note 20.Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements 
In July 2012, the FASB issued ASU 2012-02, Intangibles
Goodwill and Other Topic 350: Testing Indefinite-Lived Intangible Assets for Impairment. ASU 2012-02 simplifies how entities test indefinite-lived intangible assets, other than goodwill, for impairment and permits an entity to first
assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the indefinite-lived intangible asset is impaired. The amendments are effective for annual and interim indefinite-lived intangible asset impairment tests performed for
fiscal years beginning after September15, 2012 early adoption is permitted. The implementation of the amended accounting guidance is not expected to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. 
In December 2011, the FASB issued ASU 2011-11, Balance Sheet Topic 210: Disclosures about
Offsetting Assets and Liabilities. The objective ofASU 2011-11is to facilitate convergence of U.S.GAAP and International Financial Reporting Standards and improve the comparability of statements of financial position. Entities
are required to disclose both gross information and net information about both instruments and transactions eligible for offset in 
99 Table of Contents NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTSContinued 
the statement of financial position and instruments and transactions subject to an agreement similar to a master netting arrangement. This scope would include derivatives, sale and repurchase
agreements, and securities borrowing and securities lending arrangements. This guidance is effective for annual reporting periods beginning on or after January1, 2013, and interim periods within those annual periods. Entities should provide
the disclosures required by these amendments retrospectively for all comparative periods presented. The Company is currently evaluating the potential impact that the adoption of this statement will have on its consolidated financial statements.

Managements Report on Internal Control Over Financial
Reporting  The Companys management is responsible for
establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting.The Companys internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting
and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. 
Due to its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. In addition, projections of any
evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. 
The Companys management assessed the effectiveness of the
Companys internal control over financial reporting as of December31, 2012. In making this assessment, management used the criteria in Internal Control Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations
of the Treadway Commission COSO.  The Company
acquired Strata Control Services, Inc. on December24, 2012. Management excluded from its assessment of the effectiveness of the Companys internal control over financial reporting as of December31, 2012, Stratas internal
control over financial reporting associated with total assets of $594 million representing 10% of the Companys total assets as of December 31, 2012. 
Based on the evaluation the Company concluded that the Company maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of December31,
2012, based on criteria in the Internal Control Integrated Framework issued by the COSO.
