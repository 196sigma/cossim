These financial statements are the responsibility of the Companys management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audits.We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board United States. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Evolution Petroleum Corporation and subsidiaries as of June30, 2014 and 2013, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended June30, 2014, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board United States, Evolution Petroleum Corporation and subsidiaries internal control over financial reporting as of June30, 2014, based on criteria established in Internal Control-Integrated Frameworkissued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission in 1992, and our report dated September12, 2014expressed an unqualified opinion on the effectiveness of Evolution Petroleum Corporations internal control over financial reporting.Hein AssociatesLLPHouston, TexasSeptember12, 201434Table of ContentsREPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRMTo the Board of Directors and StockholdersEvolution Petroleum CorporationWe have audited Evolution Petroleum Corporations internal control over financial reporting as of June30, 2014, based on criteria established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission in 1992. Evolution Petroleum Corporations management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying Managements Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Companys internal control over financial reporting based on our audit.We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board United States. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audit also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.A companys internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A companys internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that apertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; bprovide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and cprovide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the companys assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.In our opinion, Evolution Petroleum Corporation maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of June30, 2014, based on criteria established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission in 1992.We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board United States, the consolidated balance sheets of Evolution Petroleum Corporation and subsidiaries as of June30, 2014 and 2013, and the related consolidated statements of operations, changes in stockholders equity, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended June30, 2014, and our report dated September12, 2014, expressed an unqualified opinion.Hein AssociatesLLPHouston, TexasSeptember12, 201435Table of ContentsEvolution Petroleum Corporation and SubsidiariesConsolidated Balance SheetsJune 30, 2014June 30, 2013AssetsCurrent assetsCash and cash  of deposit250,000ReceivablesOil and natural gas sales1,456,1461,632,853Joint interest partner49,063Income  tax asset159,62426,133Prepaid expenses and other current assets747,453266,554Total current  and equipment, net of depreciation, depletion, and amortizationOil and natural gas propertiesfull-cost method of accounting, of which $4,112,704 was excluded from amortization at June 30, 201337,822,07038,789,032Other property and equipment424,82752,217Total property and  to joint interest operating partner26,059Other assets464,052252,912Total  and Stockholders' EquityCurrent liabilitiesAccounts payable$441,722$769,099State and federal taxes payable233,548Accrued liabilities and other2,558,0041,630,103Total current  term liabilitiesDeferred income taxes9,897,2728,418,969Asset retirement  rent35,72052,865Total  and contingencies Note15Stockholders' equityPreferred stock, par value $0001;

We are engaged primarily in the development of incremental oil and gas reserves within known oil and gas resources for our shareholders and customers utilizing conventional and proprietary technology.Principles of Consolidation and Reporting.Our consolidated financial statements include the accounts of EPM and its wholly-owned subsidiaries. All significant intercompany transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. The consolidated financial statements for the previous year include certain reclassifications that were made to conform to the current presentation. Such reclassifications have no impact on previously reported income or stockholders' equity.Use of Estimates.The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America GAAP requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the dates of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods. Significant estimates include reserve quantities and estimated future cash flows associated with proved reserves, which significantly impact depletion expense and potential impairments of oil and natural gas properties, income taxes and the valuation of deferred tax assets, stock-based compensation and commitments and contingencies. We analyze our estimates based on historical experience and various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable. While we believe that our estimates and assumptions used in preparation of the consolidated financial statements are appropriate, actual results could differ from those estimates.Note2Summary of Significant Accounting PoliciesCash and Cash Equivalents.We consider all highly liquid investments, with original maturities of 90days or less when purchased, to be cash and cash equivalents.Account Receivable and Allowance for Doubtful Accounts.Accounts receivable consist of uncollateralized joint interest owner obligations due within 30 days of the invoice date, uncollateralized accrued revenues due under normal trade terms, generally requiring payment within 30 days of production, and other miscellaneous receivables. No interest is charged on past-due balances. Payments made on accounts receivable are applied to the earliest unpaid items. We establish provisions for losses on accounts receivables if it is determined that collection of all or a part of an outstanding balance is not probable. Collectibility is reviewed regularly and an allowance is established or adjusted, as necessary, using the specific identification method. As of June 30,2014and 2013, no allowance for doubtful accounts was considered necessary.Oil and Natural Gas Properties.We use the full cost method of accounting for our investments in oil and natural gas properties. Under this method of accounting, all costs incurred in the acquisition, exploration and development of oil and natural gas properties, including unproductive wells, are capitalized. This includes any internal costs that are directly related to property acquisition, exploration and development activities but does not include any costs related to production, general corporate overhead or similar activities. Gain or loss on the sale or other disposition of oil and natural gas properties is not recognized, unless the gain or loss would significantly alter the relationship between capitalized costs and proved reserves.Oil and natural gas properties include costs that are excluded from costs being depleted or amortized. Excluded costs represent investments in unproved and unevaluated properties and include non-producing leasehold, geological and geophysical costs associated with leasehold or drilling interests and exploration drilling costs. We exclude these costs until the project is evaluated and proved reserves are established or impairment is determined. Excluded costs are reviewed at least quarterly to determine if impairment has occurred. The amount of any evaluated or impaired oil and natural gas properties is transferred to capitalized costs being amortized.Limitation on Capitalized Costs.Under the full-cost method of accounting, we are required, at the end of each fiscal quarter, to perform a test to determine the limit on the book value of our oil and natural gas properties the Ceiling Test. If the capitalized costs of our oil and natural gas properties, net of accumulated amortization and related deferred income taxes , exceed the Ceiling, this excess or impairment is charged to expense and reflected as additional accumulated depreciation, depletion and amortization or as a credit to oil and natural gas properties. The expense may not be reversed in future periods, even though higher oil and natural gas prices may subsequently increase the Ceiling. The Ceiling is defined as the sum of: athe present value, discounted at 10 percent, and assuming continuation of existing economic conditions, of 1estimated future gross revenues from proved reserves, which is computed using oil and natural gas prices determined as the unweighted 40Table of ContentsEVOLUTION PETROLEUM CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIESNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Continuedarithmetic average of the first-day-of-the-month price for each month within the 12-month period prior to the end of the reporting period with consideration of price changes only to the extent provided by contractual arrangements including hedging arrangements pursuant to SAB103, less 2estimated future expenditures based on current costs to be incurred in developing and producing the proved reserves; plus bthe cost of properties not being amortized pursuant to Reg. S-X Rule4-10 c3ii; plus cthe lower of cost or estimated fair value of unproven properties included in the costs being amortized; net of dthe related tax effects related to the difference between the book and tax basis of our oil and natural gas properties. Our Ceiling Test did not result in an impairment of our oil and natural gas properties during the years ended June30, 2014, 2013or 2012.Other Property and Equipment.Other property and equipment includes leasehold improvements, data processing and telecommunications equipment, office furniture and equipment, and oilfield service equipment related to our artificial lift technology operations. These items are recorded at cost and depreciated over expected lives of the individual assets or group of assets, which range from threeto seven years. The assets are depreciated using the straight-line method, except for oilfield service equipment related to our artificial lift technology operations, which is depreciated using a method which approximates the timing and amounts of expected revenues from the contract. Repairs and maintenance costs are expensed in the period incurred.Deferred Costs.  The Company capitalizes costs incurred in connection with obtaining financing. These costs are included in other assets on the Company Consolidated Balance Sheet and are amortized over the term of the related financing using the straight-line method, which approximates the effective interest method.Asset Retirement Obligations.An asset retirement obligation associated with the retirement of a tangible long-lived asset is recognized as a liability in the period incurred, with an associated increase in the carrying amount of the related long-lived asset, our oil and natural gas properties. The cost of the tangible asset, including the asset retirement cost, is depleted over the useful life of the asset. The initial recognition or subsequent revision of asset retirement cost is considered a level3 fair value measurement. The asset retirement obligation is recorded at its estimated fair value, measured by reference to the expected future cash outflows required to satisfy the retirement obligation discounted at our credit-adjusted risk-free interest rate. Accretion expense is recognized over time as the discounted liability is accreted to its expected settlement value. If the estimated future cost of the asset retirement obligation changes, an adjustment is recorded to both the asset retirement obligation and the long-lived asset. Revisions to estimated asset retirement obligations can result from changes in retirement cost estimates, revisions to estimated inflation rates and changes in the estimated timing of abandonment.Fair Value of Financial Instruments.Our financial instruments consist of cash and cash equivalents, certificates of deposit, accounts receivable, and accounts payable. The carrying amounts of these approximate fair value due to the highly liquid nature of these short-term instruments.Stock-based Compensation.We record all share-based payment expense in our financial statements based on the estimated fair value of the award on the grant date. We use the Black-Scholes option-pricing model as the most appropriate fair-value method for our stock option awards. Restricted stock awards are valued using the market price of our common stock on the grant date. We record compensation cost, net of estimated forfeitures, for stock-based compensation awards over the requisite service period on a straight-line basis as the awards vest. As each award vests, an adjustment is made to compensation cost for any difference between the estimated forfeitures and the actual forfeitures related to the vested awards.Revenue Recognition - Oil and Gas.We recognize oil and natural gas revenue from our interests in producing wells at the time that title passes to the purchaser. As a result, we accrue revenues related to production sold for which we have not received payment.Revenue Recognition - Artificial Lift Technology.Our artificial lift technology operations may generate revenues under several forms of operational or contractual arrangements. We have utilized the technology on wells that we develop and operate and on certain wells that we operate under farm-outs from other operators. In these cases, our revenues take the form of net sales of oil and gas production. We have also provided the technology to third parties under contractual arrangements that generate fees for the technology which are based on the net profits from oil and gas production. Under these contracts, we may be required to bear part or all of the incremental installation and capital costs for the technology. In other cases, we may be compensated for our technology through a fixed or variable fee per well, which does not require us to bear any net costs of installation or other capital costs. In the future, we may enter into licensing contracts which allow for the sale and installation of the technology by third parties to their customers or we may license the technology to larger organizations for use in specified geographic areas or on other broad terms. In all cases, we evaluate the substance of the contractual arrangement and recognize revenues over the life of the contract as the earnings process is determined to be complete. We likewise charge our 41Table of ContentsEVOLUTION PETROLEUM CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIESNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Continuedcosts, including both capital expenditures and operating expenses, to operating costs in a manner which either matches these costs to the timing of expected revenues, where appropriate, or charges these costs to the accounting period in which they were incurred where it is not appropriate to capitalize or defer them to match with revenues.Depreciation, Depletion and Amortization.The depreciable base for oil and natural gas properties includes the sum of all capitalized costs net of DDA, estimated future development costs and asset retirement costs not included in oil and natural gas properties, less costs excluded from amortization. The depreciable base of oil and natural gas properties is amortized using the unit-of-production method over total proved reserves. Other property including, leasehold improvements, office and computer equipment and vehicles which are stated at original cost and depreciated using the straight-line method over the useful lives of the assets, which range from three to seven years.Intangible Assets - Intellectual Property.The Company capitalizes the external costs, consisting primarily of legal costs, related to securing its patents, trademarks and other intellectual property. The costs of research, testing and development have been expensed as incurred. As of June 30, 2014, the cumulative costs capitalized in connection with our intellectual property was $346,520. The costs related to patents are amortized over the remaining life of the patent, whereas trademarks are perpetual and are not amortized. The remaining unamortized costs related to intellectual property as of June 30, 2014 was $319,470.Income Taxes.We recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities based on the differences between the tax basis of assets and liabilities and their reported amounts in the financial statements that may result in taxable or deductible amounts in future years. The measurement of deferred tax assets may be reduced by a valuation allowance based upon management assessment of available evidence if it is deemed more likely than not some or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realizable. We recognize a tax benefit from an uncertain position when it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained upon examination, based on the technical merits of the position and will record the largest amount of tax benefit that is greater than 50% likely of being realized upon settlement with a taxing authority. The Company classifies any interest and penalties associated with income taxes as income tax expense.Earnings loss per share.Basic earnings loss per share EPS is computed by dividing earnings or loss by the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding less any non-vested restricted common stock outstanding. The computation of diluted EPS is similar to the computation of basic EPS, except that the denominator is increased to include the number of additional common shares that would have been outstanding if potential dilutive common shares had been issued. Our potential dilutive common shares are our outstanding stock options, warrants, and non-vested restricted common stock. The dilutive effect of our potential dilutive common shares is reflected in diluted EPS by application of the treasury stock method. Under the treasury stock method, exercise of stock options and warrants shall be assumed at the beginning of the period or at time of issuance, if later and common shares shall be assumed to be issued; the proceeds from exercise shall be assumed to be used to purchase common stock at the average market price during the period; and the incremental shares the difference between the number of shares assumed issued and the number of shares assumed purchased shall be included in the denominator of the diluted EPS computation. Potential dilutive common shares are excluded from the computation if their effect is anti-dilutive. Including potential dilutive common shares in the denominator of a diluted EPS computation for continuing operations always will result in an anti-dilutive per-share amount when an entity has a loss from continuing operations and nopotential dilutive common shares shall be included in the computation of diluted EPS when a loss from continuing operations exists.Note3Recent Accounting PronouncementsNew Accounting Standards.We disclose the existence and potential effect of accounting standards issued but not yet adopted by us or recently adopted by us with respect to accounting standards that may have an impact on us in the future.In July2013, the Financial Accounting Standards Board FASB issued Accounting Standard Update ASU No2013-11,Income Taxes Topic 740: Presentation of an Unrecognized Tax Benefit When a Net Operating Loss Carryforward, a Similar Tax Loss, or a Tax Credit Carryforward Exists.This ASU applies to all entities that have unrecognized tax benefits when a net operating loss carryforward, a similar tax loss, or a tax credit carryforward exists at the reporting date. U.S. GAAP does not include explicit guidance on the financial statement presentation of an unrecognized tax benefit when a net operating loss carryforward, a similar tax loss, or a tax credit carryforward exists. The amendments in this ASU state that an unrecognized tax benefit, or a portion of an unrecognized tax benefit, should be presented in the financial statements as a reduction to a deferred tax asset for a net operating loss carryforward, a similar tax loss, or a tax credit carryforward, except as follows. To the extent a net operating loss carryforward, a similar tax loss, or a tax credit carryforward is not available at the reporting date under the tax law of the applicable jurisdiction to settle any additional income taxes that would result from the 42Table of ContentsEVOLUTION PETROLEUM CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIESNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Continueddisallowance of a tax position or the tax law of the applicable jurisdiction does not require the entity to use, and the entity does not intend to use, the deferred tax asset for such purpose, the unrecognized tax benefit should be presented in the financial statements as a liability and should not be combined with deferred tax assets. The amendments in this ASU are effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those years, beginning after December15, 2013. Company adopted this guidance on July 1, 2014, and does not expect that its adoption will have a material impact on our financial position, cash flows, or results of operations.In May 2014, the FASB issued ASU No2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers: Topic 606to provide guidance on revenue recognition on contracts with customers to transfer goods or services or on contracts for the transfer of nonfinancial assets. ASU 2014-09 requires that revenue recognition on contracts with customers depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. ASU 2014-09 will be effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those years, beginning after December15, 2016. The Company does not believe its future adoption of this guidance will have a material effect on its financial position, cash flows, or results of operations.Note4Property and EquipmentAs of June30, 2014and June30, 2013, our oil and natural gas properties and other property and equipment consisted of the following:June30, 2014June30, 2013Oil and natural gas propertiesProperty costs subject to  Accumulated depreciation, depletion, and  properties not subject to amortization4,112,704Oil and natural gas properties, net37,822,07038,789,032Other property and equipmentFurniture, fixtures and office equipment, at cost343,178322,514Artificial lift technology equipment, at cost377,943Less: Accumulated  property and equipment, net$424,827$52,217As of June30, 2014, all oil and gas property costs incurred by the Company were being amortized. At June30, 2013, $41 millionof our unproved properties were not subject to amortization and consisted of unevaluated acreage in the Mississippi Lime project in Oklahoma. Our evaluation of impairment of unproved properties occurs, at a minimum, on a quarterly basis. During the year ended June30, 2014, we transferred $45 millionof Mississippi Lime property cost to the full cost pool as initial quantities of hydrocarbon production were indicative of impairment. In early November 2012, the Company sold its Wood well in the Giddings Field to EnerVestLLC and received net proceeds of $250,000and the buyer assumption of all abandonment liabilities.On December24, 2012, the Company closed the sale of a portion of its producing and non-producing properties and assets in Brazos, Burleson, Fayette, Lee and Grimes Counties, Texas to ASM Oil and Gas Company,Inc. ASM for an adjusted purchase price of $2,804,976and the buyer assumption of all abandonment liabilities.On May1, 2013, the Company informed Orion Exploration Partners,LLC that it had elected to forego payment of the $1,209,197remaining balance of its original purchase cost of leasehold in the Mississippi Lime formation in Kay County in Oklahoma. Accordingly, our joint venture interest in initial undrilled leasehold was reduced from 45%to 339%under the terms of the Agreement. On June14, 2013, the Company closed a second sale to ASM for producing and non-producing properties and assets in Brazos, Burleson, and Fayette Counties, Texas and received net proceeds of $425,000and the buyer assumption of all abandonment liabilities43Table of ContentsEVOLUTION PETROLEUM CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIESNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS ContinuedOn December 1, 2013, we sold our producing assets and undeveloped reserves in the Lopez Field in South Texas in return for proceeds of $402,500and the buyer assumption of all abandonment liabilities.The net proceeds from these sales, including the reduction of asset retirement obligations, were recognized as a reduction of the cost of oil and gas properties.During the quarter ended June 30, 2014, we incurred $377,943of costs related to the installation of our artificial lift technology on three wells for a third-party customer. Under the contract for these installations, we fund the majority of the incremental equipment and installation costs and will receive 25% of the net profits from production, as defined, for as long as the technology remains in the wells. We did not receive any revenues prior to June 30, 2014. We intend to depreciate or amortize the installation costs using a method and a life which approximates our expected net revenues from the wells.Note 5 RestructuringOn November1, 2013, we undertook an initiative to refocus our business to GARP development that resulted in adjustment of our workforce towards less emphasis on engineering and greater emphasis on sales and marketing. In exchange for severance and non-compete agreements with the terminated employees, we recorded a restructuring charge of approximately $1,332,186representing $376,365of stock-based compensation from the accelerated vesting of equity awards and $955,821of severance compensation and benefits to be paid during the twelve months ended December31, 2014.

During the year ended June30, 2014, as the result of a common stock dividend policy approved in November 2013 by the Board of Directors, we paid three quarterly cash dividends to our common shareholders, totaling $9,723,833, from retained earnings. The cash dividends were paid at a quarterly rate of $010per common share. The large tax deductions related to the fiscal 2014 exercises of stock options and warrants result in a deficit in our current year earnings and profits, as defined for tax purposes, and accordingly, the cash dividends on common shares paid in fiscal 2014 will be treated for tax purposes as a return of capital and not as dividend income to the shareholders.Since the tax benefits related to stock-based compensation created by fiscal year 2014 exercises of warrants and NQSOs result in a deficit in current year earnings and profits, as defined for tax purposes, all cash dividends on common shares paid in fiscal 2014 will be treated for tax purposes as a return of capital and not as dividend income to the shareholders.Recovery of Stockholder Short Swing ProfitIn September2013, an executive officer of the Company paid $6,850to the Company, representing the disgorgement of short swing profits under Section16bunder the Exchange Act.

Optional redemption can be made by us at any time after July1, 2014 for the stated liquidation value of $2500per share plus accrued dividends. With respect to dividend rights and rights upon our liquidation, winding-up or dissolution, the SeriesA Preferred Stock ranks senior to our common shareholders, but subordinate to any of our existing and future debt. Dividends on the SeriesA Cumulative Preferred Stock accrue and accumulate at a fixed rate of 85%per annum on the $2500per share liquidation preference, payable monthly at $0177083per share, as, if and when declared by our Board of Directors.We paid dividends of $674,302, $674,302, and $630,391to holders of our SeriesA Preferred Stock during the years ended June30, 2014, 2013and 2012, respectively.

We believe that we have appropriate support for the income tax positions taken and to be taken on the Company tax returns and that the accruals for tax liabilities are adequate for all open years based on our assessment of many factors including past experience and interpretations of tax law applied to the facts of each matter. The Company tax returns are open to audit under the statute of limitations for the years ending June30, 2010 through June30, 2013 for federal tax purposes and for the years ended June30, 2010 through June30, 2013 for state tax purposes.The components of our income tax provision benefit are as follows:June 30, 2014June 30, 2013June 30,  current income tax  deferred income tax  income tax  following table presents the reconciliation of our income taxes calculated at the statutory federal tax rate, currently 34%, to the income tax provision in our financial statements.

The Credit Agreement provides the Company with a revolving credit facility the facility in an amount up to $50,000,000with availability governed by an Initial Borrowing Base of $5,000,000. A portion of the facility not in excess of $1,000,000is available for the issuance of letters of credit.The facility is unsecured and has a term of four years. The Company subsidiaries guarantee the Company obligations under the facility. The proceeds of any loans under the facility are to be used by the Company for the acquisition and development of oil and gas properties, as defined in the facility, the issuance of letters of credit, and for working capital and general corporate purposes.Semi-annually, the borrowing base and a monthly reduction amount are re-determined from reserve reports. Requests by the Company to increase the $5,000,000initial amount are subject to the Lender credit approval process, and are also limited to 25%of the value our oil and gas properties, as defined.At the Company option, borrowings under the facility bear interest at a rate of either ian Adjusted LIBORrate LIBOR rate divided by the remainder of 1less the Lender RegulationD reserve requirement, or iian adjusted Base Rate equal to the greater of the Lender prime rateor the sum of 050%plus theFederal Fund Rate. A maximum of threeLIBOR based loans can be outstanding at any time. Allowed loan interest periods are one, two, threeand six months. LIBOR interest is payable at the end of the interest period except for six-month loans for which accrued interest is payable at three monthsand at end of term. Base Rate interest is payable monthly. Letters of credit bear fees of 35%per annum rate applied to the principal amount and are due when transacted. The maximum term of letters of credit is one year.A commitment fee of 050%per annum accrues on unutilized availability and is payable quarterly. The Company is responsible for certain administrative expenses of the Lender over the life of the Credit Agreement as well as $50,000in loan costs incurred upon closing.The Credit Agreement also contains financial covenants including a requirement that the Company maintain a current ratio of not less than 15to 1; a ratio of total funded Indebtedness to EBITDA of not more than 25to 1, and a ratio of EBITDA to interest expense of not less than 3to 1. The agreement specifies certain customary covenants, including restrictions on the Company and its subsidiaries from pledging their assets, incurring defined Indebtedness outside of the facility other that permitted indebtedness, and it restricts certain asset sales. Payments of dividends for the SeriesA Preferred are only restricted by the EBITDA to interest coverage ratio, wherein such dividends are a 1X deduction from EBITDA as opposed to a 3:1requirement if dividends were treated as interest expense. The Credit Agreement contains customary events of default. If an event of default occurs and is continuing, the Lender may declare any amounts outstanding under the Credit Agreement to be immediately due and payable.As of June30, 2014and 2013, the Company had no borrowings and no outstanding letters of credit issued under the facility, resulting in an available borrowing base capacity of $5,000,000, and we are in compliance with all the covenants of the Credit Agreement. During the year the Lender waived the provisions of the Credit Agreement pertaining to the past payments of cash dividends on our common stock, and the Credit Agreement was amended to permit the payment of cash dividends on common stock in the future if no borrowings are outstanding at the time of such payment.In connection with this agreement the Company incurred $179,468of debt issuance costs, which have been capitalized in Other Assets and are being amortized on a straight-line basis over the term of the agreement. The unamortized balance in debt issuance costs related to the Credit Agreement was $81,047as of June 30, 2014. The Company is in discussions with the Lender to replace the unsecured Credit Agreement with an expanded secured facility. As of June 30, 2014, the Company had 51Table of ContentsEVOLUTION PETROLEUM CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIESNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Continuedincurred approximately $63,535in legal and title costs related to this proposed agreement, which are also capitalized in Other Assets. Note15Commitments and ContingenciesWe are subject to various claims and contingencies in the normal course of business. In addition, from time to time, we receive communications from government or regulatory agencies concerning investigations or allegations of noncompliance with laws or regulations in jurisdiction in which we operate. We disclose such matters if we believe it is reasonably possible that a future event or events will confirm a loss through impairment of an asset or the incurrence of a liability. We accrue a loss if we believe it is probable that a future event or events will confirm a loss and we can reasonably estimate such loss and we do not accrue future legal costs related to that loss. Furthermore, we will disclose any matter that is unasserted if we consider it probable that a claim will be asserted and there is a reasonable possibility that the outcome will be unfavorable. We expense legal defense costs as they are incurred.The Company and its wholly owned subsidiary are defendants in a lawsuit brought by John C. McCarthy et. al in the Fifth District Court of Richland Parish, Louisiana in July2011. The plaintiffs alleged, among other claims, that we fraudulently and wrongfully purchased plaintiffs income royalty rights in the Delhi Field Unit in the Holt-Bryant Reservoir in May2006. On March29, 2012, the Fifth District Court dismissed the case against the Company and our wholly owned subsidiary NGS Sub Corp. The Court found that plaintiffs had no cause of action under Louisiana law, assuming that the Plaintiffs claims were valid on their face. Plaintiffs filed an appeal and the Louisiana Second Circuit Court of Appeal affirmed the dismissal, but allowed the plaintiffs to amend their petition to state a different possible cause of action. The plaintiffs amended their claim and re-filed with the district court. The plaintiffs are seeking cancellation of the lease and monetary damages. We subsequently filed a second motion pleading no cause of action, with which the district court again agreed and dismissed the plaintiffs case on September23, 2013. Plaintiffs again filed an appeal in November2013.On October14, 2013, a settlement agreement was executed in the lawsuit filed by Frederick M. Garcia and Lydia Garcia, et. al andthe lawsuit was dismissed with prejudice on November5, 2013. As previously reported, on July26, 2012, we agreed to settle a lawsuit filed by Frederick M. Garcia and Lydia Garcia in December2010 in Duval County, Texas, in which the plaintiffs alleged failure to maintain the lease beyond its primary term due to no production. Although we believed that the claims were without merit, we chose to settle for $67,000in return for an extension of the primary term of the lease, an amount less than our expected cost to prevail in court through summary judgment.As previously reported, on August23, 2012, we and our wholly-owned subsidiary, NGS Sub Corp., and Robert S. Herlin, our President and Chief Executive Officer, were served with a lawsuit filed in federal court by James H. and Kristy S. Jones the Jones lawsuit in the Western District Court of the Monroe Division, Louisiana. The plaintiffs allege primarily that we defendants wrongfully purchased the plaintiffs 0048119overriding royalty interest in the Delhi Unit in January2006 by failing to divulge the existence of an alleged previous agreement to develop the Delhi Field for EOR. The plaintiffs are seeking rescission of the assignment of the overriding royalty interest and monetary damages. We believe that the claims are without merit and are not timely, and we are vigorously defending against the claims. We filed a motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim under Federal Ruleof Civil Procedure 12b6on April1, 2013. On September17, 2013, the federal court in the Western District Court of the Monroe Division, Louisiana, dismissed a portion of the claims and allowed the plaintiffs to pursue the remaining portion of the claims. Our motion to dismiss was for lack of cause of action, assuming that the plaintiffs claims were valid on their face. On September25, 2013, plaintiff Jones filed a motion to alter or amend the September17, 2013 judgment. On December27, 2013, the court denied said plaintiffs motion, and on January21, 2014, we filed a motion to reconsider the nondismissal of the remaining claims, which was denied. Counsel has advised us that, based on information developed to date, the risk of loss in this matter is remote.On December13, 2013, we and our wholly-owned subsidiaries, Tertiaire Resources Company and NGS Sub. Corp., filed a lawsuit in the 133rd Judicial District Court of Harris County, Texas, against Denbury Onshore, LLC Denbury alleging breaches of certain 2006 agreements between the parties regarding the Delhi Field in Richland Parish, Louisiana. The specific allegations include improperly charging the payout account for capital expenditures and costs of capital, failure to adhere to preferential rights to participate in acquisitions within the defined area of mutual interest, breach of the promises to assume environmental liabilities and fully indemnify us from such costs, and other breaches. We are seeking declaration of the validity of the 2006 agreements and recovery of damages and attorneys fees. Denbury subsequently filed counterclaims, including the assertion that we owed Denbury additional revenue interests pursuant to the 2006 agreements and that our transfer of our reversionary working interest from our wholly owned subsidiary to our parent corporation and subsequently to another wholly 52Table of ContentsEVOLUTION PETROLEUM CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIESNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Continuedowned subsidiary breached their preferential right to purchase. We have denied their counterclaims as being without merit and not timely. On December3, 2013, our wholly owned subsidiary, NGS Sub. Corp., was served with a lawsuit filed in the 8th Judicial District Court of Winn Parish, Louisiana by Cecil M. Brooks, a resident of Louisiana, alleging that a former subsidiary of NGS Sub. Corp. improperly disposed of water from an off-lease well into a well located on the plaintiffs land in Winn Parish in 2006. The plaintiff is requesting monetary damages and other relief. NGS Sub. Corp. disposed of the property in question along with its ownership of the subsidiary in 2008 to a third party.

Property acquisition costs are those costs incurred to lease property, including both undeveloped leasehold and the purchase of reserves in place. Exploration costs include costs of identifying areas that may warrant examination and examining specific areas that are considered to have prospects containing oil and natural gas reserves, including costs of drilling exploratory wells, geological and geophysical costs and carrying costs on undeveloped properties. Development costs are incurred to obtain access to proved reserves, including the cost of drilling. Exploration and development costs also include amounts incurred due to the recognition of asset retirement obligations, of $66,976, $65,575, and $93,522, during the years ended June30, 2014, 2013, and 2012, respectively.For the Years Ended June 30,201420132012Oil and natural gas activitiesProperty acquisition costs:Proved    costs18,56679,035238,463Total costs incurred for oil and natural gas  Net Quantities of Proved Oil and Natural Gas ReservesThe following estimates of the net proved oil and natural gas reserves of our oil and gas properties located entirely within the United States of America are based on evaluations prepared by third-party reservoir engineers. Reserve volumes and values were determined under the method prescribed by the SEC for our fiscal years ended June30, 2014, 2013, and 2012, which requires the application of the previous 12 monthsunweighted arithmetic average first-day-of-the-month price, and current costs held constant throughout the projected reserve life, when estimating whether reserve quantities are economical to produce.Proved oil and natural gas reserves are estimated quantities of crude oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids that geological and engineering data demonstrate with reasonable certainty to be recoverable in future years from known reservoirs under existing economic and operating conditions. Proved developed oil and natural gas reserves are reserves that can be expected to be recovered through existing wells with existing equipment and operating methods. There are uncertainties inherent in estimating quantities of proved oil and natural gas reserves, projecting future production rates, and timing of development expenditures. Accordingly, reserve estimates often differ from the quantities of oil and natural gas that are ultimately recovered54Table of ContentsEVOLUTION PETROLEUM CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIESNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS ContinuedEstimated quantities of proved oil and natural gas reserves and changes in quantities of proved developed and undeveloped reserves for each of the periods indicated were as follows:Crude OilBblsNatural GasLiquidsBblsNatural GasMcfBOEProved developed and undeveloped reserves:June 30,  of previous  recovery, extensions and  sales  30,  of previous estimates  of minerals in  sales  30,  of previous estimates  recovery, extensions and  of minerals in  sales  30,  developed reserves:June 30,  30,  30,  30,  A significant upward reserve revision occurred in the Delhi Field during fiscal 2013 as a result of 1 revised geological maps based on production results and acquired seismic data, 2 inclusion of an additional reservoir with similar features, production history and suitability for EOR, and 3 inclusion of natural gas processing at Delhi.b Significant reserve revisions occurred in the Delhi Field during fiscal 2014. As a result of an adverse fluid release event in the Field, certain oil reserves were reclassified from proved to an unproved category based on the operator decision to defer CO2 injections in certain parts of the Field. There was a positive revision to estimated proved reserves of natural gas liquids and natural gas as a result of an improved design for the gas plant in the Delhi Field. The plant is expected to significantly increase recoveries of these products, particularly natural gas, which was not previously planned to be extracted from the injection volumes. Standardized Measure of Discounted Future Net Cash Flows Future oil and natural gas sales and production and development costs have been estimated using prices and costs in effect at the end of the years indicated, as required by ASC 932, Disclosures about Oil and Gas Producing ActivitiesASC 932. ASC 932 requires that net cash flow amounts be discounted at 10%. Future production and development costs are computed by estimating the expenditures to be incurred in developing and producing our proved oil and natural gas reserves assuming continuation of existing economic conditions. Future income tax expenses are computed by applying the appropriate period-end statutory tax rates to the future pretax net cash flow relating to our proved oil and natural gas reserves, less the tax basis of the related properties. The future income tax expenses do not give effect to tax credits, allowances, or the impact of general and administrative costs of ongoing operations relating to the Company proved oil and natural gas reserves. Changes in the demand for oil and natural gas, inflation, and other factors make such estimates inherently imprecise and subject to substantial revision. The table below should not be construed to be an estimate of the current market value of our proved reserves55Table of ContentsEVOLUTION PETROLEUM CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIESNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS ContinuedThe standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows related to proved oil and natural gas reserves as of June30, 2014, 2013, and 2012are as follows:For the Years Ended June 30,201420132012Future cash  production costs and severance  development  income tax  net cash  annual discount for estimated timing of cash  measure of discounted future net cash  cash inflows represent expected revenues from production of period-end quantities of proved reserves based on the previous 12 monthsunweighted arithmetic average first-day-of-the-month commodity prices for each year and reflect adjustments for lease quality, transportation fees, energy content and regional price differentials.Year Ended June  prices used in determining future cash  NGL price utilized for future cash inflows was based on the historical price received.A summary of the changes in the standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows applicable to proved crude oil, natural gas liquids, and natural gas reserves is as follows:For the Years Ended June 30,201420132012Balance, beginning of  changes in sales prices and production costs related to future  in estimated future development  of oil and gas produced during the period, net of production  change due to extensions, discoveries, and improved recovery775,5741,606,122Net change due to revisions in quantity  change due to sales of minerals in  costs incurred during the  of  change in discounted income  changes in timing of production and other  end of  The operator has expressed current plans to produce the Delhi Field at lower production rates. The decision to produce these reserves at lower rates over a longer period of time did not materially change the total quantities expected to be recovered, but resulted in a significant reduction in the discounted value of these reserves as of June 30, 201456Table of ContentsEVOLUTION PETROLEUM CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIESNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS ContinuedNote19Fair Value MeasurementAccounting guidelines for measuring fair value establish a three-level valuation hierarchy for disclosure of fair value measurements. The valuation hierarchy categorizes assets and liabilities measured at fair value into one of three different levels depending on the observability of the inputs employed in the measurement.The three levels are defined as follows:Level1Observable inputs such as quoted prices in active markets at the measurement date for identical, unrestricted assets or liabilities.Level2Other inputs that are observable directly or indirectly such as quoted prices in markets that are not active, or inputs which are observable, either directly or indirectly, for substantially the full term of the asset or liability.Level3Unobservable inputs for which there is little or no market data and which the Company makes its own assumptions about how market participants would price the assets and liabilities.Fair Value of Financial Instruments.The Company other financial instruments consist of cash and cash equivalents, certificates of deposit, receivables and payables. The carrying amounts of cash and cash equivalents, receivables and payables approximate fair value due to the highly liquid or short-term nature of these instruments.Other Fair Value Measurements.The initial measurement and any subsequent revision of asset retirement obligations at fair value are calculated using discounted future cash flows of internally estimated costs. Significant Level3 inputs used in the calculation of asset retirement obligations include the costs of plugging and abandoning wells, surface restoration and reserve lives. Subsequent to initial recognition, revisions to estimated asset retirement obligations are made when changes occur for input values, which the Company reviews quarterly.Note20Selected Quarterly Financial Data UnauditedThe following table presents summarized quarterly financial information for the years ended June30, 2014and 2013:2014FirstSecond 1Third  income  income loss available to common  net income loss per  net income loss per  a $13 millionrestructuring charge and $08 millionof non-recurring expenses primarily associated with the exercise of 40 millionof 48 millionof previously outstanding stock options and warrants2Includes $608,000of non-recurring expenses related to the retirement of an officer of the    income available to common  net income per  net income per  tax provision for fiscal 2013 reflects a higher effective tax rate compared to the estimated annual effective rate at March31, 2013.
