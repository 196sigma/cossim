1 During the period from the inception of the Company through the consummation
of its initial public offering in March 1994, the Company was treated for
income tax purposes as an S corporation under Subchapter S of the Internal
Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, and under comparable tax laws of certain
states. As a result, earnings of the Company during that period were taxed
for federal and certain state income tax purposes directly to the Company
stockholders, rather than to the Company. Upon the termination of the
Company S corporation status, in addition to becoming subject to corporate
tax at the federal level and in a number of states, the Company was required
to provide for deferred federal and state income taxes, calculated in
accordance with the Financial Accounting Standards Board Statement 109,
Accounting for Income Taxes FAS 109, for the cumulative temporary
differences between the financial reporting and income tax bases of the
Company assets and liabilities, resulting in a charge to the provision for
income taxes in the amount of $1,213,000 in 1994. See Note 11 of the Notes
to Financial Statements.
2 The Company used a portion of its net proceeds from the initial public
offering to prepay the $12,000,000 in principal of the Company 1088%
Senior Secured Notes and related accrued interest of $653,000. This
prepayment resulted in an extraordinary after tax loss of $1,160,000, net 
of related income tax benefit of 
11   $710,000. The gross extraordinary loss included a prepayment penalty of 
$1,728,000 and the write-off of unamortized deferred loan costs of 
$142,000. See Note 2 of the Notes to Financial Statements.
3 The actual and pro forma net income per share data is based on the
historical weighted average number of shares outstanding, as adjusted to
reflect i a Common Stock split of 508-for-one in connection with a
reincorporation merger transaction completed in January 1994, ii the
3-for-2 split of the Common Stock effected on March 5, 1995, and iii the
3-for-2 split of the Common Stock effected on December 5, 1995. In 
addition, the weighted average number of shares outstanding used to compute
earnings per share as of December 31, 1993, has been adjusted to include 
the estimated number of shares 464,000 shares as calculated at the initial
public offering price and prior to adjustment for the stock dividends paid
in 1995 required to be sold by the Company to pay, as of December 31, 
1993, the distribution made to the Company S corporation stockholders 
upon the consummation of the initial public offering. See Notes 2 and 3 of 
the Notes to Financial Statements.
4 The pro forma statement of income data for 1994 and prior years is based on
historical net income, as adjusted to reflect a provision for income taxes
at an assumed effective rate of 38%, as if the Company had been a C
corporation since its inception. The pro forma statement of income data was
calculated using the criteria established under FAS 109, which requires the
use of an asset and liability approach to financial reporting and accounting
for income taxes. The 1994 pro forma provision for income taxes does not
include the $1,213,000 charge related to the Company termination of its S
corporation status as discussed in note 1 above. See Notes 1, 2 and 11 of
the Notes to Financial Statements.
ITEM 7 MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL
CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
The following discussion should be read in conjunction with, and is 
qualified in its entirety by, the Financial Statements and the Notes thereto 
and Selected Financial Data included elsewhere in this Form 10-K. Historical 
operating results and percentage relationships among any amounts included in 
the Financial Statements are not necessarily indicative of trends in 
operating results for any future period.
OVERVIEW
The Company core business is the manufacture and sale of high quality,
precision steel balls and rollers. In 1996, balls accounted for approximately
93% of the Company net sales, while rollers accounted for the remaining 7%.
Although all of the Company net sales from 1980 through 1986 were exclusively
to domestic customers, the Company international sales have increased
significantly in recent years and represented approximately 50% of net sales in
1996. See Note 10 of the Notes to Financial Statements.
Significant factors in the Company growth include its displacement of
captive ball manufacturing divisions of domestic and international bearing
manufacturers as a source of precision balls and increased sales of high
precision balls for quiet bearing applications. From 1992 through 1996, the
percentage of high precision balls produced by the Company for use in quiet
bearing applications has increased from approximately 54% to approximately 78%
of total net ball sales. Management believes that the Company sales growth has
resulted from its ability to capitalize on opportunities in overseas markets and
provide precision balls at competitive prices, as well as its emphasis on
product quality and customer service.

Year Ended December 31, 1996 Compared to the Year Ended December 31, 1995
NET SALES. The Company net sales increased $67 million, or 87%, to 
$845 million in 1996 from $778 million in 1995. Foreign net sales increased 
$36 million, or 94%, to $421 million in 1996 from $385 million in 1995. 
The increase in foreign net sales was due primarily to increased sales 
volumes with existing customers, and to a lesser extent, sales to several new 
customers. Domestic net sales increased $31 million, or 80%, to $424 
million in 1996 from $393 million in 1995. This increase was due primarily 
to increased sales to existing customers. Notwithstanding the Company 
record sales in 1996, the Company foreign sales in the last half of 1996 
were negatively affected by weak international economies, certain customers' 
excess inventories, and a slowing in the overall rate of outsourcing of 
captive production. The Company anticipates that its foreign sales will 
continue to be affected by one or more of these negative factors in 1997. In 
addition, in the fourth quarter of 1996, two of the Company major customers 
have informed the Company of their intention to bring in-house in 1997 a 
portion of their business in the aggregate, approximately $90 million in 
net sales that was previously outsourced to the Company. Management 
anticipates that the loss of these sales in 1997 should be offset, at least 
partially, by additional sales to other existing customers. For information 
concerning the Company quarterly results of operations for the year ended 
December 31, 1996, See Note 13 of the Notes to Financial Statements.                    13 
GROSS PROFIT. Gross profit increased by $39 million, or 163%, to $278
million in 1996 from $239 million in 1995. As a percentage of net sales, gross
profit increased to 329% in 1996 from 307% in 1995. During 1995, gross profit
was adversely affected as a result of increased raw material costs resulting
from a steel shortage and inefficiencies associated with the steel shortage and
capacity constraints, including increased labor and transportation costs. See
Management Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
Operations--Liquidity and Capital Resources. During the first quarter of 1996,
the steel shortage abated and, in addition, the Company brought additional
capacity on-line with the addition of the Mountain City, Tennessee facility
which allowed for more efficient operations. During the third quarter of 1996,
the Company implemented a new financial reporting software package which allowed
for more efficient tracking and controlling of costs. Additionally, during 1996,
the Company recorded approximately $700,000 of duty drawback associated with
1995 and 1996 imports of raw material which had not been previously recorded.
This amount is an offset to export fees paid.
Selling, General and Administrative Expenses. Selling, general and
administrative expenses increased by $641,000, or 151%, to $49 million from
$42 million in 1995. This increase was due primarily to increased salaries and
wages. As a percentage of net sales, selling, general and administrative
expenses increased slightly to 58% in 1996 from 55% in 1995.
DEPRECIATION EXPENSE. Depreciation expense increased $994,000, or 420%, to
$34 million in 1996 from $24 million in 1995. This increase was due primarily
to capital expenditures associated with the expansion of the Company
facilities and purchases of equipment. As a percentage of net sales,
depreciation increased to 40% in 1996 from 30% in 1995.
INTEREST EXPENSE. Interest expense increased $254,000, or 6048%, to
$296,000 in 1996 from $42,000 in 1995. This increase was due to increased levels
outstanding under the Company line of credit in 1996 as compared to 1995. See
Management Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
Operations--Liquidity and Capital Resources.
NET INCOME. Net income increased $954,000, or 83%, to $125 million in
1996 from $115 million in 1995. As a percentage of net sales, net income
decreased slightly to 147% in 1996 from 148% in 1995.
Year Ended December 31, 1995 Compared to the Year Ended December 31, 1994
NET SALES. The Company net sales increased by nearly $173 million, or
286%, to $778 million in 1995 from $605 million in 1994. Foreign net sales
increased $161 million, or 719%, to $385 million in 1995 from $224 million
in 1994. The increase in foreign net sales was due primarily to increased sales
volumes with existing customers and, to a lesser extent, sales to several new
customers. Domestic net sales increased $12 million, or 31%, to $393 million
in 1995 from $381 million in 1994. This increase was due primarily to increased
sales volumes with existing customers.
GROSS PROFIT. Gross profit increased by $35 million, or 172%, to $239
million in 1995 from $204 million in 1994. As a percentage of net sales, gross
profit decreased to 307% in 1995 from 337% in 1994. This decrease in gross
profit as a percentage of net sales was due primarily to a 52100 Steel supply
shortage which existed during 1995. As a result of such shortage and production
delays resulting therefrom, the Company incurred increased raw material costs
and increased transportation costs for finished products in order to meet
customer delivery requirements in 1995. See Management Discussion and
Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations--Liquidity and Capital
Resources.
Selling, General and Administrative Expenses. Selling, general and
administrative expenses increased by $810,000, or 236%, to $42 million in 1995
from $34 million in 1994. This increase was due primarily to costs associated
with increased foreign travel in the sales department and costs associated with
the Company status as 
14 a public company. As a percentage of net sales, selling, general and 
administrative expenses decreased slightly to 55% in 1995 from 57% in 1994.
DEPRECIATION EXPENSE. Depreciation expense increased slightly to $24
million in 1995 from $20 million in 1994. The increase of $368,000, or 184 was due primarily to capital expenditures associated with the expansion of the
Company facilities and purchases of equipment. Depreciation expense as a
percentage of net sales decreased to 30% in 1995 from 33% in 1994.
INTEREST EXPENSE. Interest expense decreased by more than $312,000, or
881%, to $42,000 in 1995 from $354,000 in 1994. This decrease was due primarily
to the retirement of $12 million of 1088% Senior Secured Notes the Senior
Notes during the first quarter of 1994. See Management Discussion and
Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations--Liquidity and Capital
Resources.
EXTRAORDINARY ITEM. In the first quarter of 1994, the Company recorded an
extraordinary charge of $19 million $12 million net of tax benefit of
$710,000 related to the early retirement of the Senior Notes. The charge
consisted of $17 million in prepayment penalties and a non-cash charge of
$142,000 related to the write-off of deferred loan costs associated with the
borrowings.
NET INCOME. Net income increased by $38 million, or 490%, to $115
million in 1995 from $77 million in 1994. As a percentage of net sales, net
income increased to 148% in 1995 from 128% in 1994. This increase in net
income as a percentage of net sales was due primarily to the combined effect of
i a non-recurring, non-cash charge of $12 million to earnings in 1994 to
record deferred income taxes upon termination of the Company S corporation
status in March 1994 and ii an extraordinary charge of $19 million $12
million net of tax benefit of $710,000 in the first quarter of 1994 for the
early retirement of the Senior Notes.
LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES
In March 1994, the Company completed an initial public offering of Common
Stock pursuant to which 2,000,000 shares were issued and sold by the Company
without adjustment for the two three-for-two stock splits effective on March 5,
1995 and December 5, 1995, respectively. Net proceeds to the Company were $249
million net of $20 million underwriters' discount and $11 million of related
costs. A portion of these proceeds was used to repay $120 million in principal
of the Senior Notes, as well as accrued interest of $653,000 and a related
prepayment penalty of $17 million. Approximately $92 million was used to pay a
distribution of undistributed earnings to the Company S corporation
stockholders. The distribution consisted of all of the Company previously
taxed and undistributed earnings as of March 22, 1994, plus the Company
previously undistributed earnings for financial reporting purposes in excess of
the previously taxed earnings at March 22, 1994, less a reserve of $12 million
for the amount of the deferred income taxes payable on such excess. The
remainder of the proceeds have been used for working capital and general
corporate purposes.
In February 1995, the Company entered into a modified loan agreement with
NationsBank of Tennessee N.A. NationsBank which replaced a loan agreement
entered into with NationsBank in the first quarter of 1994. The loan agreement,
as modified, provides for a revolving credit facility of up to $100 million,
which will expire on May 31, 1998.
Amounts outstanding under the revolving facility are unsecured and bear 
interest at a floating rate equal to, at the Company option, either the 
NationsBank prime commercial rate minus 10% or LIBOR plus 115% or LIBOR 
plus 10% if the minimum advance is at least $10 million. The loan 
agreement contains customary financial and operating restrictions on the 
Company, including covenants restricting the Company, without NationsBank 
consent, from pledging its inventory, accounts receivable or other assets to 
other lenders or from acquiring any other businesses if the aggregate 
expenditures by the Company in connection with such acquisitions would exceed 
a certain threshold in any fiscal year. In addition, the Company is 
prohibited from declaring or paying any dividend if an 
15 event of default exists under the revolving credit facility at the time of, 
or would occur as a result of, such declaration or payment. The loan 
agreement also contains customary covenants requiring the satisfaction of 
certain financial tests and the maintenance of certain financial ratios, 
including covenants requiring the Company to maintain a tangible net worth of 
not less than $250 million, working capital of not less than the greater of 
$100 million or 15% of revenues, as computed on a rolling 12 month basis, a 
ratio of total debt divided by net worth of not more than 1 to 1, and a ratio 
of current assets to current liabilities of not less than 15 to 1. The 
Company is in compliance with all such covenants. The outstanding principal 
balance of the Company borrowings under the revolving facility as of 
December 31, 1996 was $23 million, compared to $36 million at December 31, 
1995.
The Company arrangements with its domestic customers typically provide
that payments are due within 30 days following the date of the Company
shipment of goods, while arrangements with foreign customers other than foreign
customers that have entered into the Company inventory management program
generally provide that payments are due within either 90 or 120 days following
the date of shipment. Under the Company inventory management program, sales
are recorded when the product is used by the customer, and payments typically
are due within 30 days thereafter. Due to the continuing expansion of the
Company foreign sales, management believes that the Company working capital
requirements will increase as a result of longer payment terms provided to
foreign customers. Currently, all foreign sales are billed and paid for in
United States dollars.
To date, the Company has not been materially adversely affected by currency
fluctuations or foreign exchange restrictions. However, approximately 94% of the
steel used by the Company is 52100 Steel, and the Company purchases
substantially all of its 52100 Steel requirements from foreign mills because of
the lack of domestic producers of such steel at the quality level the Company
requires. During 1995, due to an increase in worldwide demand for 52100 Steel
and the decrease in the value of the United States dollar relative to foreign
currencies, the Company experienced an increase in the price of 52100 Steel and
some difficulty in obtaining an adequate supply of 52100 Steel from its existing
suppliers. Because of the shortage, the Company also incurred increased
transportation costs for finished products in order to meet customer delivery
requirements. During 1996, the steel shortage abated and the Company was able to
obtain an adequate supply of 52100 Steel on a timely basis. The Company has
obtained informal commitments for 52100 Steel in 1997 that exceed its projected
usage. The Company typically reserves with its customers the right to increase
product prices periodically in the event of increases in its raw material costs.
As the Company international operations continue to grow, foreign exchange
risk can be expected to increase, and the Company may be required to develop and
implement additional strategies, such as entering into foreign currency exchange
contracts, to manage this risk.
Working capital, which consists principally of cash and cash equivalents,
accounts receivable and inventories, was $184 million at December 31, 1996, as
compared to $134 million at December 31, 1995. The ratio of current assets to
current liabilities increased to 32:1 at December 31, 1996, from 20:1 at
December 31, 1995. This increase was due primarily to a decrease in accounts
payable and amounts drawn on the revolving credit facility. Cash flow from
operations increased to $127 million during 1996 from $95 million during 1995.
This increase is primarily attributable to an increase in net income and
depreciation.
Total capital expenditures for 1996 were approximately $84 million, all of
which was spent in the purchase of new machinery and equipment for the Company
facilities. These capital expenditures were financed with cash generated from
operations and funds available under the credit facility described above. In
January, 1997, the Company purchased the building and an approximately 8 acre
tract of land on which the Mountain City, Tennessee facility is located, for an
aggregate purchase price of $321,878 including $2,353 of closing fees and
related expenses.
During 1997, the Company plans to spend an additional $6 million on capital
expenditures, including the purchase of additional machinery and equipment for
all three of the Company facilities. The Company intends to finance these
activities with cash generated from operations and funds available under the
credit facility described above. The Company believes that funds generated from
operations and borrowings from the credit facility will be 
16 sufficient to finance the Company working capital needs and capital 
expenditure requirements through December 1997.
In December 1996, the Company announced that its Board of Directors
authorized the repurchase of up to 731,462 shares of the Company Common Stock,
equaling 5% of the Company issued and outstanding shares as of November 11,
1996. The repurchase program will remain in effect until the earlier of the
completion of the purchase of the shares or November 30, 1997. The program may
be extended or discontinued at any time, and there is no assurance that the
Company will repurchase the full amount authorized. The Company did not
repurchase any shares under the program during 1996. In February 1997, the
Company repurchased 86,000 shares at an aggregate purchase price of $999,750.
The Company believes that funds generated from operations and borrowings from
the credit facility will be sufficient to finance any additional stock
repurchases under the program.
SEASONALITY AND FLUCTUATION IN QUARTERLY RESULTS
The Company net sales historically have not been of a seasonal nature.
However, as foreign sales have increased as a percentage of total sales,
seasonality has become a factor for the Company in that many foreign customers
cease production during the month of August. For information concerning the
Company quarterly results of operations for the years ended December 31, 1996
and 1995, see Note 13 of the Notes to Financial Statements.
INFLATION AND CHANGES IN PRICES
While the Company operations have not been affected by inflation during
recent years, prices for 52100 Steel and other raw materials purchased by the
Company are subject to change. For example, during 1995, due to an increase in
worldwide demand for 52100 Steel and the decrease in the value of the United
States dollar relative to foreign currencies, the Company experienced an
increase in the price of 52100 Steel and some difficulty in obtaining an
adequate supply of 52100 Steel from its existing suppliers. See Management
Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
Operations--Liquidity and Capital Resources. Typically, the Company pricing
arrangements with its steel suppliers are subject to adjustment once every six
months. In an effort to limit its exposure to fluctuations in steel prices, the
Company has generally avoided the use of long-term, fixed price contracts with
its customers. Instead, the Company typically reserves the right to increase
product prices periodically in the event of increases in its raw material costs.
The Company was able to minimize the impact on its operations resulting from the
52100 Steel price increases by taking such measures. See Management
Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
Operations--Liquidity and Capital Resources.
CAUTIONARY STATEMENTS FOR PURPOSES OF THE SAFE HARBOR PROVISIONS OF THE
PRIVATE SECURITIES LITIGATION REFORM ACT OF 1995.
The Company wishes to caution that this report and the 1996 Annual Report 
to Stockholders contain, and future filings by the Company, press releases 
and oral statements made by the Company authorized representatives may 
contain, forward looking statements that involve certain risks and 
uncertainties. The Company actual results could differ materially from 
those expressed in such forward looking statements due to important factors 
bearing on the Company business, many of which already have been discussed 
in this filing and in the Company prior filings. The following paragraphs 
discuss the risk factors that the Company regards as the most significant, 
although the Company wishes to caution that other factors that currently are 
not considered significant or that currently cannot be foreseen may in the 
future prove to be important in affecting the Company results of 
operations. The Company undertakes no obligation to publicly update or revise 
any forward looking statements, whether as a result of new information, 
future events or otherwise.
INDUSTRY RISKS. The precision ball and roller industry is cyclical and
tends to decline in response to overall declines in industrial production. The
Company sales could be negatively affected by adverse conditions in the
industrial production sector of the economy or by adverse global or national
economic conditions generally.
17 
COMPETITION. The precision ball and roller market is highly competitive,
and many of the ball and roller manufacturers in the market are larger and have
substantially greater resources than the Company. The Company competitors are
continuously exploring and implementing improvements in technology and
manufacturing processes in order to improve product quality, and the Company
ability to remain competitive will depend, among other things, on whether it is
able, in a cost effective manner, to keep apace with such quality improvements.
In addition, the Company competes with many of its customers that, in addition
to producing bearings, also internally produce balls and rollers for sale to
third parties. The Company also faces a risk that its customers will decide to
produce balls and rollers internally rather than outsourcing their needs to the
Company.
RAPID GROWTH. The Company has undergone rapid growth over the last several
years. Accordingly, the Company risks underutilization or inefficient
utilization of its production facilities in future years. The Company also faces
risks associated with start-up expenses, inefficiencies, delays and increased
depreciation costs associated with its new facility in Mountain City, Tennessee,
and with its plant expansions.
RAW MATERIAL SHORTAGES. Because the balls and rollers manufactured by the
Company have highly-specialized applications, their production requires the use
of very particular types of steel. Due to quality constraints, the Company
obtains the vast majority of its steel from overseas suppliers. Steel shortages
or transportation problems, particularly with respect to 52100 Steel, could have
a detrimental effect on the Company business. See Management Discussion and
Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations--Liquidity and Capital
Resources.
RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH INTERNATIONAL TRADE. Because the Company obtains a
majority of its raw materials from overseas suppliers and sells to a large
number of international customers, the Company faces risks associated with i
adverse foreign currency fluctuations, ii changes in trade, monetary and
fiscal policies, laws and regulations, and other activities of governments,
agencies and similar organizations, iii the imposition of trade restrictions
or prohibitions, iv the imposition of import or other charges or taxes, and
v unstable governments or legal systems in countries in which the Company
suppliers and customers are located. See Management Discussion and Analysis
of Financial Condition and Results of Operations--Liquidity and Capital
Resources and Management Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and
Results of Operations--Inflation and Changes in Prices. Currently, all foreign
sales are billed and paid for in United States dollars. An increase in the value
of the United States dollar relative to foreign currencies may adversely affect
the ability of the Company to compete with its foreign-based competitors for
international as well as domestic sales.
DEPENDENCE ON MAJOR CUSTOMERS. During 1996, the Company ten largest
customers accounted for approximately 78% of its net sales. Sales to various
U.S. and foreign divisions of SKF, which is one of the largest bearing
manufacturers in the world, accounted for approximately 37% of net sales in
1996, and sales to FAG accounted for approximately 10% of net sales in 1996. The
Company currently negotiates and contracts with various purchasing units within
SKF and believes that, in certain respects, such units operate independently
with respect to purchasing decisions. There can be no assurance, however, that
SKF will not centralize purchasing decisions in the future. None of the
Company other customers accounted for more than 10% of its net sales in 1996,
but sales to three of its customers each represented more than 5% of the
Company 1996 net sales. The loss of all or a substantial portion of sales to
these customers would have a material adverse effect on the Company business.

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 
DECEMBER 31, 1996, 1995, AND 1994
- 
NOTE 1--THE COMPANY AND ITS SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
NN Ball and Roller, Inc. the Company is a manufacturer of balls and
rollers used primarily in the bearing industry. The Company has two
manufacturing facilities in Tennessee and one manufacturing facility in South
Carolina. The Company sells to both foreign and domestic customers See Note
10.
CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS
The Company considers all highly liquid investments with an original
maturity of three months or less as cash equivalents.
INVENTORIES
Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market. Cost is determined
using the first-in, first-out method.
PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT
Property, plant and equipment are stated at cost. Expenditures for
maintenance and repairs are charged to expense as incurred. Major renewals and
betterments are capitalized. When a major property item is retired, its cost and
related accumulated depreciation or amortization are removed from the property
accounts and any gain or loss is recorded in income or expense.
Depreciation is provided principally on the straight-line method over the 
estimated useful lives of the depreciable assets for financial reporting 
purposes. Accelerated depreciation methods are used for income tax purposes.
REVENUE RECOGNITION
The Company recognizes a sale when goods are shipped and ownership is
assumed by the customer. The Company has implemented an inventory management
program for three major customers. Under this program, sales are recognized when
products are used by the customer, instead of at the time of shipment. Inventory
on consignment at December 31, 1996 and 1995 was approximately $2,610,000 and
$1,840,000, respectively.
INCOME TAXES
Income taxes are provided based upon income reported for financial statement
purposes. Deferred income taxes reflect the tax effect of temporary differences
between the financial reporting and income tax bases of the Company assets and
liabilities See Note 11.
25 NN BALL AND ROLLER, INC.
NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 
DECEMBER 31, 1996, 1995, AND 1994
- 
HISTORICAL NET INCOME PER COMMON SHARE
Primary earnings per share is computed by dividing net income by the
weighted average number of common and dilutive common equivalent shares
outstanding during the year See Note 3. The dilutive effect of stock options
is computed using the treasury stock method. The fully dilutive effect of the
Company stock options results in no impact on earnings per share for any
period presented and thus has been omitted from these financial statements.
PRO FORMA NET INCOME PER COMMON SHARE UNAUDITED
Pro forma net income per common share unaudited is computed using the
weighted average number of common shares weighted average shares outstanding
during the period See Notes 2 and 3.
FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS
Effective January 1, 1995, the Company adopted Statement of Financial
Accounting Standards No. 107, Disclosures About Fair Value of Financial
Instruments SFAS 107. SFAS 107 requires the disclosure of the fair value of
financial instruments See Note 14.
USE OF ESTIMATES IN THE PREPARATION OF FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally
accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and
assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and
disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial
statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the
reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.
NOTE 2--INITIAL PUBLIC OFFERING AND CAPITAL CHANGES

common stock in which 2,000,000 shares of common stock prior to adjustment for
stock splits discussed in Note 3 were issued and sold by the Company at $14 per

additional reserve of $1,213,000 for the amount of the deferred income taxes
payable on such excess See Note 11.

three-for-two stock split effected in the form of a 50% stock dividend payable
on March 5, 1995 to stockholders of record on February 27, 1995. This resulted

NOTE 7--SHORT-TERM CREDIT FACILITIES
Under the terms of a revolving line of credit agreement with NationsBank of
Tennessee, N.A. NationsBank, the Company may borrow up to $10,000,000
through May 31, 1998. Amounts outstanding under the facility are unsecured, and
the Company selects a floating annual interest rate equal to either the
NationsBank prime commercial rate less 1% or LIBOR plus 115%. There was
$2,308,000 and $3,590,000 outstanding under the agreement at December 31, 1996
and 1995, respectively. The interest rate on this borrowing was 725% and 75%
at December 31, 1996 and 1995, respectively. The agreement contains restrictive
covenants which specify, among other things, restrictions on the incurrence of
indebtedness and the maintenance of certain working capital requirements. The
Company was in compliance with all such covenants as of December 31, 1996.
Interest paid during 1996, 1995 and 1994 was $321,000, $15,000 and $664,000,

NOTE 8--EMPLOYEE BENEFIT PLANS
The Company has a defined contribution 401k profit sharing plan the

On May 6, 1996, one of the Company officers exercised approximately 
150,000 stock options. The exercise price and the market price of the options 
at the date of exercise were $622 and $2550, respectively. Certain of these 
options were considered non qualified options and, accordingly, the Company 
recorded compensation expense, for income tax purposes only, of approximately 
$1,967,000. The reduction in taxes payable of approximately $686,000 was 
recorded as additional paid-in capital in the accompanying financial 
statements.
All options granted in the period January 1, 1995 through December 31, 
1996 vest 20% annually, beginning one year from date of grant. The exercise 
price of each option equals the market price of the Company stock on the 
date of grant, and an option maximum term is 10 years. During 1996, the 
Company adopted the provisions of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards 
No. 123, Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation SFAS 123. SFAS 123 
encourages but does not require a fair value based method of accounting for 
stock compensation plans. The Company has elected to continue accounting for 
its stock compensation plan using the intrinsic value based                     30 NN BALL AND ROLLER, INC.

NOTE 11--PROVISION FOR INCOME TAXES
Prior to the Company initial public offering Note 2, the Company
maintained the status of an S corporation for federal income tax purposes. As an
S corporation, the federal income tax effects of the Company activities
accrued directly to its stockholders.
The Company records taxes in accordance with the provisions of Statement of
Financial Accounting Standards No. 109, Accounting for Income Taxes FAS
109, which requires use of the asset and liability method to account for
deferred income taxes. Under the asset and liability method, deferred income
taxes are provided for the temporary differences between the financial reporting
and income tax bases of the Company assets and liabilities using enacted
income tax rates expected to be in effect when the temporary differences
reverse.
As described in Note 2, on March 22, 1994, the Company completed an initial
public offering. Upon completion of the initial public offering, the Company S
corporation election was terminated and, accordingly, the Company has been
subject to federal and state income taxes from that date forward. In addition,
upon the termination of the Company S corporation status, the Company was
required to provide for deferred federal and state income taxes, calculated in
accordance with FAS 109 for the cumulative temporary differences between the
financial reporting and income tax bases of the Company assets and
liabilities. As a result, a charge to the provision for income taxes in the
amount of $1,213,000 and a corresponding increase in the deferred income tax
liability was recorded upon termination of the Company S corporation status.
