To the Stockholders and Board of Directors of
Brooks Automation, Inc.   In our opinion, based on our audits and the report of other auditors, the
accompanying consolidated balance sheets and the related consolidated statements
of operations, of changes in stockholders' equity and of cash flows present
fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Brooks Automation,
Inc. and its subsidiaries at September 30, 2001 and 2000, and the results of
their operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period
ended September 30, 2001 in conformity with accounting principles generally
accepted in the United States of America. In addition, in our opinion, the
financial statement schedule listed in the accompanying index presents fairly,
in all material respects, the information set forth therein when read in
conjunction with the related consolidated financial statements. These financial
statements and financial statement schedule are the responsibility of the
Company management; our responsibility is to express an opinion on these
financial statements and financial statement schedule based on our audits. We
did not audit the financial statements of Irvine Optical Company LLC, a wholly
owned subsidiary acquired through a pooling of interests during the year ended
September 30, 2000, which statements reflect total revenues of $11,049,000 for
the year ended December 31, 1999. Those statements were audited by other
auditors whose report thereon has been furnished to us, and our opinion
expressed herein, insofar as it relates to the amounts included for Irvine
Optical Company LLC, is based solely on the report of the other auditors. We
conducted our audits of these statements in accordance with auditing standards
generally accepted in the United States of America, which require that we plan
and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial
statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a
test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial
statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates
made by management, and evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.
We believe that our audits and the report of other auditors provide a reasonable
basis for our opinion. s/ PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP

37             REPORT OF INDEPENDENT AUDITORS
To the Members
Irvine Optical Company, LLC
We have audited the balance sheets of Irvine Optical Company, LLC the
Company as of December 31, 1999 and 1998, and the related statements of
operations, members' deficit, and cash flows for the years then ended not
presented separately herein. These financial statements are the responsibility
of the Company management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on
these financial statements based on our audit.
We conducted our audits in accordance with auditing standards generally
accepted in the United States. Those standards require that we plan and perform
the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements
are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis,
evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An
audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant
estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial
statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis
for our opinion.
In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly,
in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December
31, 1999 and 1998, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for the
years then ended, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in
the United States.
The financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will
continue as a going concern. As more fully described in Note 1 to the financial
statements, the Company ability to generate sufficient revenue and ultimately
achieve profitable operations is uncertain. The Company future prospects
depend upon its ability to demonstrate sustained product sales and to generate
sufficient working capital through new financing and/or operating cash flows,
all of which raise substantial doubt about the Company ability to continue as
a going concern. Management plans in regard to these matters are also
described in Note 1. The financial statements do not include any adjustments to
reflect the possible future effects on the recoverability and classification of
assets or amounts and classification of liabilities that may result from the
outcome of this uncertainty.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
1. NATURE OF THE BUSINESS
Brooks Automation, Inc. Brooks or the Company is a leading supplier
of integrated tool automation, factory interface and factory automation
solutions for the global semiconductor and related industries such as the data
storage and flat panel display manufacturing industries. The Company product
revenues include sales of hardware and software products. The Company service
revenues are primarily comprised of tool control application consulting
services, software customization and spare parts sales.
2. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
PRINCIPLES OF CONSOLIDATION AND BASIS OF PRESENTATION
The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company
and all majority-owned subsidiaries. All significant intercompany accounts and
transactions are eliminated.
On July 12, 2001, the Company acquired Progressive Technologies, Inc.
PTI in a transaction accounted for as a pooling of interests initiated prior
to June 30, 2001. Accordingly, the Company consolidated financial statements
and notes thereto have been restated to include the financial position and
results of operations of PTI for all periods prior to the acquisition. Prior to
its acquisition by the Company, PTI fiscal year-end was December 31.
Accordingly, the Company consolidated balance sheet as of September 30, 2000,
includes PTI balance sheet as of December 31, 2000, and the Company
consolidated statements of operations for the years ended September 30, 2000 and
1999 include PTI results of operations for the years ended December 31, 2000
and 1999, respectively. As a result of conforming dissimilar year-ends, PTI
results of operations for the three months ended December 31, 2000, are included
in both of the Company fiscal years 2001 and 2000. An amount equal to PTI
net income for the three months ended December 31, 2000 was eliminated from
consolidated accumulated deficit for the year ended September 30, 2001. PTI
revenues, net income and net income attributable to common shareholders for that
quarter were $38 million, $536,000 and $506,000, respectively.
On June 26, 2001, the Company completed the purchase of KLA-Tencor, Inc.
e-Diagnostics product business e-Diagnostics. The e-Diagnostics programs
enable service and support teams to remotely access their tools in customer fabs
in real-time to diagnose and resolve problems. On June 25, 2001, the Company
acquired CCS Technology, Inc. CCST, a supplier of 300mm automation test and
certification software located in Williston, Vermont. On May 15, 2001, the
Company acquired SimCon N.V. SimCon, a value-added reseller for the
Company simulation, scheduling, production analysis and dispatching software
headquartered in Belgium. On February 16, 2001, the Company acquired SEMY
Engineering, Inc. SEMY, a provider of advanced process and equipment control
systems for the semiconductor industry located in Phoenix, Arizona. On December
13, 2000, the Company acquired substantially all of the assets of a scheduling
and simulation software and service distributor in Japan. These transactions
were recorded using the purchase method of accounting in accordance with
Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 16, Business Combinations APB 16.
Accordingly, the Company Consolidated Statements of Operations and of Cash
Flows for the year ended September 30, 2001 include the results of these
acquired entities for the periods subsequent to their respective acquisitions.
On May 5, 2000, the Company completed the acquisition of Irvine Optical
Company LLC Irvine Optical in a transaction accounted for as a pooling of
interests. Accordingly, the results of operations and financial position of
Irvine Optical are included in the Company consolidated results for all
periods presented. Prior to its acquisition by the Company, Irvine Optical
fiscal year-end was December 31. As a result of conforming dissimilar year-ends,
Irvine Optical results of operations for the three months ended December 31,
1999, are included in both of the Company fiscal years 2000 and 1999. An
amount equal to Irvine Optical net income for the three months ended December
31, 1999, was eliminated from consolidated
44
BROOKS AUTOMATION, INC.
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS -- CONTINUED
accumulated deficit for the year ended September 30, 2000. Irvine Optical
revenues and net income for that quarter were $41 million and $01 million,
respectively.
The Company completed two acquisitions during fiscal year 2000 which were
accounted for using the purchase method of accounting in accordance with APB 16:
MiTeX Solutions MiTeX on June 23, 2000 and Auto-Soft Corporation ASC and
AutoSimulations, Inc. ASI on January 6, 2000. The Company Consolidated
Statements of Operations and of Cash Flows include the results of these entities
for the periods subsequent to their respective acquisitions.
On August 31, 1999, the Company completed the acquisition of Smart Machines
Inc. Smart Machines. The acquisition was accounted for as a pooling of
interests. Accordingly, the results of operations and financial position of
Smart Machines are included in the Company consolidated results for all
periods presented.
The Company completed three acquisitions during the year ended September
30, 1999, which were accounted for using the purchase method of accounting in
accordance with APB 16: the Infab Division Infab of Jenoptik AG on September
30, 1999; Domain Manufacturing Corporation Domain on June 30, 1999 and
Hanyon Technology, Inc. Hanyon on April 21, 1999. Accordingly, the Company
Consolidated Statements of Operations and of Cash Flows include the results of
these acquired entities for all periods subsequent to their respective
acquisitions.
In June 1999, the Company formed a joint venture in Korea. This joint
venture is 70% owned by the Company and 30% owned by third parties unaffiliated
with the Company. The Company consolidates fully the financial position and
results of operations of the joint venture and accounts for the minority
interests in the consolidated financial statements.
Certain amounts in previously issued financial statements have been
reclassified to conform to current presentation.
USE OF ESTIMATES
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally
accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and
assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and
disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial
statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the
reporting period. Significant estimates include revenues and costs under
long-term contracts, collectibility of accounts receivable, obsolescence of
inventory, recoverability of depreciable assets, intangibles and deferred tax
assets and the adequacy of acquisition-related and restructuring reserves.
Although the Company regularly assesses these estimates, actual results could
differ from those estimates. Changes in estimates are recorded in the period in
which they become known.
FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSLATION
For non-U.S. subsidiaries, which operate in a local currency environment,
assets and liabilities are translated at period-end exchange rates, and income
statement items are translated at the average exchange rates for the period. The
local currency for all foreign subsidiaries is considered to be the functional
currency and accordingly, translation adjustments are reported in Accumulated
other comprehensive income loss. To date, foreign currency translation
adjustments are the only component added to the Company net income loss in
the calculation of comprehensive net income loss.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS -- CONTINUED
CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS
Cash and cash equivalents include cash and highly liquid investments with
original maturities to the Company of three months or less. At both September
30, 2001 and 2000, all cash equivalents were classified as available-for-sale
and held at amortized cost, which approximates fair value.
MARKETABLE SECURITIES
The Company invests its excess cash in marketable debt securities and
records them as available-for-sale. The Company records these securities at fair
value in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 115,
Accounting for Certain Investments in Debt and Equity Securities FAS 115.
For all periods presented, unrealized gains and losses are immaterial.
Marketable securities reported as current assets represent investments that
mature within one year. Long-term marketable securities represent investments
with maturity dates greater than one year from the balance sheet date. At the
time that the maturity dates of these investments become one year or less, the
values will be reclassified to current assets. At September 30, 2001, the
Company marketable securities were comprised entirely of corporate debt
securities aggregating $1695 million, with maturities to the Company not
exceeding three years. At September 30, 2000, the Company marketable
securities were comprised of U.S. Government securities aggregating $533
million and corporate debt securities aggregating $497 million.
CONCENTRATION OF CREDIT RISK
Financial instruments that potentially subject the Company to concentration
of credit risk consist primarily of trade receivables and temporary and
long-term cash investments in treasury bills, certificates of deposit and
commercial paper. The Company restricts its investments to repurchase agreements
with major banks, U.S. government and corporate securities, and mutual funds
that invest in U.S. government securities, which are subject to minimal credit
and market risk. The Company customers are concentrated in the semiconductor
industry, and relatively few customers account for a significant portion of the
Company revenues. The Company regularly monitors the creditworthiness of its
customers and believes that it has adequately provided for exposure to potential
credit losses.
INVENTORIES
Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market, cost being
determined using the first-in, first-out method. The Company provides inventory
reserves for excess, obsolete or damaged inventory based on changes in customer
demand, technology and other economic factors.
While the Company often uses sole source suppliers for certain key
components and common assemblies to achieve quality control and the benefits of
economies of scale, the Company believes that these parts and materials are
readily available from other supply sources.
FIXED ASSETS
Property, plant and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated
depreciation. Depreciation is computed using the straight-line method.
Depreciable lives are summarized below                              
Buildings                           20 - 40 years
Computer equipment and software                 2 - 6 years
Machinery and equipment                    2 - 10 years
Furniture and fixtures                     3 - 10 years   Equipment held under capital leases is recorded at the fair market value of
the equipment at the inception of the leases. Leasehold improvements and
equipment held under capital leases are amortized over the shorter
46
BROOKS AUTOMATION, INC.
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS -- CONTINUED
of their estimated useful lives or the term of the respective leases. Equipment
used for demonstrations to customers is included in machinery and equipment and
is depreciated over its estimated useful life. Repair and maintenance costs are
expensed as incurred.
The Company periodically evaluates the recoverability of long-lived assets,
including intangibles, whenever events and changes in circumstances indicate
that the carrying amount of an asset may not be fully recoverable. When
indicators of impairment are present, the carrying values of the asset are
evaluated in relation to the operating performance and future undiscounted cash
flows of the underlying business. The net book value of the underlying asset is
adjusted to fair value if the sum of the expected discounted cash flows is less
than book value. Fair values are based on estimates of market prices and
assumptions concerning the amount and timing of estimated future cash flows and
assumed discount rates, reflecting varying degrees of perceived risk.
INTANGIBLE ASSETS
Patents include capitalized direct costs associated with obtaining patents
as well as assets that were acquired as a part of purchase business
combinations. Capitalized patent costs are amortized using the straight-line
method over the shorter of seven years or the estimated economic life of the
patents. The fair values of acquired patents are amortized over three to five
years using the straight-line method. As of September 30, 2001 and 2000, the net
book values of the Company patents were $22 million and $41 million,
respectively.
Costs incurred in the research and development of the Company products
are expensed as incurred, except for certain software development costs.
Software development costs are expensed prior to establishing technological
feasibility and capitalized thereafter until the product is available for
general release to customers. Capitalized software development costs are
amortized to cost of sales on a product-by-product basis over the estimated
lives of the related products, typically three years. As of September 30, 2001,
the Company capitalized software costs had been fully amortized and written
off. As of September 30, 2000, the net book value of the Company capitalized
software costs were $06 million.
Goodwill represents the excess of purchase price over the fair value of net
tangible and identifiable intangible assets of businesses the Company has
acquired and has accounted for under the purchase method in accordance with APB
16. As of September 30, 2001 and 2000, the net book values of goodwill were
$601 million and $434 million, respectively.
Amortization expense for all intangible assets was $316 million, $196
million and $14 million for the years ended September 30, 2001, 2000 and 1999,
respectively.
The amortizable lives of intangible assets, including those identified as a
result of purchase accounting, are summarized as follows                              
Patents                            3 - 7 years
Completed technology                      4 - 5 years
License agreements                         5 years
Trademarks and trade names                   2 - 5 years
Non-competition agreements                   3 - 5 years
Assembled workforces                      3 - 4 years
Customer relationships                       4 years
Goodwill                           3 - 15 years                     47
BROOKS AUTOMATION, INC.
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS -- CONTINUED
REVENUE RECOGNITION
The Company has adopted the recommendations of Staff Accounting Bulletin
101, Revenue Recognition in Financial Statements, SAB 101 effective
October 1, 2000. The adoption of SAB 101 did not have any impact on the
Company results of operations or financial position.
Revenue from product sales are recorded upon transfer of title and risk of
loss to the customer provided there is evidence of an arrangement, fees are
fixed or determinable, no significant obligations remain, collection of the
related receivable is reasonably assured and customer acceptance criteria have
been successfully demonstrated. Revenue from software licenses is recorded
provided there is evidence of an arrangement, fees are fixed or determinable, no
significant obligations remain, collection of the related receivable is
reasonably assured and customer acceptance criteria have been successfully
demonstrated. Costs incurred for shipping and handling are included in cost of
sales. A provision for product warranty costs is recorded to estimate costs
associated with such warranty liabilities. In the event significant
post-shipment obligations or uncertainties remain, revenue is deferred and
recognized when such obligations are fulfilled by the Company or the
uncertainties are resolved.
Revenue from services is recognized as the services are rendered. Revenue
from fixed fee application consulting contracts and long-term contracts are
recognized using the percentage-of-completion method of contract accounting
based on the ratio that costs incurred to date bear to estimated total costs at
completion. Revisions in revenue and cost estimates are recorded in the periods
in which the facts that require such revisions become known. Losses, if any, are
provided for in the period in which such losses are first identified by
management. Generally, the terms of long-term contracts provide for progress
billing based on completion of certain phases of work. For maintenance
contracts, service revenue is recognized ratably over the term of the
maintenance contract.
In transactions that include multiple products and/or services, the Company
allocates the sales value among each of the deliverables based on their relative
fair values.
STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION
The Company employee stock compensation plans are accounted for in
accordance with Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 25, Accounting for
Stock Issued to Employees, APB 25 and related interpretations. Under this
method, no compensation expense is recognized as long as the exercise price
equals or exceeds the market price of the underlying stock on the date of the
grant. The Company elected the disclosure-only alternative permitted under
Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123, Accounting for Stock-Based
Compensation, FAS 123 for fixed stock-based awards to employees. All non-
employee stock-based awards are accounted for in accordance with FAS 123.
INCOME TAXES
Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the expected
future tax consequences, utilizing current tax rates, of temporary differences
between the carrying amounts and the tax bases of assets and liabilities.
Deferred tax assets are recognized, net of any valuation allowance, for the
estimated future tax effects of deductible temporary differences and tax
operating loss and credit carryforwards.
EARNINGS LOSS PER SHARE
Basic earnings loss per share is calculated based on the weighted average
number of common shares outstanding during the period. Diluted earnings per
share is calculated based on the weighted average number of common shares and
dilutive common equivalent shares assumed outstanding during the period. Shares
used to compute diluted earnings per share exclude common share equivalents if
their inclusion would have an anti-dilutive effect.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS -- CONTINUED
FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS
The Company financial instruments consist of cash and cash equivalents,
investments in long- and short-term debt securities, accounts receivable,
accounts payable, accrued expenses and long- and short-term debt. The carrying
amounts reported in the balance sheets approximate their fair values at both
September 30, 2001 and 2000.
RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS
In October 2001, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Statement
of Financial Accounting Standards No. 144 FAS 144, Accounting for the
Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets. FAS 144 supercedes FASB Statement
No. 121 FAS 121 Accounting for the Impairment of Long-Lived Assets and for
Long-Lived Assets to be Disposed of. FAS 144 applies to all long-lived assets
and consequently amends Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 30 APB 30,
Reporting Results of Operations -- Reporting the Effects of Disposal of a
Segment of a Business, and Extraordinary, Unusual and Infrequently Occurring
Events and Transactions. FAS 144 is effective for financial statements issued
for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2001. Management is currently
evaluating the effect, if any, FAS 144 will have on its financial position and
results of operations.
In July 2001, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Statements of
Financial Accounting Standards No. 141 FAS 141, Business Combinations and
No. 142 FAS 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets effective for fiscal
years beginning after December 15, 2001. FAS 141 requires business combinations
initiated after June 30, 2001 to be accounted for using the purchase method of
accounting, and broadens the criteria for recording intangible assets separate
from goodwill. FAS 142 requires that goodwill and identifiable intangible assets
determined to have an indefinite life no longer be amortized, but instead be
tested for impairment at least annually. The Company is required to adopt FAS
142 in the fiscal year beginning October 1, 2002, at which time amortization of
goodwill on purchase transactions prior to July 1, 2001 will cease. The
application of the separate recognition criteria for intangible assets and the
cessation of amortization of goodwill and result in goodwill of approximately
$67 million at September 30, 2001 being subject to an annual impairment test,
unless interim indicators indicate a need for an interim test, and a resulting
reduction of goodwill amortization expense of approximately $32 million, $22
million and $11 million in fiscal 2002, 2003 and 2004, respectively.
3. BUSINESS ACQUISITIONS
POOLING OF INTERESTS TRANSACTIONS
PTI
On July 12, 2001, the Brooks acquired PTI in a transaction accounted for as
a pooling of interests initiated prior to June 30, 2001 in exchange for 715,004
shares of the Company common stock. The acquisition has been accounted for as
a pooling of interests. PTI is engaged in the development, production and
distribution of air-flow regulation systems for clean room and process equipment
in the semiconductor industry.
The accompanying consolidated financial statements and notes thereto have
been restated to include the financial position and results of operations for
PTI for all periods prior to the acquisition. As a result of conforming

The excess of purchase price over the fair value of net liabilities assumed
and identifiable intangible assets was recorded based upon analyses of their
fair values by an independent appraiser. The balance of the excess was recorded

acquired. The Company recorded the cash receipt with a corresponding reduction
to acquired intangible assets.
Infab
On September 30, 1999, the Company acquired certain assets of Infab in
exchange for 868,572 shares of Brooks common stock in a purchase transaction.
Infab is a worldwide supplier of advanced factory automation systems
headquartered in Germany. The assets purchased principally included fixed
assets, inventory, receivables, patents and intellectual property.
As part of the preliminary purchase price allocation recorded at September
30, 1999, the Company had established an accrual of $27 million related
primarily to severance costs and costs to exit certain duplicate facilities.
During the year ended September 30, 2000, review of these accruals determined
that the accruals were not required due to changed conditions and circumstances
subsequent to the preliminary purchase price allocation. Accordingly, these
accruals were reversed and recorded as a purchase accounting adjustment to
decrease goodwill. Additionally, during the year ended September 30, 2000, the
Company finalized its evaluation of the fair value of assets acquired and
liabilities assumed. This evaluation resulted in a reduction to the value of net
tangible assets acquired of $71 million, primarily related to inventories and
accounts receivable, and resulting in an increase to goodwill for the same
amount. As settlement of this shortfall during fiscal 2001, the Company received
$51 million of cash from the sellers and recorded a corresponding reduction to
acquired intangible assets. In addition, the Company adjusted goodwill by $11
million in the year ended September 30, 2001 in relation to 45,714 shares of its
common stock which had been held in escrow pending the post-closing review of
the assets purchased.

The Company does not provide for U.S. income taxes applicable to
undistributed earnings of its foreign subsidiaries since these earnings are
indefinitely reinvested. A valuation allowance has been established for certain
of the future domestic income tax benefits primarily related to Research and
Development and Foreign Tax Credits based on management assessment that it is
more likely than not that such benefits will not be realized.
As of September 30, 2001, the Company had federal and state net operating
loss carryforwards of approximately $185 million and federal and state research
and development tax credit carryforwards of approximately $76 million and
foreign tax credit carryforwards of approximately $41 million available to
reduce future tax liabilities, which expire at various dates through 2021. The
ultimate realization of the remaining loss carryforwards is dependent upon the
generation of sufficient taxable income in respective jurisdictions. Although
realization is not assured, management believes it is more likely than not that
all of the deferred tax assets will be realized. The amount of the deferred tax
asset considered realizable, however, could be reduced in the near term if
estimates of future taxable income during the carryforward period are reduced.
6. FINANCING ARRANGEMENTS
On May 23, 2001, the Company completed the private placement of $1750
million aggregate principal amount of 475% Convertible Subordinated Notes due

A Junior Participating Preferred Stock the Series A Preferred Shares, par
value $001 per share, of the Company, at a purchase price of $13500 per one
one-thousandth of a Series A Preferred Share, subject to adjustment. Redemption
of the rights could generally discourage a merger or tender offer involving the
securities of the Company that is not approved by the Company Board of
Directors by increasing the cost of effecting any such transaction and,
accordingly, could have an adverse impact on stockholders who might want to vote
in favor of such merger or participate in such tender offer. The rights will
expire on the earlier of July 31, 2007, or the date on which the rights are
redeemed. The terms of the rights may generally be amended by the Board of

10. ACQUISITION-RELATED AND RESTRUCTURING COSTS AND ACCRUALS
The Company recorded $93 million of acquisition-related and restructuring
charges during the year ended September 30, 2001, comprised of $39 million of
acquisition-related costs and $54 million of restructuring charges. The
acquisition-related costs primarily relate to transaction costs incurred during
the Company recent acquisition of PTI. On September 5, 2001, the Company
Board of Directors approved a formal plan of restructure in response to the
current downturn in the semiconductor industry. To that effect, the Company
recorded restructuring charges of $54 million in the fourth quarter of the
fiscal year. Of this amount, $20 million is related to workforce reductions of
approximately 140 employees which is expected to be paid in 2002 and $34
million for the consolidation and strategic focus realignment of several
facilities of which $01 million was paid in 2001, $17 million is expected to
be paid in 2002 and $16 million in the subsequent years. These measures were
largely intended to align the Company capacity and infrastructure to
anticipated customer demand. Workforce charges, consisting principally of
severance costs, were recorded based on specific identification of employees to
be terminated, along with their job classifications or functions and their
locations. The charges for the Company excess facilities were recorded to
recognize the lower of the amount of the remaining lease obligations, net of any
sublease rentals, or the expected lease settlement costs. These costs have been
estimated from the time when the space is expected to be vacated and there are
no plans to utilize the facility in the future. Costs incurred prior to vacating
the facilities will be charged to operations.
During the year ended September 30, 2000, the Company recorded
acquisition-related costs of $06 million, primarily for legal, accounting and
other costs associated with acquiring Irvine Optical.
During the year ended September 30, 1999, the Company recorded
acquisition-related and restructuring costs of $31 million, including $12
million of legal, accounting and other costs associated with acquiring Smart
Machines. In addition, the Company approved and implemented a restructuring
program designed to
63
BROOKS AUTOMATION, INC.
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS -- CONTINUED
integrate its fiscal 1999 acquisitions. These actions involved 7 employees, all
of whom were terminated prior to September 30, 1999, and the write-off of
certain fixed assets prior to September 30, 1999. Accordingly, during fiscal
1999, the Company recorded a charge of $19 million related to the restructuring
program. The Company also recorded $29 million of costs in purchase accounting
transactions consisting of $20 million for severance costs principally related
to former Infab employees, $06 million to exit certain duplicate facilities and
$03 million for other related costs.

These future minimum lease commitments include approximately $33 million
related to a facility the Company has elected to abandon in connection with its
restructuring initiatives.
On January 29, 2001 the Company purchased three buildings, two of which are
used as Brooks' corporate headquarters and primary manufacturing facility, and
the third is currently leased to an unrelated party. The term of that lease
concludes in November 2002.
As of September 30, 2001, the Company did not have any capital lease
obligations.
CONTINGENCY
There has been substantial litigation regarding patent and other
intellectual property rights in the semiconductor and related industries. The
Company has received notice from a third party alleging infringements of such
party patent rights by certain of the Company products. The Company believes
the patents claimed are invalid. In the event of litigation with respect to this
claim, the Company is prepared to vigorously defend its position. However,
because patent litigation can be extremely expensive and time consuming, the
Company may seek to obtain a license to one or more of the disputed patents.
Based upon currently available information, the Company would only do so if such
license fees would not be material to the Company consolidated financial
statements. Currently, the Company does not believe it is probable that the
future events related to this threatened matter would have an adverse effect on
the Company business.
15. SUBSEQUENT EVENTS
On December 13, 2001, the Company acquired the Automation Systems Group of
Zygo Corporation in exchange for approximately $11 million of cash, net of
closing adjustments aggregating approximately $2 million. The Automation Systems
Group, located in Florida, is a manufacturer of reticle automation systems,
including reticle sorters, reticle macro inspection systems and reticle handling
solutions for the semiconductor industry. The transaction will be accounted for
as a purchase of assets.
On October 23, 2001, the Company and PRI Automation, Inc. PRI entered
into an Agreement and Plan of Merger the Merger Agreement. PRI supplies
advanced factory automation systems, software, and services that optimize the
productivity of semiconductor and precision electronics manufacturers, as well

to the terms and conditions contained therein, PRI common stockholders will
receive 052 shares of the Company common stock for each share of PRI common

not limited to, all required regulatory approvals, the approval of the Merger by
the stockholders of the Company and the stockholders of PRI and the approval of
the issuance of the Company Common Stock in the Merger by the stockholders of
the Company. The Merger would be accounted for as a purchase of assets.
