ITEM 8. FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA
REPORT OF INDEPENDENT ACCOUNTANTS
To the Board of Directors and Stockholders
of Pegasus Solutions, Inc.   In our opinion, the accompanying consolidated balance sheets and the
related consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss, changes in
stockholders' equity and cash flows present fairly, in all material respects,
the financial position of Pegasus Solutions, Inc. and its subsidiaries at
December 31, 2002 and 2001, and the results of their operations and their cash
flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2002 in
conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of
America. These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company
management; our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial
statements based on our audits. We conducted our audits of these statements in
accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in the United States of
America, which require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable
assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material
misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting
the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the
accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, and
evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our
audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
As discussed in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements, the
Company changed its method of accounting for goodwill and other intangible
assets in connection with its adoption of Statement of Financial Accounting
Standards No. 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, effective January 1,
2002.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
1. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
BASIS OF PRESENTATION
Pegasus is a leading provider of hotel room reservation services,
reservation technology systems and hotel representation services for the global
hospitality industry. On April 3, 2000, Pegasus completed the acquisition of
REZ, Inc. REZ, a leader in providing distribution services and solutions for
the hotel industry. The acquisition added hotel representation, central
reservation system, or CRS, and property management system, or PMS, services to
our existing electronic distribution and commission processing services. Pegasus
is organized primarily on the basis of services provided, with two reportable
segments -- technology and hospitality.
The technology segment provides reservation services, commission processing
services and property systems and services to the global hotel industry. The
hospitality segment provides hotel representation services offered under the
Utell brand name. Hotel representation services offered under the Summit Hotels
& Resorts and Sterling Hotels & Resorts brand names were sold in January 2001,
and the Golden Tulip brand was sold in June 2001.
The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Pegasus
Solutions, Inc. and its wholly owned subsidiaries Pegasus or the Company.
All significant inter-company balances have been eliminated in consolidation.
Certain prior year amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current year
presentation. Pegasus' common stock is traded on the Nasdaq National Market
under the symbol PEGS.
MANAGEMENT ESTIMATES
The preparation of the consolidated financial statements in conformity with
generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates
and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities,
revenues and expenses and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities.
Actual results may differ from those estimates. Certain accounting policies
require higher degrees of judgment than others in their application. The
following accounting policies require significant estimates: accounts and notes
receivable, impairment of long-lived assets and employee benefit plans.
CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS
The Company considers all highly liquid investments with maturities of
three months or less from the date of purchase to be cash equivalents.
INVESTMENTS IN DEBT AND EQUITY SECURITIES
Marketable securities consist of corporate debt and equity securities and
obligations issued by governments and agencies. By policy, the Company invests
primarily in high-grade marketable securities. All marketable securities are
defined as available-for-sale under the provisions of Statement of Financial
Accounting Standards No. 115, Accounting for Certain Investments in Debt and
Equity Securities.
Management determines the appropriate classification of its investments in
marketable securities at the time of purchase and re-evaluates such
determination at each balance sheet date. Available-for-sale securities are
carried at fair value, with changes in the unrealized gain or loss reported as a
separate component of stockholders' equity, net of tax.
CAPITALIZED SOFTWARE COSTS
Software costs are accounted for in accordance with either Statement of
Financial Accounting Standards No. 86, Accounting for the Costs of Computer
Software to Be Sold, Leased, or Otherwise Marketed, and with Statement of
Position No. 98-1, Accounting for the Costs of Computer Software Developed or
35
PEGASUS SOLUTIONS, INC.
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS -- CONTINUED
Obtained for Internal Use. Capitalized software costs are amortized on a
product-by-product basis using the straight-line method over a period, which
approximates the estimated economic life of the product. In the event
unamortized software costs exceed the net realizable value of the software, the
excess is written-off in the period the excess is determined. Amortization of
capitalized software costs in 2002, 2001 and 2000 totaled $206 million, $158
million and $113 million, respectively. At December 31, 2002 and 2001,
unamortized capitalized software was $439 million and $510 million,
respectively.
PROPERTY AND EQUIPMENT
Property and equipment are recorded at cost and depreciated using the
straight-line method over their estimated useful lives, ranging from three to
seven years. Leasehold improvements are amortized over the shorter of their
estimated useful lives or the life of the lease. Expenditures for maintenance
and repairs, as well as minor renewals, are charged to operations as incurred,
while betterments and major renewals are capitalized. Any gain or loss resulting
from the retirement or sale of an asset is credited or charged to operations.
The Company evaluates long-lived assets to be held and used in the
business, or to be disposed of, for impairment whenever events or changes in
circumstances indicate that the net book value of the asset may not be
recoverable. Impairment is determined by comparing expected future cash flows
undiscounted and before interest to the net book value of the assets. If
impairment exists, the amount of impairment is measured as the difference
between the net book value of the assets and the estimated fair value of the
related assets. The Company believes that no impairment of property and
equipment existed at December 31, 2002 or 2001.
GOODWILL
Effective January 1, 2002, the Company adopted Statement of Financial
Accounting Standards No. 142, Goodwill and Other Intangibles FAS 142 and
Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 141, Business Combinations
FAS 141. FAS 142 addresses financial accounting and reporting for intangible
assets acquired individually or with a group of other assets but not those
acquired in a business combination at acquisition and for goodwill and other
intangible assets subsequent to their acquisition. The Company consolidated
balance sheet at December 31, 2001 included goodwill, net of accumulated
amortization, totaling $1369 million, which is related to the REZ, Inc. REZ
and Global Enterprise Technology Solutions, LLC GETS acquisitions. Pegasus
applied the provisions of FAS 142 on January 1, 2002 and discontinued
amortization of goodwill from the REZ acquisition. In accordance with FAS 141,
goodwill from the GETS acquisition was never amortized. In addition, as required
by FAS 141, effective January 1, 2002, workforce-in-place from the REZ
acquisition was reclassified as goodwill and is no longer be subject to
amortization. During 2002, purchase price adjustments for certain tax items
reduced goodwill by $26 million.
Amortization of goodwill was $162 million and $123 million for the years
ended December 31, 2001 and 2000, respectively. As of December 31, 2002 and
2001, goodwill totaled $1395 million and $1369 million, respectively. The
carrying value of goodwill is evaluated annually. The Company believes that no
impairment of goodwill existed at December 31, 2002 or 2001.
OTHER INVESTMENTS
As a result of the REZ acquisition, the Company received a $11 million
non-controlling equity investment in the SITA Foundation. The investment was
converted into 32,853 shares of France Telecom and disposed of by the Company
for a loss of approximately $280,000 in 2002.
On February 11, 2002, Pegasus and five hotel chains -- Hilton Hotels, Hyatt
Corporation, Marriott International, Six Continents Hotels and Starwood
Hotels -- announced the formation of Travelweb, LLC, Travelweb formerly
known as Hotel Distribution System, LLC See Note 15. This new venture was
36
PEGASUS SOLUTIONS, INC.
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS -- CONTINUED
formed to distribute discounted hotel rooms over the Internet through multiple
Internet sites using a merchant business model.
On April 4, 2002, Pegasus entered into a three-year technology agreement
with Travelweb to develop technology and provide services that automate the
net-rate reservation and merchant model processes for Travelweb and
participating hotels.
During the year ended December 31, 2002, Pegasus contributed $18 million
in cash and $361,000 in development costs to Travelweb. In addition, the Company
transferred its consumer Internet site, TravelWeb.com, as part of the capital
contribution to the venture. Because Pegasus is equal partners with five hotel
companies and does not exercise significant influence, the investment in
Travelweb is accounted for under the cost method.
STOCK-BASED EMPLOYEE COMPENSATION
The Company accounts for stock-based compensation utilizing the intrinsic
value method in accordance with the provisions of Accounting Principles Board
Opinion No. 25 APB 25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees and related
Interpretations. Accordingly, no compensation expense is recognized for fixed
option plans because the exercise prices of employee stock options equal or
exceed the market prices of the underlying stock on the dates of grant. As
discussed in Note 11, the Company maintains stock option, restricted stock and
employee stock purchase plans. Total compensation expense for these plans was
$798,000, $123,000 and $280,000 for 2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively.
The following table represents the effect on net income and earnings per
share if the Company had applied the fair value based method and recognition
provisions of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123, Accounting
for Stock-Based Compensation, to stock-based employee compensation In

REVENUES
In 2002, the Company adopted the provisions of Emerging Issues Task Force
Issue, EITF, 01-14 Income Characterization of Reimbursements Received for
'Out-of-Pocket' Expenses Incurred. The Company billings for out-of pocket
expenses, such as travel, and certain third-party vendor expenses such as global
distribution system and telecommunication charges are included in revenues. The
related costs are classified as customer reimbursements and are reflected as a
component of cost of services. Revenues and costs of services for prior periods
have been adjusted to give retroactive effect to the adoption of EITF 01-14. The
adoption of EITF 01-14 had no effect on the Company financial position, cash
flows, operating loss or per share results.
Pegasus' service revenues are predominantly transaction-based. The
Company technology segment derives its revenues from transaction fees,
commission fees, license fees and maintenance fees charged to participating
hotels and travel agencies. The Company hospitality segment derives its
revenues from reservation processing fees, membership fees and fees for various
marketing services.
Reservation services. CRS revenues consist of transaction fees as well as
license, maintenance and support fees related to the Company
RezViewTMsoftware. Transaction fees are recognized when the guest stay occurs
or at the transaction date depending on the contract terms. License, maintenance
and support fees are recognized ratably over the term of the customer contract.
Pegasus derives revenues from its electronic distribution service by
charging hotel customers a fee based on the number of reservations made, less
the number cancelled net reservations. As a hotel cumulative volume of net
reservations increases during the course of the calendar year, its fee per
transaction decreases after predetermined transaction volume hurdles have been
met. As a result, for higher volume customers, unit transaction fees are higher
at the beginning of the year, when cumulative transactions are lower. The
Company recognizes revenues based on the fee per transaction that a customer is
expected to pay during the entire year. The Company interim balance sheets
reflect deferred revenue for the difference between the fee per transaction that
Pegasus actually bills a customer during the period and the average fee per
transaction that a customer is expected to pay for the entire year. The deferred
revenue created during the early periods of the
38
PEGASUS SOLUTIONS, INC.
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS -- CONTINUED
year is recognized by the end of the year as the fee per transaction that
Pegasus actually bills a customer falls below the average fee per transaction
for the entire year. The Company quarterly operating results have historically
not been materially impacted as a result of this policy. Additionally, Pegasus
generally charges new participants in the electronic distribution service a
one-time fee for work performed to establish the connection between a hotel
central reservation system and the Pegasus electronic distribution technology.
The Company recognizes these one-time fees over the life of the customer
contract. The Company also charges certain GDSs a fee based on either the number
of net reservations or the number of hotel chains connected to the GDS through
the Pegasus electronic distribution technology to compensate for the management
and consolidation of multiple interfaces.
Pegasus derives its Internet distribution revenues by charging
participating hotels transaction fees. For reservations that originate on Web
sites using our online distribution service, Pegasus charges hotels transaction
fees based on the number of net reservations made at participating properties.
Online distribution service customers also pay initial development fees and
monthly subscription or maintenance fees.
Financial Services. Pegasus derives commission processing revenues by
charging each participating travel agency a fee equal to a percentage of
commissions paid to that agency through the commission processing service. The
Company also generally charges participating hotels a fee based on the number of
commissionable transactions processed. Revenues from travel agency fees can vary
substantially from period to period based on the types of hotels at which
reservations are made, fluctuations in overall room rates and percentages or
fees determined by the travel supplier. Pegasus recognizes revenues from its
commission processing service when earned.
Property Systems. Property Systems revenues consist of maintenance and
support fees from PMS software obtained in the REZ and GETS acquisitions. In
addition, Property system revenues include fees from the PegasusCentral product,
which are recognized monthly. Maintenance, support and training fees are
recognized ratably over the term of the customer contract.
Hotel Representation. Hotel representation revenues consist of reservation
processing fees, membership fees and fees for various marketing services.
Reservation processing fees are recognized when the guest stay occurs or on the
transaction date depending on the contract terms. Membership fees are generally
billed quarterly and recognized ratably over the billing period. Marketing
service revenues are recognized as the marketing services are provided.
INCOME TAXES
Income taxes are accounted for under the asset and liability method.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the estimated future tax
consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement
carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax
bases. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates
in effect for the year in which those temporary differences are expected to be
recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a
change in tax rate is recognized in income in the period that includes the
enactment date. Valuation allowances are established when necessary to reduce
deferred tax assets to the amounts more likely than not to be realized.
ADVERTISING COSTS
Advertising and promotion-related expenses are charged to operations when
incurred. Advertising expense for 2002, 2001 and 2000 was approximately $23
million, $38 million and $51 million, respectively.

PEGASUS SOLUTIONS, INC.
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS -- CONTINUED
RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT
Research and development expenses are charged to operations when incurred.
FOREIGN CURRENCY
The Company has various foreign operations, primarily in Europe, Canada,
Latin America and Asia. The U.S. dollar is the functional currency for the
Company foreign operations. Gains and losses from foreign currency
transactions are recognized in the period in which they occur and are included
in other income expense.
FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS
The Company uses derivative financial instrument contracts to manage
foreign exchange risks. Amounts receivable or payable under derivative financial
instrument contracts are reported on the consolidated balance sheet. As exchange
rates fluctuate, gains and losses on contracts used to hedge existing assets and
liabilities are recognized in the statement of operations as other income
expense.
The carrying amounts of the Company financial instruments reflected in
the consolidated balance sheets at December 31, 2002 and 2001 approximate their
respective fair values.
CONCENTRATIONS OF CREDIT AND MARKET RISK
The Company financial instruments exposed to concentrations of credit
risk consist primarily of cash, receivables and forward contracts to purchase or
sell foreign currencies.
Cash and Cash Equivalents. Cash balances exceeding the federally insured
limits are maintained in financial institutions. However, management believes
the institutions are of high credit quality.
Accounts and notes receivables. The Company technology customers
primarily include well-established hotel chains and travel-related web sites.
The Company representation customers primarily consist of independent hotels,
some of which are located outside the United States. Some of these customers may
not be financially viable. Even though the Company has policies in place to
limit exposure from concentrations of credit risks, management believes the
Company has moderate exposure to credit risk related to accounts receivable from
its customers. Additionally, Pegasus has notes receivable from one company
related to the sale of business units see Note 4. These notes receivable are
monitored by management for collectibility, considering the payment history and
known financial condition of the party. If the financial condition of the party
was to deteriorate, resulting in an impairment of their ability to make
payments, Pegasus may incur an expense to increase its allowance for doubtful
accounts and may receive less cash than expected.
Foreign currency contracts. The counterparties to the Company foreign
exchange contracts are substantial and creditworthy multinational commercial
banks or other financial institutions that are recognized market makers. Neither
the risks of counterparty nonperformance nor the economic consequences of
counterparty nonperformance associated with these contracts are considered by
the Company to be material.
The Company is exposed to certain market risks, including the effects of
movements in foreign currency exchange rates. Forty percent of 2002 revenue was
derived from customers located outside the United States, particularly in
Europe. Fluctuations in the value of foreign currencies relative to the U.S.
Dollar directly impact our revenues. The Company uses derivative financial
instrument contracts to manage foreign exchange risks. The Company has
established a control environment that includes policies and procedures for risk
assessment and the approval, reporting and monitoring of derivative financial
instrument activities. Company policy prohibits holding or issuing derivative
financial instruments for trading purposes.

NET LOSS PER SHARE
Basic loss per share is computed by dividing net loss available to common
stockholders by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding for the
reporting period, after giving retroactive effect to stock splits. The effect of
stock options is not included in the calculation of diluted net loss per share
for the years ended December 31, 2002, 2001 and 2000, as the effect would be
anti-dilutive. Shares issuable upon the exercise of stock options that were
excluded from the calculation were 44 million, 38 million and 31 million in
2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively. As of December 31, 2002, the Company also has
98,400 shares of restricted stock, which vest in 2003 that have not been
included in the calculation of diluted net loss for the year ended December 31,
2002, as the effect would be anti-dilutive.
RECENTLY ISSUED ACCOUNTING STANDARDS
In June 2002, the FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards
No. 146, Accounting for Costs Associated with Exit or Disposal Activities, or
FAS 146. FAS 146 addresses financial accounting and reporting for costs
associated with exit or disposal activities and replaces Emerging Issues Task
Force Issue No. 94-3, Liability Recognition for Certain Employee Termination
Benefits and Other Costs to Exit an Activity including Certain Costs Incurred
in a Restructuring. FAS 146 requires a liability for a cost associated with an
exit or disposal activity to be recognized when incurred -- not when an entity
commits to an exit plan, as under Issue No. 94-3. The provisions of FAS 146 are
effective, on a prospective basis, for exit or disposal activities initiated by
companies after December 31, 2002.
In November 2002, the EITF reached a consensus on Issue No. 00-21, Revenue
Arrangements with Multiple Deliverables. EITF Issue No. 00-21 provides guidance
on how to account for arrangements that involve the delivery or performance of
multiple products, services and/or rights to use assets. The provisions of EITF
Issue No. 00-21 will apply to revenue arrangements entered into in fiscal
periods beginning after June 15, 2003. Pegasus is currently evaluating the
effect that the adoption of EITF Issue No. 00-21 will have on its results of
operations and financial condition.
In December 2002, the FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting
Standards No. 148, Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation -- Transition and
Disclosure, or FAS 148. FAS 148 amends FAS 123 Accounting For Stock-Based
Compensation to provide alternative methods of transitioning to a fair-value
method of accounting for stock-based compensation. FAS 148 also amends
disclosure requirements, regardless of the accounting method used for
stock-based compensation. The Company has complied with the disclosure
provisions of FAS 148. The Company is currently evaluating SFAS No. 148 to
determine if it will adopt SFAS No. 123 to account for employee stock options
using the fair value method and, if so, how to transition to that method.
2. RESTRUCTURE COSTS
During the years ended December 31, 2001 and 2000, the Company reorganized
its operations from a business unit structure into distinct functional areas,
consolidated its reservation centers outside of the United States and ceased
operations of its Business Intelligence division, resulting in restructuring
charges of $77 million and $34 million, respectively.

Total restructuring  $7,696  $3,421
Pegasus conducted a reorganization of its reportable segments by business
function in the third quarter of 2001, incurring $63 million of restructuring
charges. These charges included $39 million of severance and outplacement costs
and $24 million of redundant facilities and other costs. As a result of the
reorganization plan, Pegasus eliminated approximately 15 percent of its
workforce determined to be duplicative and consolidated certain facilities and
functions. The positions eliminated were primarily related to call center and
administrative functions and included both domestic and international locations.
The Company consolidated reservation centers outside the U.S. during the
fourth quarter of 2000 and the first and fourth quarters of 2001, incurring $16
million of restructuring charges. These charges included $821,000 of severance
costs and $771,000 of redundant facilities and other costs. As a result of the
reservation center consolidation, Pegasus eliminated approximately five percent
of its workforce determined to be duplicative and consolidated certain
facilities and functions.
Pegasus' business intelligence division ceased operations during the fourth
quarter of 2000, incurring $32 million of restructuring charges. These charges
included $221,000 of severance costs and $30 million to write-down goodwill and
other assets associated with business intelligence services. Approximately one
percent of the Company workforce was eliminated by the winding-down of these
services.
As of December 31, 2002, total unpaid costs were $517,000 and were
classified as accrued liabilities.
On February 4, 2003, the Company announced a strategic reorganization to
integrate its technology and hospitality divisions into one operating unit. The
integration plan, which includes the elimination of redundant positions and
consolidation of certain facilities, should be substantially completed during
the first half of 2003. The restructure will be accounted for under the
provisions of FAS 146 and Pegasus estimates restructure and asset impairment
costs ranging from $5 million to $6 million.

the sale of Summit, Sterling and Golden Tulip representation services -- see
Note 4.
A charge of $80 million was taken in 2000 to write off purchased IPR
projects. The value assigned to purchased IPR was determined by identifying
research projects in areas for which technological feasibility had not yet been
established. These projects included a customer reporting system and Corporate
Direct, a program for discounted corporate room rates on the Internet. The value
was determined by estimating the expected cash flows from the projects once
commercially viable, discounting the net cash flows back to their present value
and then applying a percentage of completion to the calculated value.
GLOBAL ENTERPRISE TECHNOLOGY SOLUTIONS, LLC
On September 1, 2001, Pegasus acquired the remaining 80 percent of the
outstanding common stock of GETS, a Tempe, Arizona-based provider of hotel
property management systems, for $115 million in cash. Pegasus acquired the
initial 20 percent interest on November 1, 2000 for $50 million in cash and
stock, which was accounted for under the equity method. The final purchase price
totaled $226 million and was comprised of   - $165 million in total cash and common stock exchanged in November 2000
and September 2001   - $60 million of software development costs funded by Pegasus prior to
acquisition, and
- $90,000 of acquisition costs.
The acquisition was accounted for under the purchase method of accounting.
Accordingly, GETS' results of operations subsequent to the acquisition date are
included in the Company consolidated financial statements. Allocation of the
purchase price to assets acquired and liabilities assumed was based upon an

Goodwill related to the 20 percent share of GETS acquired in November 2000 was
amortized through the September 2001 acquisition of the remaining 80 percent of
GETS and was included in equity in loss of investee.
At August 31, 2001, amortization included in equity in loss of investee
totaled $595,000. Pursuant to the issuance of FAS 141 and FAS 142, goodwill
obtained with the September 2001 GETS acquisition is not subject to
amortization.
4. SALE OF BUSINESS UNITS
SUMMIT AND STERLING HOTELS & RESORTS
On January 10, 2001, Pegasus sold its Summit Hotels & Resorts and Sterling
Hotels & Resorts brand businesses to IndeCorp Corporation IndeCorp for
approximately $12 million, including a $10 million promissory note and
scheduled future payments due upon member hotel contract renewals. The $10
million promissory note bears interest at Prime plus 2 percent annually and is
scheduled to mature on July 31, 2003, as amended.
In addition, IndeCorp signed a five-year technology services agreement and
a three-year hotel representation agreement with Pegasus. As part of the
agreements, Pegasus is the exclusive provider of reservation technology,
electronic reservation processing and commission processing services to the
IndeCorp brands, which includes all Preferred Hotels & Resorts, Summit Hotels &
Resorts and Sterling Hotels & Resorts member hotels.
On November 9, 2001, Pegasus and IndeCorp amended the original sale
agreement to provide for a $60 million promissory note that replaces the
scheduled future payments under the original agreement. The $60 million
promissory note requires monthly payments for a period of eight years commencing
July 1, 2002 and bears interest at 7 percent. In conjunction with amending the
original sale agreement, Pegasus also received from IndeCorp a $28 million
promissory note to replace existing outstanding trade receivables, and extended
the term of the existing technology services and hotel representation agreements
with IndeCorp for an additional 1 1/2 years. The $28 million promissory note
requires monthly payments for a period of eight years commencing July 1, 2002
and bears interest at 7 percent. During 2001, Pegasus recognized a $48 million
pre-tax gain on the sale of the Summit Hotels & Resorts and Sterling Hotels &
Resorts brands.
GOLDEN TULIP
On June 29, 2001, Pegasus sold its Golden Tulip brand and licensing
business to Madrid-based NH Hoteles NH for $20 million. As a result of this
transaction, Pegasus recognized a pre-tax gain of $749,000. In addition, NH
signed one-year agreements with Pegasus for reservation and Utell services. As
part of the agreements, Pegasus is the exclusive provider of reservations
technology, voice and electronic reservation processing and commission
processing services to all Golden Tulip Hotels and Tulip Inns.

7. DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS
To reduce the impact of changes in foreign exchange rates on consolidated
results of operations and future foreign currency denominated cash flows, the
Company was a party to various forward exchange contracts at December 31, 2002.
These contracts reduce exposure to currency movements affecting existing foreign
currency denominated assets and liabilities -- primarily trade receivables and
payables.

Pensions. Annually, commencing in 2003, the Company is obligated to make cash
payments to a trust associated with benefits earned under the Executive
Retirement Plan. The amounts funded to the trust may be available to creditors

In assessing the realizability of deferred tax assets, management considers

assets will not be realized. The ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is
dependent upon generation of future taxable income during the periods in which
those temporary

differences become deductible. Management considers the scheduled reversal of
deferred tax liabilities, projected future taxable income, and tax planning
strategies in making this assessment. The valuation allowance at December 31,
2002 and 2001 is related to various deferred tax assets established with the
acquisition of REZ. The valuation allowance, if released, will decrease
goodwill.
At December 31, 2002 and 2001, the Company had federal net operating loss
carryforwards of approximately $25 million and $35 million, respectively. United
Kingdom and other foreign net operating loss carryforwards for the respective

operating loss carryforwards that existed at December 31, 2002 will begin to
expire in 2019. The foreign net operating loss carryforwards that existed at
December 31, 2002 will begin to expire in 2004. Utilization of the net operating
loss carryforwards may be limited by the separate return loss year rules and
could be affected by ownership changes which have occurred or could occur in the
future.
The Company has not provided for foreign withholding taxes or United States
deferred income taxes on accumulated undistributed earnings of foreign
subsidiaries, as management does not intend to repatriate such earnings. If such
earnings were to be repatriated, such earnings could be subject to foreign
withholding tax and United States residual tax.

16. SEGMENT INFORMATION
As set forth in the criteria of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards
No. 131, Disclosures about Segments of an Enterprise and Related Information,
the Company is organized into two reportable segments -- technology and
hospitality.
The technology segment provides CRS, electronic distribution, commission
processing and property systems services to the global hotel industry. The
hospitality segment provides hotel representation services offered under the
Utell brand name. Hotel representation services offered under the Summit Hotels
& Resorts and Sterling Hotels & Resorts brand names were sold in January 2001,
while the Golden Tulip brand was sold in June 2001.
The Company is organized primarily on the basis of services provided. Prior
period segment information has been reclassified to conform to the current
period presentation. Segment data includes an allocation of all corporate costs
to the operating segments. Management evaluates the performance of its segments
based on earnings before interest, income tax, depreciation and amortization
EBITDA. The Company believes that EBITDA, which is widely used by analysts
and investors, is an appropriate measure of operating performance. Nevertheless,
this measure should not be considered in isolation of, or as a substitute for,
operating income, cash flows from operating activities or any other measure for
determining the Company operating performance or liquidity that is calculated
in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. In addition, the
Company calculation of EBITDA is not necessarily comparable to similarly
titled measures reported by other companies.
