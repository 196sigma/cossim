REPORT OF INDEPENDENT ACCOUNTANTS
To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of Lumisys Incorporated
In our opinion, the accompanying consolidated financial statements listed in the
accompanying index present fairly, in all material respects, the financial 
position of Lumisys Incorporated and its subsidiaries at December 31, 1997 
and 1996 and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of 
the three years in the period ended December 31, 1997, in conformity with 
generally accepted accounting principles. These financial statements are the 
responsibility of the Company management; our responsibility is to express an 
opinion on these statements based on our audits. We conducted our audits of 
these statements in accordance with generally accepted auditing standards which 
require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about 
whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit 
includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and 
disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles 
used and significant estimates made by management, and evaluating the overall 
financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a 
reasonable basis for the opinion expressed above. PRICE WATERHOUSE LLP

LUMISYS INCORPORATED
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
NOTE 1 - THE COMPANY AND SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
Lumisys Incorporated Lumisys or the Company designs, manufactures and 
markets an integrated suite of hardware and software products for digitizing, 
networking, archiving, routing and displaying medical images in a Picture 
Archiving and Communication Systems PACS and teleradiology environment. 
The Company offers laser and CCD X-ray film digitizers, video frame digitizers, 
and software to enable healthcare organizations to capture, store, distribute 
and display medical images over LANs and WANs. The Company commenced 
operations on February 4, 1987, and operates in one industry segment.
On November 25, 1997, the Company merged with CompuRAD, Inc. CompuRAD and 
was accounted for as a pooling-of-interests see Note 3. Accordingly, the 
consolidated historical financial statements for all periods presented combine 
the financial results of Lumisys and CompuRAD.
MANAGEMENT ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted 
accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions 
that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of 
contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and 
reported amounts of sales and expenses during the reporting period. Actual 
results could differ from those estimates.
PRINCIPLES OF CONSOLIDATION
The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and 
its wholly-owned subsidiaries. All significant intercompany transactions and 
balances have been eliminated.
REVENUE RECOGNITION
Revenues for hardware products are recognized when products are shipped. 
Revenues for software products and systems including hardware, software and 
installation are recognized after shipment and acceptance by the customer. 
Revenue from maintenance, service and support agreements is recognized over the 
term of the agreement which in most instances is one year. Revenue from post-
contract customer support is recognized in the period the customer support 
services are provided. Sales to international customers, primarily located in 
Europe, represented, 12%, 9% and 8% of total sales in 1997, 1996 and 1995, 
respectively. All transactions are denominated in U.S. dollars.
In October, 1997, the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants issued 
Statement of Position No. 97-2 SOP 97-2, Software Revenue Recognition, 
which the Company currently intends to adopt for transactions entered into after
January 1, 1998. SOP 97-2 provides guidance on recognizing revenue on software 
transactions and supersedes SOP 91-1. The Company believes that the adoption 
of SOP 97-2 will not have a significant impact on its current licensing or 
revenue recognition practices.
CASH EQUIVALENTS AND SHORT-TERM INVESTMENTS
The Company considers all debt instruments with maturities of three months or 
less when purchased to be cash equivalents. The Company generally invests its 
available cash in commercial paper and money market funds with several 
financial institutions.
The Company has categorized its short-term investments as available-for-sale. 
Unrealized gains or losses are recorded directly in stockholders' equity and 
have been insignificant for all periods presented. As of December 31, 1997, 
short-term investments consisted of marketable debt securities and its carrying 
value approximated cost. As of December 31, 1996, the Company did not have any 
short-term investments.
INVENTORIES
Inventories are stated at the lower of cost, determined using the first-in, 
first-out method, or market, and reserves are provided for obsolete, slow-
moving or unsaleable inventory.
PROPERTY AND EQUIPMENT
Property and equipment are stated at cost. Depreciation is provided using the 
straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the respective assets, 
generally three years. Leasehold improvements are amortized using the 
straight-line method over the lesser of the remaining lease terms or the 
estimated useful lives of the related assets.
RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT
Research and development costs are expensed as incurred.
SOFTWARE DEVELOPMENT COSTS
Software development costs are included in research and development and are 
expensed as incurred. Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 86 
SFAS 86 requires the capitalization of certain software development costs 
once technological feasibility is established. The capitalized cost is then 
amortized on a straight-line basis over the estimated product life, or on the 
ratio of current sales to total projected product sales, whichever method 
results in greater amortization. To date, the period between achieving 
technological feasibility, which the Company defines as the completion of a 
working model, and the general availability of such software has been short and 
software development costs qualifying for capitalization have been 
insignificant. 
WARRANTY
Upon product shipment, the Company provides for the estimated cost that may be 
incurred under its product warranties.
INCOME TAXES
A deferred income tax asset or liability is established for the expected future 
consequences resulting from differences between the financial reporting and 
income tax bases of assets and liabilities and from net operating loss and tax 
credit carryforwards. Valuation allowances are established when necessary to 
reduce deferred tax assets to the amounts, based on available evidence, which 
are expected to be realized.
CONCENTRATION OF CREDIT RISK
Financial instruments that potentially subject the Company to significant 
concentrations of credit risk consist primarily of cash, cash equivalents, 
short term investments and accounts receivable. The Company limits the amount 
of cash invested with any one financial institution. The Company trade 
accounts receivable are derived primarily from sales in the United States, 
Europe and the Far East. The Company credit policy is to require prepayment
of 50% of the purchase order prior to shipment on domestic sales and prepayment
of 100% or a letter of credit on foreign sales. Prepayments are generally made 
less than one week prior to shipment. The Company prepayment policy has not 
resulted in significant unearned revenue balances at the reported balance sheet
dates. The Company performs ongoing credit evaluations of its customers' 
financial condition and may modify its sales terms in certain circumstances 
based on these reviews. The Company maintains reserves for potential credit 
losses. Such losses have been insignificant for all periods presented.
In each of the years ended December 31, 1997, 1996 and 1995, no customers 
represented more than 10% of total sales of the Company.
STOCK COMPENSATION
The Company accounts for employee stock-based compensation in accordance with 
Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 25, Accounting for Stock Issued to 
Employees. In January 1996, the Company adopted the disclosure requirements of
SFAS No. 123 SFAS 123, Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation see Note 
5.
NET INCOME LOSS PER SHARE
The Company adopted SFAS No. 128 SFAS 128, Earnings Per Share. SFAS 128 
requires the presentation of basic and diluted earnings per share for companies 
with potentially dilutive securities, such as options. All historical earnings 
per share information has been restated as required by SFAS 128.
Basic earnings per share is computed by dividing income loss available to 
common shareholders by the weighted-average common shares outstanding for the 
period. Diluted earnings per share reflects the weighted-average common shares 
outstanding plus the potential effect of dilutive securities which are 
convertible to common shares such as options, warrants, convertible debt and 
preferred stock. 
The following is a reconciliation between the components of the basic and 
diluted net income loss per share calculations for the periods presented 
below in thousands                    Year ended December 31,
1997    1996    1995
Net income loss         $ 3,349  $ 2,815  $ 1,801
Weighted average shares 
outstanding - basic        10,080   9,598   6,714
Effect of dilutive securities:
Potential common stock
Stock options and warrants          162    522
Weighted average shares 
outstanding - diluted       10,080   9,760   7,236
Due to the net loss in 1997, all potential common stock outstanding is 
considered anti-dilutive and is excluded from the calculation of dilutive net 
income loss per share. Potential common stock outstanding as of December 31, 
1997 includes options to purchase 784,134 shares of common stock at an average 
exercise price of $379.
RECENTLY ISSUED ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENT
In June 1997, the Financial Accounting Standards Board FASB issued SFAS No. 
130 SFAS 130, Reporting Comprehensive Income. SFAS 130 establishes 
standards for reporting and display of comprehensive income and its components 
in a financial statement that is displayed with the same prominence as other 
financial statements for the periods beginning after December 15, 1997. 
Comprehensive income, as defined, includes all changes in equity net assets 
during a period from nonowner sources, including unrealized gains and losses on 
available-for-sale securities. Reclassification of financial statements for 
earlier periods for comparative purposes is required. The Company will adopt 
SFAS 130 beginning in 1998 and does not expect such adoption to have a material 
effect on its consolidated financial statements.
In June 1997, the FASB issued SFAS No. 131 SFAS 131, Disclosure about 
Segments of an Enterprise and Related Information. This statement establishes 
standards for the way companies report information about operating segments in 
annual financial statements for periods beginning after December 15, 1997. It 
also establishes standards for related disclosures about products and services, 
geographic areas, and major customers. It is not expected that adoption of 
SFAS 131 will have a material impact to the Company consolidated financial 
statements.

NOTE 3 - MERGER AND ACQUISITIONS
COMPURAD
On November 25, 1997, the Company merged with CompuRAD, a provider of software
that enables healthcare clinicians to access medical images and clinical 
information at any point of care. Under the terms of the merger agreement, 
CompuRAD stockholders received 0928 of a share of the Company common stock
for each outstanding share of CompuRAD common stock, resulting in the Company
issuing approximately 37 million shares, valued at approximately $234 million
based upon the closing price of the Company common stock on November 25, 1997.
Additionally, outstanding options to acquire CompuRAD common stock were replaced
with options to acquire approximately 379,000 shares of the Company common 
stock. The transaction has been accounted for using the pooling-of-interests
method of accounting and, therefore, all periods have been restated to include
the operations of CompuRAD as if the companies had been consolidated for all 
periods presented.
In connection with the merger, the Company recorded merger and related costs 
during the fourth quarter totaling $42 million. Included in this charge were 
provisions for merger transaction costs of $15 million, asset write-downs of 
$13 million, employee severance and termination benefits of $04 million, 
costs to combine and integrate operations of $08 million and other merger 
related costs of $02 million. Of the $29 million in merger and related costs 
which were accrued at the time of the merger, approximately $08 million has 
been incurred at December 31, 1997.

acquisition included in the Company consolidated statements of operations are

IMAGRAPH CORPORATION
On March 31, 1995, the Company purchased all the outstanding shares of Imagraph 
Corporation Imagraph, a developer and manufacturer of advanced graphics 
controllers and frame grabbers, in exchange for $1,800,000 in cash and 36,845 
shares of Series C mandatorily redeemable convertible Preferred Stock. The 
transaction was accounted for as a purchase; accordingly, the purchase price 
was allocated to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based upon their 
estimated fair market values at the date of the acquisition. The in-process 
research and development represents the estimated current fair market value, 
using a risk-adjusted income approach, of specifically identified technologies 
which had not reached technological feasibility and had no alternative future 
uses. The purchased technology met the technological feasibility criteria for 
capitalization and estimated current fair market value was determined using a 
risk-adjusted income approach. The results of Imagraph are included in the 
Company operations commencing from the date of acquisition. The allocation 
of the purchase price, which is based principally on an independent appraisal, 
is as follows in thousands         Accounts receivable         $ 855

X-RAY SCANNER CORPORATION
On March 2, 1995, the Company purchased all the outstanding shares of X-ray 
Scanner Corporation XRS, a developer and manufacturer of medical film 
scanning digitizers, in exchange for $200,000 in cash, 15,058 shares of the 
Company Common Stock and $10,000 in acquisition expenses. The transaction 
was accounted for using the purchase method; accordingly, the purchase price 
was allocated to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based upon their

Management believes that the available objective evidence, including the recent 
acquisitions made by the Company and the necessary expenditures for research 
and development and for marketing in the high technology segment it pursues, 
creates uncertainty regarding the attainment of sufficient profitability to 
realize the deferred tax assets and therefore a partial valuation allowance has 
been recorded. At December 31, 1997, the Company had net operating loss carry-forwards, as the 
result of the acquisition of Imagraph and the merger with CompuRAD, available 
to reduce income taxes for federal and state income tax purposes of 
approximately $32 million and $20 million, respectively; such carry-forwards 
expire through 2012. As a result of an ownership change and consolidated return
rules, the utilization of such carryforwards is limited.
NOTE 5 - COMMON STOCK AND STOCK PLANS
CERTAIN EQUITY TRANSACTIONS
In conjunction with an initial public offering of the Company Common Stock 
the Offering in 1995, all outstanding shares of mandatorily redeemable 
convertible Preferred Stock automatically converted into Common Stock upon the 
closing of the Offering.
In September and October 1995, the Company Board of Directors authorized, and 
the stockholders approved, the reincorporation of the Company in Delaware and 
the associated exchange of four shares of Common Stock and four shares of 
mandatorily redeemable convertible Preferred Stock into one share of each 
corresponding class and series of stock of the Delaware successor resulting in 
a one-for-four reverse stock split of the Company Common and Preferred 
Stock. All applicable share and per share amounts of Common and Preferred 
Stock have been retroactively adjusted to reflect this reverse stock split. 
Effective upon the closing of the Offering, the Company was authorized to issue 
25,000,000 shares of Common Stock and 5,000,000 shares of undesignated 
Preferred Stock and the Board of Directors have the authority to issue the 
undesignated Preferred Stock in one or more series and to fix the rights, 
preferences, privileges and restrictions thereof.
STOCK PLANS
The Company initially reserved 45,000 shares of Common Stock for issuance under 
its 1987 Stock Option Plan the 1987 Plan. During 1990, the Board of 
Directors authorized an additional 580,000 shares to be reserved for issuance 
and during each of the years ended December 31, 1992, 1994 and 1995, the Board 
of Directors authorized an additional 250,000 shares to be reserved for 
issuance. The 1987 Plan provides for the grant of incentive stock options and 
nonstatutory stock options designated Supplemental Stock. Incentive stock 
options are available for employees, officers and employee directors and are 
granted at exercise prices which are not less than 100% of fair market value on 
the date of the grant. Supplemental Stock is available for employees, 
officers, consultants and directors and is granted at exercise prices not less 
than 85% of fair market value on the date of grant. All options are to have a 
term not greater than ten years from the date of grant. The Board shall 
determine the number of shares for which an option can be granted. Options 
granted generally vest 25 percent after one year and then ratably at 625 
percent per quarter over a three year period. In 1995 the Board granted 
options for 299,838 shares of Common Stock.
In September 1995, the Board of Directors determined that no additional options 
would be granted under the 1987 Plan and adopted the 1995 Stock Option Plan 
the 1995 Plan under which an aggregate of 350,000 shares of Common Stock 
have been reserved for issuance upon exercise of options granted to employees, 
officers and employee directors of and consultants to the Company. The 1995 
Plan will terminate in September 2005, unless terminated earlier by the Board 
of Directors. In each of the years 1997, 1996 and 1995 the Board granted 
options for 42,550, 153,225 and 75,400 shares of Common Stock, respectively.
The 1995 Plan provides for the grant of both incentive stock options and 
nonstatutory stock options designated Supplemental Stock. The maximum term 
of options granted under the 1995 Plan is ten years. The exercise price of 
incentive stock options granted under the 1995 Plan must equal at least the 
fair value of the Company Common Stock on the date of grant. The exercise 
price of Supplemental Stock options under the Plan must equal at least 85% of 
the fair market value of the Company Common Stock on the date of grant. The 
exercise price of options granted to any person who at the time of grant owns 
stock possessing more than 10% of the total combined voting power of all 
classes of stock must be at least 110% of the fair market value of such stock 
on the date of grant and the terms of these options cannot exceed five years. 
The Board shall determine the number of shares for which an option can be 
granted. Options granted under the 1995 Plan will generally vest 25 percent 
after one year and then ratably at 625 percent per quarter over a three year 
period.
Under certain events, the Company has the right to repurchase, at the original 
issue price, a declining percentage of certain of the common shares issued to 
employees under written agreements with such employees. The Company right to 
repurchase such stock declines on a percentage basis based on the length of the 
employees' continuous employment with the Company. At December 31, 1997, 71 
shares of Common Stock were subject to repurchase by the Company.
The Company has recorded compensation expense for the difference between the 
grant price and the deemed fair market value of the Company Common Stock for 
options granted in March 1995. Such compensation expense was approximately 
$15,000, $37,000 and $33,000 for the years ended December 31, 1997, 1996 and 
1995, respectively. During 1996, forfeited options resulted in a reduction of 
$69,000 from the maximum aggregated compensation expense to approximately 
$104,000 over the vesting period of four years.
In August 1995, the Board adopted the 1995 Non-Employee Directors Stock Option 
Plan the Directors Plan, which provided for the automatic grant of options 
to purchase shares of Common Stock to non-employee directors of the Company. 
The Directors Plan will be administered by the Board.
The maximum number of shares of Common Stock that may be issued pursuant to 
options granted under the Directors Plan is 112,500. Pursuant to the terms of 
the Directors Plan, each person who is elected as a director of the Company or 
a compensated Chairman of the Board a Non-Employee Director will 
automatically be granted an option to purchase 18,750 shares of Common Stock on 
the date of his or her election to the Board. On the date of adoption of the 
Directors Plan, each person who was then a Non-Employee Director of the Company 
and who had not received within the one-year period prior to adoption of the 
Directors Plan either an option grant or other right to purchase shares of 
Common Stock, was granted an option to purchase 18,750 shares of Common Stock 
under the Directors Plan. Thereafter, each Non-Employee Director will 
automatically be granted an option to purchase an additional 18,750 shares of 
Common Stock under the Directors Plan on the date any and all previous options 
or stock purchases by such person either under the Directors Plan or otherwise 
become fully vested. Options granted under the Directors Plan will vest 25 
percent after one year and then ratably at 625 percent per quarter thereafter 
over a three year period.
No options granted under the Directors Plan may be exercised later than ten 
years from the date of grant. The exercise price of options under the 
Directors Plan must be equal to the fair market value of the Common Stock on 
the date of grant. Options granted under the Directors Plan are generally 
nontransferable. The Directors Plan will terminate August 2005 unless 
terminated earlier by the Board.
Pursuant to the Directors Plan, in May and November 1997 each of two Non-
Employee Directors were granted options to purchase 18,750 shares of Common 
Stock at exercises prices of $663 and $631 per share, respectively. No 
options were granted pursuant to the Directors Plan in 1996 and in August 1995, 
each of two Non-Employee Directors were granted options to purchase 18,750 
shares of Common Stock at exercises prices of $600 per share.
In November 1997, in connection with the acquisition of CompuRAD, the Company 
assumed the stock option plans of CompuRAD. The options for shares outstanding 
were converted to options to purchase 379,017 shares of Common Stock of the 
Company. CompuRAD had a non-qualified stock option plan under which options 
for 69,600 and 851,208 shares of common stock were granted in 1996 and 1995, 
respectively. In July 1996, the Board of Directors of CompuRAD adopted the 
1996 Stock Plan the 1996 Plan, reserving 371,200 shares for issuance 
thereunder. Under the 1996 Plan, options for 322,429 and 0 shares of common 
stock were granted in 1997 and 1996, respectively. No additional options will 
be granted under the CompuRAD plans.

Employee Stock Purchase Plan
In September 1995, the Company Board of Directors approved the 1995 Employee 
Stock Purchase Plan the Purchase Plan and reserved 150,000 shares of Common 
Stock for issuance to eligible employees. The Purchase Plan permits eligible 
employees to purchase Common Stock through periodic payroll deductions of up to 
10% of their annual compensation. Each offering period will have a duration of 
12 months and shares of Common Stock will be purchased for each participant at 
semi-annual intervals during each offering period. The price at which the 
Common Stock is purchased under the Purchase Plan is equal to 85 percent of the 
lower of the fair value on the commencement date of each offering period or the 
semi-annual purchase date. As of December 31, 1997, 52,263 shares had been 
issued under the Purchase Plan.
FAIR VALUE DISCLOSURE
At December 31, 1997, the Company has three stock-based compensation plans, as 
described above. The Company has elected to continue to apply APB Opinion 25 
and related Interpretations in accounting for its plans. Accordingly, no 
compensation cost has been recognized for its fixed stock option plans and its 
stock purchase plan. Had compensation cost for the Company three stock-based 
compensation plans been determined based on the fair value at the grant dates 
for awards under those plans consistent with the method of SFAS 123, the 
Company net income loss and net income loss per share would have been 
reduced to the pro forma amounts indicated below in thousands, except per 
share amounts                          Year ended December 31,

The fair value of each option is estimated on the date of grant using the 
Black-Scholes option-valuation model with the following weighted-average 
assumptions used for grants in 1997, 1996 and 1995, respectively: dividend 
yield of 0 percent for all years; expected volatility of 660, 578 and 598 
percent, risk-free interest rates of 627, 601 and 626 percent; and expected 
lives of 6 years for 1997 and 3 years for non-officer/director and 5 years for 
officers and directors for 1996 and 1995. 
The fair value of the employees' purchase rights under the Purchase Plan, which 
is described above, was estimated using the Black-Scholes option-valuation 
model with the following assumptions for 1997, 1996 and 1995, respectively: 
dividend yield of 0 percent for all years; an expected life of 1 year for all
years; expected volatility of 66, 59 and 56 percent; and risk-free interest 
rates of 566, 552 and 596 percent. The weighted-average fair value of
purchase rights granted in 1997 was $395 per share and in both 1996 and 1995 
was $274 per share. 
WARRANT
Warrants for the purchase of 92,800 shares of Common Stock were outstanding at 
December 31 1996, with exercise prices of $720 per share. These warrants are 
currently exercisable, will terminate in August 2001, and may be exercised on a 
net basis.
NOTE 6 - RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS
During May 1994, the Company made loans totaling $275,000 to certain executives 
and directors pursuant to the Company 1987 Stock Option Plan. The loans were 
secured by 458,500 shares of the Company Common Stock. The loans bear 
interest at the lesser of 494 percent per annum or the maximum rate 
permissible by law. Accrued interest is payable annually in arrears. The 
loans were due and paid in full on May 31, 1997. Notes receivable in the 
amount of $114,000 deducted from stockholders' equity at December 31, 1996, 
include loan balances plus accrued interest.
During 1995, the Company made a loan totaling $125,000 to an employee of the 
Company. The loan bears interest at 796 percent per annum and is payable at a 
rate of $25,000 plus accrued interest annually commencing March 1, 1996. In 
addition, the Company has entered into a non-competition agreement with the 
same employee at a rate of $25,000 per year over a five year period commencing 
March 1, 1995.
The	Company president was, and certain of the Company stockholders are, 
stockholders of Arizona State Radiology ASR. Certain technology was 
transferred to CompuRAD at its inception by ASR. The terms and amount to be 
paid to ASR for such technology were subject to negotiations between the 
parties, which were finalized in July 1996. The final settlement, which is 
reflected in the accompanying consolidated financial statements as if it had 
occurred on January 1, 1993, called for CompuRAD to pay ASR a settlement 
consisting of common stock, a note payable, and a deferred payment of $541,676 
due either in cash or stock. The technology was valued at $610,000, based on 
the value of consideration given, and was amortized over a three-year period 
beginning January 1, 1993. The technology is fully amortized on the 
accompanying consolidated balance sheets. CompuRAD issued 86,749 and 32,226 
shares of stock to ASR in November 1996 and September 1997 in full settlement of
the deferred payment. The note payable consists of a $250,000 unsecured, non-
interest bearing note which is payable on December 31, 2002. Original issue

1999     690
2000     699
2001     446
2002     130
$2,656
Total rent expense was approximately $608,000, $485,000 and $358,000 for 1997, 
1996 and 1995, respectively.
On July 9, 1997 and July 10, 1997, two class action complaints were filed in 
the Superior Court of the State of California, County of Santa Clara, and the 
U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California, respectively, 
against the Company, several of its current and former officers and directors, 
and its underwriters. The complaints are brought on behalf of all persons who 
purchased the Company Common Stock during the putative class period, November 
15, 1995 to July 11, 1996. The complaints allege that, during the class 
period, defendants made material misstatements and omitted to disclose material 
information concerning the Company actual and expected performance and 
results, causing the price of the Company Common Stock to be artificially 
inflated. The federal complaint alleges claims under Sections 10b and 20a 
of the Exchange Act, and SEC Rule 10b-5 promulgated thereunder; the state 
complaint alleges claims under California state law. Neither the federal nor 
the state complaint specifies the amount of damages sought. The Company and 
the other defendants vigorously deny all allegations of wrongdoing and intend 
to defend themselves aggressively. On January 9, 1998, the Santa Clara 
Superior Court dismissed the State complaint in part with prejudice and in part 
with leave to amend. Plaintiff has filed an amended complaint in State court 
and on March 23, 1998, defendants filed a demurer to the amended complaint. On 
March 6, 1998, the federal court dismissed the federal complaint with leave to 
amend. There can be no assurance that the Company will prevail in these actions
or that the plaintiffs will not recover damages.
On July 18, 1997, a third-party filed a complaint in Santa Clara Superior Court 
against the Company and one of its officers. The complaint contains causes of 
action for liable, defamation, negligent infliction of emotional distress and 
punitive damages. The Company and the other defendant vigorously deny all 
allegations of wrongdoing and intend to defend themselves aggressively.
