REPORT OF ERNST YOUNG LLP, INDEPENDENT AUDITORS  The Board of Directors and Stockholders CyberSource Corporation  We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of CyberSource Corporation as of December 31, 2003 and 2002,
and the related consolidated statements of operations, stockholders equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2003. Our audits also included the financial statement schedule listed in the Index at a2. These financial statements and schedule are the responsibility of the Companys management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements and schedule based on our audits.  We conducted our audits in accordance with auditing standards generally
accepted in the United States. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence
supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We
believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.  In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated financial position of CyberSource Corporation at December 31, 2003 and 2002, and the consolidated results of its
operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2003, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. Also, in our opinion, the related financial statement schedule, when
considered in relation to the basic financial statements taken as a whole, presents fairly in all material respects the information set forth therein.  /s/ ERNST YOUNG LLP  Palo Alto, California January 16, 2004

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  1.
Summary of Significant Accounting Policies  The Company  CyberSource Corporation the Company or CyberSource provides secure electronic payment and risk management solutions to
organizations that process orders for goods and services over the Internet. CyberSources payment solutions allow eCommerce merchants to accept a wide range of online payment options, from credit cards and electronic checks, to global payment
options and new emerging payment types. CyberSources risk and compliance management tools address issues such as credit card fraud, online tax requirements and export controls. CyberSources reporting and management tools help automate
the flow of complex eCommerce processes, such as recurring billing and payment reconciliation. CyberSource partners with and connects to a large network of payment processors and other payment service providers, to offer merchants a single source
solution.  Basis of Presentation  The accompanying consolidated financial statements reflect the financial
position and results of operations of the Company and its wholly owned subsidiaries. All intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated. Certain amounts in the prior years financial statements have been reclassified to conform
with the current years presentation.  Foreign Currency Translation
The financial statements of the Companys non-U.S.
subsidiary are translated into U.S. dollars in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 52, Foreign Currency Translation. Assets and liabilities of the Companys subsidiary are translated at the rates of
exchange at the end of the period. Revenues and expenses are translated using the average exchange rates in effect during the period. Foreign currency translation adjustments are recorded in other comprehensive income loss. Gains and losses
realized from foreign currency transactions denominated in currencies other than the subsidiarys functional currency were not material through December 31, 2003.  Use of Estimates  The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions
that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements as well as the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual
results could differ from those estimates.  Revenue Recognition
The Company recognizes revenue in accordance with SEC
Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 101, Revenue Recognition in Financial Statements SAB 101 and Statement of Position 97-2, Software Revenue Recognition SOP 97-2, as amended. SAB 101 and SOP 97-2
require that four basic criteria must be met before revenue can be recognized: 1 persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists; 2 delivery has occurred or services rendered; 3 the fee is fixed and determinable; and 4 collectibility is
reasonably assured. Determination of criteria 4 is based on managements judgments regarding the collectibility of those fees.  The Company derives its revenues from monthly commerce transaction processing fees, support service fees, professional services and the sale of enterprise
software licenses and related maintenance. Transaction revenues are recognized in the period in which the transactions occur. Professional services revenue and support service fees are recognized as the related services are provided and costs are
incurred. In accordance with SOP 97-2 as amended, the Company had recognized enterprise software license and maintenance revenue when all elements of a contract had been delivered. For the periods through September 30, 2002, for enterprise software
arrangements where maintenance was the only undelivered element, the Company had recognized the entire contract ratably over the term of the maintenance period as vendor-specific objective evidence VSOE of fair value for license or
maintenance revenue had not been established. Beginning in the fourth quarter of 2002, the Company changed its maintenance pricing and established VSOE of fair value for new maintenance arrangements. As a result of establishing VSOE of fair value
for maintenance revenue effective October 1, 2002, the Company is utilizing the residual method of accounting as permitted by Statement of Position 98-9 SOP 98-9 and therefore recognizes software license revenue in the period in which
the contract is signed, the software is delivered and the fee is collectible. 
32 Table of Contents CYBERSOURCE CORPORATION  NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTSContinued 
The Company derives a significant portion of its professional services revenue from fixed-price
contracts, which require the accurate estimation of the cost, scope and duration of each engagement. Revenue and the related costs for these projects are recognized using the percentage-of-completion method. Estimates are made regarding percent
complete based on original hours budgeted and projected hours to complete the projects and revisions to estimates are reflected in the period in which changes become known. The Company has not had significant losses on professional services
engagements to date.  Provisions are provided for sales returns
and are based on historical experience and other known factors. For the years ended December 31, 2003 and 2002, no customer accounted for more than 10% of total revenues. For the year ended December 31, 2001, one customer accounted for 10% of
revenues.  Cash, Cash Equivalents and Short-Term Investments 
The Company considers all highly liquid investments with an original
maturity from the date of purchase of three months or less to be cash equivalents. As of December 31, 2003 and 2002, cash equivalents consist primarily of investments in money market funds, government bonds and commercial paper.  Short-term investments are classified as available-for-sale and are carried
at fair market value. Short-term investments are primarily composed of government and corporate bonds with an original maturity greater than three months and less than one year. The carrying amounts of the Companys short-term investments
approximate fair market value due to the short-term nature of these instruments. Cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments consist of the following as of December 31, 2003 and 2002 in thousands:  CarryingValue atDecember31, 2003

Unrealized losses on short-term investments, which represent the difference between the fair market
value and the amortized cost, were $15,000 as of December 31, 2003 and $0 as of December 31, 2002. There were no realized gains or losses from the sale of short-term investments during fiscal 2003, 2002 or 2001.  Concentration of Credit Risk  Financial instruments that potentially subject the Company and its
subsidiaries to concentrations of credit risk consist principally of cash, cash equivalents, short-term investments and accounts receivable.  Cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments are invested in major financial institutions in the United States. Such deposits may be in excess of
insured limits and are not insured in other jurisdictions. Management believes that the financial institutions that hold the Companys investments are financially sound and, accordingly, minimal credit risk exists with respect to these
investments.  The accounts receivable of the Company and its
subsidiaries are derived from sales to customers located primarily in the United States and Europe. The Company performs ongoing credit evaluations of its customers.  An allowance for doubtful accounts is determined with respect to those amounts that the Company has determined to be
doubtful of collection. At December 31, 2003 and 2002, no customer accounted for 10% or more of the Companys accounts receivable balance. At December 31, 2003 and 2002, accounts receivable due from foreign customers were 15% and 13 respectively. The Company generally does not require collateral.  The Company has no off-balance-sheet concentration of credit risk such as foreign exchange contracts, option contracts or other hedging arrangements. 
Property and Equipment  Property and equipment are stated at cost and are depreciated on a straight-line basis over estimated useful lives of three years. Leasehold improvements
are amortized on a straight-line basis over the shorter of the lease terms or the estimated useful lives.  Property and equipment consist of the following in thousands:  December 31 2003
2002
Computer equipment and software 20,565 20,432
Furniture and fixtures 1,840 1,826
Office equipment 1,375 1,309
Leasehold improvements 2,724 2,555 26,504 26,122
Less accumulated depreciation and amortization 24,309 20,706 2,195 5,416  Asset Impairment  The Company periodically assesses the carrying value of its long-lived
assets, including goodwill and other intangible assets, and recognizes impairment losses if it determines that the carrying values are not recoverable. In November 2001, the Company evaluated the carrying value of its goodwill and other intangible
assets under the guidance of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 121, Accounting for the Impairment of Long-Lived Assets SFAS 121. The Company concluded that the goodwill and other intangible assets recorded as
a result of its acquisition of PaylinX were impaired. As a result, the Company recorded a $914 million write-off of goodwill and other intangible assets see Note 6.

In accordance with the adoption of Statement of Financial Accounting Standard No. 142 Goodwill
and Other Intangible Assets SFAS 142, the following financial information reflects consolidated results adjusted as though the accounting for goodwill and other intangible assets was consistent in all comparable annual periods
presented in thousands, except per share data:  Years Ended December 31 2003 2002 2001 Reported net loss 5,442 12,514 185,047 Add back goodwill amortization 34,976 Adjusted net loss 5,442 12,514 150,071 Adjusted basic and diluted net loss per share Reported basic and diluted net loss per share 017 038 538 Add back goodwill amortization 102 Adjusted basic and diluted net loss per share 017 038 436 Weighted average number of shares used in computing basic and diluted net loss and adjusted net loss per share 32,860 32,900 34,370  Product Development 
Product development expenditures are charged to operations as incurred.
SFAS No. 86, Accounting for the Costs of Computer Software to be Sold, Leased or Otherwise Marketed, requires capitalization of certain software development costs subsequent to the establishment of technological feasibility. Based on the
Companys product development process, technological feasibility is established upon the completion of a working model. To date, costs incurred by the Company between the completion of the working model and the point at which the product is
ready for general release have been insignificant. Accordingly, the Company has charged all such costs to product development expense in the period incurred.  Advertising Expense  The cost of advertising is recorded as an expense when incurred. Advertising costs were approximately $02 million, $05 million and $01 million during
the years ended December 31, 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively.  Accounting
for Stock-Based Compensation  In December 2002, the FASB
issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 148, Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation Transition and Disclosure SFAS 148. SFAS 148 amends Statement of Financial Accounting Standards 123,
Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation, SFAS 123 to provide alternative methods of transition to the fair value method of accounting for stock-based employee compensation. In addition, SFAS 148 requires disclosure of the
effects of an entitys accounting policy with respect to stock-based employee compensation on reported net income and earnings per share in annual and interim financial statements. As permitted under SFAS 148, the Company adopted the disclosure
only provisions and has continued to follow the intrinsic value method of accounting for employee stock options in accordance with Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 25 Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees. Accordingly,
no compensation has been recognized for the Companys stock-based compensation. If compensation expense for the Companys stock-based compensation had been determined based on the fair value of the stock grants, our net loss and net loss
per share would have been the pro forma amounts indicated below in thousands, except per share amounts:  Years Ended December 31 2003 2002 2001 Net loss, as reported 5,442 12,514 185,047 Stock-based employee compensation expense included in reported net loss 2,511 Total stock-based employee compensation expense determined under fair value based methods for all awards 6,206 8,271 17,141 Pro forma net loss 11,648 20,785 199,677 Basic and diluted net loss per share, as reported 017 038 538 Pro forma basic and diluted net loss per share 035 063 581 
35 Table of Contents CYBERSOURCE CORPORATION  NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTSContinued 
The fair value for these options was estimated at the date of grant using the Black-Scholes valuation
model in 2003, 2002 and 2001 with the following weighted average assumptions:  YearsEndedDecember31 2003 2002 2001 Stock options Risk-free interest rate
297 382 430 Dividend yield Volatility
059 069 136 Expected life years
4 4 4 Employee stock purchase plan shares Risk-free interest rate
108 172 430 Dividend yield Volatility
059 069 136 Expected life months
6 6 6
The weighted average
fair value of options granted, which is the value assigned to the options under SFAS 123, was $116, $106 and $117 per share for options granted during 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively. The weighted average fair value assigned to shares granted
under the employee stock purchase plan under SFAS 123, was $074, $047 and $327 per share during 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively.  The Company applies SFAS 123 and EITF 96-18 Accounting for Equity Instruments that are Issued to Other than Employees for Acquiring, or in
Conjunction with Selling, Goods or Services with respect to options issued to non-employees. SFAS 123 requires use of an option valuation model to measure the fair value of the options at the grant date.  Net Loss Per Share  In accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 128, Earnings Per Share, basic and diluted
net loss per share has been computed using the weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding during the period. Potentially dilutive securities have been excluded from the computation as their effect is antidilutive.  If the Company had reported net income for the years ended December 31, 2003,
2002 and 2001, diluted earnings per share would have included the shares used in the computation of net loss per share as well as additional common equivalent shares related to outstanding options to purchase approximately 1,699,481, 1,079,777 and
463,102 shares of common stock, respectively The common equivalent shares from options and warrants would be determined on a weighted average basis using the treasury stock method. The common equivalent shares related to the convertible note payable
would be determined on a weighted average basis using the as-if converted method.  Income Taxes  Income
taxes are calculated under the provisions of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 109, Accounting for Income Taxes SFAS 109. Under SFAS 109, the liability method is used in accounting for income taxes, which
includes the effects of temporary differences between financial and taxable amounts of assets and liabilities.  Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income Loss  The Companys comprehensive income loss consists of its net loss and other comprehensive income loss, including unrealized gains or losses on available for sale securities and foreign currency translation
gains or losses.  New Accounting Pronouncements  In January 2003, the FASB issued Interpretation No. 46 FIN 46,
Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities. FIN 46 requires that if an entity has a controlling financial interest in a variable interest entity, the assets, liabilities and results of activities of the variable interest entity should
be included in the consolidated financial statements of the entity. FIN 46 requires that its provisions are effective immediately for all arrangements entered into after January 31, 2003. For those arrangements entered into prior to January 31,
2003, the provisions of FIN 46 are effective in the first interim or annual period ending after December 31, 2003. The Company has determined that it does not have any variable interest entities created before or after January 31, 2003 and that FIN
46 will not have a significant impact on its consolidated balance sheet and results of operations.

Strategic Alliance  In June 2002, the Company entered into an Original Equipment Manufacturer agreement OEM Agreement with Miva Corporation Miva,
a privately-held provider of eCommerce software and services to small and medium-sized businesses. Under the terms of the OEM Agreement, the Companys transaction processing services are being resold to the customers of Miva. Revenue generated
under the OEM Agreement is being shared equally between the Company and Miva, after certain costs associated with delivering such services have been reimbursed to both parties, and is being recognized on a cash basis.  In conjunction with the OEM Agreement, the Company and Miva also entered into
a loan agreement whereby the Company provided an initial loan to Miva of $03 million in June 2002 and an additional loan of $03 million in August 2002 pursuant to a promissory note. Mivas share of revenue under the OEM Agreement must first
be used to repay the indebtedness outstanding under the loan. Any remaining principal and accrued interest is payable in full in June 2004. The loan accrues interest at an annual rate of 5% and is secured by substantially all of Mivas assets.
The Company recognized interest income related to the loan on a cash basis. In conjunction with the loan agreement, the Company also received a warrant to purchase 680,550 shares of the Mivas common stock at an exercise price of $028 per
share. The warrant is fully vested, expires in June 2004 and has been assessed a value of approximately $95,000 using the Black-Scholes valuation model.  In December 2003, Miva was acquired by a third party, FindWhat.com. As a result, the Company waived its right to the warrant and wrote-off the value
associated with the warrant accordingly. The principal and accrued interest on the loan have been classified as other current assets in the Companys consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2003.  In January 2004, subsequent to the balance sheet date, the Company received
payment in full from Miva of all principal and accrued interest on the outstanding loan classified as other current assets in the Companys consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2003.  3.

Investment in Joint Venture  On March 1, 2000, the Company entered into a joint venture agreement with Japanese partners Marubeni Corporation and Trans-Cosmos, Inc. to establish
CyberSource K.K. to provide commerce transaction services to the Japanese market. The Company will maintain a majority controlling interest in CyberSource K.K., subject to certain veto rights granted to the partners, which expire when CyberSource

Restructuring and Other Non-recurring Charges  During the years ended December 31, 2003, 2002 and 2001, the Company recorded non-recurring restructuring charges totaling $05 million, $25 million and
$1047 million, respectively, as summarized below:  December 31 2003

Other non-recurring charges 131 620 Total restructuring and other non-recurring charges 467 2,473 104,661  In November 2001, the
Company completed an analysis under SFAS 121 to determine if its goodwill and other intangible assets recorded in September 2000 related to its acquisition of PaylinX Corporation were impaired. The Company concluded that certain events and changes
in circumstances, including a decrease in its market capitalization during fiscal 2001 and a decline in the estimated future growth of the enterprise payment software market, were indicators of impairment of the remaining goodwill and other
intangible assets. Due to these indicators of impairment, the Company performed an analysis of future undiscounted cash flows to determine the recoverability of the goodwill and other intangible assets. Based on its analysis, the Company recorded a
$914 million non-cash write-off of the goodwill and other intangible assets.  The Company also recorded restructuring charges of approximately $04 million, $03 million and $65 million in 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively, related to the reduction of its workforce worldwide to realign its
resources to better manage and control the business. During 2003, the Company reduced its workforce by 11 employees of which 8 were in sales and marketing; 2 were in product development; and 1 was in operations. During 2002, the Company reduced its
workforce by 12 employees of which 8 were in sales and marketing; 3 were in product development; and 1 was in general and administrative services. During 2001, the Company reduced its workforce by 270 employees of which 103 were in sales and
marketing; 55 were in product development; 83 were in operations and customer support; and 29 were in general and administrative services. As of December 31, 2003, all amounts related to severance and benefits had been paid.

The Company also recorded facility-related restructuring charges of approximately $01 million, $20
million and $62 million in 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively. During 2001, the Company closed its St. Louis, Missouri facility, exited certain under-utilized space in its Mountain View, California and Austin, Texas facilities and consolidated its
data centers. Included in the $62 million charge in 2001 was $35 million related to future lease payments for the Companys St. Louis, Missouri facility, as well as future lease payments, net of estimated sublease income, for the exited
Mountain View, California space. Also, included in the $62 million was $27 million related to the impairment of excess property and equipment and leasehold improvements primarily resulting from the exiting of the above facilities. During 2002, the
Company reassessed its initial estimate of future sublease income and the related sublease timeline associated with subleasing excess leased facilities. The reassessment was prompted by a further decline in the real estate market in the cities where
those facilities are located. After considering information provided to the Company by its real estate advisors, the Company concluded it was probable these facilities could not be subleased at rates originally considered nor could they be subleased
in the timeframe originally planned. As a result, the Company recorded an additional charge of $20 million relating to the facilities located in Mountain View, California and Austin, Texas. The additional charge considered current lease rates for
similar facilities as well as costs associated with the estimated added holding period through December 2003. During 2003, the Company again reassessed its revised estimate of future sublease income and the related sublease timeline associated with
subleasing excess leased facilities. After considering information provided to the Company by its real estate advisors, the Company concluded it was probable these facilities could not be subleased in the timeframe assumed in December 2002. As a
result, the Company recorded an additional charge of $03 million relating to the facilities located in Mountain View, California and Austin, Texas. The additional charge considers current lease rates for similar facilities as well as costs
associated with the estimated added holding period through December 2004. Also during 2003, the Company was able to sublease a portion of its St. Louis, Missouri facility and recorded a recovery of $02 million. As of December 31, 2003, $24 million
related to facility-related restructuring charges was included in accrued restructuring related expenses and will be paid over the respective remaining lease terms.  The following table summarizes the activity during fiscal 2003 related to the 2003 restructuring charges in thousands:

immaterial amounts of accounts payable due to Morrison Foerster LLP.  The terms of the Companys contracts with the above-related parties are consistent with its contracts with other independent parties.  12.
Litigation and Contingencies  In July and August 2001, various class action lawsuits were filed in the United States District Court, Southern District of New York, against the Company,
its Chairman and CEO, a former officer, and four brokerage firms that served as underwriters in its initial public offering. The actions were filed on behalf of persons who purchased the Companys stock issued pursuant to or traceable to the
initial public offering during the period from June 23, 1999 through December 6, 2000. The action alleges that the Companys underwriters charged secret excessive commissions to certain of their customers in return for allocations of the
Companys stock in the offering. The two individual defendants are alleged to be liable because of their involvement in preparing and signing the registration statement for the offering, which allegedly failed to disclose the supposedly
excessive commissions. On December 7, 2001, an amended complaint was filed in one of the actions to expand the purported class to persons who purchased the Companys stock issued pursuant to or traceable to the follow-on public offering during
the period from November 4, 1999 through December 6, 2000. The lawsuit filed against the Company is one of several hundred lawsuits filed against other companies based on substantially similar claims. On April 19, 2002, a consolidated amended
complaint was filed to consolidate all of the complaints and claims into one case. The consolidated amended complaint alleges claims that are virtually identical to the amended complaint filed on December 7, 2001 and the original complaints. In
October 2002, the Companys officer and a former officer that were named in the amended complaint were dismissed without prejudice. In July 2002, the Company, along with other issuer defendants in the case, filed a motion to dismiss the
consolidated amended complaint with prejudice. On February 19, 2003, the court issued a written decision denying the motion to dismiss with respect to CyberSource. On July 2, 2003, a committee of the Companys Board of Directors conditionally
approved a proposed partial settlement with the plaintiffs 
42 Table of Contents CYBERSOURCE CORPORATION  NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTSContinued 
in this matter. The settlement would provide, among other things, a release of the Company and of the individual defendants for the conduct alleged in the
action to be wrongful in the Amended Complaint. The Company would agree to undertake other responsibilities under the partial settlement, including agreeing to assign away, not assert, or release certain potential claims the Company may have against
its underwriters. Any direct financial impact of the proposed settlement is expected to be borne by the Companys insurers. The committee agreed to approve the settlement subject to a number of conditions, including the participation of a
substantial number of other Issuer Defendants in the proposed settlement, the consent of the Companys insurers to the settlement, and the completion of acceptable final settlement documentation. Furthermore, the settlement is subject to a
hearing on fairness and approval by the court overseeing the IPO litigations. The Company believes that the allegations seem directed primarily at its underwriters and have been informed that this action is one of numerous similar actions filed
against underwriters relating to other initial public offerings. While there can be no assurances as to the outcome of the lawsuit, the Company does not presently believe that an adverse outcome in the lawsuit would have a material effect on its
financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.  The
Company is currently party to various legal proceedings and claims, either asserted or unasserted, which arise in the ordinary course of business. While the outcome of these matters cannot be predicted with certainty, The Company does not believe
that the outcome of any of these claims or any of the above mentioned legal matters will have a material adverse effect on its consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flow.  13.
Income Taxes  As of December 31, 2003, the Company had federal and state net operating loss carryforwards of approximately $1556 million and $676 million,
respectively. As of December 31, 2003, the Company also had federal and state research credit carryforwards of approximately $06 million and $06 million, respectively. As a result of California legislation, the utilization of a substantial portion
of the Companys California state net operating loss carryforward is suspended for 2003.  The net operating loss and credit carryforwards will expire at various dates beginning in 2010 through 2023, if not utilized. The utilization of the net operating losses and credits may be subject to a substantial
annual limitation due to the change in ownership provisions of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 and similar state provisions. The annual limitation may result in the expiration of net operating losses and credits before utilization.
The net deferred tax asset has been fully offset by a
valuation allowance. Significant components of the Companys deferred tax assets and liabilities for federal and state income taxes at December 31 are as follows in thousands:  2003 2002 Deferred tax assets Net operating loss carryforwards 56,940 55,220 Research credit carryforwards 950 960 Other, net 4,760 4,410 Deferred tax assets 62,650 60,590 Deferred tax liability Net deferred tax assets 62,650 60,590 Valuation allowance 62,650 60,590 Net deferred tax assets    Under SFAS 109,
deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on differences between financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities and are measured using the enacted tax rates and laws that will be in effect when the differences are
expected to reverse. Based upon the weight of available evidence, which includes the Companys historical operating performance, the reported net losses in 2003 and 2002, and the uncertainties regarding future results of operations of the
Company, the Company has provided a full valuation allowance against its net deferred tax assets as it is not more likely than not that the deferred tax assets will be realized. The valuation allowance increased by $21 million during 2003 and
increased by $47 million during 2002.  14.
Employee Savings and Retirement Plan  The Company maintains a defined contribution plan under Internal Revenue Service Code 401k the 401k Plan. The 401k Plan provides for
tax deferred salary deductions. Employees can elect to contribute to the 401k Plan up to 20% of their salary, subject to current statutory limits. The Company is not required to contribute to the 401k Plan and has made no contributions since the
inception of the 401k Plan.

CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES  As of the end of the period covered by this report, the Company carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of its Chief
Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of its disclosure controls and procedures. Based on this evaluation, the Companys Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded

about the likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions, regardless of how remote.  There have been no significant changes in the Companys internal
controls or in other factors which could significantly affect internal controls subsequent to the date the Company carried out this evaluation.
