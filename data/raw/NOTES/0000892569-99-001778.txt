REPORT OF INDEPENDENT PUBLIC ACCOUNTANTS
Board of Directors and Stockholders
White Cap Industries, Inc.
We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of WHITE CAP
INDUSTRIES, INC. a Delaware corporation and subsidiary as of March 31, 1998
and March 27, 1999, and the related consolidated statements of operations,
stockholders' equity deficit and cash flows for each of the three years in the
period ended March 27, 1999. These financial statements are the responsibility
of the Company management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on
these financial statements based on our audits.
We conducted our audits in accordance with generally accepted auditing
standards. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material
misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting
the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes
assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by
management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.
We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above
present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of White Cap
Industries, Inc. and subsidiary as of March 31, 1998 and March 27, 1999, and the
results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in
the period ended March 27, 1999 in conformity with generally accepted accounting
principles.

WHITE CAP INDUSTRIES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARY
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
MARCH 27, 1999
1. BUSINESS ORGANIZATION
White Cap Industries, Inc. formerly White Cap Holdings, Inc. WCI, was
formed in November 1996 as a Delaware corporation and had no prior operating
history. White Cap Industries Corp. WCIC was formed in February 1976 as a
California corporation.
In February 1997, WCI and WCIC completed a transaction whereby the sole
shareholder of WCIC exchanged all of the outstanding stock of WCIC for preferred
stock of WCI, cash and dividends. This transaction was accounted for as a
recapitalization whereby WCIC became a wholly owned subsidiary of WCI. The
operating results for all periods prior to the recapitalization transaction
consist entirely of the historical results of WCIC. Hereinafter WCI and WCIC are
collectively referred to as the Company.
The Company is a business-to-business retailer of specialty tools and
materials to professional contractors throughout the Western United States. At
March 27, 1999, the Company operations consisted of a central distribution
center located in Costa Mesa, California and 40 retail branches located in
California, Nevada, Arizona, Colorado, Oregon, Washington, Texas, New Mexico,
and Utah.
The Company acquired five contractor suppliers during the fiscal year ended
March 27, 1999 see Note 4.
2. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
Principles of Consolidation
The accompanying consolidated financial statements and related notes
include the accounts of White Cap Industries, Inc. and its wholly owned
subsidiary White Cap Industries Corp. All significant intercompany accounts and
transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.
Fiscal Year
Beginning with the year ended March 27, 1999, the Company changed its
fiscal year to a 52- or 53-week period ending on the Saturday nearest to March
31.
Use of Estimates
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally
accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and
assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and
disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial
statements. Actual results could differ from those estimates.
Concentration of Credit Risk
The majority of sales are on a credit basis to professional concrete,
framing, waterproofing, landscaping, grading, electrical, mechanical and general
contractors located throughout the Western United States. Many customers are
under-capitalized and generally represent a higher than normal credit risk. In
many cases this risk is somewhat mitigated by filing a preliminary notice on
materials for specific jobs sites. The Company records an estimated allowance
for doubtful accounts and adjusts this estimate periodically based upon
historical experience and specific knowledge of a customer financial
condition. No single customer represents more than two percent of the accounts
receivable balance shown in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets.

WHITE CAP INDUSTRIES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARY
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED
MARCH 27, 1999
Cash and Cash Equivalents
The Company considers all highly liquid investment instruments purchased
with an original maturity of three months or less to be cash equivalents.
Inventories
Inventories are stated at the lower of cost weighted average, which
approximates FIFO or market and consist primarily of purchased products held
for sale.
Property and Equipment
Property and equipment are recorded at cost and depreciated based on the
estimated useful lives of depreciable assets using primarily the straight-line
method for financial reporting purposes and accelerated methods for tax
purposes. Estimated useful lives are as follows                   
30 years
Transportation equipment. 3 to 10 years
Machinery and equipment. 2 to 10 years
Office  3 to 5 years
Lesser of useful life or term of
Leasehold improvements. lease   Upon retirement of property and equipment, the asset and accumulated
depreciation and amortization accounts are relieved and any gain or loss is
reflected in operations. Maintenance costs and repairs are expensed as incurred.
Intangibles Assets
Intangible assets consist of goodwill, covenant not to compete and deferred
financing costs. Goodwill represents the excess of cost over the fair value of
net assets acquired in business combinations accounted for under the purchase
method. Management has evaluated its accounting for goodwill, considering such
factors as historical profitability and future undiscounted operating cash
flows, and believes that the asset is realizable and that the amortization
period is appropriate.
Intangible assets are amortized on a straight-line basis over the following
estimated useful lives                   
40 years
Covenant not to compete. Term of the agreement 5 years
Deferred financing costs. Term of the agreements 5 years  Revenue Recognition
Revenue from product sales is recognized as orders are picked up by
customers or upon delivery to customers. The Company also rents equipment to
customers under short-term agreements and such revenue is recognized over the
rental period as earned. The Company establishes reserves for estimated customer
returns, allowances and discounts at the time the related revenue is recognized.
Cost of Goods Sold
Cost of goods sold consists primarily of the purchase cost of the product
plus transportation to the Company facilities. Vendor rebates are recognized
on an accrual basis in the period earned as a reduction to cost of goods sold.

MARCH 27, 1999
Advertising Expenses
Advertising costs, which consists primarily of radio advertisements,
catalog expenses and store promotions are charged to expense as incurred.
Advertising expenses in the fiscal years ended March 27, 1999, March 31, 1998
and 1997, were approximately $1,445,000, $1,338,000, and $379,000, respectively.
Income Taxes
The Company accounts for income taxes in accordance with the provisions of
Statement of Financial Accounting Standards SFAS No. 109. The statement
requires an asset and liability approach for financial accounting and reporting
of income taxes. Deferred taxes are determined based on the estimated future tax
effects of differences between the financial and tax basis of assets and
liabilities given the provisions of the enacted tax laws. Prior to the
recapitalization transaction completed in February 1997, WCIC was taxed as an S
Corporation see Note 7.
Fair Value of Financial Instruments
The carrying value of cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable and
accounts payable approximates the fair value. In addition, the carrying value of
all borrowings approximate fair value based on interest rates currently
available to the Company.
Cash Management
The Company has a cash management program that processes cash receipts and
provides for centralized cash disbursements using certain zero-balance accounts.
This cash management program may result in negative book cash balances in
various zero-balance disbursement accounts. At March 31, 1998 and March 27,
1999, such negative cash balances total approximately $72 million and $73
million, respectively, and are included in accounts payable.
Stock Split
Effective October 1997, the Company effected a 174 for 1 stock split of
the common stock. The financial statements have been retroactively adjusted to
reflect the stock split.
Stock-Based Compensation
As permitted under SFAS No. 123, the Company accounts for employee
stock-based compensation under APB Opinion No. 25 and therefore presents the
necessary pro forma disclosures see Note 11.
Per Share Amounts
The Company has adopted the provisions of SFAS No. 128, Earnings Per
Share, and applied this pronouncement to all periods presented. This statement
requires the presentation of both basic and diluted net income loss per share
for financial statement purposes. Basic net income loss per share is computed
by dividing income loss available to common stockholders by the weighted
average number of common shares outstanding. Diluted net income loss per share
includes the effect of the potential shares outstanding, including dilutive
stock options and warrants using the treasury stock method.
Recent Accounting Pronouncements
The Company adopted the Financial Accounting Standards Board Statement of
Financial Accounting Standards SFAS No. 130, Reporting Comprehensive Income
during the year ended March 27, 1999.

WHITE CAP INDUSTRIES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARY
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED
MARCH 27, 1999
This statement requires that all items that meet the definition of components of
comprehensive income be reported in a financial statement for the period in
which they are recognized. Components of comprehensive income include revenues,
expenses, gains and losses that under generally accepted accounting principles
are included in comprehensive income loss but are excluded from net income
loss. There are no differences between the Company net income loss, as
reported, and comprehensive income loss as defined, for each of the three
years in the period ended March 27, 1999.
The Company has also adopted SFAS no. 131, Disclosures About Segments Of
An Enterprise and Related Information during the year ended March 27, 1999. The
Company believes it operates in a single business segment.
In June 1998, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Statement of
Financial Accounting Standards No. 133 SFAS 133, Accounting for Derivative
Instruments and Hedging Activities, effective for all fiscal quarters of fiscal
years beginning after June 15, 2000. SFAS 133 requires all derivatives to be
carried on the balance sheet at fair value. Changes in the fair value of
derivatives must be recognized in the Company Consolidated Statements of
Operations when they occur; however, there is an exception for derivatives that
qualify as hedges as defined by SFAS 133. If a derivative qualifies as a hedge,
a company can elect to use hedge accounting to eliminate or reduce the income
statement volatility that would arise from reporting changes in a derivative
fair value. Adoption of SFAS 133 is not expected to materially impact the
Company reported financial results.
In March 1998, the American Institute of Certified Public Accounts
AICPA issued Statement of Position 98-1, Accounting for the Costs of
Computer Software Developed For or Obtained for Internal Use SOP No. 98-1.
SOP No. 98-1 is effective for fiscal years beginning on January 1, 1999. SOP No.
98-1 will require the capitalization of certain costs and the expensing of
certain costs incurred after the date of adoption in connection with developing
or obtaining software. Management does not believe the adoption of this
statement will have a material effect on the Company future earnings and
financial position.
In April 1998, AICPA issued Statement of Position 98-5, Reporting on the
Costs of Start-Up Activities SOP No. 98-5. SOP No. 98-5 is effective for
fiscal years beginning after December 15, 1998. SOP No. 98-5 will require costs
of start-up activities and organization costs to be expenses as incurred.
Non-capital expenditures incurred in connection with opening new branches are
expensed as incurred under the Company current policy which conforms with SOP
No. 98-5.
Reclassifications
Certain amounts for prior periods have been reclassified to conform to the
current year presentation.
