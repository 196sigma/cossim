ITEM8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data. a Managements Report on Internal Control Over Financial
Reporting Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as defined in Rules
13a-15f and 15d-15f under the Exchange Act and for assessing the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting. Our internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the
reliability of financial reporting and the preparation and fair presentation of published financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States. Our internal control over financial reporting is supported by written policies and procedures that:  Pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of our assets;  Provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting
principles, and that receipts and expenditures are being made only in accordance with authorizations from our management and directors; and  Provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of our assets that could have a material effect on the
financial statements. Our management assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December31,
2005. In making this assessment, our management used the criteria set forth in Internal ControlIntegrated Framework published by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission COSO. Our
managements assessment included an evaluation of the design of our internal control over financial reporting and testing of the operating effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting. Based on this assessment, our management
concluded that, as of December31, 2005, our internal control over financial reporting was effective. Because of its inherent limitations, a system
of internal control over financial reporting can provide only reasonable, and not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met and may not prevent or detect all misstatements. In addition, projections of any evaluation of
effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. BDO Seidman LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, audited managements assessment of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial
reporting as of December31, 2005. BDO Seidman LLP issued an audit report thereon, which is included at Item8b of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

Summary of Significant Accounting Policies  a
Nature of Business Datastream Systems, Inc.
and Subsidiaries the Company or Datastream provides asset performance management software and services to enterprises worldwide, including approximately 60 percent of the Fortune 500. Datastreams solutions
combine asset management functionality with advanced analytics to deliver a platform for optimizing enterprise asset performance. Datastream was founded in 1986. In addition to its U.S. operations, the Company has offices in Argentina, Brazil, Chile, China, France, Germany, Italy, Mexico, The Netherlands, Singapore, and the United Kingdom.  b
Basis of Presentation The consolidated
financial statements include the accounts of Datastream Systems, Inc. and its wholly owned subsidiaries. All significant intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated.  c
Revenue Recognition The Company follows the
guidance of AICPA Statement of Position SOP 97-2, Software Revenue Recognition to account for its software license arrangements SOP 97-2. The majority of the Companys software license arrangements include
additional elements such as professional services, post contract support and/or hosting services and therefore, are considered multiple element arrangements. In addition, arrangements entered into with the same customer within a close proximity of
time usually within three months are evaluated together to determine if they collectively are a multiple element arrangement. The Company
accounts for multiple element arrangements by allocating the total contract fee to the various elements based on vendor-specific objective evidence of fair value VSOE of each element of the arrangement with the exception of the license
element. The license element is accounted for according to the residual method provided by SOP 98-9Modification of SOP 97-2, Software Revenue Recognition, With Respect to Certain Transactions SOP 98-9. VSOE is determined
for all undelivered elements, including services and post contract support and hosting. If any undelivered element does not have VSOE then all revenue from the arrangement is deferred until sufficient evidence exists or until all elements of the
arrangement have been delivered. Product Revenues The Company recognizes product revenues when a non-cancelable license
agreement has been signed, the product has been delivered, the fees are fixed or determinable, collectibility is probable and VSOE exists for all undelivered elements in an arrangement. Fees are generally considered fixed or determinable upon
receipt of a signed license agreement. Management sets payment terms depending on market and customer specific conditions. If payment terms on license fees extend beyond a period of time that is out of the Companys historical collection
period, then revenue is recognized as payments are due. The products are off-the-shelf products because they can be used by customers with little or no customization. Professional Services The professional service offerings are primarily related to providing installation, implementation, integration, training and project management services. These services are sold
principally on a time and materials basis or in limited cases at a fixed price. Time and material projects are distinguished from fixed price agreements in that the price of the services is quoted based on days incurred on the project or some other
measure of time such as hours, weeks or months. A fixed price service contract is defined as any contract entered into for a pre-determined total price regardless of the number of days actually needed to complete the project. Time and material
service revenue is recognized as the services are performed. Fixed price services are recognized based on the proportional performance method. The measure of performance is based on the relationship between the hours incurred to date versus the
total estimated hours to complete an input method. The resulting percentage complete is used to determine the percentage of revenue of the contract to be recognized. The output method is not used because it is difficult to establish and reasonably
estimate outputs. The Company believes that the input method is better because of a history of accurate estimates. Estimates are 
39 Table of Contents
Datastream Systems, Inc. and Subsidiaries Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements December31, 2005, 2004, and
2003 updated frequently at least quarterly, variances regularly monitored and recognized, and the Company has the ability to track
costs. Losses on fixed price contracts are recognized during the period in which the loss first becomes evident. Contract losses are determined to be the amount by which the estimated total costs of the contract exceed the total fixed price of the
contract. The service elements are not essential to the functionality of the software and are accounted for separately as evidenced by the
following:  Services provided together with products do not include significant customizations to the features or functionality of the software.  Complex interfaces are not necessary for the software to function in the customers environment.  The timing of the payment for the software is not coincident with the performance of the services.  Customer payment for the license is not dependent upon milestones or customer acceptance.  These services are available from other vendors.  These services do not carry significant degrees of risk or unique acceptance criteria.  The Company is an experienced provider of the services. The Company infrequently enters into any multiple element arrangements in which the services were considered essential to the functionality of the software. Support and Hosting Revenues The Company recognizes support revenues, which consist of fees for ongoing support and product updates, ratably over the term of the contract support period, typically one
year. The amount of support revenue invoiced but not yet recognized is recorded as unearned revenue in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. Certain customers purchase our hosting services. A customer must generally purchase a perpetual license for the product before a customer can utilize hosting services. Hosted customers with perpetual licenses have the contractual right to
take possession of the software at any time during the hosted period and either host the product internally or contract with a third party vendor. The customer has the right to choose not to renew its hosting arrangement upon its expiration and
deploy the software internally or contract with another party unrelated to us to host the software. For the vast majority of the hosted products, the customer could self-host and any penalties to do so are not material as defined in EITF 00-03,
Application of AICPA Statement of Position 97-2 to Arrangements That Include the Right to Use Software Stored on Another Entitys Hardware. The arrangement is accounted for under SOP 97-2. The Company accounts for the license element
according to the residual method upon delivery of the license element to the customer. The portion of the arrangement fee allocated to the hosting element is recognized ratably over the term of the arrangement. In certain limited instances, the hosted customer may incur significant penalties upon electing to terminate hosting services. In those instances, all
revenues related to the arrangement are recognized over the longer of the contractual life or the period of the expected life of the hosting arrangement since the customer has paid a nonrefundable upfront fee software license. Reseller Arrangements - The majority of sales through resellers are generated from our European, Asian and Latin American operations. Revenue from
resellers is recognized on the accrual basis only if financial stability of the reseller can be determined, payment is not contingent on end user payment to the reseller, and other criteria of SOP 97-2 are met. If financial stability cannot be
determined and properly documented or if payment from the distributor is contingent, then revenue is recognized upon cash receipt. In
accordance with Emerging Issues Task Force Issue 99-19, Reporting Revenue Gross as a Principal versus Net as an Agent, the Company evaluates sales through its resellersand sales of third party productson a case-by-case basis to
determine whether the transaction should be recorded gross or net, including but not limited to assessing 
40 Table of Contents
Datastream Systems, Inc. and Subsidiaries Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements December31, 2005, 2004, and
2003 whether or not the Company 1 acts as principal in the transaction, 2 takes title to the products, 3 has risks and rewards of
ownership, such as the risk of loss for collection, delivery, or returns, and 4 acts as an agent or broker with compensation on a commission or fee basis. Product Warranties and Returns - The standard agreements do not contain product return rights. A standard warranty of 30 days from the date of sale is provided. The Company continually evaluates obligations
with respect to warranties, returns and refunds. Reserves are not maintained with respect to warranty based on the performance history of our software. The Company may, in certain circumstances, grant discounts for product sales. The discounts are
recognized as a reduction of product revenue. The allowance for doubtful accounts includes an insignificant amount for product returns and refunds. Guarantees - The Company accounts for guarantees in accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board Interpretation No45 FIN 45, Guarantors Accounting and Disclosure Requirements for Guarantees,
Including Indirect Guarantees of Indebtedness of Others. The Companys sales agreements with customers generally contain infringement indemnity provisions. Under these agreements, the Company agrees to indemnify, defend and hold harmless
the customer in connection with patent, copyright or trade secret infringement claims made by third parties with respect to the customers authorized use of the Companys products and services. The indemnity provisions generally provide
for the Companys control of defense and settlement and cover costs and damages finally awarded against the customer, as well as the Companys modification of the product so it is no longer infringing or, if it cannot be corrected, return
of the product for a pro-rated refund. The sales agreements with customers sometimes also contain indemnity provisions for death, personal injury or property damage caused by the Companys personnel or contractors in the course of performing
services to customers. Under these agreements, the Company agrees to indemnify, defend and hold harmless the customer in connection with death, personal injury and property damage claims made by third parties with respect to actions of the
Companys personnel or contractors. The indemnity provisions generally provide for the Companys control of defense and settlement and cover costs and damages finally awarded against the customer. The indemnity obligations contained in
sales agreements generally have a limited life and monetary award. The Company has not previously incurred costs to settle claims or pay awards under these indemnification obligations. The Company accounts for these indemnity obligations in
accordance with SFAS No5, Accounting for Contingencies, and records a liability for these obligations when a loss is probable and reasonably estimable. The Company has not recorded any liabilities for these agreements as of
December31, 2005 or 2004.  d
Cash Equivalents The Company considers all
highly liquid investments with an original maturity of three months or less to be cash equivalents.  e
Short-Term Investments Short-term
investments at December31, 2005 consisted of foreign issued debt securities. Short-term investments at December31, 2004 consisted of auction-rate securities. The interest rates on auction-rate securities are typically reset to market
prevailing rates every 35 days or less, and in all cases every 90 days or less, but the securities have longer stated maturities, ranging from 2032 to 2043. Investments with maturities beyond one year may be classified as short term based on their
highly liquid nature and because such marketable securities represent the investment of cash that is available for current operations. Short-term investments are classified as available for-sale. Due to the frequent market interest rate reset,
changes in the fair value are insignificant.  f
Accounts Receivable Trade accounts
receivable are recorded at the invoiced amount and do not bear interest. The Company maintains allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of its customers to make required payments and for estimated credits to
be issued. In determining the allowance for doubtful accounts, the Company reviews the rolling twelve month average of account write-offs, customer specific account risks, accounts receivable aging, and geographic specific factors that may impact
international accounts. These factors combine to establish the allowance for doubtful accounts balance. Accounts are considered past due once their contractual due date has passed. Account balances are charged off against the allowance or directly
to bad debt expense after all means of collection have been exhausted and the potential for recovery is considered remote.

Concentration of Credit Risk Financial
instruments which potentially expose the Company to concentrations of credit risk consist primarily of trade accounts receivable. The Company has not experienced significant losses related to receivables from individual customers or groups of
customers in a particular industry or geographic area.  h
Investment Security The Companys
investment security is carried at cost. It is not traded on the open market and does not have a readily determinable fair value. A decline
in the value of any investment below its carrying value that is deemed to be other than temporary results in a reduction in the carrying amount to fair value. The impairment is charged to earnings and a new cost basis for the security is
established. The Company did not earn dividend or interest income on its investment in the years ended December31, 2005, 2004 or 2003. See Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in this Annual Report.  i
Property, Equipment and Internally Developed Software Property and equipment are recorded at cost. Depreciation is computed using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets for financial reporting and using the accelerated and modified
accelerated cost recovery systems for income tax reporting purposes. Leasehold improvements are amortized over the shorter of the lease terms or the estimated useful lives. In accordance with Statement of Position No98-1, Accounting for the Costs of Computer Software Developed or Obtained for Internal
Use SOP 98-1, the Company capitalized approximately $03 million and $01 million in costs related to the development of internal use software for its website, enterprise resource planning system, and systems management
applications during the years ended December31, 2005 and 2004, respectively. The Company amortizes the costs of computer software developed for internal use on a straight-line basis over its estimated useful life of three years. The carrying
value of internal use software is included in property and equipment on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. The estimated useful lives
generally assigned are as follows:  Building and improvements
12to39Years
Computer equipment
2 to 5 Years
Furniture and fixtures
3 to 5 Years
Internally developed software
3 Years
j
Research Development Costs Research and development expenses include payroll, employee benefits and other employee-related costs associated with product development. We have determined that technological feasibility for our software products is reached shortly before
the products are generally released. Costs incurred after technological feasibility is established are not material, and accordingly, we expense all research and development costs when incurred. During the years ended December31, 2005, 2004
and 2003, total costs incurred and expensed for software development activities were approximately $13,795,000, $13,979,000, and $12,421,000, respectively.  k
Stock Option Plans The Company applies the
intrinsic-value-based method of accounting prescribed by Accounting Principles Board APB Opinion No25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees, as amended, to account for its stock-based employee compensation plans. Under this
method, compensation expense is recorded on the date of grant only if the current market price of the underlying stock exceeds the exercise price. SFAS No123, Accounting for Stock-

2003 Based Compensation, as amended by Statement 148, Accounting for Stock-Based CompensationTransition and
Disclosure, established accounting and disclosure requirements using a fair-value-based method of accounting for stock-based employee compensation plans. As allowed by SFAS No123, the Company has elected to continue to apply the
intrinsic-value-based method of accounting described above, and has adopted only the disclosure requirements of SFAS No123, as amended by SFAS No148. The following table illustrates the effect on net income if the fair-value-based method had been applied to all outstanding and unvested awards in each period.

grant and employee stock purchase plan purchase right on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option pricing model. The Black-Scholes option-pricing model was developed for use in estimating the fair value of traded options that have no vesting
restrictions and are fully transferable; characteristics not present in the Companys option grants or employee stock purchase plan rights. Additionally, option valuation models require the input of highly subjective assumptions, including the
expected volatility of the stock price. The assumptions used to value the option grants and the employee stock purchase plan were as

Income Taxes The Company accounts for
income taxes under the asset and liability method in accordance with SFAS No109, Accounting for Income Taxes. The Company recognizes deferred income taxes, net of valuation allowances, for the estimated future tax effects of temporary
differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their tax bases and net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates
expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that
includes the enactment date. Changes in deferred tax assets and liabilities are recorded in the provision for income taxes.  m
Net Income Per Share Basic net income per
share is computed by dividing net income by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding. Diluted net income per share is computed by dividing net income by the weighted average number of common and potential common shares outstanding,
provided no anti-dilution exists. Diluted weighted average common and potential common shares include common shares and stock options using the treasury stock method.  n
Foreign Currency Translation The financial
statements of subsidiaries outside the United States are measured using the local currency as the functional currency. Remeasurement gains and losses for transactions which are denominated in a currency other than a foreign subsidiarys local
currency are recognized in the consolidated statements of income. The Company recorded net remeasurement losses of approximately $73,000 and $506,000 the years ended December31, 2005 and 2004, respectively, and a net remeasurement gain of
approximately $248,000 in the year ended December31, 2003. Translation of the foreign operations to United States dollars occurs
using the current exchange rate for balance sheet accounts and an average exchange rate for results of operations. Translation gains and losses are recognized as a component of equity in Accumulated Other Comprehensive Loss. o
Total Comprehensive Income Total
comprehensive income consists of net income and net unrealized foreign currency translation adjustments and is presented in the consolidated statements of stockholders equity and comprehensive income.  p
Advertising Costs The Company expenses
advertising costs in the period incurred. Advertising expense was approximately $1,638,000, $1,393,000, and $1,697,000 in 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively.  q
Use of Estimates The preparation of
financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of
contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period including estimates and assumptions for allowances for doubtful accounts receivable and unbilled
revenue, revenue recognition, deferred income tax assets, valuation of investments, and the fair value of stock options for disclosure purposes. Actual results could differ from those estimates.

2003  r
Contingencies The Company evaluates whether
or not a contingency exists in accordance with Financial Accounting Standard FAS 5, Accounting for Contingencies. An estimated loss from a loss contingency is accrued by a charge to income if it is probable that an asset has been impaired
or a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. If no accrual is made for a loss contingency because the loss has not been deemed probable or the amount cannot be reasonably estimated then disclosure of the
contingency is made when there is at least a reasonable possibility that a material loss may have been incurred. Estimated gains from gain contingencies are not recorded until realized; however, disclosure of the event leading to the potential gain
contingency may be required.  s
Reclassifications Certain amounts in the
2004 and 2003 financial statements have been reclassified to conform to the 2005 presentation. These reclassifications had no impact on stockholders equity or net income as previously reported.  t
Recent Accounting Pronouncements In June
2005, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued FAS No154, Accounting Changes and Error Corrections a replacement of APB Opinion No20 and FASB Statement No3. This Statement generally requires retrospective
application to prior periods financial statements of changes in accounting principle. Previously, Opinion No20 required that most voluntary changes in accounting principle were recognized by including the cumulative effect of changing
to the new accounting principle in net income of the period of the change. FAS 154 applies to all voluntary changes in accounting principle. It also applies to changes required by an accounting pronouncement in the unusual instance that the
pronouncement does not include specific transition provisions. When a pronouncement includes specific transition provisions, those provisions should be followed. This Statement shall be effective for accounting changes and corrections of errors made
in fiscal years beginning after December15, 2005. We do not expect the adoption of this statement to have a material impact on our results of operations, financial position or cash flow. In June 2005, the EITF reached a consensus on Issue No05-06, Determining the Amortization Period for Leasehold Improvements
EITF 05-06. EITF 05-06 provides guidance for determining the amortization period used for leasehold improvements acquired in a business combination or purchased after the inception of a lease, collectively referred to as subsequently acquired
leasehold improvements. EITF 05-06 provides that the amortization period used for the subsequently acquired leasehold improvements to be the lesser of athe subsequently acquired leasehold improvements useful lives, or ba
period that reflects renewals that are reasonably assured upon the acquisition or the purchase. EITF 05-06 is effective on a prospective basis for subsequently acquired leasehold improvements purchased or acquired in periods beginning after the date
of the FASBs ratification, which was on June29, 2005. The adoption of EITF 05-06 did not have a material impact on the Companys consolidated results of operations, financial position or cash flow. In March 2005, the FASB issued FASB Interpretation No47, Accounting for Conditional Asset Retirement Obligations FIN 47. FIN 47 provides
guidance relating to the identification and recognition of legal obligations to perform an asset retirement activity. FIN 47 requires recognition of a liability for the fair value of a conditional asset retirement obligation when incurred if the
liabilitys fair value can be reasonably estimated. The company was required to adopt the provisions of FIN 47 by December31, 2005. The adoption of FIN 47 did not have a material impact on the Companys results of operations,
financial position or cash flows. In December 2004, the Financial Accounting Standards Board FASB issued Statement
No123 Revised 2004, Share-Based Payment SFAS 123R which is a revision of FASB Statement No123, Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation. SFAS 123R supercedes Accounting Principles Board Opinion No25,
Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees, and amends FASB Statement No95, Statement of Cash Flows. SFAS 123R requires the measurement of all share-based payments to employees, including grants of employee stock options,
45 Table of Contents
Datastream Systems, Inc. and Subsidiaries Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements December31, 2005, 2004, and
2003 using a fair-value based method and the recording of such expense in the Companys consolidated statements of income. The
accounting provisions of SFAS 123R are effective for annual periods beginning after June15, 2005. The Company is required to adopt SFAS 123R in the first quarter of 2006. The pro forma disclosures previously permitted under SFAS 123 no longer
will be an alternative to financial statement recognition. See Note 1k above for the pro forma net income and pro forma net income per share amounts for years 2003 through 2005, as if the Company had used a fair-value-based method similar to the
methods required under SFAS 123R to measure compensation expense for employee stock incentive awards. The Company is evaluating the requirements under SFAS 123R and does not expect the adoption to have a significant impact on the Companys
consolidated statements of income and net income per share. The Company accelerated vesting of outstanding options in anticipation of this requirement. See Note 8 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in this Annual Report. In December 2004, the FASB issued FASB Staff Position No. FAS 109-1 Application of FASB Statement No109, Accounting for Income
Taxes, to the Tax Deduction on Qualified Production Activities by the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004 FSP FAS No109-1 and FASB Staff Position No109-2, Accounting and Disclosure Guidance for the
Foreign Earnings Repatriation Provision within the American Jobs Creations Act of 2004 FSP FAS No109-2. The American Jobs Creation Act of 2004 AJCA provides several incentives for U.S. multinational
corporations and U.S. manufacturers, subject to certain limitations. The incentives include an 85% dividends received deduction for certain dividends from controlled foreign corporations that repatriate accumulated income abroad, and a deduction for
domestic qualified production activities taxable income. The adoption of this Staff Position did not have a material impact on the Companys results of operations, financial position or cash flow.  2
Investment Security The Companys single cost
method investment consisted of an investment in a privately owned company. In 2003, the investment was evaluated for impairment based on a notice received that it intended to obtain additional financing. Datastream concluded that the financing would
be dilutive to ownership at an implied valuation below the $20 million carrying value. Accordingly, Datastream decreased its long-term investment to its estimated fair market value from $20 million to $05 million and recorded a charge of
approximately $15 million through other income expense, net. Based on the degree of ownership dilution and future prospects, the Company considered the impairment to be other than temporary. During 2004, the Company made an additional investment
of approximately $35,000 in order to avoid material dilution to its ownership position. The investment was evaluated for impairment at
December31, 2005 in accordance with the Companys policy of annual review. The Company concluded that the investment lacked liquidity and would require additional financing that would fully dilute its ownership position. Accordingly,
Datastream recorded a charge of approximately $05 million through other income expense, net. Based on the change in management, poor operating results and lackluster future prospects, the Company considered the impairment to be other than
temporary.  3
Fair Value of Financial Instruments The fair value
of a financial instrument is the amount at which the instrument could be exchanged in a current transaction between willing parties. At
December31, 2005 and 2004, the carrying value of financial instruments such as cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments, accounts receivable, and accounts payable approximated their fair values, based upon the short maturities of
these instruments.

granted by the Company. The exercise of these stock options or the subsequent disqualified disposition of the underlying stock of the Company generated income tax deductions and related income tax benefits for the Company that are recorded directly
to additional paid-in capital in accordance with APB Opinion No25. Such amounts were approximately $35,000, $85,000, and $237,000, for 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. Income tax expense differed from the amounts computed by applying the federal income tax rate of 34 percent for 2005 and 35 percent for 2004 and 2003 as a result of the following:  In thousands

The federal income tax rate of 34 percent is considered applicable for 2005 based on
estimates made during 2005 of current and future taxable incomes. Deferred income taxes reflect the net tax effects of temporary differences
between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for income tax purposes.

Foreign 990 562 3,201 2,354 Net deferred tax assets 4,013 4,368 In assessing the realizability of deferred tax assets, management considers whether it is more
likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. The ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which those temporary
differences become deductible. Management considers all available evidence, both positive and negative, such as projected future taxable income and tax planning strategies in making this assessment. The valuation allowances for deferred tax assets at December31, 2005 and 2004 are as follows:  In thousands

Net operating loss carryforwards of foreign subsidiaries 3,402 1,613

December31, 2005,December31, 2004, and December31, 2003 was an increase of approximately $3,269,000, an increase of approximately $680,000, and a decrease of approximately $1,611,000, respectively. Of the increase in the
valuation allowance for 2005, approximately $3,119,000 is related to increases to the Companys deferred tax assets of approximately $3,198,000. As these increases are substantially offset by increases in related valuation allowances,
theresult is a net impact of $79,000. The Company increased the value of its gross deferred tax assets primarily due to additional
foreign net operating loss carryforwards resulting from the completion of a tax audit in 2005, and to an upward revision to the value of certain state tax credits. As noted above, these increases are substantially offset by increases in related
valuation allowances.

of the state tax credits and net operating loss carryforwards expire between 2013 and 2016. The foreign net operating loss carryforwards have no expiration date. There is a greater likelihood of not realizing the full future tax benefits of these
tax credits and net operating loss carryforwards and accordingly, the Company has recorded valuation allowances related to the deferred tax assets. In order to realize the U.S. federal deferred tax assets, the Company will need to generate future taxable income of approximately $80 million prior to the expiration of the federal tax credits. The Company will need to generate future
taxable income of approximately $170 million prior to the expiration of the state net operating loss carryforwards in order to realize the benefit of this asset. The Company will need to generate future taxable income of approximately $2330
million prior to the expiration of the state tax credits in order to realize the benefit of this asset. Federal taxable income in the
United States for the year ended December31, 2005 was approximately $74 million and for the year ended December31, 2004 was approximately $44 million. As of December31, 2005, the Company has approximately $45 million of unremitted foreign earnings, which are deemed to be permanently invested.  7
Employee Savings and Retirement Plan Effective
September1, 1992, the Company established a Retirement Plan under Section401k of the Internal Revenue Code. The Plan is funded in part from employee voluntary contributions with the Companys contribution equal to one-half of the
employees contribution up to 3% of his or her compensation. The Plan provided for voluntary employee contributions of up to 15% of their total compensation until April1, 2001, after which time employees could contribute up to 20% of
their total compensation. The Companys contributions to the Plan totaled approximately $616,000, $600,000, and $365,000 in 2005, 2004
and 2003, respectively.  8
Stock Compensation Plans The Company has several
stock compensation plans. The plans are described below. Options granted under the 1995 Stock Option Plan the 1995 Plan vest
incrementally over a period of one to three years and expire either five or ten years from the date of grant, depending on the terms of the option agreement. Options under the 1995 Plan are granted with an exercise price at least equal to the fair
market value of the underlying shares at the grant date. Incentive options granted to a participant who is an over 10% owner are not granted at less than 110% of the fair market value of the underlying shares at the grant date.

Datastream Systems, Inc. and Subsidiaries Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements December31, 2005, 2004, and

vesting periods up to five years from the date of grant, depending on the applicable laws of the foreign jurisdiction and the terms of the option agreement. Options granted under the EU Plan expire ten years after the date of grant and are granted
at the fair market value of the underlying shares at the date of grant. Options granted under the Datastream Systems, Inc. 1998 Stock
Option Plan the 1998 Plan vest incrementally over a period of one to five years and expire either five or ten years from the date of grant, depending on the terms of the option agreement. Options under the 1998 Plan are granted with an
exercise price at least equal to the fair market value of the underlying shares at the grant date. Incentive options granted to a participant who is an over 10% owner are not granted at less than 110% of the fair market value of the underlying
shares at the grant date. Options granted pursuant to Datastream Systems, Inc. 1998 Singapore Stock Option Plan, the 1998 German Stock
Option Plan, the 1998 Australian Stock Option Plan, and the 1999 Argentinean Stock Option Plan vest incrementally over a period of one to five years, depending on the terms of the option agreement, and expire ten years from the date of grant.
Options are granted at the fair market value of the underlying shares at the grant date. Acceleration of Unvested Options
On December30, 2005, the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors of the Company approved the accelerated vesting of unvested
stock options held by active employees of the Company or its affiliates for all of the aforementioned stock option plans collectively, the Stock Option Plans. As a result, a total of 1,081,698 options to purchase common stock of the Company, which otherwise would have vested from time to time at future dates,
became fully vested and immediately exercisable as of December30, 2005. The accelerated options have exercise prices ranging from $597 to $1050 and a weighted average exercise price of $728. The total number of accelerated options includes
509,999 options held by executive officers of the Company, with exercise prices ranging from $597 to $1050 and a weighted average exercise price of $718. The primary purpose of accelerating the vesting of these options was to eliminate the recognition of non-cash compensation expense associated with these options that the Company would have been required to recognize
in its future consolidated statements of income upon its adoption of SFAS 123R. SFAS 123R will generally require that the fair value of all share-based payments to employees, including stock option awards, be recognized as compensation expense in
the Companys statements of income. The Company is required to adopt the expense recognition provisions of SFAS 123R effective January1, 2006. In order to limit the personal benefit to the option holders of fully vesting their stock options, the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors imposed restrictions on the sale or transfer of the shares
received by an option holder upon the exercise of an accelerated option until the date on which such option would have vested and become exercisable, without giving effect to such acceleration. A non-cash compensation charge of approximately $47,000 pre-tax was recognized as a result of the accelerated vesting related to the intrinsic value, on
the acceleration date, of those options that would have been forfeited had the vesting not been accelerated. In determining the forfeiture rates, the Company reviewed the impact of one-time events that are not expected to recur and whether options
were held by executive officers of the Company. The compensation charge will be adjusted in future periods as actual forfeitures are realized.

2003 Warrants In
connection with entering into a software development and licensing agreement, Datastream issued a warrant during the first quarter of 2002 to purchase up to 50,000 shares of common stock of the Company. The warrant was exercisable on the date of
issuance and remained exercisable for three years from the date of issuance. The exercise price per share was $695, which was the market price of the Companys common stock on the date of issuance of the warrant. The warrant agreement allowed
for net share settlement at the option of the warrant holder and provided piggy back registration rights for the underlying common stock. The warrant was not exercised and expired on February13, 2005. On the date of issuance the
Company recorded the fair value of the warrant as a credit to Additional Paid-In Capital and a debit to other assets. The Company recorded amortization of the asset as a reduction of revenue over the three years the warrant was exercisable.
Employee Stock Purchase Plan The Purchase Plan permits eligible employees to elect to contribute up to 15% of their regular compensation through payroll deductions, toward the purchase of common stock at 85% of the fair market value of a share on either the date the
right is granted the first day of each semi-annual period or the date it is exercised the last day of such period, whichever is lower. The Purchase Plan is intended to comply with Section423 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as
amended. The Board of Directors and the Companys stockholders have reserved 400,000 shares of common stock for future issuance pursuant to the Purchase Plan. Under the Plan, the Company sold 15,373, 18,118, and 32,319 shares in 2005, 2004 and

In 2003, the Company changed the methodology used to determine the intercompany pricing between
the US Operations and the foreign affiliates from a comparable uncontrolled transaction method CUT Method to a comparable profits method CPM Method. The CUT Method evaluates whether the amount charged for a controlled
transfer of intangible property is consistent with an arms length transaction by reference to the amount charged in a comparable uncontrolled transaction. The CPM Method evaluates the arms length character of a controlled transaction
based upon objective measures of profitability derived from uncontrolled taxpayers that engage in similar business activities under similar circumstances. In 2003, the Company applied additional control procedures to the foreign affiliate operations. More specifically, the Company provided significant direction to the foreign affiliates regarding markets and customers
to target. The Company assisted the foreign affiliates in managing capital and other resources, and centralized in the U.S. certain management and administrative functions formerly performed by the foreign affiliates. As a result of these
operational changes, the foreign subsidiaries made fewer operating decisions and undertook fewer risks than they did before the Company instituted these changes. As a result, a new transfer pricing method was applied. In accordance with section 482 of the U.S. Internal Revenue Code and the regulations thereunder, the Company engaged a third party in 2003 to determine a
new arms length pricing method to apply to the foreign affiliates. The objective measures of profitability used in the CPM Method are commonly used by companies in the software/hardware distribution business all over the world. The result was
a change from an intercompany charge for the licensing of the software to a set profitability margin based on comparable company profits. The impact of these changes on operating income in 2003 was a decrease in North American operating income of approximately $1,145,000 and an increase in operating income of approximately $197,000, $567,000 and $381,000 in Europe, Latin
America and Asia, respectively.

2003 During 2005, the Company, while retaining the CPM Method, consistent with the results of its review of comparable company
profits, reduced the intercompany charge for the licensing of software. The impact of this reduction in the intercompany charge on
operating income in 2005 was a decrease in North American operating income of approximately $714,000 and an increase in operating income of approximately $452,000, $125,000 and $137,000 in Europe, Latin America and Asia, respectively.  11
Reconciliation of Basic and Diluted Income per Share Basic net income per share is computed by dividing net income by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding. Diluted net income per share is computed by dividing net income by the weighted average number of common and
potential dilutive common shares outstanding. Diluted weighted average common and potential dilutive common shares include common shares and stock options using the treasury stock method, except when those shares result in antidilution. The
reconciliation of basic and diluted income per share is as follows:  In thousands except per share data

Commitments and Contingencies  The Company is

Subsequent Event On January4, 2006, the
Company entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger the Merger Agreement with wholly owned subsidiaries of Infor Global Solutions AG Infor. The Merger Agreement provides that, upon the terms and subject to the conditions
set forth therein:  An indirect wholly owned subsidiary of Infor will merge with and into the Company, and the Company will become an indirect wholly owned subsidiary of Infor; and
Upon consummation of the merger, each share of the Companys common stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the effective time of the merger as defined in the Merger
Agreement, other than shares held by stockholders who have properly perfected their appraisal rights and by the Company or Infors subsidiaries, will be converted into the right to receive $1026 in cash, without interest or dividends and less
any applicable withholding taxes. Furthermore, at the effective time of the merger, each holder of an outstanding stock
option to acquire the Companys common stock will, in settlement thereof, receive for each share subject to each such option that is vested and exercisable as of the effective time, an amount in cash equal to the difference between $1026 and
the per share exercise price of such option, to the extent such difference is a positive number and subject to any applicable withholding taxes. Upon receipt of this consideration, each such option will be canceled. After the merger, the Companys common stock will cease to be quoted on the Pink Sheets Electronic Quotation System, and there will be no public
market for the Companys common stock. Following the merger, the Company also expects to deregister its shares of common stock with the SEC and to cease to be a public reporting company. Accordingly, the Company will no longer be required to
file periodic and current reports with the SEC. The consummation of the merger is subject to certain conditions contained in the Merger
Agreement that if not waived, must have occurred or be true, including the adoption of the Merger Agreement by the Companys stockholders. If those conditions have not occurred or are not true, either the Company or the Infor subsidiaries would
not be obligated to effect the merger. The Merger Agreement contains certain termination rights for both the Company and the Infor subsidiaries, and further provides that, upon termination of the Merger Agreement under specified circumstances,
either party may be required to pay the other party a termination fee of up to $6,500,000. The Merger Agreement also provides that in certain instances where the termination fee is not owed, the Company may be required to reimburse an Infor
subsidiary for up to $3,000,000 of its transaction related expenses. The merger is expected to occur within five business days after all conditions specified in the Merger Agreement have been satisfied or waived, or April14, 2006, whichever is
later. In connection with the execution of the Merger Agreement, certain of the Companys executive officers entered into voting
agreements on January4, 2006, with the Infor subsidiaries, pursuant to which such executive officers agreed to vote their respective shares of the Companys common stock in favor of the adoption of the Merger Agreement and, in the event
they do not act in accordance with their obligations thereunder, granted the Infor subsidiaries a proxy to vote their shares at any stockholder meeting convened to consider the Merger Agreement. Corporate, general, and administrative expenses for the year ended December31, 2005 include approximately $10million of costs incurred in
connection with the process surrounding a potential business combination transaction that led to the Merger Agreement with Infor.

Item4. Controls and Procedures. a Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures As of the end of the period covered by this report, our management carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of our principal executive
officer and principal financial officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures pursuant to Rule13a-15 and Rule15d-15 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended the
Exchange Act. Based on that evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of December31, 2005 to provide reasonable assurance that
information required to be disclosed in the reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SECs rules and forms. Because of its inherent limitations, a control system can provide only reasonable, and not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met and that
all control issues within our company have been detected. In addition, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risks that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions and that the degree
of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. We maintain a disclosure committee to assist the Chief Executive Officer and Chief
Financial Officer in performing the evaluation discussed above. The members of this committee include our executive officers, senior members of our finance and accounting staff and our internal counsel. b Managements Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting Managements Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting and the attestation report of BDO Seidman LLP, our independent registered public accounting firm, on managements assessment of internal control over financial

reporting that occurred during our fourth fiscal quarter ended December31, 2005, that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting, except for changes implemented in the
fourth fiscal quarter ended December31, 2005, as noted below:  We have significantly increased the monitoring controls of our international locations by our corporate location including the review of all key account reconciliations and a
secondary review of all technical accounting matters.  All key technical matters undergo secondary reviews to ensure the proper application of accounting literature including: 1 a secondary review of fixed price service revenue
calculations, 2 the determination whether services provided on individual contracts were essential to the functionality of software arrangements, 3 a secondary review of all significant multiple element arrangements, and 4 the appropriateness of
the calculations of vendor-specific objective evidence standards in accordance with Company policy.  We are engaged in on-going risk assessments including: 1 risk assessment of geographical financial results by management, 2 increased visits to international locations by
management, and 3 assessments of potential risks by management during site visits at international locations to ensure all financial reporting risks are identified in a timely manner.  We have implemented procedures to formally document the collectibility of key customer accounts prior to recognizing revenue.  We have implemented proper procedures to review any new reseller arrangements in non-U.S. locations including a proper legal and accounting review prior to revenue recognition.
