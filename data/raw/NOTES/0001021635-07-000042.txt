NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS   
1. 
Summary of Significant Accounting Policies  Organization
OGE Energy Corp. collectively, with its subsidiaries, the Company is an energy and energy services provider offering physical delivery and related services for both electricity and natural gas primarily in the south central United States. The Company conducts these activities through two business segments, the Electric Utility and the Natural Gas Pipeline segments. All significant intercompany transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.
The Electric Utility segment generates, transmits, distributes and sells electric energy in Oklahoma and western Arkansas. Its operations are conducted through Oklahoma Gas and Electric Company OGE and are subject to regulation by the Oklahoma Corporation Commission OCC, the Arkansas Public Service Commission APSC and the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission FERC. OGE was incorporated in 1902 under the laws of the Oklahoma Territory. OGE is the largest electric utility in Oklahoma and its franchised service territory includes the Fort Smith, Arkansas area. OGE sold its retail gas business in 1928 and is no longer engaged in the gas distribution business. 
The operations of the Natural Gas Pipeline segment are conducted through Enogex Inc. and its subsidiaries Enogex and consist of three related businesses: i the transportation and storage of natural gas, ii the gathering and processing of natural gas and iii the marketing of natural gas. The vast majority of Enogexs natural gas gathering, processing, transportation and storage assets are located in the major gas producing basins of Oklahoma. In May 2006, Enogex Gas Gathering, L.L.C. Gathering, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Enogex Inc., sold certain gas gathering assets in the Kinta, Oklahoma, area, which have been reported as discontinued operations in the Companys Consolidated Financial Statements see Note 8 for a further discussion. In December 2006, Enogex entered into a joint venture arrangement with a third party. The joint venture,
Atoka Midstream, LLC, intends to construct, own and operate a gathering system and processing plant and related facilities relating to production in certain areas in southeastern Oklahoma. Enogex holds its 50 percent membership interest in Atoka Midstream LLC through Enogex Atoka LLC Enogex Atoka, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Enogex Inc. Enogex Atoka will act as the managing member and operator ofthe facilities owned by the joint venture.
The Company allocates operating costs to its affiliates based on several factors. Operating costs directly related to specific affiliates are assigned to those affiliates. Where more than one affiliate benefits from certain expenditures, the costs are shared between those affiliates receiving the benefits. Operating costs incurred for the benefit of all affiliates are allocated among the affiliates, based primarily upon head-count, occupancy, usage or the Distrigas method. The Distrigas method is a three-factor formula that uses an equal weighting of payroll, net operating revenues and gross property, plant and equipment. The Company adopted the Distrigas method in January 1996 as a result of a recommendation by the OCC Staff. The Company believes this method provides a reasonable basis for allocating common expenses.
Accounting Records
The accounting records of OGE are maintained in accordance with the Uniform System of Accounts prescribed by the FERC and adopted by the OCC and the APSC. Additionally, OGE, as a regulated utility, is subject to the accounting principles prescribed by the Financial Accounting Standards Board FASB Statement of Financial Accounting Standards SFAS No. 71, Accounting for the Effects of Certain Types of Regulation. SFAS No. 71 provides that certain actual or anticipated costs that would otherwise be charged to expense can be deferred as regulatory assets, based on the expected recovery from customers in future rates. Likewise, certain actual or anticipated credits that would otherwise reduce expense can be deferred as regulatory liabilities, based on the expected flowback to customers in future rates. Managements expected recovery of
deferred costs and flowback of deferred credits generally results from specific decisions by regulators granting such ratemaking treatment. 
OGE records
certain actual or anticipated costs and obligations as regulatory assets or liabilities if it is probable, based on
regulatory orders or other available evidence, that the cost or obligation will be included in amounts allowable for
recovery or refund in future rates. 73   
The following table is a summary of OGEs regulatory assets and liabilities at December 31:

$1181  The Company adopted SFAS No. 158, Employers Accounting for Defined Benefit Pension and Other Postretirement Plans, an amendment of FASB Statements No. 87, 88, 106 and 132R, effective December 31, 2006, which requires the Company to separately disclose the items that have not yet been recognized as components of net periodic pension cost including, net loss, prior service cost and net transition obligation at December 31, 2006. For companies not subject to SFAS No. 71, SFAS No. 158 required this information to be included in Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income. However, for companies subject to SFAS No. 71, this information is allowed to be recorded as a regulatory asset if: i the utility has historically recovered and currently recovers pension and postretirement benefit plan expense in its electric rates; and ii there is no negative evidence that the existing
regulatory treatment will change. Therefore, OGE has recorded the net loss, prior service cost and net transition obligation as a regulatory asset as these expenses are probable of future recovery. If, in the future, the regulatory bodies indicated a change in policy related to the recovery of pension and postretirement benefit plan expenses, this could cause the SFAS No. 158 regulatory asset balance to be reclassified to Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income.    
The components of the SFAS No. 158 regulatory asset at December 31, 2006 are as follows:

$222  74 Income taxes recoverable from customers represent income tax benefits previously used to reduce OGEs revenues.  These amounts are being recovered in rates as the temporary differences that generated the income tax benefit turn around.  The provisions of SFAS No. 71 allowed OGE to treat these amounts as regulatory assets and liabilities and they are being amortized over the estimated remaining life of the assets to which they relate.  The income tax related regulatory assets and liabilities are netted on the Companys Consolidated Balance Sheets in the line item, Income Taxes Recoverable from Customers, Net. The OCC authorized approximately $301 million of the $328 million regulatory
asset balance at December 31, 2005 to be included in OGEs rate base for purposes of earning a return.
Unamortized loss on reacquired debt is comprised of unamortized debt issuance costs related to the early retirement of OGEs long-term debt. These amounts are being amortized over the term of the long-term debt which replaced the previous long-term debt. The unamortized loss on reacquired debt is not included in OGEs rate base and does not otherwise earn a rate of return.
As a result of the acquisition of a 77 percent interest in the 520 megawatt MW natural gas-fired combined cycle NRG McClain Station the McClain Plant completed on July 9, 2004, and consistent with the 2002 agreed-upon settlement of an OGE rate case the 2002 Settlement Agreement with the OCC, OGE had the right to accrue a regulatory asset, for a period not to exceed 12 months subsequent to the acquisition and operation of the McClain Plant, consisting of the non-fuel operation and maintenance expenses, depreciation, cost of debt associated with the investment and ad valorem taxes. At December 31, 2005, the McClain Plant regulatory asset was approximately $249 million which is being recovered over a four-year time period as authorized in the OCC rate order which began in January 2006. The OCC authorized approximately $155 million of the
$249 million regulatory asset balance at December 31, 2005 to be included in OGEs rate base for purposes of earning a return. 
In accordance with the OCC order received by OGE in December 2005 in its Oklahoma rate case, OGE was allowed to recover a certain amount of pension plan expenses. At December 31, 2006, there was approximately $147 million of expenses exceeding this level primarily related to a pension settlement charge recorded by the Company during the fourth quarter of 2006 see Note 15 for a further discussion. These excess amounts have been recorded as a regulatory asset as OGE believes these expenses are probable of future recovery. 
In January 2005, a cogeneration credit rider was implemented at OGE as part of the Oklahoma retail customer electric rates in order to return purchase power capacity payment reductions and any change in operating and maintenance expense related to cogeneration previously included in base rates to OGEs customers. The balance of the cogeneration credit rider under recovery was approximately $31 million and $37 million, respectively, at December 31, 2006 and 2005. OGEs cogeneration credit rider has been updated and approved by the OCC in December of each year through December 2006 and any over/under recovery of the cogeneration credit rider in the current year and prior periods has been automatically included in the next years rider. OGEs current cogeneration credit rider expired December 31, 2006. The 2007 cogeneration credit rider is
approximately $807 million and the total under recovery through 2006 was approximately $31 million. OGE expects to file an application with the OCC in late 2007 to request a cogeneration credit for years after 2007. The cogeneration credit rider under recovery was not included in OGEs rate base and did not otherwise earn a rate of return. The cogeneration credit rider under recovery is included in Other Current Assets on the Companys Consolidated Balance Sheets.
Fuel clause under recoveries are generated from under recoveries from OGEs customers when OGEs cost of fuel exceeds the amount billed to its customers. Fuel clause over recoveries are generated from over recoveries from OGEs customers when the amount billed to its customers exceeds OGEs cost of fuel. OGEs fuel recovery clauses are designed to smooth the impact of fuel price volatility on customers bills. As a result, OGE typically under recovers fuel cost in periods of rising prices above the baseline charge for fuel and over recovers fuel cost when prices decline below the baseline charge for fuel. Provisions in the fuel clauses allow OGE to amortize under or over recovery. In accordance with the OCC order received by OGE in December 2005 in its rate case, beginning in January 2006, OGEs mechanism
for the recovery of over or under recovered fuel costs from its customers was modified to allow interest to be applied to the over or under recovery. As described in more detail in Note 18, the OCC, in its order dated December 12, 2005, granted OGE a $423 million annual increase in the rates charged by OGE to its retail customers in Oklahoma. These increased rates became effective in January 2006 pursuant to approved tariffs filed with the OCC. In January 2007, OGE
determined that the approved tariffs had inadvertently
authorized OGE to collect, and OGE had collected, approximately $267 million of additional fuel-related revenues
during 2006 that was not intended by the December 12, 2005 order. As a result, OGE filed with the OCC in January 2007
amendments to its previously-authorized tariffs, in order to cease recovery of the fuel-related revenues not intended by the
December 12, 2005 order. The $267 million, plus $12 million of interest, was recorded as a liability under Fuel Clause Over
Recoveries on the Consolidated Balance Sheet in the fourth quarter of 2006, 
75 and such amounts, along with other Fuel Clause Over
Recoveries, will be credited to OGEs Oklahoma customers in 2007 and 2008 through OGEs automatic fuel adjustment
clause. In addition, OGE recorded a reduction in operating revenues of approximately $267 million and an
increase in interest expense of approximately $05 million, which resulted in an after tax reduction in net income of
approximately $167 million in the fourth quarter of 2006. Because the rate increase authorized in the December 2005 order
was not implemented until January 2006 and the tariffs were corrected effective December 31, 2006, the $267 million had no
impact on net income for the year ended December 31, 2006. See additional discussion in Supplementary Data 
Interim Consolidated Financial Information Unaudited. 
Accrued removal obligations represent asset retirement costs previously recovered from ratepayers for other than legal obligations. In accordance with SFAS No. 143, Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations, OGE was required to reclassify its accrued removal obligations, which had previously been recorded as a liability in Accumulated Depreciation, to a regulatory liability.
During 2004, OGE sold assets including its interest in certain natural gas producing properties and the sale of land near the Companys principal executive offices for a gain of approximately $35 million. During 2005, OGE sold certain assets for a gain of approximately $03 million. In December 2005, the OCC order in OGEs Oklahoma rate case required that any previously recognized gain in 2004 related to the sale of assets should be returned to customers through electric rates at a rate of approximately $13 million annually. During 2005, OGE reversed these gains and reclassified them to Other Deferred Credits and Other Liabilities as a regulatory liability. OGE recorded gains from the sale of assets in 2005 and 2006 in a similar manner and expects to continue that treatment for future gains from the sale of assets.
Management continuously monitors the future recoverability of regulatory assets. When in managements judgment future recovery becomes impaired, the amount of the regulatory asset is reduced or written off, as appropriate. If the Company were required to discontinue the application of SFAS No. 71 for some or all of its operations, it could result in writing off the related regulatory assets; the financial effects of which could be significant.
Use of Estimates
In preparing the Consolidated Financial
Statements, management is required to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and
disclosure of contingent assets and contingent liabilities at the date of the Consolidated Financial Statements and the reported
amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Changes to these assumptions and estimates could have a material affect
on the Companys Consolidated Financial Statements particularly as they relate to pension expense and impairment estimates.
However, the Company believes it has taken reasonable, but conservative, positions where assumptions and estimates are used in order
to minimize the negative financial impact to the Company that could result if actual results vary from the assumptions and estimates.
In managements opinion, the areas of the Company where the most significant judgment is exercised is in the valuation of pension
plan assumptions, impairment estimates, contingency reserves, asset retirement obligations, fair value and cash flow hedges, regulatory assets and liabilities, unbilled
revenues for OGE, operating revenues for Enogex, natural gas purchases for Enogex, the allowance for uncollectible accounts receivable and
the valuation of energy purchase and sale contracts.
Cash and Cash Equivalents
For purposes of the Consolidated Financial Statements, the Company considers all highly liquid debt instruments purchased with an original maturity of three months or less to be cash equivalents. These investments are carried at cost, which approximates fair value.
The Companys cash management program utilizes controlled disbursement banking arrangements. Outstanding checks in excess of cash balances were approximately $450 million and $550 million at December 31, 2006 and 2005, respectively, and are classified as Accounts Payable in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Sufficient funds were available to fund these outstanding checks when they were presented for payment.
Allowance for Uncollectible Accounts Receivable
For OGE, customer balances
are generally written off if not collected within six months after the final billing date. The allowance for uncollectible
accounts receivable for OGE is calculated by multiplying the last six months of electric revenue by the provision rate.
The provision rate is based on a 12-month historical average of actual balances written off. To the extent the historical
collection rates are not representative of future collections, there could be an effect on the amount of uncollectible expense
recognized. The allowance for uncollectible accounts receivable for Enogex is calculated based on outstanding accounts receivable
balances over 180 days old. In addition, other outstanding accounts receivable balances less 76 than 180 days old are reserved on a
case-by-case basis when the Company believes the required payment of specific amounts owed is unlikely to
occur. The allowance for uncollectible accounts receivable was approximately $44 million and $37 million at December 31, 2006
and 2005, respectively.
For OGE, new business customers are required to provide a security deposit in the form of cash, bond or irrevocable letter of credit that is refunded when the account is closed. New residential customers, whose outside credit scores indicate risk, are required to provide a security deposit that is refunded after 12 months of good payment history based on the applicable utility regulation. The payment behavior of all existing customers is continuously monitored and if, the payment behavior indicates sufficient risk within the meaning of the applicable utility regulation, customers will be required to provide a security deposit.
For Enogex, credit risk is the risk of financial loss to Enogex if counterparties fail to perform their contractual obligations. Enogex maintains credit policies with regard to its counterparties that management believes minimize overall credit risk. These policies include the evaluation of a potential counterpartys financial condition including credit rating, collateral requirements under certain circumstances and the use of standardized agreements which provide for the netting of cash flows associated with a single counterparty. Enogex also monitors the financial condition of existing counterparties on an ongoing basis.
Fuel Inventories
OGE
Fuel inventories for the generation of electricity consist of coal, natural gas and oil. These inventories are accounted for under the last-in, first-out LIFO cost method. The estimated replacement cost of fuel inventories was higher than the stated LIFO cost by approximately $137 million and $191 million for 2006 and 2005, respectively, based on the average cost of fuel purchased. The amount of fuel inventory was approximately $297 million and $279 million at December 31, 2006 and 2005, respectively.
Enogex
Natural gas inventory is held by Enogex
Inc. and OGE Energy Resources, Inc. OERI. Enogex Inc. maintains of natural gas inventory to provide operational support for
its pipeline deliveries. As part of its recurring business activity, OERI injects and withdraws natural gas in to and out of inventory
under the terms of its storage capacity contracts. In order to mitigate market price exposures, OERI enters into contracts or hedging
instruments to protect the cash flows associated with its inventory. OERI has elected not to designate inventory hedging contracts as
fair value or cash flow hedges under SFAS No. 133, Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities, as amended.
The fair value of the hedging instruments is recorded on the books of OERI as a Price Risk Management asset or liability with an offsetting
gain or loss recorded in current earnings. All natural gas inventory held by Enogex is recorded at the lower of cost or market. During 2006,
Enogex recorded write-downs to market value related to natural gas storage inventory of approximately $187 million.
The amount of Enogexs natural gas inventory was approximately $359 million and $357 million at December 31, 2006 and 2005,
respectively. Natural gas storage inventory is presented in Fuel Inventories on the Consolidated Balance Sheets and in Cost of Goods Sold
on the Consolidated Statements of Income.
Gas Imbalances
Gas imbalances occur when the actual amounts
of natural gas delivered from or received by Enogexs pipeline system differ from the amounts scheduled to be delivered or received.
Imbalances are due to or due from shippers and operators and can be settled in cash or made up in-kind. Enogex values all imbalances at an average of current market indices applicable to Enogexs operations, not to exceed net realizable value. Also included in Gas Imbalances on the Consolidated Balance Sheets are planned or managed imbalances related to OERIs business, referred to as park and loan transactions. Park and loan assets were approximately $157 million at December 31, 2005 and park and loan liabilities were approximately $102 million at December 31, 2005. There were no park and loan assets or liabilities at December 31, 2006. Operational imbalance assets were approximately $28
million and $163 million, respectively, at December 31, 2006 and 2005 and operational imbalance liabilities were approximately $111 million and $258 million, respectively, at December 31, 2006 and 2005. 
77 Property, Plant and Equipment
OGE
All property, plant and equipment are recorded at cost. Newly constructed plant is added to plant balances at cost which includes contracted services, direct labor, materials, overhead, transportation costs and the allowance for funds used during construction AFUDC. Replacements of units of property are capitalized as plant. For assets that belong to a common plant account, the replaced plant is removed from plant balances and the cost of such property less net salvage is charged to Accumulated Depreciation. For assets that do not belong to a common plant account, the replaced plant is removed from plant balances with the related accumulated depreciation and the remaining balance is recorded as a loss in the Consolidated Statements of Income as Other Expense. Repair and replacement of minor items of property are included in the Consolidated Statements of Income as Other
Operation and Maintenance Expense.
OGE owns a 77 percent in the McClain Plant and, as disclosed below, only OGEs 77 percent interest is reflected in the balances in the table below. The owner of the remaining 23 percent interest in the McClain Plant is the Oklahoma Municipal Power Authority OMPA. OGE and the OMPA are responsible for providing their own financing of capital expenditures. Also, only OGEs proportionate interest of any direct expenses of the McClain Plant such as fuel, maintenance expense and other operating expenses is included in the applicable financial statements captions in the Consolidated Statements of Income. The balance of OGEs interest in the McClain Plant asset is approximately $1762 million and $1740 million, respectively, at December 31, 2006 and 2005. The accumulated depreciation associated with OGEs interest in the McClain
Plant is approximately $249 million and $143 million, respectively, at December 31, 2006 and 2005.
Enogex
All property, plant and equipment are recorded at cost. Newly constructed plant is added to plant balances at cost which includes contracted services, direct labor, materials, overhead, transportation costs and capitalized interest. Replacements of units of property are capitalized as plant. For assets that belong to a common plant account, the replaced plant is removed from plant balances and charged to Accumulated Depreciation. For assets that do not belong to a common plant account, the replaced plant is removed from plant balances with the related accumulated depreciation and the remaining balance is recorded as a loss in the Consolidated Statements of Income as Other Expense. Repair and removal costs are included in the Consolidated Statements of Income as Other Operation and Maintenance Expense.
The Companys property, plant and equipment are divided into the following major classes at December 31, 2006 and 2005, respectively.

OGE
The provision for depreciation, which was approximately 27 percent and 30 percent, respectively, of the average depreciable utility plant for 2006 and 2005, is provided on a straight-line method over the estimated service life of the utility assets. Depreciation is provided at the unit level for production plant and at the account or sub-account level for all other plant, and is based on the average life group method. In 2007, the provision for depreciation is projected to be approximately 27 percent of the average depreciable utility plant. Amortization of intangibles other than debt costs is computed using the straight-line method. Approximately 81 percent of the amortizable intangible plant balance at December 31, 2006 will be amortized over three years with the remaining intangible plant being amortized over their respective lives ranging up to 25 years.
Enogex
Depreciation is computed principally on the straight-line method using estimated useful lives of three to 83 years for transportation and storage assets, three to 30 years for gathering and processing assets and three to 10 years for marketing assets. Amortization of intangibles other than debt costs is computed using the straight-line method over the respective lives of the intangibles ranging up to 20 years.
Impairment of Assets
The Company assesses potential impairments of assets or asset groups when there is evidence that events or changes in circumstances require an analysis of the recoverability of an asset or asset group. For purposes of recognition and measurement of an impairment loss, a long-lived asset or assets shall be grouped with other assets and liabilities at the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are largely independent of the cash flows of other assets and liabilities. Estimates of future cash flows used to test the recoverability of a long-lived asset or asset group shall include only the future cash flows cash inflows less associated cash outflows that are directly associated with and that are expected to arise as a direct result of the use and eventual disposition of the asset or asset group. The fair value of these assets is based on third-party evaluations, prices for
similar assets, historical data and projected cash flow. An impairment loss is recognized when the sum of the expected future net cash flows is less than the carrying amount of the asset. The amount of any recognized impairment is based on the estimated fair value of the asset subject to impairment compared to the carrying amount of such asset. Enogex expects to continue to evaluate the strategic fit and financial performance of each of its assets in an effort to ensure a proper economic allocation of resources. The magnitude and timing of any potential impairment or gain on the disposition of any assets is not known at this time. Allowance for Funds Used During Construction
For OGE, AFUDC is calculated according to the FERC pronouncements for the imputed cost of equity and borrowed funds. AFUDC, a non-cash item, is reflected as a credit in the Consolidated Statements of Income and as a charge to Construction Work in Progress in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. AFUDC rates, compounded semi-annually, were 779 percent, 378 percent and 499 percent for the years 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. The increase in the AFUDC rates in 2006 was primarily due to increased equity funds in the AFUDC calculation that resulted from a higher level of construction costs partially offset by a lower level of short-term borrowings in 2006. Revenue Recognition
OGE
OGE reads its customers meters and sends bills to its customers throughout each month. As a result, there is a significant amount of customers electricity consumption that has not been billed at the end of each month. An amount is accrued as a receivable for this unbilled revenue based on estimates of usage and prices during the period. The estimates that management uses in this calculation could vary from the actual amounts to be paid by customers.
Enogex
Operating revenues for transportation,
storage, gathering and processing services for Enogex are recorded each month based on the current months estimated volumes,
contracted prices considering current commodity prices, historical seasonal fluctuations and any known adjustments. The estimates are
reversed in the following month and customers are 
79 billed on actual volumes and contracted prices. Gas sales are calculated on current month
nominations and contracted prices. Operating revenues associated with the production of natural gas liquids are estimated based on current
month estimated production and contracted prices. These amounts are reversed in the following month and the customers are billed on actual
production and contracted prices. Estimated operating revenues are reflected in Accounts Receivable, Net on the Consolidated Balance Sheets and
in Operating Revenues on the
Consolidated Statements of Income.
Estimates for gas purchases are based on sales volumes and contracted purchase prices. Estimated gas purchases are included in Accounts Payable on the Consolidated Balance Sheets and in Cost of Goods Sold on the Consolidated Statements of Income.
The Company recognizes revenue from natural gas gathering, processing, transportation and storage services to third parties as services are provided. Revenue associated with natural gas liquids is recognized when the production is sold. Substantially all of OERIs natural gas contracts qualify as derivatives and, therefore, are accounted for at fair value as prescribed in SFAS No. 133. Under fair value accounting, fixed-price forwards, swaps, options, futures and other financial instruments with third parties are recorded at estimated fair market values, net of reserves, with the corresponding market changes in fair value recognized in earnings and offsetting amounts recorded as Price Risk Management assets, liabilities or against the brokerage deposits in Other Current Assets in the Consolidated Balance Sheets.
Automatic Fuel Adjustment Clauses
Variances in the actual cost of fuel used in electric generation and certain purchased power costs, as compared to the fuel component in the cost-of-service for ratemaking, are passed through to OGEs customers through automatic fuel adjustment clauses, which are subject to periodic review by the OCC, the APSC and the FERC.
Stock-Based Compensation
The Company adopted SFAS No. 123 Revised, Share-Based Payment, using the modified prospective transition method, effective January 1, 2006, which required the Company to measure and recognize the cost of employee services received in exchange for an award of equity instruments based on the grant date fair value of the award. See Note 3 for a further discussion related to the Companys stock-based compensation. The following table reflects pro forma net income and income per average common share for 2005 and 2004 had the Company elected to adopt the fair value recognition provisions of SFAS No. 123, Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation, for options granted under the Companys stock-based employee compensation plans. For purposes of this pro forma disclosure, the value of the options was determined using a Black-Scholes option pricing formula and
amortized to expense over the options vesting periods. Pro forma information is not included for 2006 as all share-based payments have been accounted for under SFAS No. 123R.

The Company adopted certain provisions of SFAS No. 158 effective December 31, 2006, which requires the Company to separately disclose the items that have not yet been recognized as components of net periodic pension cost including, net loss, prior service cost and net transition obligation at December 31, 2006. The below amounts exclude amounts related to OGE, since under SFAS No. 71, OGE is allowed to record these expenses as a regulatory asset see Note 1 for a future discussion. Accumulated other comprehensive loss included an after tax loss of approximately $214 million $349 million pre-tax and $34 million $56 million pre-tax at December 31, 2006 related to the net loss and prior service cost of its defined benefit pension plan, respectively. Accumulated other comprehensive loss included an after tax loss of approximately $54 million $117 million pre-tax 08 million $12 million pre-tax and $07 million $12 million pre-tax at December 31, 2006 related to the net loss, net transition obligation and prior service cost of its defined benefit postretirement plans, respectively.

Accumulated other comprehensive loss included an after tax loss of approximately $911 million $1486 million pre-tax at December 31, 2005 related to a minimum pension liability adjustment based on a review of the funded status of the Companys pension plan by the Companys actuarial consultants as of December 31, 2005.
Environmental Costs
Accruals for
environmental costs are recognized when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the liability
can be reasonably estimated. Costs are charged to expense or deferred as a regulatory asset based on expected recovery
from customers in future rates, if they relate to the remediation of conditions caused by past operations or if they are
not expected to mitigate or prevent contamination from future operations. Where environmental expenditures relate to facilities
currently in use, such as pollution control equipment, the costs may be capitalized and depreciated over the future service periods.
Estimated remediation costs are recorded at undiscounted amounts, independent of any insurance or rate recovery, based on prior
experience, assessments and current technology. Accrued obligations are regularly adjusted as environmental assessments and estimates are revised, and remediation efforts proceed. For sites where OGE and Enogex 
81 have been designated as one of several potentially responsible parties, the amount accrued represents OGEs and Enogexs estimated share of the cost.
Reclassifications
Certain prior year amounts have been reclassified on the Consolidated Financial Statements to conform to the 2006 presentation primarily related to discontinued operations.

Accounting Pronouncements  In July 2006, the FASB issued FASB Interpretation No. 48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes, an interpretation of FASB Statement No. 109, which clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in an enterprises financial statements in accordance with SFAS No. 109, Accounting for Income Taxes. This interpretation prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. This interpretation also provides guidance on derecognition, classification, interest and penalties, accounting in interim periods, disclosure and transition. This interpretation is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2006. The Company adopted this new interpretation effective January 1, 2007. As prescribed in the
interpretation, the cumulative effect of applying the provisions of FIN No. 48 shall be reflected as an adjustment to the opening balance of Stockholders Equity. The Company estimates that this cumulative effect will be between approximately $3 million and $5 million. The Company also anticipates additional interest expense will be incurred during 2007 related to the method of accounting used to capitalize costs for self-constructed assets see Note 10 for a further discussion. 
In September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 157, Fair Value Measurements, which defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value in generally accepted accounting principles and expands disclosures about fair value measurements. SFAS No. 157 expands disclosures about the use of fair value to measure assets and liabilities in interim and annual periods subsequent to initial recognition. The guidance in SFAS No. 157 applies to derivatives and other financial instruments measured at fair value under SFAS No. 133 at initial recognition and in all subsequent periods. Therefore, SFAS No. 157 nullifies the guidance in footnote 3 of Emerging Issues Task Force Issue No. 02-3, Issues Involved in Accounting for Derivative Contracts Held for Trading Purposes and Contracts Involved in Energy Trading and Risk Management Activities. SFAS No. 157 also amends
SFAS No. 133 to remove the guidance similar to that nullified in EITF 02-3. SFAS No. 157 is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2007, and interim periods within those fiscal years. The provisions of SFAS No. 157 should be applied prospectively as of the beginning of the fiscal year in which it is initially applied, except in certain conditions. The Company will adopt this new standard effective January 1, 2008. Management has not yet determined what the impact of this new standard will be on its consolidated financial position or results of operations.
In September 2006, the FASB issued
SFAS No. 158 which requires an employer to: i recognize the overfunded or underfunded status of a defined benefit postretirement plan
other than a multiemployer plan as an asset or liability in its statement of financial position and to recognize changes in that
funded status in the year in which the changes occur through comprehensive income of a business entity; and ii to measure the fair
value of the funded status of a plan as of the date of its year-end statement of financial position, with limited exceptions.
The requirement to initially recognize the funded status of the defined benefit postretirement plan and the disclosure requirements
are effective for the year ended December 31, 2006 for the Company. The requirement to measure plan
assets and benefit obligations at fair value in accordance with SFAS No. 157 as of the date of the employers fiscal year-end
statement of financial position is effective for fiscal years ending after December 15, 2008. The Company adopted provision i
above of this new standard effective December 31, 2006. At December 31, 2006, the projected benefit obligation and fair value of
assets of the Companys pension plan and restoration of retirement income plan was approximately $5850 million and $5194
million, respectively, for an underfunded status of approximately $656 million. Also, at December 31, 2006, the accumulated
postretirement benefit obligation and fair value of assets of the Companys postretirement benefit plans was approximately
$2254 million and $740 million, respectively, for an underfunded status of approximately $1514
million. The above amounts have been recorded in Accrued Pension and Benefit Obligations with the offset in Accumulated Other
Comprehensive Loss except OGEs portion which is recorded as a regulatory asset as discussed in Note 1 in the
Companys Consolidated Balance Sheet. The Company will adopt provision ii above of this new standard effective
December 31, 2008. Management has not yet determined what the impact of provision ii of this new standard will be
on its consolidated financial position or results of operations.

Stock-Based Compensation  On January 21, 1998, the Company adopted a Stock Incentive Plan the 1998 Plan. In 2003, the Company adopted, and its shareowners approved, a new Stock Incentive Plan the 2003 Plan and together with the 1998 Plan, the Plans. The 2003 Plan replaced the 1998 Plan and no further awards will be granted under the 1998 Plan. As under the 1998 Plan, under the 2003 Plan, restricted stock, stock options, stock appreciation rights and performance units may be granted to officers, directors and other key employees. The Company has authorized the issuance of up to 2,700,000 shares under the 2003 Plan. 
Prior to January 1, 2006, the Company accounted for the Plans under the recognition and measurement provisions of Accounting Principles Board APB Opinion No. 25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees, as permitted by SFAS No. 123. The Company also previously adopted the disclosure provisions under SFAS No. 123 and SFAS No. 148, Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation Transition and Disclosure. The Company recorded compensation expense of approximately $09 million pre-tax $05 million after tax and $35 million pre-tax $21 million after tax in 2005 and 2004, respectively, related to its performance units in Other Operation and Maintenance Expense in the Consolidated Statements of Income. No compensation expense related to stock options was recognized in 2005 or 2004 as all options granted under those plans had an exercise price
equal to the market value of the Companys common stock on the grant date. Effective January 1, 2006, the Company adopted SFAS No. 123R using the modified prospective transition method. Under that transition method, compensation cost recognized in the first quarter of 2006 included: i compensation cost for all share-based payments granted prior to, but not yet vested as of January 1, 2006, based on the fair value calculated in accordance with the provisions of SFAS No. 123R; and ii compensation cost for all share-based payments granted in the first quarter of 2006 based on the fair value calculated in accordance with the provisions of SFAS No. 123R. Results for prior periods were not restated.
As a result of adopting SFAS No. 123R on January 1, 2006, the Company recorded a cumulative effect adjustment of approximately $04 million pre-tax $02 million after tax, or less than $001 per basic and diluted share on January 1, 2006 for outstanding non-vested share-based compensation grants at December 31, 2005, which is not included in the amounts discussed below. The Company determined that the cumulative effect adjustment was immaterial for presentation purposes and is, therefore, included in Other Operation and Maintenance Expense in the Consolidated Statement of Income. The Company recorded compensation expense of approximately $86 million pre-tax $53 million after tax, or $006 per basic and diluted share in 2006 related to the Companys share-based payments.
Prior to the adoption of SFAS No. 123R, the Company presented all tax benefits of deductions resulting from the exercise of stock options or other share-based payments as operating cash flows in the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. SFAS No. 123R requires cash flows resulting in tax benefits from tax deductions in excess of the compensation cost recognized for share-based payments excess tax benefits to be classified as financing cash flows. The Company recorded an excess tax benefit of approximately $28 million in 2006 related to the Companys 2006 share-based payments, which amount will be presented as a financing cash inflow and realized when the Companys 2006 income tax return is completed in 2007. The Company realized an excess tax benefit of approximately $14 million in 2006 related to the Companys 2005 share-based payments, which
amount was presented as a financing cash inflow and realized when the Companys 2005 income tax return was filed in August 2006. The Company realized an excess tax benefit of approximately $08 million during 2005 related to the Companys 2004 share-based payments. The Company did not realize an excess tax benefit during 2004 related to the Companys 2003 share-based payments.  Performance Units
Under the Plans, the Company has issued performance units which represent the value of one share of the Companys common stock. The performance units provide for accelerated vesting if there is a change in control as defined in the Plans. Each performance unit is subject to forfeiture if the recipient terminates employment with the Company or a subsidiary prior to the end of the three-year award cycle for any reason other than death, disability or retirement. In the event of death, disability or retirement, a participant will receive a prorated payment based on such participants number of full months of service during the three-year award cycle, further adjusted based on the achievement of the performance goals during the award cycle. The following table is a summary of the terms of the Companys outstanding performance units awarded during 2004, 2005 and 2006. 83

The performance units granted based on total shareholder return TSR are contingently awarded and will be payable in cash or shares of the Companys common stock other than performance units awarded in 2006, which will be payable only in shares of common stock subject to the condition that the number of performance units, if any, earned by the employees upon the expiration of a three-year award cycle is dependent on the Companys TSR ranking relative to a peer group of companies. The performance units granted based on earnings per share EPS are contingently awarded and will be payable in cash or shares of the Companys common stock other than performance units awarded in 2006, which will be payable only in shares of common stock based on the Companys EPS growth over a three-year award cycle compared to a target set at the time of the
grant by the Compensation Committee of the Companys Board of Directors. If there is no or only a partial payout for the performance units at the end of the three-year award cycle, the unearned performance units are cancelled. During 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively, the Company awarded 239,856, 201,794 and 162,591 performance units to certain employees of the Company and its subsidiaries. 
Performance Units Total Shareholder Return
The Company recorded compensation expense of approximately $65 million pre-tax $40 million after tax in 2006 related to the performance units based on TSR.  The Company recorded compensation expense of approximately $06 million pre-tax $04 million after tax and $36 million pre-tax $22 million after tax in 2005 and 2004, respectively, related to the performance units based on TSR. The fair value of the performance units based on TSR was estimated on the grant date using a lattice-based valuation model that factors in information, including the expected dividend yield, expected price volatility, risk-free interest rate and the probable outcome of the market condition, over the expected life of the performance units. Compensation expense for the performance units settled in stock is a fixed amount determined at the grant date fair value and is recognized over the three-year
award cycle regardless of whether performance units are awarded at the end of the award cycle. Compensation expense for the performance units settled in cash is based on the change in the fair value of the performance units for each reporting period. This liability for the performance units will be remeasured at each reporting date until the date of settlement. Dividends are not accrued or paid during the performance period and, therefore, are not included in the fair value calculation. Expected price volatility is based on the historical volatility of the Companys common stock for the past three years and was simulated using the Geometric Brownian Motion process. The risk-free interest rate for the performance unit grants is based on the three-year U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect at the time of the grant. The expected life of the units is based on the non-vested period since inception of the three-year award cycle. There are no post-vesting restrictions related to
the Companys performance units based on TSR. The fair value of the performance units based on TSR was calculated based on the following assumptions at the grant date.

FOf the 307,418 performance units not vested at December 31, 2006, 267,650 performance units are assumed to vest at the end of the applicable vesting period. At December 31, 2006, there was approximately $37 million in unrecognized compensation cost related to non-vested performance units based on TSR which is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of 161 years. Performance Units Earnings Per Share The Company recorded compensation expense of approximately $20 million pre-tax $12 million after tax in 2006 related to the performance units based on EPS. The Company recorded compensation expense of approximately $05 million pre-tax $03 million after tax in 2005 related to the performance units based on EPS. No compensation expense related to performance units based on EPS was recognized in 2004 as the 2004 performance units did not have an EPS component. The fair value of the performance units based on EPS is based on grant date fair value which is equivalent to the price of one share of the Companys common stock on the date of grant. The fair value of performance units based on EPS varies as the number of performance units that will vest is based on the grant date fair value of the units and the probable outcome of the performance condition. The Company reassesses
at each reporting date whether achievement of the performance condition is probable and accrues compensation expense if and when achievement of the performance condition is probable. As a result, the compensation expense recognized for these performance units can vary from period to period. There are no post-vesting restrictions related to the Companys performance units based on EPS. The grant date fair value of the 2005 and 2006 performance units was $2378 and $2800, respectively. A summary of the
activity for the Companys performance units based on EPS at December 31, 2006 and changes during 2006 are
summarized in the following table. Following the end of a three-year performance period, payout of the 85 performance units based on EPS growth is determined by the Companys growth in EPS for such period compared
to a target set at the beginning of the three-year period by the Compensation Committee of the Companys Board of
Directors and payout requires the approval of the Compensation Committee. Payouts, if any, are made in two-thirds
stock and one-third cash other than payouts of performance units awarded in 2006, which will be made only in common stock
and are considered made when approved by the Compensation Committee.

At December 31, 2006, there was approximately $26 million in unrecognized compensation cost related to non-vested performance units based on EPS which is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of 17 years. StockOptions The Company recorded compensation expense of approximately $01 million pre-tax less than $01 million after tax in 2006 related to stock options. During 2006 and 2005, no stock options were granted under the 2003 Plan. During 2004, 380,400 stock options were granted under the 2003 Plan. Compensation expense for the non-vested stock options at December 31, 2005 was a fixed amount determined at the grant date fair value and was recognized over the remaining vesting period during 2006. No compensation expense related to stock options was recognized in 2005 or 2004 as all options granted under those plans had an exercise price equal to the market value of the Companys common stock on the grant date. The Company accounts for stock option grants as separate grants. The options granted under the Plans vest in one-third annual installments beginning one year from the date of grant
and have a contractual life of 10 years. Each option is subject to forfeiture if the recipient terminates employment with the Company or a subsidiary for any reason other than death, disability or retirement. Dividends are not paid or accrued on unexercised options. The options provide for accelerated vesting if there is a change in control as defined in the Plans. The fair value of each option grant under the Plans is estimated on the grant date using the Black-Scholes option pricing model that factors in information, including the expected dividend yield, expected price volatility and risk-free interest rate. The fair value was $205 at the grant date for the stock options that are not fully vested at December 31, 2006 and was calculated based on the following assumptions at the grant date. 86

new shares to satisfy stock option exercises. The Company received approximately $145 million in 2006 related to
exercised stock options. The Company recorded an excess tax benefit of approximately $28 million in 2006 related
to the Companys 2006 share-based payments, which amount will be presented as a financing cash inflow and realized
when the Companys 2006 income tax return is completed in 2007. The Company realized an excess tax benefit of
approximately $14 million in 2006 related to the Companys 2005 share-based payments, which amount was presented
as a financing cash inflow and realized when the Companys 2005 income tax return was filed in August 2006.
The Company realized an excess tax benefit of approximately $08 million during 2005 related to the Companys 2004 share-based payments. The Company did
not realize a excess tax benefit during 2004 related to the Companys 2003 share-based payments.   
4. 
Asset Retirement Obligations  In accordance with SFAS No.
143 for periods subsequent to the initial measurement of an asset retirement obligations ARO, an entity shall
recognize period-to-period changes in the liability for an ARO resulting from: i the passage of time; and ii revisions
to either the timing or the amount of the original estimate of undiscounted cash flows. During the second quarter of 2006,
the Company reviewed its initial ARO valuations and determined that there were changes in the liability of the ARO related
to power plant structure legal obligations resulting from revisions to the amount of the original estimate of undiscounted
cash flows. As a result, an ARO of approximately $10 million was recognized as an increase in the carrying amount of the
liability for an ARO and an increase in the related asset retirement cost capitalized as part of the carrying amount of the related
long-lived asset with no effect on net income. There were no changes made to previously recorded AROs during the
last six months of 2006. Also, in the fourth quarter of 2006, OGE recorded an additional ARO for approximately
$09 million related to its Centennial wind farm. Beginning January 1, 2007, OGE will amortize the remaining
value of the related ARO asset over the estimated remaining life of 99 years. The Company has also 87 identified other AROs
that have not been recorded because the Company determined that these assets have indefinite lives primarily related to
Enogexs processing plants and compression sites.    
5. 
Loss on Retirement and Asset Retirement Obligation of Fixed Assets  OGE had a power supply contract with a large industrial customer which expired June 1, 2006. In conjunction with the expiration of this contract, OGE evaluated options to utilize the assets dedicated to that customer, which resulted in the decision to retire these assets as of June 30, 2006. The carrying amount of these assets at June 30, 2006 was approximately $68 million, which was recorded as a pre-tax loss during the second quarter of 2006. This loss was included in Other Expense in the Consolidated Statement of Income. Also, as part of the settlement of the ARO for these assets, OGE recorded a reduction to the previously recorded ARO for these assets of approximately $09 million in 2006 due to an agreement with a third party to provide removal and remediation services. This reduction is included in Other Expense in the Consolidated Statement of Income.   
6. 
Asset Sales  During September 2004, Enogex received notification from a customer that a transportation agreement involving four of Enogexs non-contiguous pipeline asset segments located in West Texas and used to serve the customers power plants would be terminated effective December 31, 2004. In response to this notification, the Company recognized, during the third quarter of 2004, a pre-tax impairment loss of approximately $86 million in the Natural Gas Pipeline segment related to Enogex natural gas pipeline assets that were used to provide service to this customer. In December 2004, the Company received notification that all of this customers plants in West Texas were shut down and service was no longer required. In November 2006, Enogex sold the four non-contiguous pipeline asset segments for approximately $10 million. Enogex recognized a pre-tax gain of approximately $10
million in the fourth quarter of 2006 related to the sale of these assets. These assets were part of the Natural Gas Pipeline segment.   
7. 
Price Risk Management Assets and Liabilities  Non-Trading Activities The Company periodically utilizes derivative contracts to manage the exposure of its assets to unfavorable changes in commodity prices, as well as to reduce exposure to adverse interest rate fluctuations. During 2006 and 2005, the Companys use of non-trading price risk management instruments involved the use of commodity price futures, commodity price swap contracts, interest rate swap agreements and treasury lock agreements. The commodity price futures, commodity price swap contracts and interest rate swap agreements involved the exchange of fixed price or rate payments in exchange for floating price or rate payments over the life of the instrument without an exchange of the underlying principal amount. The treasury lock agreements in late 2005 protected against the variability of future interest payments of long-term debt that was issued by OGE in January 2006 and the
treasury lock agreement in November 2006 is to protect against the variability of future interest payments of long-term debt that is expected to be issued during the first half of 2007. In accordance
with SFAS No. 133, the Company recognizes its non-exchange traded derivative instruments as Price Risk Management
assets or liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheets at fair value with such amounts classified as current or
long-term based on their anticipated settlement. Exchange traded transactions are settled on a net basis daily through margin accounts with a clearing broker and, therefore, are recorded at fair value on a net basis in Other Current Assets in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. The accounting for changes in the fair value of a derivative depends on the intended use of the derivative and resulting designation. For derivative instruments that are designated and qualify as a fair value hedge, the gain or loss on the derivative instrument is recognized in current earnings on the same line item as the gain or loss recorded for the change in the fair value of the hedged item. For derivatives that are designated and qualify as a cash flow hedge, the effective portion of the change in fair value of the derivative instrument is reported as a component of Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income and recognized into earnings in the same period during which the hedged transaction affects earnings. The ineffective portio n
of a
derivatives change in fair value is recognized currently in earnings. Forecasted transactions designated as the
hedged item in a cash flow hedge are regularly evaluated to assess whether they continue to be probable of occurring.
If the forecasted transactions are no longer probable of occurring, hedge accounting will cease on a prospective basis
and all future changes in the fair value of the derivative will be recognized directly in earnings. If the forecasted
transactions are no longer reasonably possible of occurring, any associated amounts recorded in Accumulated Other
Comprehensive Income will also be recognized directly in earnings. The Company may designate certain
derivative instruments for the purchase or sale of physical commodities, purchase or sale of electric power and fuel procurement as
normal purchases and normal sales contracts under the provisions 88 of SFAS No. 133. Normal purchases and normal sales contracts are not
recorded in Price Risk Management assets or liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheets and earnings recognition is recorded in the
period in which physical delivery of the commodity occurs. The Company applies normal purchases and normal sales to: i commodity
contracts for the purchase and sale of natural gas by its subsidiaries, Enogex Inc. and Enogex Gas Gathering, L.L.C.; ii commodity contracts
for the sale of natural gas liquids produced by its subsidiary, Enogex Products Corporation Products; iii electric power
contracts by OGE; and iv fuel procurement by OGE. At December 31, 2006 and 2005, the Company had no outstanding interest rate swap agreements. At December 31, 2006, OGEs treasury lock agreement has been designated as a cash flow hedge under SFAS No. 133. At December 31, 2005, OGE had two separate treasury lock agreements designated as cash flow hedges under SFAS No. 133, which were terminated on January 6, 2006 after OGE issued long-term debt. The Company measures ineffectiveness of the cash flow hedges under the hypothetical derivative method prescribed by SFAS No. 133. Under the hypothetical derivative method, the Company has designated that the critical terms of the hedging instrument are the same as the critical terms of the hypothetical derivative used to value the forecasted transaction, and, as a result, no ineffectiveness is expected.  Trading Activities The Company, through its subsidiary, OERI, engages in energy trading activities primarily related to the purchase and sale of natural gas. Contracts utilized in these activities generally include forward swap contracts as well as over-the-counter and exchange traded futures and options. Energy trading activities are accounted for in accordance with SFAS No. 133 and EITF Issue No. 02-3. In accordance with SFAS No. 133, financial instruments that qualify as derivatives are reflected at fair value with the resulting unrealized gains and losses recorded as Price Risk Management assets or liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheets, classified as current or long-term based on their anticipated settlement or against the brokerage deposits in Other Current Assets. Unrealized gains and losses from changes in the market value of open contracts are included in Natural Gas Pipeline Operating
Revenues in the Consolidated Statements of Income. Energy trading contracts resulting in delivery of a commodity that meet the requirements of EITF Issue No. 99-19, Reporting Revenues Gross as a Principal or Net as an Agent, are included as sales or purchases in the Consolidated Statements of Income depending on whether the contract relates to the sale or purchase of the commodity. In accordance with FASB Interpretation No. 39 As Amended, Offsetting of Amounts Related to Certain Contracts an interpretation of APB Opinion No. 10 and FASB Statement No. 105, fair value amounts recognized for forward, interest rate swap, currency swap, option and other conditional or exchange contracts executed with the same counterparty under a master netting arrangement may be offset. The reporting entitys choice to offset or not must be applied consistently. A master netting arrangement exists if the reporting entity has multiple contracts, whether for the same type of conditional or exchange contract or for different types of contracts, with a single counterparty that are subject to a contractual agreement that provides for the net settlement of all contracts through a single payment in a single currency in the event of default on or termination of any one
contract. Offsetting the fair values recognized for forward, interest rate swap, currency swap, option and other conditional or exchange contracts outstanding with a single counterparty results in the net fair value of the transactions being reported as an asset or a liability in the consolidated balance sheet. In the Companys
Consolidated Balance Sheets at December 31, 2006 and 2005, the fair value of transactions with the same counterparty
is presented on a gross basis, consistent with past practice. However, OERI has energy trading contracts with set off provisions
with various counterparties. If these transactions with the same counterparty were presented on a net basis in
the Consolidated Balance Sheets, Price Risk Management assets and liabilities would be approximately $400 million
and $67 million at December 31, 2006, respectively, and would be approximately $980 million and $928 million at
December 31, 2005, respectively.   
8. 
Enogex Discontinued Operations  In April 2005, Enogex Compression Company, LLC Enogex Compression received an unsolicited offer to buy its interest in Enerven Compression Services, LLC Enerven, a joint venture focused on the rental of natural gas compression assets. After evaluating this offer, Enogex Compression sold its interest in Enerven for approximately $73 million in August 2005. Enogex Compression recognized an after tax gain of approximately $18 million related to the sale of this business.  Enogex regularly evaluates
the long term stability, profitability and core competency of each of its businesses within the regulatory and market
framework in which each business operates. Based on these evaluations, in September 2005, Enogex announced that it had
entered into an agreement to sell its interest in Enogex Arkansas Pipeline Corporation EAPC, which held
the 75 percent interest in the NOARK Pipeline System Limited Partnership. This sale was completed 89 on October 31, 2005. The Company received approximately
$1774 million in cash proceeds and recognized an after tax gain of approximately $367 million from the sale
of this business in the fourth quarter of 2005. Enogex used approximately $319 million of the proceeds to
repay principal and accrued interest on long-term debt and approximately $467 million to pay taxes associated
with EAPC. The balance of the
proceeds of approximately $988 million, was used, among other things, to reduce short-term debt levels and
fund capital expenditures. In March 2006, Enogex announced that its wholly-owned subsidiary, Gathering, had entered into an agreement to sell certain gas gathering assets in the Kinta, Oklahoma, area. The Gathering assets included in the transaction were approximately 568 miles of gas gathering pipeline and 22 compressor units with current volumes of approximately 145 million cubic feet per day, all in eastern Oklahoma. The sale price was approximately $93 million. This transaction closed on May 1, 2006 and Enogex recorded an after tax gain of approximately $341 million during the second quarter of 2006. The proceeds from the sale, were used, among other things, to reduce short-term debt levels and fund capital expenditures. The Consolidated Financial Statements of the Company have been reclassified to reflect Enogex Compressions sale of its Enerven interest, Enogexs sale of its EAPC interest and Gatherings gas gathering assets in Kinta, Oklahoma, all of which were part of the Natural Gas Pipeline segment, as discontinued operations. Accordingly, revenues, costs and expenses and cash flows of Enerven, EAPC and the Gathering assets that were sold have been excluded from the respective captions in the Consolidated Financial Statements and have been separately reported as discontinued operations in the applicable financial statement captions. Enogex Compressions sale of its Enerven interest and Enogexs sale of its EAPC interest were completed during 2005 and, therefore, there are no results of operations for these transactions during 2006. Summarized financial information for the
discontinued operations as of December 31 is as follows

The Company files consolidated income tax returns. Income taxes are allocated to each affiliate based on its separate taxable income or loss. Federal investment tax credits on electric utility property have been deferred and are being amortized to income over the life of the related property. The Company continues to amortize its federal investment tax credits on a ratable basis throughout the year. This ratable amortization results in a larger percentage reconciling item related to these credits during the first quarter when the Company historically experiences decreased book income. The following schedule reconciles the statutory federal tax rate to the effective income tax rate

341%  ADuring 2005, the Company performed a detailed analysis of all deferred tax assets and liabilities. In connection with this analysis, it was determined that an excess liability existed. The removal of this excess liability caused a permanent difference in the effective tax rate for 2005 of approximately 23 percent. In connection with the filing in the third quarter of 2003 of the Companys consolidated income tax returns for 2002, OGE elected to change its tax method of accounting related to the capitalization of costs for self-constructed assets to another method prescribed in the Income Tax regulations. The accounting method change was for income tax purposes only. For financial accounting purposes, the only change was recognition of the impact of the cash flow generated by accelerating income tax deductions. This was reflected in the financial statements as a switch from current income taxes payable to deferred income taxes payable. This tax accounting method change resulted in a one-time catch-up deduction for costs previously capitalized under the prior method, resulting in a consolidated tax net operating loss for 2002. This tax net operating loss eliminated the Companys
current federal and state income tax liability for 2002 and 2003 and all estimated payments made for 2002 were refunded. The Company received federal and state income tax refunds of approximately $508 million during 2003 related to this tax accounting method change.  During 2005,
new guidelines were issued by the Internal Revenue Service IRS related to the change in the method
of accounting used to capitalize costs for self-construction discussed above. The Companys current IRS
examination process, which was completed in the second quarter of 2006, identified this change in method of
accounting as an issue under examination. As a result of their examination, the IRS disagreed with the change
OGE made in 2002 and determined that OGE should change its tax method of accounting for the capitalization
of costs for self-constructed assets 91 to another method prescribed in the Income Tax regulations. The Company filed
a formal protest with the IRS on July 21, 2006 and requested a hearing with the IRS to review the IRSs
determination that the tax accounting method OGE elected in 2002 was not appropriate. On August
17, 2006, the Company made a deposit with the IRS in anticipation that a portion of prior year deductions will
be disallowed. The deposit enabled OGE to cease accruing interest effective August 17, 2006. The impact
of this matter on future cash flows is uncertain but could be material. The Company cannot predict either the
final outcome or the timing of the resolution of this matter. During 2005 and 2006, OGE recorded
approximately $35 million in additional interest expense related to income taxes as a result of a potential adjustment.
This amount is included in Interest on Short-Term Debt and Other Interest Charges in the Consolidated Statements of Income.   The Company follows the provisions of SFAS No. 109 which uses an asset and liability approach to accounting for income taxes. Under SFAS No. 109, deferred tax assets or liabilities are computed based on the difference between the financial statement and income tax bases of assets and liabilities using the enacted marginal tax rate. Deferred income tax expenses or benefits are based on the changes in the asset or liability from period to period. The deferred tax provisions, set forth above, are recognized as costs in the ratemaking process by the commissions having jurisdiction over the rates charged by OGE. The components of Accumulated Deferred Taxes at December 31, 2006 and 2005, respectively, are as follows

$8071  The Company has an Oklahoma investment tax credit carryover of approximately $37 million. These Oklahoma credit carryover amounts will begin expiring in the year 2017. During 2006, additional Oklahoma tax credits of approximately $51 million were generated by OGE and Enogex. The Company believes that, based on current projections, the entire $88 million of these state tax credit amounts will be fully utilized in 2007.   
11. 
Common Stock  In July 2005,
the Company filed a Form S-3 Registration Statement to register 7,000,000 shares of the Companys common stock
pursuant to the Companys Automatic Dividend Reinvestment and Stock Purchase Plan DRIP/DSPP.
Under the terms of the DRIP/DSPP, the Company may accept requests for optional investments in amounts greater than
$01 million per year and may offer a discount of up to three percent from current market prices. This program
allows the Company to sell additional common stock at a smaller discount than that normally incurred in a secondary
equity offering. During the years ended December 31, 2006 and 2005, the Company purchased common stock on the open
market to satisfy the common stock requirements of the DRIP/DSPP and therefore did not issue any new shares of common
stock. During the year ended December 31, 2004, the Company issued 721,021
shares of common stock and 1,238,043 shares of common stock at a discount of 150 percent and 125 percent, respectively,
pursuant to the DRIP/DSPP. Also, as part of the 92 DRIP/DSPP, the Company issued 242,003 shares of common stock at no
discount during the year ended December 31, 2004.  For the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively, there were 738,426, 606,802 and 392,686 shares of new common stock issued pursuant to the Companys Stock Incentive Plan, related to exercised stock options and payouts of earned performance units. At December 31, 2006, there were 13,010,588 shares of unissued common stock reserved for the various employee and Company stock plans.  Shareowners Rights Plan In December 1990,
OGE adopted a Shareowners Rights Plan designed to protect shareowners interests in the event that OGE
was ever confronted with an unfair or inadequate acquisition proposal. In connection with the corporate restructuring,
the Company adopted a substantially identical Shareowners Rights Plan in August 1995. Pursuant to the plan, the Company
declared a dividend distribution of one right for each share of Company common stock. As a result of the June
1998 two-for-one stock split, each share of common stock is now entitled to one-half of a right. Each right entitles the
holder to purchase from the Company one one-hundredth of a share of new preferred stock of the Company under certain circumstances. The rights may be exercised if a person or group announces its intention to acquire, or does acquire, 20 percent or more of the Companys common stock. Under certain circumstances, the holders of the rights will be entitled to purchase either shares of common stock of the Company or common stock of the acquirer at a reduced percentage of the market value. In October 2000, the Shareowners Rights Plan was amended and restated to extend the expiration date to December 11, 2010 and to change the exercise price of the rights. The Companys Restated Certificate of Incorporation permits the issuance of a new series of preferred stock with dividends payable other than quarterly.

Long-Term Debt   A summary of the Companys long-term debt is included in the Consolidated Statements of Capitalization. At December 31, 2006, the Company is in compliance with all of its debt agreements. Long-Term Debt with Optional Redemption Provisions OGEs $1250 million principal amount 665 percent Senior Notes Senior Notes due July 15, 2027, are repayable on July 15, 2007, at the option of the holders, at 100 percent of the principal amount, together with accrued and unpaid interest to July 15, 2007. Only holders who submit requests for repayment between May 15, 2007 and June 15, 2007 are entitled to such repayments. In accordance with SFAS No. 6, Classification of Short-Term Obligations Expected to Be Refinanced, OGE reclassified the Senior Notes from long-term debt due within one year to long-term debt at December 31, 2006 due to OGE having sufficient long-term liquidity in place as a result of increasing its revolving credit agreement to $4000 million in December 2006. Also, based on where the Senior Notes have recently traded, OGE does not believe it is probable that this
option will be exercised by the note holders. 93 OGE has three series of variable-rate industrial authority bonds the Bonds with optional redemption provisions that allow the holders to request repayment of the Bonds at various dates prior to the maturity. The Bonds, which can be tendered at the option of the holder during the next 12 months, are as follows dollars in millions

$  1354  All of these Bonds
are subject to an optional tender at the request of the holders, at 100 percent of the principal amount, together with
accrued and unpaid interest to the date of purchase. The bond holders, on any business day, can request repayment of
the Bond by delivering an irrevocable notice to the tender agent stating the principal amount of the Bond, payment
instructions for the purchase price and the business day the Bond is to be purchased. The repayment option may only
be exercised by the holder of a Bond for the principal amount. When a tender notice has been received by the trustee,
a third party remarketing agent for the Bonds will attempt to remarket any Bonds tendered for purchase. This process occurs once per week.
Since the original issuance of these series of Bonds in 1995 and 1997, the remarketing agent has successfully remarketed all tendered bonds. If the remarketing agent is unable to remarket any such Bonds, the Company is obligated to repurchase such unremarketed Bonds. The Company has sufficient long-term liquidity to meet these obligations. Long-term Debt Maturities Maturities of the Companys long-term debt during the next five years consist of $30 million in 2007; $10 million in 2008 and $4000 million in 2010. There are no maturities of the Companys long-term debt in years 2009 or 2011. The Company has previously incurred costs related to debt refinancings. Unamortized debt expense and unamortized loss on reacquired debt are classified as Deferred Charges and Other Assets and the unamortized premium and discount on long-term debt is classified as Long-Term Debt, respectively, in the Consolidated Balance Sheets and are being amortized over the life of the respective debt.   
14. 
Short-Term Debt  The Company borrows on a short-term basis, as necessary, by the issuance of commercial paper and by loans under short-term bank facilities. The short-term debt balance was approximately $300 million at December 31, 2005 at a weighted-average interest rate of 4421 percent. There was no short-term debt outstanding at December 31, 2006. In accordance with SFAS No. 6, $2200 million of commercial paper was classified as long-term debt at December 31, 2005 as OGE planned to refinance this amount. Subsequently, OGE issued $220 million of long-term debt in January 2006 and repaid the outstanding commercial paper and bank borrowings. The following table shows the Companys revolving credit agreements and available cash at December 31, 2006.

A This bank facility is available to back up the Companys commercial paper borrowings
and to provide revolving credit borrowings. This bank facility can also be used as a letter of credit facility. At December 31, 2006,
there were no outstanding commercial paper borrowings. 
B This bank facility is available to back up OGEs commercial paper borrowings and to provide revolving
credit borrowings. At December 31, 2006, OGE had outstanding approximately $31 million supporting letters of credit and no commercial
paper borrowings.C In December 2006, the Company and OGE amended and restated their revolving credit agreements to total in the
aggregate $10 billion, $600 million for the Company and $400 million for OGE. Each of the credit facilities has a five-year term
with an option to extend the term for two
additional one-year periods. Also, each of these credit facilities has an additional option at the end of the two renewal options to
convert the outstanding balance to a one-year term loan.  94 The Companys and OGEs ability to access the commercial paper market could be adversely impacted by a credit ratings downgrade or major market disruptions. Pricing grids associated with the back-up lines of credit could cause annual fees and borrowing rates to increase if an adverse ratings impact occurs. The impact of any future downgrades would result in an increase in the cost of short-term borrowings but would not result in any defaults or accelerations as a result of the rating changes. Unlike the Company and Enogex, OGE must obtain regulatory approval from the FERC in order to borrow on a short-term basis. OGE has the necessary regulatory approvals to incur up to $800 million in short-term borrowings at any one time for a two-year period beginning January 1, 2007 and ending December 31, 2008.

Retirement Plans and Postretirement Benefit Plans  In September 2006,
the FASB issued SFAS No. 158 which requires an employer to: i recognize the overfunded or underfunded status of a
defined benefit postretirement plan other than a multiemployer plan as an asset or liability in its statement of
financial position and to recognize changes in that funded status in the year in which the changes occur through
comprehensive income of a business entity; and ii to measure the fair value of the funded status of a plan as of the date of its year-end statement of financial
position, with limited exceptions. The requirement to initially recognize the funded status of the defined benefit postretirement plan and the disclosure requirements are effective for the year ended December 31, 2006 for the Company. The requirement to measure plan assets and benefit obligations at fair value in accordance with SFAS No. 157 as of the date of the employers fiscal year-end statement of financial position is effective for fiscal years ending after December 15, 2008. SFAS No. 158 also requires additional disclosures for defined benefit pension plans and other defined benefit postretirement plans. Defined Benefit Pension Plan All eligible employees of the Company and participating affiliates are covered by a non-contributory defined benefit pension plan. For employees hired on or after February 1, 2000, the pension plan is a cash balance plan, under which the Company annually will credit to the employees account an amount equal to five percent of the employees annual compensation plus accrued interest. Employees hired prior to February 1, 2000 will receive the greater of the cash balance benefit or a benefit based primarily on years of service and the average of the five highest consecutive years of compensation during an employees last 10 years prior to retirement, with reductions in benefits for each year prior to age 62 unless the employees age and years of credited service equal or exceed 80. It is the Companys policy to fund the plan on a current basis based on the net periodic SFAS No. 87, Employers Accounting for Pensions, pension expense as determined by the Companys actuarial consultants. Additional amounts may be contributed from time to time to increase the funded status of the plan. During 2006 and 2005, the Company made contributions to its pension plan of approximately $900 million and $320 million, respectively, to ensure that the pension plan maintains an adequate funded status. Such contributions are intended to provide not only for benefits attributed to service to date, but also for those expected to be earned in the future. In August 2006, legislation was passed that changed the funding requirement for single- and multi-employer defined benefit pension plans as discussed below. During 2007, the Company may contribute up to
$50 million to its pension plan. The expected contribution to the pension plan, anticipated to be in the form of cash, is a discretionary contribution and is not required to satisfy the minimum regulatory funding requirement specified by the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended. 
At December 31, 2006, the projected
benefit obligation and fair value of assets of the Companys pension plan and restoration of retirement income plan was approximately
$5850 million and $5194 million, respectively, for an underfunded status of approximately $656 million.
The above amounts have been recorded in Accrued Pension and Benefit Obligations with the offset in Accumulated Other Comprehensive Loss except OGEs
portion which is recorded as a regulatory asset as discussed in Note 1 in the Companys Consolidated Balance
Sheet. The entry did not impact the results of operations in 2006 and did not require a usage of cash and is therefore excluded from the
Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows. The amounts in Accumulated Other Comprehensive Loss and as a regulatory asset represent a net periodic benefit cost
to be recognized in the Consolidated Statements of Income in future periods.   During 2005, the Company made contributions
to the pension plan that exceeded amounts previously recognized as net periodic pension expense and recorded a net prepaid benefit
obligation at December 31, 2005 of approximately $889 million. At December 31, 2005, the Companys projected pension benefit
obligation exceeded the fair value of the pension plan assets by approximately $1546 million. As a result of recording a prepaid benefit
obligation and having a funded status where the projected benefit obligations exceeded the fair value of plan assets, provisions of
SFAS No. 87 required the recognition of an additional minimum liability in the amount of approximately $1814 million at December 31, 2005.
The 95 offset of this entry was an intangible asset and Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income, net of a deferred tax asset; therefore,
this adjustment did not impact the results of operations in 2005 and did not require a usage of cash and is therefore excluded from the
Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows. The amount recorded as an intangible asset equaled the unrecognized prior service cost with the
remainder recorded in Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income. The amount in Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income represents a net
periodic benefit cost to be recognized in the Consolidated Statements of Income in future periods. In accordance with SFAS No.
88, Employers Accounting for Settlements and Curtailments of Defined Benefit Pension Plans and for Termination Benefits,
a one-time settlement charge is required to be recorded by an organization when lump sum payments or other settlements that relieve the
organization from the responsibility for the pension benefit obligation during a plan year exceed the service cost and interest cost
components of the organizations net periodic pension cost. During 2006, the Company experienced an
increase in both the number of employees electing to retire and the amount of lump sum payments to be paid to such employees upon retirement
in 2006. As a result, the Company recorded a pension settlement charge for 2006 of approximately $171 million in the fourth quarter of
2006. The pension settlement charge did not require
a cash outlay by the Company and did not increase the Companys total pension expense over time, as the
charge was an acceleration of costs that otherwise would have been recognized as pension expense in future periods. OGEs Oklahoma jurisdictional portion of this charge was recorded as a regulatory asset see Note 1 for a further discussion.  Pension Plan Costs and Assumptions On August 17, 2006, President Bush signed The Pension Protection Act of 2006 the Pension Protection Act into law. The Pension Protection Act makes changes to important aspects of qualified retirement plans. Among other things, it introduces a new funding requirement for single- and multi-employer defined benefit pension plans, provides legal certainty on a prospective basis for cash balance and other hybrid plans and addresses contributions to defined contribution plans, deduction limits for contributions to retirement plans and investment advice provided to plan participants. The Company is currently analyzing the impact of the Pension Protection Act on its pension plans. Plan Investments, Policies and Strategies The pension plans assets consist primarily of investments in mutual funds, U.S. Government securities, listed common stocks and corporate debt. The following table shows, by major category, the percentage of the fair value of the plan assets held at December 31, 2006 and 2005

100 %  The pension plan assets are held in a trust which follows an investment policy and strategy designed to maximize the long-term investment returns of the trust at prudent risk levels. Common stocks are used as a hedge against moderate inflationary conditions, as well as for participation in normal economic times. Fixed income investments are utilized for high current income and as a hedge against deflation. The Company has retained an investment consultant responsible for the general investment oversight, analysis, monitoring investment guideline compliance and providing quarterly reports to certain of the Companys members and the Companys Employee Benefit Funds Management Committee the Committee.
The various investment managers used by the trust operate within the general operating objectives as established in the investment policy and within the specific guidelines established for their respective portfolio.

More frequent rebalancing may occur if there are dramatic price movements in the financial markets which may cause the trusts exposure to any asset class to exceed or fall below the established allowable guidelines.
To evaluate the progress of the portfolio, investment performance is reviewed quarterly. It is, however, expected that performance goals will be met over a full market cycle, normally defined as a three to five year period. Analysis of performance is within the context of the prevailing investment environment and the advisors investment style. The goal of the trust is to provide a rate of return consistently from three to five percent over the rate of inflation as measured by the national Consumer Price Index on a fee adjusted basis over a typical market cycle of no less than three years and no more than five years. Each investment manager is expected to outperform its respective benchmark. Below is a list of each asset class utilized with appropriate comparative benchmarks each manager is evaluated against..

Exposure to any single issuer, other than the U.S. government, its agencies, or its instrumentalities which have no limits is limited to five percent of the fixed income portfolio as measured by market value. At least 75 percent of the invested assets must possess an investment grade rating at or above Baa3 or BBB- by Moodys Investors Service Moodys, Standard Poors Ratings Services Standard Poors or Fitch Ratings Fitch. The portfolio may invest up to 10 percent of the portfolios market value in convertible bonds as long as the securities purchased meet the quality guidelines. The purchase of any of the Companys equity, debt or other securities is prohibited.
The domestic value equity managers focus on stocks that the manager believes are undervalued in price and earn an average or less than average return on assets, and often pays out higher than average dividend payments. The domestic growth equity manager will invest primarily in growth companies which consistently experience above average growth in earnings and sales, earn a high return on assets, and reinvest cash flow into existing business. The domestic mid-cap equity portfolio manager focuses on companies with market capitalizations lower than the average company traded on the public exchanges with the following characteristics: price/earnings ratio at or near the SP 400 Midcap Index, small dividend yield, return on equity at or near the SP 400 Midcap Index and earnings per share growth rate at or near the SP 400 Midcap Index. The domestic small-capitalization equity
manager will purchase shares of companies with market capitalizations lower that the average company traded on the public exchanges with the following characteristics: price/earnings ratio at or near the Russell 2000, small dividend yield, return on equity at or near the Russell 2000 and earnings per share growth rate at or near the Russell 2000. The international global equity manager invests primarily in non-dollar denominated equity securities. Investing internationally diversifies the overall trust across the global equity markets. The manager is required to operate under certain restrictions including: regional constraints, diversification requirements and percentage of U.S. securities. The Morgan Stanley Capital International Europe, Australia and the Far East Index EAFE is the benchmark for comparative performance purposes. The EAFE Index is a market value weighted index comprised of over 1,000 companies traded on the stock markets of Europe, Australia, New
Zealand and the Far East. All of the equities which are purchased for the international portfolio are thoroughly researched. Only companies with a market capitalization in excess of $100 million are allowable. No more than five percent of the portfolio can be invested in any one stock at the time of purchase. All securities are freely traded on a recognized stock exchange and there are no 144-A securities and no over-the-counter derivatives. The following investment categories are excluded: options other than traded currency options, commodities, futures other than currency futures or currency hedging, short sales/margin purchases, private placements, unlisted securities and real estate but not real estate shares.  For all domestic
equity investment managers, no more than eight percent five percent for mid-cap and small-cap equity managers can be
invested in any one stock at the time of purchase and no more than 16 percent 10 percent for mid-cap and small-cap
equity managers after accounting for price appreciation. A minimum of 95 percent of the total assets of an equity
managers portfolio must be allocated to the equity markets. Options or financial futures may not be purchased 97 unless prior approval of the Committee is received. The purchase of securities on margin is prohibited as is securities
lending. Private placement or venture capital may not be purchased. All interest and dividend payments must be swept
on a daily basis into a short-term money market fund for re-deployment. The purchase of any of the Companys equity,
debt or other securities is prohibited. The purchase
of equity or debt issues of the portfolio managers organization is also prohibited. The aggregate positions in
any company may not exceed one percent of the fair market value of its outstanding stock. Restoration of Retirement Income Plan The Company provides a restoration of retirement income plan to those participants in the Companys pension plan whose benefits are subject to certain limitations under the Internal Revenue Code the Code. The benefits payable under this restoration of retirement income plan are equivalent to the amounts that would have been payable under the pension plan but for these limitations. The restoration of retirement income plan is intended to be an unfunded plan.
Postretirement Benefit Plans
In addition to providing pension benefits, the Company provides certain medical and life insurance benefits for eligible retired members postretirement benefits. Regular, full-time, active employees hired prior to February 1, 2000, whose age and years of credited service total or exceed 80 or have attained age 55 with 10 years of vesting service at the time of retirement are entitled to these postretirement benefits. Employees hired on or after February 1,2000, are not entitled to postretirement medical benefits but are entitled to postretirement life insurance benefits. Eligible retirees must contribute such amount as the Company specifies from time to time toward the cost of coverage for postretirement benefits. The benefits are subject to deductibles, co-payment provisions and other limitations. OGE charges to expense the SFAS No. 106,
Employers Accounting for Postretirement Benefits other than Pensions, costs and includes an annual amount as a component of the cost-of-service in future ratemaking proceedings.
At December 31, 2006, the accumulated
postretirement benefit obligation and fair value of assets of the Companys postretirement benefit plans was approximately
$2254 million and $740 million, respectively, for an underfunded status of approximately $1514 million. The above amounts have been
recorded in Accrued Pension and Benefit Obligations with the offset in Accumulated Other Comprehensive Loss except OGEs portion
which is recorded as a regulatory asset as discussed in Note 1 in the Companys Consolidated Balance Sheet. The entry did not impact
the results of operations in 2006 and did not require a usage of cash and is therefore excluded from the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows.
The amounts in Accumulated Other Comprehensive Loss and as a regulatory asset represent a net periodic benefit cost to be recognized in the Consolidated Statements
of Income in future periods.

The overall expected rate of return on plan assets assumption remained 850 percent in 2005 and 2006 in determining net periodic benefit cost. The rate of return on plan assets assumption is the average long-term rate of earnings expected on the funds currently invested and to be invested for the purpose of providing benefits specified by the pension plan or postretirement benefit plans. This assumption is reexamined at least annually and updated as necessary. The rate of return on plan assets assumption reflects a combination of historical return analysis, forward-looking return expectations and the plans current and expected asset allocation.
The Company expects to pay benefits related to its pension plan and restoration of retirement income plan of approximately $618 million in 2007, $642 million in 2008, $653 million in 2009, $645 million in 2010, $674 million in 2011 and an aggregate of $3128 million in years 2012 to 2016. These expected benefits were based on the same assumptions used to measure the Companys benefit obligation at the end of the year and include benefits attributable to estimated future employee service.
The assumed health care cost trend rates have a significant effect on the amounts reported for postretirement medical benefit plans. Future health care cost trend rates are assumed to be eight percent in 2007 with the rates decreasing in subsequent years by one percentage point per year through 2010. A one-percentage point change in the assumed health care cost trend rate would have the following effects

198  Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement and Modernization Act of 2003
On December 8, 2003, President Bush signed into law the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement and Modernization Act of 2003 the Medicare Act. The Medicare Act expanded Medicare to include, for the first time, coverage for prescription drugs. In May 2004, the FASB issued FASB Staff Position No. FAS 106-2, Accounting and Disclosure Requirements Related to the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement and Modernization Act of 2003. FAS 106-2 provided guidance on the accounting for the effects of the Medicare Act for employers that sponsor postretirement heath care plans that provide prescription drug benefits. FAS 106-2 also required those employers to provide certain disclosures regarding the effect of the federal subsidy provided by the Medicare Act. The Company adopted this new standard effective July 1, 2004
with retroactive application to the date of the Medicare Acts enactment. Management expects that the
accumulated plan benefit obligation APBO for the Company with respect to its postretirement
medical plan will be reduced by approximately $397 million as a result of savings to the Company with
respect to its postretirement medical plan resulting from the Medicare Act provided subsidy, which will
reduce the Companys costs for its postretirement medical plan by approximately $65 million annually.
The $65 million in annual savings is comprised of a reduction of approximately $38 million from amortization of the $397 million gain due to the reduction of the APBO, a reduction in the interest cost on the APBO of approximately $22 million and a reduction in the service cost due to the subsidy of approximately $05 million. 100 The Company expects to pay gross benefits payments related to its postretirement benefit plans, including prescription drug benefits, of approximately $121 million in 2007, $126 million in 2008, $136 million in 2009, $146 million in 2010, $156 million in 2011 and an aggregate of $892 million in years 2012 to 2016. The Company expects to receive federal subsidy receipts provided by the Medicare Act of approximately $11 million in 2007, $13 million in 2008, $14 million in 2009, $16 million in 2010, $17 million in 2011 and an aggregate of $102 million in years 2012 to 2016. The Company did not receive any federal subsidy receipts in 2006.
Defined Contribution Plan
The Company provides a defined contribution savings plan. Each regular full-time employee of the Company or a participating affiliate is eligible to participate in the plan immediately. All other employees of the Company or a participating affiliate are eligible to become participants in the plan after completing one year of service as defined in the plan. Participants may contribute each pay period any whole percentage between two percent and 19 percent of their compensation, as defined in the plan, for that pay period. Contributions of the first six percent of compensation are called Regular Contributions and any contributions over six percent of compensation are called Supplemental Contributions. Participants who have attained age 50 before the close of a year are allowed to make additional contributions referred to as Catch-Up Contributions,
subject to the limitations of the Code. The Company contributes to the Plan each pay period on behalf of each participant an amount equal to 50 percent of the participants Regular Contributions for participants whose employment or re-employment date, as defined in the plan, occurred before February 1, 2000 and who have less than 20 years of service, as defined in the plan, and an amount equal to 75 percent of the participants Regular Contributions for participants whose employment or re-employment date occurred before February1,2000 and who have 20 or more years of service.For participants whose employment or re-employment date occurred on or after February 1, 2000, the Company shall contribute 100 percent of the Regular Contributions deposited during such pay period by such participant. No Company contributions are made with respect to a participants Supplemental Contributions, Catch-Up Contributions, or with respect to a participants
Regular Contributions based on overtime payments, pay-in-lieu of overtime for exempt personnel, special lump-sum recognition awards and lump-sum merit awards included in compensation for determining the amount of participant contributions. The Companys contribution which is initially allocated for investment to the OGE Energy Corp. Common Stock Fund may be made in shares of the Companys common stock or in cash which is used to invest in the Companys common stock. Once made, the Companys contribution may be reallocated, at any time, by participants to other available investment options. The Company contributed approximately $68 million, $67 million and $62 million during 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively, to the defined contribution plan.
Deferred Compensation Plan
The Company provides a deferred
compensation plan. The plans primary purpose is to provide a tax-deferred capital accumulation vehicle for a select group of
management, highly compensated employees and non-employee members of the Board of Directors of the Company and to supplement such
employees defined contribution plan contributions as well as offering this plan to be competitive in the marketplace.
Eligible employees who enroll in the plan have the following deferral options: i eligible employees may elect to defer up to a maximum of 70 percent of base salary and 100 percent of bonus awards; or ii eligible employees may elect a deferral percentage of base salary and bonus awards based on the deferral percentage elected for a year under the defined contribution plan with such deferrals to start when maximum deferrals to the qualified defined contribution plan have been made because of limitations in that plan. Eligible directors who enroll in the plan may elect to defer up to a maximum of 100 percent of directors meeting fees and annual retainers. The Company matches employee but not non-employee director deferrals to provide for the match that would have been made under the defined contribution plan had such deferrals been made under that plan without regard to the
statutory limitations on elective deferrals and matching contributions applicable to the defined contribution plan. In addition, the Benefits Committee may award discretionary employer contribution credits to a participant under the plan. The Company accounts for the contributions related to the Companys executive officers in this plan as Accrued Pension and Benefit Obligations and the Company accounts for the contributions related to the Companys directors in this plan as Other Deferred Credits and Other Liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. The investment associated with these contributions is accounted for as Other Property and Investments in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. The appreciation of these investments is accounted for as Other Income and the increase in the liability under the plan is accounted for as Other Expense in the Consolidated Statements of Income.
Supplemental Executive Retirement Plan
The Company provides
a supplemental executive retirement plan in order to attract and retain lateral hires or other executives designated by the
Compensation Committee of the Companys Board of Directors who may not otherwise qualify 
101 for a sufficient
level of benefits under the Companys pension plan. The supplemental executive retirement plan is intended to be
an unfunded plan and not subject to the benefit limits imposed by the Code.

A Natural Gas Pipelines operations consist of three related business: Transportation and Storage, Gathering and Processing and Marketing. The following table provides supplemental Natural Gas Pipeline information.
B In January 2005, a cogeneration credit rider was implemented at OGE as part of the Oklahoma retail customer electric rates in order to return purchase power capacity payment reductions and any change in operating and maintenance expense related to cogeneration previously included in base rates to OGEs customers. This rider resulted in the seasonal over or under collection of revenues as the rider is based on an equal monthly amount of kilowatt-hour
kwh usage as compared to actual kwh usage. Due to the seasonal rates of OGEs electric sales, this resulted in a temporary over collection of operating revenues in excess of the reduction in operating and maintenance expense for the first quarter of 2005 of approximately $34 million. In August 2005, the Company determined that OGEs net income should not be affected by over or under collections on a temporary or permanent basis, and accordingly, any difference at that time was deferred as a regulatory asset to better reflect the purchase power capacity payment reductions and any change in operating and maintenance expense related to cogeneration. Subsequent to August 2005, any over or under collections related to the cogeneration credit rider are reflected as a regulatory asset or liability.

C In March 2005, Enogex corrected its procedure for accounting for park and loan transactions natural gas storage transactions during 2004 that resulted from an incorrect change in an accounting procedure implemented during 2004. The incorrect procedure affected the timing of recognition of revenue and income from park and loan transactions and resulted in a temporary overstatement of operating revenues without the associated expense until the transaction was completed and the expense recognized. As a result of this correction, Enogex recorded a pre-tax charge of approximately $77 million $47 million after tax or $005 per share as a reduction in Operating Revenues in the Consolidated Statement of Income and a corresponding $77 million decrease in Current Price Risk Management Assets in the Consolidated Balance Sheet during the three
months ended March 31, 2005.  103

Commitments and Contingencies  Capital Expenditures
The Companys capital expenditures
are estimated at approximately: 2007 $5681 million, 2008 $8386 million, 2009 $8159 million, 2010 $6599
million, 2011 $5502 million and 2012 $4360 million. These amounts include capital expenditures of approximately $940
million, $2788 million, $2857 million, $977 million and $341 million, respectively, in 2007 through 2011 related to the construction
of the proposed Red Rock power plant as discussed in Note 18. 104 Operating Lease Obligations

OGE Railcar Lease Agreement
At December 31, 2006, OGE had a noncancellable operating lease with purchase options, covering 1,464 coal hopper railcars to transport coal from Wyoming to OGEs coal-fired generation units. Rental payments are charged to Fuel Expense and are recovered through OGEs tariffs and automatic fuel adjustment clauses. On December 29, 2005, OGE entered into a new lease agreement for railcars effective February 1, 2006 with a new lessor as described below. At the end of the new lease term which is January 31, 2011, OGE has the option to either purchase the railcars at a stipulated fair market value or renew the lease. If OGE chooses not to purchase the railcars or renew the lease agreement and the actual value of the railcars is less than the stipulated fair market value, OGE would be responsible for the difference in those values up to a maximum
of approximately $299 million. OGE is also required to maintain the railcars it has under lease to transport coal from Wyoming and has entered into agreements with Progress Rail Services and WATCO, both of which are non-affiliated companies, to furnish this maintenance.
Public Utility Regulatory Policy Act of 1978
OGE has entered into agreements with three qualifying cogeneration facilities having initial terms of three to 32 years. These contracts were entered into pursuant to the Public Utility Regulatory Policy Act of 1978 PURPA. Stated generally, PURPA and the regulations thereunder promulgated by the FERC require OGE to purchase power generated in a manufacturing process from a qualified cogeneration facility QF. The rate for such power to be paid by OGE was approved by the OCC. The rate generally consists of two components: one is a rate for actual electricity purchased from the QF by OGE; the other is a capacity charge, which OGE must pay the QF for having the capacity available. However, if no electrical power is made available to OGE for a period of time generally three months, OGEs obligation to pay the capacity
charge is suspended. The total cost of cogeneration payments is recoverable in rates from customers. OGE has approximately 430 MWs of QF contracts that will expire at the end of 2007, unless extended by OGE. For one of these QF contracts, OGE purchases 100 percent of electricity generated by the QF. For the other QF contract, OGE can purchase up to 17 percent of electricity generated by the QF. In addition, effective September 1, 2004, OGE entered into a new 15-year power purchase agreement for 120 MWs with Powersmith Cogeneration Project, L.P. PowerSmith in which OGE purchases 100 percent of electricity generated by PowerSmith.
During 2006, 2005 and 2004, OGE made total payments to cogenerators of approximately $1626 million, $1838 million and $2035 million, respectively, of which approximately $949 million, $955 million and $1553 million, respectively, represented capacity payments. All payments for purchased power, including cogeneration, are included in the Consolidated Statements of Income as Cost of Goods Sold. The future minimum capacity payments under the contracts are approximately:  2007 $976 million, 2008 $961 million, 2009 $944 million, 2010 $926 million and 2011 $906 million. The minimum capacity payment amounts for 2008 through 2011 assume OGE elects to extend certain cogeneration contracts, which otherwise expire at the end of 2007.
Fuel Minimum Purchase Commitments
OGE purchased
necessary fuel supplies of coal and natural gas for its generating units of approximately $1951 million, $1635 million
and $1665 million for the years ended December31, 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. OGE has 
105 entered into purchase commitments of necessary fuel supplies of approximately: 2007 $1980 million,
2008 $1141 million, 2009 $1059 million, 2010 $1077 million, 2011 - $654 million and 2012 and
Beyond $234 million.
Natural Gas Units
In October 2006, OGE issued and completed a request for proposal RFP for gas supply purchases for periods that began in November 2006 through March 2007, which accounted for approximately eight percent of its projected 2007 natural gas requirements. All of these contracts are tied to various gas price market indices and will expire in 2007. OGEs remaining 2007 natural gas requirements will be met with additional RFPs in early to mid-2007. OGE will meet additional natural gas requirements with monthly and daily purchases as required.  
Purchased Power
In October 2006, OGE issued an RFP for firm economy energy purchases during the summer of 2007 and expects to select a supplier in early 2007. Also, in early 2007, OGE expects to issue an RFP for capacityand/or firm energypurchases for the summer periods of 2008through 2010 and expects to select a supplier by the early summer of 2007.
Natural Gas Measurement Cases
United States of America ex rel., Jack J. Grynberg v. Enogex Inc., Enogex Services Corporation and OGE. United States District Court for the Western District of Oklahoma, Case No. CIV-97-1010-L. United States of America ex rel., Jack J. Grynberg v. Transok Inc. et al. United States District Court for the Eastern District of Louisiana, Case No. 97-2089; United States District Court for the Western District of Oklahoma, Case No. 97-1009M. On June 15, 1999, the Company was served with Plaintiffs complaint, which is a qui tam action under the False Claims Act. Plaintiff Jack J.Grynberg, as individual relator on behalf of the United States Government, alleges:ieach of the named defendants have improperly or intentionally mismeasured gas both volume and British thermal unit Btu content purchased from federal and Indian lands which
have resulted in the under-reporting and underpayment of gas royalties owed to the Federal Government; iicertain provisions generally found in gas purchase contracts are improper; iiitransactions by affiliated companies are not arms-length; ivexcess processing cost deduction; and vfailure to account for production separated out as a result of gas processing. Grynberg seeks the following damages:aadditional royalties which he claims should have been paid to the Federal Government, some percentage of which Grynberg, as relator, may be entitled to recover; btreble damages; ccivil penalties; dan order requiring defendants to measure the way Grynberg contends is the better way to do so; and einterest, costs and attorneys fees.
In qui tam actions, the United States Government can intervene and take over such actions from the relator. The Department of Justice, on behalf of the United States Government, decided not to intervene in this action.
Plaintiff filed over 70other cases naming over 300other defendants in various Federal Courts across the country containing nearly identical allegations. The Multidistrict Litigation Panel entered its order in late 1999 transferring and consolidating for pretrial purposes approximately 76 other similar actions filed in nine other Federal Courts. The consolidated cases are now before the United States District Court for the District of Wyoming.
In October 2002, the Court granted the Department of Justices motion to dismiss certain of Plaintiffs claims and issued an order dismissing Plaintiffs valuation claims against all defendants. Various procedural motions have been filed. A hearing on the defendants motions to dismiss for lack of subject matter jurisdiction, including public disclosure, original source and voluntary disclosure requirements was held in 2005 and the special master ruled that OGE and all Enogex parties named in these proceedings should be dismissed. This ruling was appealed to the District Court of Wyoming. 
On October 20, 2006, the District Court
of Wyoming ruled on Grynbergs appeal, following and confirming the recommendation of the special master dismissing all claims against
Enogex Inc., Enogex Services Corp., Transok, Inc. and OGE, for lack of subject matter jurisdiction. Judgment was entered on
November 17, 2006 and Grynberg filed his notice of appeal with the District Court of Wyoming. The defendants filed motions for
attorneys fees regarding issues of liability and Rule 11 motions on January 8, 2007. The defendants also filed for other
legal costs on December 18, 2006. A hearing on these motions is currently scheduled for April 24, 2007. Grynberg has also filed appeals with the
Tenth Circuit Court of Appeals. The Company intends to vigorously defend this action. At this time, the Company is unable to provide
an evaluation of the likelihood of an unfavorable outcome and an estimate of the amount or range of potential loss to the Company. 
106 Will Price Price I On September 24, 1999, various subsidiaries of the Company were served with a class action petition filed in United States District Court, State of Kansas by Quinque Operating Company and other named plaintiffs, alleging mismeasurement of natural gas on non-federal lands. On April 10, 2003 the Court entered an order denying class certification. On May 12, 2003, Plaintiffs now Will Price, Stixon Petroleum, Inc., Thomas F. Boles and the Cooper Clark Foundation, on behalf of themselves and other royalty interest owners filed a motion seeking to file an amended petition and the court granted the motion on July 28, 2003. In this amended petition, OGE and Enogex Inc. were omitted from the case. Two subsidiaries of Enogex remain as defendants. The Plaintiffs amended petition alleges that
approximately 60 defendants, including two Enogex subsidiaries, have improperly measured natural gas. The amended petition reduces the claims to: 1 mismeasurement of volume only; 2 conspiracy, unjust enrichment and accounting; 3 a putative Plaintiffs class of only royalty owners; and 4 gas measured in three specific states. A hearing on class certification issues was held April 1, 2005. The Company intends to vigorously defend this action. At this time, the Company is unable to provide an evaluation of the likelihood of an unfavorable outcome and an estimate of the amount or range of potential loss to the Company.
Will Price Price II On May 12, 2003, the Plaintiffs same as those in Price I above filed a new class action petition Price II in the District Court of Stevens County, Kansas, relating to wrongful Btu analysis against natural gas pipeline owners and operators, naming the same defendants as in the amended petition of the Price I case. Two Enogex subsidiaries were served on August 4, 2003. The Plaintiffs seek to represent a class of only royalty owners either from whom the defendants had purchased natural gas or measured natural gas since January 1, 1974 to the present. The class action petition alleges improper analysis of gas heating content. In all other respects, the Price II petition appears to be the same as the amended petition in Price I. A hearing on class certification issues was held April 1, 2005. The
Company intends to vigorously defend this action. At this time, the Company is unable to provide an evaluation of the likelihood of an unfavorable outcome and an estimate of the amount or range of potential loss to the Company.
Pipeline Rupture 
On May 10, 2005, a natural gas pipeline rupture occurred on an Enogex facility within the ANR Pipeline, Inc. plant site in Custer County, near Clinton, Oklahoma, resulting in an explosion and fire. No injuries were reported as a result of the incident. It is anticipated that any third party damages related to this incident will not be material to the Company as they will be covered by insurance following payment of the deductible, which deductible has been accrued in the Companys Consolidated Financial Statements.
Farris Buser Litigation
On July 22, 2005, Enogex along with certain other unaffiliated co-defendants was served with a purported class action which had been filed on February 7, 2005 by Farris Buser and other named plaintiffs in the District Court of Canadian County, Oklahoma. The plaintiffs own royalty interests in certain oil and gas producing properties and allege they have been under-compensated by the named defendants, including the Enogex companies, relating to the sale of liquid hydrocarbons recovered during the transportation of natural gas from the plaintiffs wells. The plaintiffs assert breach of contract, implied covenants, obligation, fiduciary duty, unjust enrichment, conspiracy and fraud causes of action and claim actual damages in excess of $10,000, plus attorneys fees and costs, and punitive damages in excess of $10,000. The Enogex companies filed a motion to dismiss
which was granted on November 18, 2005, subject to the plaintiffs right to conduct discovery and the possible re-filing of their allegations in thepetition against Enogex companies. On September 19, 2005, the co-defendants, BP America, Inc. and BP America Production Co. collectively, BP, filed a cross claim against Products seeking indemnification and/or contribution from Products based upon the 1997 sale of a third party interest in one of Products natural gas processing plants. On May 17, 2006, the plaintiffs filed an amended petition against the Enogex companies. The Enogex companies filed a motion to dismiss the amended petition on August 2, 2006. The hearing on the dismissal motion was held on November 20, 2006 and the court denied the Enogex companies motion. The Enogex companies filed an answer to the amended petition and BPs cross claim on January 16, 2007. Based on its investigation to date, the Company believes these claims and
cross claims in thislawsuitare without merit and intends to continue vigorously defending this case.
Osterhout Litigation
On June 19, 2006,
two OGE customers brought a putative class action, on behalf of all similarly situated customers, in the District
Court of Creek County, Oklahoma, challenging certain charges on OGEs electric bills. The plaintiffs claim
that OGE improperly charged sales tax based on franchise fee charges paid by its customers. The plaintiffs also
challenge certain franchise fee charges, contending that such fees are more than is allowed under Oklahoma law. OGEs motion for summary
judgment was denied by the trial judge. OGE has filed a writ of prohibition at the Oklahoma 
107 Supreme Court
asking the court to direct the trial court to dismiss the class action suit. At the present time, OGE believes
that this case is without merit and intends to continue vigorously defending this case.
Calpine Corporation Bankruptcy
Calpine Corporation, Calpine Energy Services, L.P., and several other affiliates collectively Calpine voluntarily filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection from creditors on December 20, 2005 Case No. 05-60200 BRL United States Bankruptcy Court, S.D. of New York. Enogex provides natural gas transportation services pursuant to long-term contracts to two Calpine-owned power generation plants in Oklahoma. Calpine is continuing to operate the plants and request services pursuant to the contracts. The total unpaid amount due to Enogex from Calpine is approximately $03 million which has been fully reserved on the Companys books.
A Calpine-owned power generation plant in Oklahoma is contractually obligated to provide capacity and energy to OGE. The Calpine plant also pays, through the Southwest Power Pool SPP, for transmission services provided to OGE. OGE expects both arrangements to remain in effect; however, whether Calpine in its bankruptcy proceedings will ultimately reject these agreements with OGE is unknown.
Potential Collateral Requirements
At December 31, 2006 in the event Moodys or Standard Poors were to lower Enogexs senior unsecured debt rating to a below investment grade rating, Enogex would be required to post approximately $33 million of collateral to satisfy its obligation under its financial and physical contracts.
Environmental Laws and Regulations
Approximately $165 million and $975 million, respectively of the Companys capital expenditures budgeted for 2007 and 2008 are to comply with environmental laws and regulations. The Companys management believes that all of its operations are in substantial compliance with present federal, state and local environmental standards. It is estimated that the Companys total expenditures for capital, operating, maintenance and other costs to preserve and enhance environmental quality will be approximately $844 million during 2007 as compared to approximately $601 million in 2006. The Company continues to evaluate its environmental management systems to ensure compliance with existing and proposed environmental legislation and regulations and to better position itself in a competitive market.
OGE
Air
On March 15, 2005,the Environmental Protection Agency EPA issued the Clean Air Mercury Rule CAMR to limit mercury emissions from coal-fired boilers. On May 31, 2006, the EPA issued a ruling which amended and clarified minor portions of the CAMR. The CAMR is currently subject to legal challenges. The CAMR requires reductions in mercury in two phases, Phase I beginning in 2010 and Phase II in 2018. The CAMR is based on the cap and trade program that will allow utilities to purchase mercury allowances if available rather than reduce emissions. It is anticipated that OGE will need to obtain allowances or reduce its mercury emissions in Phase II by approximately 70 percent. The CAMR requires each state to adopt the requirements of the federal rule into a state implementation plan. However, the CAMR does not preclude states from developing more
stringent mercury reduction requirements. The state of Oklahoma has proposed to incorporate the EPAs CAMR, along with the proposed mercury allowance allocations, into the state implementation program. OGE is currently participating in the state rulemaking process and anticipates the rulemaking to be completed by the end of 2007. Because rulemaking is in progress, the cost to install any mercury controls is uncertain at this time but is expected to be significant to meet Phase II requirements in 2018. The state implementation plan will also require continuous monitoring of mercury emissions from OGEs coal-fired boilers beginning in 2009. The cost of the monitoring equipment is estimated at approximately $79 million which is expected to be incurred during the years 2007 and 2008. However, the cost to comply with the CAMR monitoring requirements will be in addition to the cost of other emissions monitoring that is already in place pursuant to Title IV of the
Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990.
On June 15, 2005,
the EPA issued final amendments to its 1999 regional haze rule. These regulations are intended to protect visibility in
national parks and wilderness areas Class I areas throughout the United States.In Oklahoma, the
Wichita Mountains are the only area covered under the regulation. However, Oklahomas impact on parks in other states must also be evaluated. Sulfates
and nitrate aerosols both emitted from coal-fired boilers can lead to the degradation of 
108 visibility. The state
of Oklahoma has joined with eight other central states and has begun to finalize the process of determining what,
if any, impact emission sources in Oklahoma have on national parks and wilderness areas. 
In September 2005, the Oklahoma Department of Environmental Quality ODEQ informally notified affected utilities that they would be required to perform a study to determine their impact on visibility in Federal Class I areas. Affected utilities are those which have Best Available Retrofit Technology BART eligible sources sources built between 1962 and 1977. For OGE these include various generating units at various generating stations. Regulations, however, allow an owner or operator of a BART-eligible source to request and obtain a waiver from BART if modeling shows no significant impact on visibility in nearby Class I areas. Therefore, OGE initiated a preliminary modeling study that was completed in July 2006. Because the preliminary results indicated a significant impact from OGEs Sooner, Muskogee, Seminole and Horseshoe
Lake generating stations on visibility in Class I areas in both Oklahoma and Arkansas, more detailed modeling is being performed. Based on results of modeling for the Seminole and Horseshoe Lake generating stations, OGE submitted an application for waiver to the ODEQ on December 1, 2006. The ODEQ and the EPA approvals are required for any waiver; it is not known at this time whether approval will be granted. The ODEQ made a preliminary determination to accept the application for Horseshoe Lake and reject the application for Seminole. OGE is continuing to discuss the Seminole application with the ODEQ. 
OGE is currently evaluating various control strategies for its generating units. Proposed compliance determinations for affected units must be submitted to the ODEQ by March 30, 2007. The ODEQ will then incorporate OGEs, as well as other industrys compliance plans, into the state implementation plan which will then be submitted to the EPA. Once the EPA approves the plan, OGE will have five years to institute any required reductions. OGE is in the process of determining the extent of pollution control equipment needed to comply with the regulations. OGE plans to spend approximately $54 million during 2007 related to the regional haze project. OGE currently estimates that it could be required to spend approximately $600 million over a five-year period to install certain equipment such as scrubbers and low nitrogen oxide NOX
burners at its generating stations. However, this amount could increase or decrease substantially based on the interpretation of the requirements by the ODEQ and the EPA, the availability of alternative control measures to achieve more cost effective visibility improvements, the availability of materials, labor force and the specific design criteria for OGEs generating units. OGE expects that any necessary environmental expenditures will qualify as part of a pre-approval plan to handle state and federally mandated environmental upgrades which will be recoverable in Oklahoma from OGEs retail customers under House Bill 1910, which was enacted into law in May 2005.
Currently, the EPA has designated Oklahoma in attainment with the ambient standard for ozone. However, future elevated readings could lead to redesignation of these areas as non-attainment. Both Tulsa and Oklahoma City have entered into an Early Action Compact with the EPA whereby voluntary measures will be enacted to reduce ozone. This compact expires in December 2007. However, the EPA has proposed continuation through a similar program called Ozone Flex, which both Oklahoma City and Tulsa expect to participate. If either Tulsa or Oklahoma City became non-attainment, reductions in nitrogen oxides emissions from OGEs generating facilities may be required.
On April 25, 2005, the EPA published a finding that all 50 states failed to submit the interstate pollution transport plans required by the Clean Air Act as a result of the adoption of the revised ambient ozone and fine particle standards.  Failure to submit these implementation plans began a two-year timeframe, starting on May 25, 2005, during which states must submit a demonstration to the EPA that they do not affect air quality in downwind states. Earlier in 2005 it was unclear whether this could be accomplished by the state of Oklahoma and it was previously reported that there may be future significant expenditures required by OGE if Oklahoma was determined to impact the air quality in downwind states. However, recent communications with the state of Oklahoma have affirmed that they have completed the demonstration that they do not affect air quality in downwind states and
are on target to submit it to the EPA by the May 25, 2007 deadline. Therefore, there should be no significant impact to OGE as a result of the April 25, 2005 finding.
On September 21, 2006, the EPA lowered the 24-hour fine particulate ambient standard while retaining the annual standard at its current level and promulgated a new standard for inhalable coarse particulates. Based on past monitoring data, it appears that Oklahoma may be able to remain in attainment with these standards. However if parts of Oklahoma do become non-attainment, reductions in emissions from OGEs coal-fired boilers could be required which may result in significant capital and operating expenditures.
The 1990 Clean Air Act
includes an acid rain program to reduce sulfur dioxide SO2 emissions. Reductions were obtained through a
program of emission release allowances issued by the EPA to power plants covered by the acid rain program. Each allowance
is worth one ton of SO2 released from the smokestack. Plants may only release as much SO2 as they have allowances. Allowances may
be banked and traded or sold nationwide. Beginning in 2000, OGE became subject to more stringent SO2 emission
requirements in Phase II of the acid rain program. These lower limits had no significant 
109 financial impact due to
OGEs earlier decision to burn low sulfur coal. In 2006, OGEs SO2 emissions were well below
the allowable limits. 
The EPA allocated SO2 allowances to OGE starting in 2000 and OGE started banking allowances in 2001. In February 2006, OGE sold 6,312 allowances for approximately $89 million. See Note 18 for a discussion of the SO2 allowance joint filing made in February 2006 which discusses how the proceeds from the sale of SO2 allowances will be shared between OGE and its customers for any sales after December 31, 2005.
With respect to the NOX regulations of the acid rain program, OGE committed to meeting a 045 lbs/million British thermal unit MMBtu NOX emission level in 1997 on all coal-fired boilers. As a result, OGE was eligible to exercise its option to extend the effective date of the lower emission requirements from the year 2000 until 2008. OGEs average NOX emissions from its coal-fired boilers for 2006 were approximately 033 lbs/MMBtu. The regulations require that OGE achieve a NOX emission level of 040 lbs/MMBtu for these boilers beginning in 2008. Further reductions in NOX emissions could be required if the ODEQ determines that such NOX emissions are contributing to regional haze or that OGEs facilities impact the air quality of the Tulsa or Oklahoma City metropolitan areas, or if Oklahoma becomes non-attainment with the fine particulate
standard. Any of these scenarios would require significant capital and operating expenditures.
The ODEQ Clean Air Act Amendment Title V permitting program was approved by the EPA in March 1996. By March of 1997, OGE had submitted all required permit applications. As of December 31, 2006, OGE had received Title V permits for all of its generating stations. Since these permits require renewal every five years, OGE has begun the renewal process for some of its generating stations. Air permit fees for generating stations were approximately $06 million in 2006. The fees for 2007 are estimated to be approximately the same as in 2006.
There have been a variety of unsuccessful legislative and litigation efforts to force mandatory control of utility emissions that allegedly contribute to climate change. If legislation is passed in the future requiring mandatory carbon dioxide emission reductions to address climate change, this could have a tremendous impact on all coal-fired electric utilities, including OGEs operations by requiring OGE to significantly reduce the use of coal as a fuel source.
Waste
OGE has sought and will continue to seek, new pollution prevention opportunities and to evaluate the effectiveness of its waste reduction, reuse and recycling efforts. In 2006, OGE obtained refunds of approximately $20 million from its recycling efforts. This figure does not include the additional savings gained through the reduction and/or avoidance of disposal costs and the reduction in material purchases due to the reuse of existing materials. Similar savings are anticipated in future years.
Water
OGE had one Oklahoma Pollutant Discharge Elimination System OPDES permit approved during 2006 and has one other OPDES permit renewal pending. OGE expects that this permit will be issued during the first or second quarter of 2007. OGE expects that this permit, when issued, will continue to be reasonable in its requirements, allow operational flexibility and provide reductions in operating costs. Additionally, OGE filed an application with the state of Oklahoma during 2006 for a new wastewater discharge permit for one of its facilities. OGE expects that the wastewater discharge permit for this facility will be issued in the first or second quarter of 2007.
Section 316b of the Clean Water Act requires that the location, design, construction and capacity of any cooling water intake structure reflect the best available technology for minimizing environmental impacts. The EPA 316b rules for existing facilities became effective July 23, 2004. OGE has engaged a consultant who has developed the required documentation for four OGE facilities. These documents were submitted to the state agency on December 7, 2005 for review and approval. OGE has also provided the state of Oklahoma with information and requests that, if approved by the state, may reduce the impact of the 316b rules on OGE because if OGEs position is approved, three of the four OGE facilities would not be required to comply with the 316b rules. Depending on the ultimate analysis and final determinations regarding the 316b
rules, capital and/or operating costs may increase at any affected OGE generating facility. On January 25, 2007,
a federal court reversed and remanded portions of the 316b rules to the EPA. The existing rules remain in effect while the EPA is considering how to
respond to the court decision. It is not clear what changes, if any, the EPA will make to the rules or how those
changes may affect OGE. 110 Enogex
The construction and operation of pipelines, plants and other facilities for transporting, processing, compressing or storing natural gas and other products may be subject to federal, state and local environmental laws and regulations, including those that can impose obligations to remediate hazardous substances at locations where Enogex operates. In most instances, the applicable regulatory requirements relate to water and air pollution control or solid waste management measures. Appropriate governmental authorities may enforce these laws and regulations with a variety of civil and criminal enforcement measures, including monetary penalties, assessment and remediation requirements and injunctions with respect to future compliance. Enogex may generate some materials subject to the requirements of the Federal Resource Conservation and Recovery Act and the Clean Water Act and comparable
state statutes, prepares and files reports and documents pursuant to the Toxic Substance Control Act and the Emergency Planning and Community Right to Know Act and obtains permits pursuant to the Federal Clean Air Act and comparable state air statutes.
Environmental regulation can increase the cost of planning, design, initial installation and operation of Enogexs facilities. Historically, Enogexs total expenditures for environmental control facilities and for remediation have not been significant in relation to its results of operations or financial condition. The Company believes, however, that it is reasonably likely that the trend in environmental legislation and regulations will continue towards more restrictive standards.
The Company has and will continue to evaluate the impact of its operations on the environment.As a result, contamination on Company property may be discovered from time to time.
Other
In the normal course of business, the Company is confronted with issues or events that may result in a contingent liability. These generally relate to lawsuits, claims made by third parties, environmental actions or the action of various regulatory agencies and income tax related items. Management consults with legal counsel and other appropriate experts to assess the claim. If, in managements opinion, the Company has incurred a probable loss as set forth by accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, an estimate is made of the loss and the appropriate accounting entries are reflected in the Companys Consolidated Financial Statements. Except as otherwise stated above, in Note 18 below and in Item 3 of this Form 10-K, management, after consultation with legal counsel, does not currently anticipate that liabilities arising out of these pending or threatened
lawsuits, claims and contingencies will have a material adverse effect on the Companys consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows.

Rate Matters and Regulation  Regulation and Rates
OGEs retail electric tariffs are regulated by the OCC in Oklahoma and by the APSC in Arkansas. The issuance of certain securities by OGE is also regulated by the OCC and the APSC. OGEs wholesale electric tariffs, short-term borrowing authorization and accounting practices are subject to the jurisdiction of the FERC. The Secretary of the Department of Energy has jurisdiction over some of OGEs facilities and operations. For the year ended December 31, 2006, approximately 87 percent of OGEs electric revenue was subject to the jurisdiction of the OCC, nine percent to the APSC and four percent to the FERC.
The OCC
issued an order in 1996 authorizing OGE to reorganize into a subsidiary of the Company. The order required
that, among other things, i the Company permit the OCC access to the books and records of the Company and its
affiliates relating to transactions with OGE; ii the Company employ accounting and other procedures and
controls to protect against subsidization of non-utility activities by OGEs customers; and iii the
Company refrain from pledging OGE assets or income for affiliate transactions. In addition, the Energy
Policy Act of 2005 enacted the Public Utility Holding Company Act of 2005, which in turn granted to the FERC
access to the books and records of the Company and its affiliates as the FERC deems
relevant to costs incurred by OGE or necessary or appropriate for the protection of utility customers
with respect to the FERC jurisdictional rates.   
Completed Regulatory Matters  2002 Settlement Agreement
On November 22, 2002, the OCC signed a
rate order containing the provisions of the 2002 Settlement Agreement.
The 2002 Settlement Agreement provided for, among other items: i a $250 million annual reduction in the electric rates of 111 OGEs Oklahoma customers which went into effect January 6, 2003; ii recovery by OGE, through rate base, of the capital
expenditures associated with the January 2002 ice storm; iii OGE to acquire electric generation of not less than
400 MW New Generation to be integrated into OGEs generation system; and iv recovery by OGE, over three
years, of the $54 million in deferred operating costs, associated with the January 2002 ice storm, through OGEs rider for
sales to other utilities and power marketers off-system sales. Previously, OGE had a 50/50 sharing mechanism in
Oklahoma for any off-system sales. The 2002 Settlement Agreement provided that the first $18 million in annual net profits from
OGEs off-system sales will go to OGE, the next $36 million in annual net profits from off-system sales will go to
OGEs Oklahoma customers and any net profits from off-system sales in excess of these amounts will be credited in each sales
year with 80 percent to OGEs Oklahoma customers and the remaining 20 percent to OGE. During 2005, OGE recovered
approximately $18 million in annual net profits from off-system sales. Including this amount, OGE has recovered a total of $54
million related to the regulatory asset since December 31, 2002, which is in accordance with the 2002 Settlement Agreement. During 2005,
OGE also credited as required approximately $36 million in annual net profits from off-system sales to OGEs
Oklahoma customers and the net profits from off-system sales that exceeded the $54 million were shared with 80 percent to OGEs
Oklahoma customers and the remaining 20 percent to OGE. Beginning January 1, 2006, the annual net profits from off-system sales were
shared with 80 percent to OGEs Oklahoma customers and 20 percent to OGE.
OCC Order Confirming Savings
The 2002 Settlement Agreement required that, if OGE did not acquire the New Generation by December 31, 2003, OGE must credit $250 million annually at a rate of 1/12 of $250 million per month for each month that the New Generation is not in place to its Oklahoma customers beginning January 1, 2004 and continuing through December 31, 2006. As discussed in more detail below, in August 2003 OGE signed an agreement to purchase a 77 percent interest in the McClain Plant, but due to a delay at the FERC, the acquisition was not completed by December 31, 2003. In the interim, OGE entered into a power purchase agreement with the McClain Plant that delivered the savings guaranteed to OGEs customers. OGE requested that the OCC confirm that the steps it had taken, including the power purchase agreement, were satisfying the customer savings obligation under the
2002 Settlement Agreement and that OGE would not be required to begin crediting its customers. On April 28, 2004, the OCC issued an order confirming that OGE was delivering savings to its customers as required under the 2002 Settlement Agreement. The order removed any uncertainty over whether the OCC believed OGE had to reduce its rates, effective January 1, 2004, while it awaited action by the FERC on its application to purchase the McClain Plant. A party to the OCC proceeding appealed the OCCs order to the Oklahoma Supreme Court. The appeal was denied and the OCC order is considered final. OGE has filed reports with the OCC for the months of January 2004 through December 2006 supporting the savings from the McClain Plant. OGE expects to file an application with the OCC in the second quarter of 2007 supporting its compliance with the 2002 Settlement Agreement. OGE expects the OCC to issue an order by the end of 2007 in this
matter.
Acquisition of McClain Power Plant 
On July 9, 2004, OGE completed the acquisition of a 77 percent interest in the McClain Plant. This transaction was intended to satisfy the requirement in the 2002 Settlement Agreement to acquire electric generation of not less than 400 MWs. 
The closing of the
purchase of the McClain Plant was subject to approval from the FERC. The FERCs July 2, 2004 approval was based
on an offer of settlement in which OGE agreed to undertake the following mitigation measures: i install certain
transmission facilities designed to result in up to 600 MWs of available transfer capability ATC
from the Redbud Energy LP Redbud facility to the OGE control area; ii pending completion of these
transmission upgrades, provide up to 600 MWs of ATC into OGEs control area from the Redbud plant
through changes to the dispatch of OGEs generating units; and iii hire an independent market monitor to
oversee OGEs activity in its control area until the SPP implements a market monitor for the SPP regional
transmission organization RTO. OGE completed the installation of the capital improvements and notified the
FERC in writing on May 31, 2005 that these were completed. OGEs obligation to redispatch its system to make 600 MWs of
ATC available to the Redbud power plant terminated upon completion of the transmission upgrades. On June 20, 2006, the FERC issued an order
that OGE had fully satisfied all of the transmission upgrade requirements associated with the McClain Plant acquisition.
Parties in this matter had 30 days to request a rehearing. No request for rehearing was filed with the FERC and OGE believes the
order is final. According to both OGEs market monitoring plan and the applicable FERC orders, OGEs market monitoring
plan was set to terminate when the SPP installed its own market monitor. Given the implementation of the SPPs external market monitor
effective December 1, 2006, OGEs market monitoring plan effectively ended and OGEs market monitor was dismissed on
December 1, 2006. Also, on December 1, 2006, OGE notified the FERC that based on the status of the SPPs internal and external
market monitors, the McClain settlements market monitoring requirements had been fulfilled. On January 16 112 2007, OGEs
market monitor submitted its final report addressing the period from September 30, 2006 to November 30, 2006. 
OGE expects the addition of the McClain Plant, including the effects of an interim power purchase agreement OGE had with NRG McClain LLC while OGE was awaiting regulatory approval to complete the acquisition, will provide savings, over a three-year period January 1, 2004 through December 31, 2006, in excess of $750 million to its Oklahoma customers. In the event OGE is unable to demonstrate at least $750 million in savings to its customers during this 36-month period, OGE will be required to credit its Oklahoma customers any unrealized savings below $750 million as determined subsequent to the end of the 36-month period. At this time, OGE believes that it achieved at least $750 million in savings during this period. OGE has filed reports with the OCC for the months of January 2004 through December 2006 supporting the savings from the McClain
Plant. OGE expects to file an application with the OCC in the second quarter of 2007 supporting its compliance with the 2002 Settlement Agreement. OGE expects the OCC to issue an order by the end of 2007 in this matter.
OGE Oklahoma Rate Case Filing
On May 20, 2005, OGE filed with the OCC an application for an annual rate increase of approximately $891 million to recover, among other things, its investment in, and the operating expenses of, the McClain Plant. The application also included, among other things, implementation of enhanced reliability programs in OGEs system, increased fuel oil inventory, the establishment of a separate recovery mechanism for major storm expense, the establishment of new rate classes for public schools and related facilities, the establishment of a military base rider, the establishment of a new low income assistance tariff and the proposal to make the guaranteed flat bill pilot tariff permanent for residential and small business customers. 
On September 12, 2005, several parties filed responsive testimony reflecting various positions on the issues related to this case. In particular, the testimony of the OCC Staff recommended that OGE be entitled a rate increase of approximately $130 million, one-seventh the amount requested by OGE in its May 20, 2005 application. The recommendations in the testimony of the Attorney Generals office and the OIEC recommended a rate decrease of approximately $24 million and $31 million, respectively. Hearings in the rate case began on October 10, 2005 and concluded on October 24, 2005. On November 3, 2005, the Referee appointed by the OCC for this proceeding issued a report recommending an estimated rate increase of approximately $42 million for OGE. On December 12, 2005, the OCC issued an order providing for a $423 million increase in rates and a 1075 percent
return on equity, based on a capital structure consisting of 557 percent equity and 443 percent debt. The new rates became effective in January 2006 pursuant to approved tariffs filed with the OCC. Also included in the order, among other things, are new depreciation rates effective January 2006 and a provision which modified OGEs mechanism for the recovery of over or under recovered fuel costs from its customers to allow interest to be applied to the over or under recovery. See Note 1 for a discussion of amendments to the tariffs related to Fuel Clause Over Recoveries.
As part of the rate order issued by the
OCC in December 2005, OGE received OCC approval for the creation of two new rate classes, Public Schools-Demand and Public Schools
Non-Demand. These two classes of service will provide OGE flexibility to provide targeted programs for load management to public
schools and their unique usage patterns. Another item approved in the order was the creation of service level fuel differentiation that
allows customers to pay fuel costs that better reflect operational energy losses related to a specific service level. The OCC order also approved a military base
rider which demonstrates Oklahomas continued commitment to our military partners. OGEs highly successful wind program was
authorized to lower its cost on a per kwh basis, which provides subscribing customers the increased incentive to hedge against future
natural gas prices. The order also enables OGEs low-income qualified customers to receive relief on their summer electric
bills by waiving the customer charge on their monthly bills from June to September of each year. Also included in OGEs rate case application, but not approved, was the establishment of a separate recovery mechanism for major storm expense.
As provided in the 2002 Settlement Agreement, OGE had the right to accrue a regulatory asset, for a period not to exceed 12 months subsequent to the completion of the acquisition and operation of the McClain Plant, consisting of the non-fuel operation and maintenance expenses, depreciation, cost of debt associated with the investment and ad valorem taxes. OGE completed its acquisition of the McClain Plant on July 9, 2004. Accordingly, OGE ceased accruing various operating and related costs associated with the McClain Plant as a regulatory asset on July 8, 2005. At December 31, 2005, the actual incurred expenses included in the McClain Plant regulatory asset were approximately $249 million. Such costs will be recovered over a four-year time period as authorized in the OCC rate order beginning in January 2006. The OCC authorized approximately $155 million of the $249
million regulatory asset to be included in OGEs rate base for purposes of earning a return.
113 Enogex FERC Section 311 2001 Rate Case
Pursuant to a settlement accepted by the FERC in May 2003 to resolve Enogexs 2001 Section 311 rate case, Enogex assessed a fee under certain market conditions for processing customer gas gathered behind processing plants so that it met the heating value standards of natural gas transmission pipelines default processing fee. Pursuant to Enogexs Statement of Operating Conditions SOC that was effective through September 30, 2004, if Enogexs annual processing gross margin exceeded a specified threshold, Enogex was required to record a default processing fee refund obligation in an amount equal to the lesser of the default processing fees or the amount of the processing margin in excess of the specified threshold. In June 2004, Enogex billed default processing fees of approximately $02 million, which was recorded as deferred revenue. Based on
the processing gross margin for 2004, these default processing fees billed to customers were recorded as deferred revenue and were refunded or credited to customers by April 30, 2005. 
Enogex FERC Section 311 2004 Rate Case and related FERC dockets and 2006 Fuel Filing
On September 1, 2004, Enogex made a filing at the FERC to revise its previously approved SOC to permit, among other things, the unbundling, effective October 1, 2004, of its previously bundled gathering and transportation services. As a result, effective October 1, 2004, the FERC regulates Enogexs Section 311 transportation but does not regulate Enogexs gathering. The OCC regulates gathering pursuant to Oklahoma statute. 
On September 30, 2004, Enogex made its required triennial filing at the FERC to update its Section 311 maximum interruptible transportation rate. On September 29, 2004, Enogex filed an updated fuel factor with the FERC for the last quarter of 2004. Finally, on November15, 2004, Enogex filed its annual updated system-wide fuel factor for fuel year 2005 calendar year 2005. The proceedings were resolved by a unanimous settlement that the FERC approved without modification or condition, by order of September 19, 2005. The Settlement established new maximum interruptible Section 311 zonal rates for an East Zone and a West Zone on the Enogex system, confirmed that Enogex could unbundle its gathering and transportation services and permitted the fuel factor percentages for the last quarter of 2004 and for fuel year 2005 to become effective, as filed. The FERC order concluded all
four proceedings which resulted in no refunds being due. Enogex must file its next rate case no later than October 1, 2007 to comply with the FERCs requirement for triennial filings.
Enogex 2007 Fuel Filing
As required by the fuel tracker provisions of its SOC, Enogex files annually to update its fuel percentages. On November 15, 2006, Enogex filed zonal fuel percentages for the 2007 calendar fuel year. As had been agreed in the settlement of the 2004 Section 311 rate case, Enogex established an East Zone fixed fuel percentage and a West Zone fixed fuel percentage to be recalculated annually to replace the system-wide fixed fuel percentage previously established annually for the Enogex system. By order dated December 19, 2006, the FERC approved and accepted Enogexs November 15, 2006 zonal fuel factors as fair and equitable effective January 1, 2007. 
Gas Transportation and Storage Agreement
As part
of the 2002 Settlement Agreement, OGE also agreed to consider competitive bidding as a basis to select
its provider for gas transportation service to its natural gas-fired generation facilities pursuant to the
terms set forth in the 2002 Settlement Agreement. Because the required integrated service was not available
in the marketplace from parties other than Enogex, OGE advised the OCC that, after careful consideration,
competitive bidding for gas transportation was rejected in favor of a new intrastate integrated, firm no-notice
load following gas transportation and storage services agreement with Enogex. This seven-year agreement provides
for gas transportation and storage services for each of OGEs natural gas-fired generation facilities. OGE will pay Enogex annual demand fees of approximately $468 million for the right to transport specified maximum daily quantities MDQ and maximum hourly quantities MHQ of gas at various minimum gas delivery pressures depending on the operational needs of the individual generating facility. In addition, OGE supplies system fuel in-kind for its pro-rata share of actual fuel and lost and unaccounted for gas on the transportation system.  To the extent OGE transports gas in quantities exceeding the prescribed MDQs or MHQs, it pays an overrun service charge. During the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004, OGE paid Enogex approximately $475 million, $476 million and $496 million, respectively, for gas transportation and storage services.
On July 14, 2005,
the OCC issued an order in this case approving a $419 million annual recovery. The OCC order disallowed the recovery
by OGE of the amount that Enogex charges OGE for the cost of fuel used, or otherwise unaccounted for, in
providing natural gas transportation and storage service to OGE. Over the last three years, this amount has
ranged from $10 million to $34 million annually. This amount was approximately $10 million in 2006 and is projected
to be approximately $11 million in 2007. The OCCs order required OGE to refund to its Oklahoma customers
the 
114 difference between the amounts collected from such customers in the past based on an annual rate of $468 million for
gas transportation and storage services and the $419 million annual rate authorized by the OCCs order. Based on
the order, OGEs refund obligation was
approximately $88 million. OGE began refunding this obligation in September 2005 through its automatic fuel
adjustment clause. The obligation was fully refunded at September30, 2006.
In connection with the Enogex gas transportation and storage agreement, OGE also recorded a refund obligation in Arkansas of approximately $11 million at December 31, 2005. OGE provided to the APSC the OCC evidence and above findings showing that the Arkansas refund was calculated consistently with the Oklahoma refund. OGE applied the refund obligation to its fuel clause under recoveries balance in April and customers began receiving this refund in April 2006 and will continue through March 2007.
Security Enhancements
On April 8, 2002, OGE filed a joint
application with the OCC Staff requesting approval for security investments and a rider to recover these costs from the ratepayers.
On October 28, 2004, all parties signed a joint stipulation that contains the OCC Staffs recommendations and authorizes up to a
$5 million annual recovery from OGEs customers for security enhancement. On December 21, 2004, the OCC issued an order
approving the stipulation which included a security rider. OGE implemented the security rider with the first billing period in
July 2006 and began charging OGEs Oklahoma customers approximately $24 million annually. In compliance with the OCC order, in
October 2006, OGE filed a report regarding the recovery of the security costs through the authorized recovery rider for the period
from July 1, 2006 to September 30, 2006. The OCC
authorized tariff provides that the security rider may be updated quarterly. In December 2006, OGE updated the security rider to
recover approximately $29 million annually beginning with the first billing cycle in January 2007. OGE also filed an application
with the OCC on December 15, 2006 to amend its security plan to seek approval of approximately $76 million of cost increases related to
the expanded scope of previously authorized projects and approximately $109 million for new security projects. The annual revenue
requirement associated with the $185 million of capital expenditures is approximately $27 million. A procedural schedule was issued in
February 2007 in this matter with hearings scheduled to begin on May 30, 2007. OGE expects the OCC to issue an order in the third quarter of 2007
in this matter.
Competitive Bidding, Prudence Reviews and Other Rules for Electric Utility Providers
On March 10, 2005, the OCC filed Cause No. PUD 200500129 regarding Inquiry of the Oklahoma Corporation Commission into Guidelines for Establishing Rules for Competitive Bidding and Prudence Reviews for Electric Utility Providers. On June 10, 2005, the OCC voted to close this notice of inquiry and directed the OCC Staff to open a rulemaking to address the competitive bidding issue for electric utilities and other matters. Rules were adopted by the OCC on January 18, 2006 and became effective on April 3, 2006. The new rules: i establish a competitive procurement process for purchase of long-term electric generation and long-term fuel supplies; ii clarify existing law by requiring that a prudence review of utility fuel and generation procurement be conducted no less frequently than every two years; iii require a utility to submit an integrated resource plan to the OCC
every three years; and iv establish a process in accordance with House Bill 1910 whereby a utility may seek pre-approval for recovery of costs associated with transmission upgrades, generation facility modifications caused by environmental requirements and the purchase or construction of generation facilities. OGE does not expect these rules to have a significant impact on its operations.
OGE SO2 Allowance Filing
On February 10, 2006, OGE, the OCC Staff and AES Shady Point AES filed a joint application with the OCC to determine the treatment of proceeds received from OGEs sale of SO2 allowances and how these proceeds will be shared between OGE and its customers for any sales after December 31, 2005. In the application, the parties proposed that AES be held harmless from any reduction in OGEs coal costs caused by the sale of SO2 allowances and that the proceeds of such sales be shared 80 percent with OGEs Oklahoma customers and the remaining 20 percent to OGE. A credit rider was requested to pass the proceeds from the sale of the SO2 allowances to Oklahoma customers. Any proceeds from the sale of SO2 allowances in the Arkansas and the FERC jurisdictions will flow through OGEs automatic fuel adjustment clause. On June 5,
2006, the parties signed a settlement agreement providing that the proceeds of such sales after December 31, 2005 are to be shared 90 percent with OGEs Oklahoma customers and the remaining 10 percent to OGE. On June 26, 2006, the OCC approved the settlement agreement, including the 90/10 sharing mechanism. During 2006, OGE recorded approximately $08 million in SO2 sales proceeds from sales in 2006 that are included as an increase in Operating Revenues in the Consolidated Statement of Income. 
115 Review of OGEs Fuel Adjustment Clause for Calendar Years 2003 and 2004
The OCC routinely audits activity in OGEs fuel adjustment clause for each calendar year. On March 18, 2005, the OCC Staff filed Cause No. PUD 200500140 regarding Application of the Public Utility Division Director for Public Hearing to Review and Monitor OGEs Fuel Adjustment Clause for Calendar Year 2003. On August 25, 2005, the OCC Staff filed Cause No. PUD 200500327 regarding Application of the Public Utility Division Director for Public Hearing to Review and Monitor OGEs Fuel Adjustment Clause for Calendar Year 2004. On September 27, 2005, the OCC consolidated these two proceedings into one proceeding. Oklahoma Industrial Energy Consumers, AES, Redbud and PowerSmith Cogeneration Project, L.P intervened in this proceeding. On September 21, 2006, OGE reached a settlement with the other parties in this case that
required no refunds. On October 16, 2006, the OCC issued an order that approved the settlement concluding that OGEs 2003 fuel costs were prudent and OGEs 2004 fuel costs were appropriately calculated. Also, as part of the settlement, OGE agreed to develop minimum filing requirements for future fuel adjustment clause reviews.
Cogeneration Credit Rider
On September 17, 2004, OGE filed an application and testimony with the OCC requesting a cogeneration credit rider. The requested rider reduces cogeneration charges to customers because of decreasing cogeneration payments made by OGE beginning January 2005. The cogeneration credit rider is necessary because amounts currently recovered from customers in base rates include historically higher cogeneration payments. OGEs cogeneration credit rider has been updated and approved by the OCC in December of each year through December 2006 and any over/under recovery of the cogeneration credit rider in the current year and prior periods has been automatically included in the next years rider. OGEs current cogeneration credit rider expired December 31, 2006. The 2007 cogeneration credit rider is approximately $807 million and the total under recovery
through 2006 was approximately $31 million. OGE expects to file an application with the OCC in late 2007 to request a cogeneration credit for years after 2007.
Pending Regulatory Matters
OGE Wind Power Filing
In January 2007, the Centennial wind farm in
northwestern Oklahoma was fully in service. Through December 31, 2006, OGE has spent approximately $1711 million related to the Centennial wind farm.
The OCC previously had approved a settlement agreement approving the Centennial wind power contract and a recovery rider for up to $205 million in construction costs and allowance for funds used during construction. The settlement also indicated that OGE shall file for a general rate review during 2009 that will permit the OCC to issue an order no later than December 31, 2009 placing the Centennial wind farm in OGEs rate base. On January 17, 2007, OGE sent notice to the OCC to trigger the Centennial wind farm rider for the first billing cycle in February 2007. The recovery rider is designed to recover approximately $226 million in the first year of operations, which amount will decline over the life of the facility. Because the wind farm rider was implemented in February
2007, OGE expects to recover approximately $207 million under the rider during the remaining 11 months of 2007. OGE expects the recovery rider to remain in effect through late 2009. As explained below, the recent rate order from the APSC allows for the recovery of the portion of the Centennial wind farm allocable to OGEs customers in Arkansas. 
OGE Arkansas Rate Case Filing
On July 28, 2006, OGE filed
with the APSC an application for an annual rate increase of approximately $135 million to recover, among other things, its investment
in, and the operating expenses of, the McClain Plant, the Centennial wind power project and the costs of electric system expansion and
upgrades based on a return on equity of 1175 percent. On November 29, 2006, OGE reached a settlement with the other parties in
this case for an annual rate increase of approximately $54 million. In the settlement agreement, the parties also agreed that OGE
would be allowed to recover the full Arkansas portion of the Centennial wind farm. On January 5, 2007, the APSC approved the settlement
and issued a rate order that provides for a $54 million annual increase in OGEs electric rates and a 100 percent return on
equity. The new Arkansas rates became effective in February 2007. Proposed Construction of Power Plant
On July 18, 2006, the Company
announced plans for OGE to partner with American Electric Powers subsidiary, Public Service Company of
Oklahoma PSO, and the OMPA to build a new 950 MW coal unit at OGEs existing Sooner plant location near
Red Rock, Oklahoma. The estimated $18 billion project is the result of PSOs December 2005 
116 request for proposals in which it
sought bids for up to 600 MWs of new base load generation to be available to PSO. The unit, to be called
Red Rock, is expected to be one of the cleanest of its size using coal from the Powder River Basin, which is located near Gillette, Wyoming.
OGE will operate the facility and expects to spend approximately $759 million in construction costs related to its 42 percent ownership
percentage in the project and approximately $30 million in transmission costs for the project. PSO will own 50 percent and the
OMPA will own eight percent. On December 1, 2006, OGE submitted an application to the ODEQ for an air permit for the Red Rock
plant. OGE is seeking to have the air permit approved by the ODEQ by August 1, 2007. OGE expects construction to begin in
2007 and is targeting the completion of the power plant in the 2011/2012 timeframe. OGE filed an application with the OCC on January 17, 2007
asking the OCC to find that its portion of the construction costs are prudent and that a recovery mechanism should be established to
recover OGEs overall cost of capital on the investment during the construction period. The OCC rules provide that the OCC
has up to 240 days to issue an order determining OGEs pre-approval request, however OGEs application requested
that the OCC issue an order by July 20, 2007. The project is contingent upon numerous factors, including the successful completion of
contract negotiations and the necessary regulatory and environmental approvals. Under the construction, ownership and
operating agreement between OGE, PSO and the OMPA, the parties could incur up to $60 million of which approximately $25 million
would be borne by OGE prior to the receipt of acceptable regulatory approvals and permits. If such approvals and permits were not
obtained and the Red Rock project was abandoned, the Company can provide no assurance that these expenditures incurred by OGE would be
recoverable in future rates. 
FERC Audit
On May 29, 2006, the FERC notified OGE that it was commencing an audit to determine whether and how OGE is complying with: i its Open Access Transmission Tariff; ii requirements of its market-based rate authorization; iii Standards of Conduct and Open Access Same-Time Information System; and iv wholesale fuel adjustment clause tariff and other requirements contained in the FERC regulations. Over the past several years, the FERC has conducted numerous audits of utilities across the country to ensure regulatory compliance. OGE is currently in the process of providing information to the FERC. OGE cannot predict either the final outcome or the timing of the completion of this audit.
Uniform Fuel Adjustment Clause Filing
On January 23, 2006, the Director of the Public Utility Division of the OCC filed Cause No. PUD 200600012 regarding an application to review the OCCs regulation of the automatic rate adjustment clauses of all public energy utilities operating in Oklahoma and subject to the OCCs jurisdiction. A technical conference for electric utilities was held on March 17, 2006. At this time, OGE does not believe the outcome of this proceeding will significantly impact the Company.
Southwest Power Pool
OGE is a member of the SPP,
the regional reliability organization for all or parts of Oklahoma, Arkansas, Kansas, Louisiana, New Mexico, Mississippi, Missouri
and Texas. OGE participated with the SPP in the development of regional transmission tariffs and executed a Membership
Agreement with the SPP to facilitate interstate transmission operations within this region in 1998. In October 2003,
the SPP filed an application with the FERC seeking authority to form an RTO. In a FERC order dated October 1, 2004,
the SPP was granted RTO status, subject to the SPP submitting a further compliance filing. On January 25, 2005, the
FERC issued an order on compliance filing stating that the November 1, 2004 SPP compliance filing satisfied the October 1 FERC order. The approval of the SPP RTO application is not expected to significantly impact the Companys consolidated financial results.
The regional state committee, which is comprised of commissioners of the applicable state regulatory commissions, finished its process of formulating a methodology for funding transmission expansion in the SPP control area by allocating costs of transmission expansion to the SPP members who benefit. The SPP Board of Directors adopted this plan and filed it with the FERC on February 28, 2005, Docket No. ER05-652. The FERC conditionally accepted the plan on April 21, 2005 with an effective date of May 5, 2005. The SPP made a second compliance filing on October 20, 2005 on various minor issues associated with the plan. On January 11, 2006, the FERC conditionally accepted the compliance filing, but required the SPP to make minor wording changes within 30 days. The SPP filed these minor wording changes on February 10, 2006.
The SPP filed on June 15, 2005,
Docket No. ER05-1118, to create a real-time, offer-based energy imbalance service market that will require cash settlements for
over or under generation. Market participants, including OGE, will be required to submit resource plans and can submit
offer curves for each resource available for dispatch. In addition, the SPP may order certain dispatching of generating units
and has implemented a market monitoring plan that provides a clear set of rules, the potential consequences if the rules are
violated and the areas in which an independent market monitor will examine and report.  On March 20, 2006, the FERC issued an
order that conditionally accepted a portion of the filing and suspended 
117 and rejected other portions of the filing. After several delays, the SPP Board of Directors voted to implement
the energy imbalance service market no earlier than
February 1, 2007. The SPP filed a certification of readiness to the FERC on January 18, 2007 that addressed issues raised
by intervenors to the proceeding. The SPP energy imbalance service market began operations on February 1, 2007. As one
condition to participation in the energy imbalance service market, OGE, as well as other balancing authorities in the
SPP, were required to submit open access tariff schedules setting forth the rates, terms and conditions for the provision of
emergency energy service. OGE submitted the required schedule on September 13, 2006, in Docket No. ER06-1488-000. On
January 31, 2007, the FERC issued an order conditionally accepting OGEs proposed emergency energy schedule,
subject to OGE submitting, within 30 days, a compliance filing making certain revisions required by the FERC. 
On August 8, 2005, the SPP filed with the FERC for approval, Docket No. ER05-1285, tariff provisions which contained, among other items, a standard definition of transmission to be used in the SPP RTO.  The definition provides a uniform basis for application of formula rates, exercise of functional control of the transmission system, planning and expansion of the transmission system, compensation of new transmission owners and provides for a three-year period for petitioning for deviations from the bright line definition. The basic definition of transmission facilities is similar to definitions accepted for other RTOs. On September 30, 2005, the FERC accepted the definition, with minor modification. On November 29, 2005, the SPP submitted a compliance filing consistent with the September 30 FERC directions for modification.
On August 5, 2004, OGE filed with the APSC in Docket 04-111-U an application for approval of its participation in the SPP RTO. The application was filed pursuant to the provisions of the Arkansas code, which require that no public utility shall sell, lease, rent or otherwise transfer, in any manner, control of electric transmission facilities in this state without the approval of the APSC, provided that the approval is required only to the extent the transaction is not subject to the exclusive jurisdiction of the FERC or any other federal agency. On October 12, 2004, the SPP filed with the APSC in Docket 04-137-U an application for a Certificate of Public Convenience and Necessity for the limited purpose of managing and coordinating the use of certain transmission facilities located within the state of Arkansas. The APSC consolidated these two dockets, among others, and a public
hearing was held on April 4, 2006. On August 10, 2006, the APSC issued an order granting OGE, subject to certain conditions,
permission to transfer functional control of its transmission facilities to the SPP. Also, in a separate order, the APSC granted the
application of the SPP for a certificate of public convenience and necessity to transact business as a public utility in Arkansas due to
asserting functional control of certain transmission facilities in Arkansas. The APSC, however, denied the SPPs request for a
waiver of the applicability of various provisions of state law. Also, on December 1, 2006, the APSC issued an order closing the combined
dockets described above.
Market-Based Rate Authority
On December 22, 2003,
OGE and OERI filed a triennial market power update based on the supply margin assessment test. On May 13, 2004, the
FERC directed all utilities with pending three year market-based reviews to revise the generation market power portion of
their three year review to address the new interim tests. OGE and OERI submitted a compliance filing to the FERC on
February 7, 2005 that applied the interim tests to OGE and OERI. In the compliance filing, OGE and OERI passed
the pivotal supplier screen but did not pass the market share screen in the OGE control area. OGE and OERI provided an explanation as to why their failure of the market share screen in the OGE control area should not be viewed as an indication that they can exercise generation market power. 
On June 7, 2005, the FERC issued an order on OGEs and OERIs market-based rate filing. Because OGE and OERI failed the market share screen for OGEs control area, the FERC established hearing procedures to investigate whether OGE and OERI may continue to sell power at market-based rates in OGEs control area. The order established a rebuttable presumption that OGE and OERI have the ability to exercise market power in the OGE control area. OGE and OERI were requested to provide additional information that demonstrates to the FERC that they cannot exercise market power in the first-tier markets as well. However, the order conditionally allows OGE and OERI to sell power in first-tier markets subject to OGE and OERI providing
additional information that clearly shows that they pass the market share screen for the first-tier markets. OGE and OERI provided that additional information on July 7, 2005. On August 8, 2005, OGE and OERI informed the FERC that they will: i adopt the FERC default rate mechanism for sales of one week or less to loads that sink in OGEs control area; and ii commit not to enter into any sales with a duration of between one week and one year to loads that sink in OGEs control area. OGE and OERI also informed the FERC that any new agreements for long-term sales one year or longer in duration to loads that sink in OGEs control area will be filed with the FERC and that OGE and OERI will not make such sales under their respective market based rate tariffs. On January 20, 2006, the FERC issued a Notice of Institution of Proceeding and Refund Effective Date for the purpose
of establishing the date from which any subsequent market-based sales would be subject to refund in the event the FERC concludes after investigation that the rates for such sales are not just and reasonable. The refund effective date was March 27, 2006. 118 On March 21, 2006, the FERC issued an
order conditionally accepting OGEs and OERIs proposal to mitigate the presumption of market power in the OGE control
area. First, the FERC accepted the additional information related to first-tier markets submitted by OGE and OERI, and concluded that
OGE and OERI satisfy the FERCs generation market power standard for directly interconnected first-tier control areas.
Second, the FERC directed the Company to make certain revisions to its mitigation proposal and file a cost-based rate tariff for short-term
sales one week or less made within the OGE control area. The FERC also expanded the scope of the proposed mitigation to all sales
made within the OGE control area instead of only to sales sinking to load within the OGE control area. On April 20, 2006, the
Company submitted: i a compliance filing containing the specified revisions to the Companys market-based rate tariffs and the
new cost-based rate tariff; and ii a request for rehearing asking the FERC to reconsider its expanded mitigation directive contained
in the March 21, 2006 order. On May 22, 2006, the FERC issued a tolling order that effectively provided the FERC additional time to
consider the April 20, 2006 rehearing request. On July 25, 2006 and August 25, 2006, pursuant to a FERC March 20, 2006 order, OGE
and OERI filed revisions to their market-based rate tariffs to allow them to sell energy imbalance service into the wholesale markets
administered by the SPP at market-based rates. The FERC has not yet acted on OGEs April 20, 2006, July 25, 2006 or
August 25, 2006 filings. On February 6, 2007, OGE and OERI submitted to the FERC a change in status
report notifying the FERC that OGE has placed into service OGEs Centennial wind farm, a wind farm with a nameplate capacity rating
of 120 MW. OGE and OERI explained that adding this capacity was not material to the FERCs grant of market-based rate status to
OGE and OERI. The FERC has not yet acted on this change in status filing. Department of Energy Blackout Report
On April 5, 2004, the U.S. Department of Energy issued its final report regarding the August 14, 2003 electric blackout in the eastern United States, which did not have an adverse affect on OGEs electric system. The report recommends a number of specific changes to current statutes, rules or practices in order to improve the reliability of the infrastructure used to transmit electric power. The recommendations include the establishment of mandatory reliability standards and financial penalties for noncompliance. On April 14, 2004, the FERC issued a policy statement requiring electric utilities, including OGE, to submit a report on vegetation management practices and indicating the FERCs intent to make North American Electric Reliability Council reliability standards mandatory. On June 17, 2004, OGE filed its report on vegetation management practices with
the FERC. During 2004, OGE spent less than $02 million related to the implementation of blackout report recommendations. Implementation of the blackout report recommendations and the FERC policy statement could increase future transmission costs, but the extent of the increased costs is not known at this time.
National Energy Legislation
In late 2006, the FERC issued final regulations, pursuant to the 2005 Energy Policy Act, governing the elimination of mandatory purchase obligations by utilities from qualified facilities under PURPA. Those regulations offer the potential for OGE as a member of the SPP to avoid new mandatory purchase obligations under certain conditions. In addition, in December 2006, Congress enacted and the President signed into law legislation extending through 2008 several energy tax credits, including the tax credit for renewable energy sources such as wind power, that otherwise would have expired in 2007. Looking ahead to 2007, Congress will likely consider several issues of interest to OGE, including proposals to create a federal mandate for utilities to generate a specified percentage of their power from renewable sources, as well as proposals to impose mandatory global climate
emission controls that might limit emissions of carbon dioxide and other so-called greenhouse gases from coal based electric generation facilities. 
State Legislative Initiatives
Oklahoma
The 2006 legislative session concluded on May 26, 2006, with no legislation being passed that had a material impact on the Company. One bill, House Bill 1386 was introduced in the 2005 session and was carried over into the 2006 session. That bill, if passed, could have an impact on the Companys ability to compete with other utility providers. The bill proposed that utilities be able to continue to serve and expand, if so desired, in service territories in which they currently serve but which a municipality annexes. OGE believes current case law authorizes utilities to serve and expand in an area described above. House Bill 1386 would codify OGEs belief. The bill failed to be heard in the Senate in 2006.
As discussed
above, legislation was enacted in Oklahoma in the 1990s that was to restructure the electric utility industry
in that state. The implementation of the Oklahoma restructuring legislation was delayed and seems unlikely to
proceed anytime in the near future. Yet, if ultimately enacted, this legislation could deregulate OGEs
electric generation assets and cause OGE to discontinue the use of SFAS No. 71 with respect to its related
regulatory balances. The 119 previously-enacted Oklahoma legislation would not affect OGEs electric
transmission and distribution assets and OGE believes that the continued use of SFAS No. 71 with respect
to the related regulatory balances is appropriate. Based on a current evaluation of the various factors and
conditions that are expected to impact future cost recovery, management believes that its regulatory
assets, including those related to generation, are probable of future recovery. Summary
The Energy Act, the actions of the FERC, the restructuring legislation in Oklahoma and other factors are intended to increase competition in the electric industry. OGE has taken steps in the past and intends to take appropriate steps in the future to remain a competitive supplier of electricity. While OGE is supportive of competition, it believes that all electric suppliers must be required to compete on a fair and equitable basis and OGE is advocating this position vigorously.

The carrying value of the financial instruments on the Consolidated Balance Sheets not otherwise discussed above approximates fair value except for long-term debt which is valued at the carrying amount. The valuation of the Companys interest rate swaps and energy trading contracts was determined primarily based on quoted market prices. However, in certain instances where market quotes are not available, other valuation techniques or models are used to estimate market values. The valuation of instruments also considers the credit risk of the counterparties and the potential impact of liquidating the position in an orderly manner over a reasonable period of time. The fair value of the Companys long-term debt is based on quoted market prices and managements estimate of current rates available for similar issues with similar maturities. See Note 7 for a discussion of
Enogexs trading contracts with set off provisions.

AThese amounts have been restated due to the sales of EAPC and Enerven being reported as discontinued operations during 2005 and the sale of certain gas gathering assets in Kinta, Oklahoma, being reported as discontinued operations during 2006.
BAs described above in Note 18 of the Notes to
Consolidated Financial Statements, the OCC, in its order dated December 12, 2005, granted OGE a $423 million annual increase in the
rates charged by OGE to its retail customers in Oklahoma. These increased rates became effective in January 2006 pursuant to approved
tariffs filed with the OCC. In January 2007, OGE determined that the approved tariffs had inadvertently authorized OGE to collect, and OGE had collected, approximately $267 million of additional fuel-related revenues during 2006 that was not intended by the December 12, 2005 order. As a result, OGE filed with the OCC in January 2007 amendments to its previously-authorized tariffs, in order to cease recovery of the fuel-related revenues not intended by the December 12, 2005 order. The $267 million, plus $12 million of interest, was recorded as a
liability under Fuel Clause Over Recoveries on the Consolidated Balance Sheet in the fourth quarter of 2006, and such amounts, along with
other Fuel Clause Over Recoveries, will be credited to OGEs Oklahoma customers in 2007 and 2008 through OGEs automatic
fuel adjustment clause. In addition, OGE recorded a reduction in operating revenues of approximately $267 million and an increase in
interest expense of approximately $05 million, which resulted in an after tax reduction in net income of approximately $167 million in the
fourth quarter of 2006. On a quarterly basis, collections of such additional amounts under the previously-authorized tariffs represented
approximately $78 million of operating revenues $48 million of net income for the quarter ended March 31, 2006,
approximately $77 million of operating revenues $47 million of net income for the quarter ended June 30, 2006 and approximately
$59 million of operating revenues $36 million of net income for the quarter ended September 30, 2006.   Dividends

The
Company maintains a set of disclosure controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required
to be disclosed by the Company in reports that it files or submits under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the Securities and Exchange Commission SEC rules and forms. In addition, the disclosure controls and procedures ensure that information required to be disclosed is accumulated and communicated to management, including the chief executive officer CEO and chief financial officer CFO, allowing timely decisions regarding required disclosure. As of the end of the period covered by this report, based on an evaluation carried out under the supervision and with the participation of the Companys management, including the CEO and CFO, of the effectiveness of the Companys disclosure controls and procedures as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15e and 15d-15e under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the CEO and CFO have concluded that the Companys disclosure
controls and
procedures are effective. 
No change in the Companys internal control over financial reporting has occurred during the Companys most recently completed fiscal quarter that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, the Companys internal control over financial reporting as such term is defined in Rules13a-15f and 15d-15f under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. 
123 Managements Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting
The management of OGE Energy Corp. the Company is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting. The Companys internal control system was designed to provide reasonable assurance to the Companys management and Board of Directors regarding the preparation and fair presentation of published financial statements. All internal control systems, no matter how well designed, have inherent limitations. Therefore, even those systems determined to be effective can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement preparation and presentation.
The Companys management assessed the effectiveness of the Companys internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2006. In making this assessment, it used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission in Internal Control-Integrated Framework. Based on our assessment, we believe that, as of December 31, 2006, the Companys internal control over financial reporting is effective based on those criteria.
The Companys independent auditors have issued an attestation report on managements assessment of the Companys internal control over financial reporting. This report appears on the following page.

ACCOUNTING FIRM
The Board of Directors and Stockholders
OGE Energy Corp. 
We have audited managements assessment, included in the accompanying Managements Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting, that OGE Energy Corp. maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2006, based on criteria established in Internal ControlIntegrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission the COSO criteria. OGE Energy Corp.s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on managements assessment and an opinion on the effectiveness of the companys internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. 
We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board United States. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, evaluating managements assessment, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.
A companys internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A companys internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that 1 pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; 2 provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and 3
provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the companys assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
In our opinion, managements assessment that OGE Energy Corp. maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2006, is fairly stated, in all material respects, based on the COSO criteria. Also, in our opinion, OGE Energy Corp. maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2006, based on the COSO criteria.
We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board United States, the consolidated balance sheets and statements of capitalization of OGE Energy Corp. as of December31, 2006 and 2005, and the related consolidated statements of income, retained earnings, comprehensive income and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December31,2006 of OGE Energy Corp. and our report dated February 14, 2007 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.
