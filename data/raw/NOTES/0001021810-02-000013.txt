2 SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
a Principles of Consolidation -  The  consolidated  financial statements
include the accounts of the Company and its wholly owned subsidiaries after
elimination of all material inter-company balances and transactions. Certain
reclassifications have been made to the prior year financial statements to
conform to the 2001 financial statement presentation.
b Accounting Estimates - The  preparation  of financial   statements in
conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of
America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the
reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets
and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts
of revenues and expenses during the period. Estimates include, but are not
limited to, an allowance for doubtful accounts, a provision for forward loss and
project plans for the completion and delivery of certain solutions. Actual
results could differ from those estimates.
c Revenue Recognition - The Company supplies Internet banking and electronic
bill presentment and payment software to FI. The Company revenues associated
with integrated solutions that bundle software products with customization,
installation and training services are recognized using the percentage of
completion method of accounting.
Starting late in 2000, the Company entered into contracts for its bill
payment technology software.  This software does not require significant
customization. Upon delivery, the Company either recognizes revenue ratably over
the contract period for contracts where vendor specific objective evidence
VSOE of fair value for post contract customer support PCS does not exist or
recognizes revenue in full where VSOE of fair value for PCS does exist.
The Company enters into multiple element arrangements. Elements typically
include software, consulting, implementation and PCS. PCS contracts generally
require the Company to provide technical support and unspecified, readily
available software updates and upgrades to customers. Revenue for these multiple
element arrangements is recognized when there is persuasive evidence of an
arrangement and delivery to the customer has occurred, the fee is fixed and
determinable, and collectibility is considered probable. Advance payments are recorded as deferred revenue until the products are shipped, services are
delivered and all obligations are met. Currently, the Company does not have VSOE
of fair value for some of the elements within its multiple element arrangements.
Therefore, all revenue under such arrangements is being recognized ratably over
the term of the PCS contract. Revenue from transactional services, which
includes hosting and service bureaus, is recognized as transactions are
processed.
Emerging Issues Task Force Abstract Issue No. 00-3, Application of AICPA
Statement of Position 97-2 to Arrangements that Include the Right to Use
Software Stored on Another Entity Hardware EITF 00-3, provides guidance in
determining whether or not the provisions of Statement of Position No. 97-2,
Software Revenue Recognition SOP 97-2, should be applied to hosting
arrangements. The Company has some contracts where the customers operate our
software in an ASP environment. The customer may not take possession of the
software without incurring significant transition and infrastructure costs, as
well as potential payments of fees to the Company for the termination of such
arrangements. In cases where the customer has not licensed software from
InteliData, the customer must also purchase a license prior to having the right
to use the software in its own operating environment, in addition to the
aforementioned fees. In these situations, the Company applies the guidance under
EITF 00-3 and the Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 101, Revenue Recognition in
Financial Statements, and recognizes the revenue associated with the license
and/or implementation fees ratably over the initial term of the contract.
Additionally, based on the EITF 00-3 guidance, the Company concluded that
SOP 97-2 should not be applied to certain of its contracts and their related
revenue for license and professional services were recognized under the
percentage of completion method. In addition to our developing and delivering
the solution, the Company is entitled to transaction fees based on the number of
users and transactions. These transaction fees are earned based on the monthly
user counts and as transactions are processed.
d Cash and Cash Equivalents -  The Company  considers all non-restricted,
highly liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less to be
cash equivalents.  Cash and cash equivalents are stated at cost, which
approximates their fair market value.
e Investments - The Company reports its investments in marketable securities
as available-for-sale with any unrealized holding gains and losses, net of the
related income tax effect, excluded from earnings and reported as a separate
component of stockholders' equity until such gains or losses are realized.
Dividends and interest income are recognized when earned. Realized gains or
losses are included in earnings and are derived using the first-in, first-out
method for determining cost of securities sold.
Adoption of New Accounting  Pronouncement - Prior to  January 1, 2001,
the Company considered its investment in warrants to purchase common stock of
Sybase, Inc. Sybase to be available-for-sale under the provisions of
Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 115, Accounting for Certain
Investments in Debt and Equity Securities. Effective January 1, 2001, the
Company adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 133, Accounting
for Derivative  Instruments and Hedging  Activities SFAS 133,  which
establishes accounting and reporting standards for derivative instruments and
for hedging activities by requiring that all derivatives be recognized in the
balance sheet and measured at fair value. Effective January 1, 2001, the
Company investment in the Sybase warrants was accounted for in accordance with
SFAS 133.
f Property  and  Equipment - Property and equipment is stated at cost.
Depreciation of property and equipment is calculated using the straight-line
method over the estimated useful lives of the assets, which are generally in the
range of three to seven years.
g Net Liabilities of Discontinued Operations - Under various disposal
plans adopted in 1997, 1998, and 2000, the Company has completed the divestiture
of all of its telecommunications, interactive services businesses and the Caller
ID adjunct leasing activities, respectively.
h Deferred Revenues - Deferred revenues represent unearned  revenues  for
services that have not yet been provided or where certain accounting revenue
recognition criteria have not yet been met.
i Income Taxes -  Income taxes are accounted for in accordance with the
asset and liability method. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized
for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the
financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and
their respective tax bases. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to
taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to
be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a
change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the
enactment date. Valuation allowances are established against deferred tax assets
when it is deemed, based on available evidence, that it is more likely than not
that some portion or all of the deferred tax asset will not be realized.
j Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation - The Company accounts for employee
stock options in accordance with Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 25
APB 25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees. Under APB 25, the Company
recognizes no compensation expense related to employee stock options, as no
options are granted at a price below the market price on the day of grant. The
Company accounts for stock options issued to non-employees in accordance with
the provisions of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123 SFAS
123, Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation.
SFAS 123 prescribes the recognition of compensation expense based on the
fair value to options on the grant date and allows companies to continue
applying APB 25 if certain pro forma disclosures are made assuming hypothetical
fair value method application. The Company has elected to continue to apply the
provisions of APB 25 for options granted to employees and provide the pro forma
disclosures pursuant to SFAS 123.
k Net Income Loss Attributable to Common Stockholders per share - Basic
earnings loss per common share EPS is computed by dividing net income
loss, after deducting preferred stock dividend requirements and amortization
of the discounts on the preferred stock that was issued in 1999, by the basic
weighted-average common shares outstanding during the year. Diluted EPS reflects
the dilutive effect of stock options and stock awards granted to employees under
stock-based compensation plans, as well as stock warrants. The effects of stock
options and warrants were not included in the loss per share computations in
2001 and 1999 because they would have been anti-dilutive.
l Fair Value of Financial Instruments - The carrying values of the Company
financial instruments such as cash and cash equivalents, investments in common
stock,  warrants,  and bonds, accounts receivable,  and accounts payable
approximate their fair values.
m New Accounting Pronouncements - In June 2001, the Financial Accounting
Standards Board issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 141,
Business Combinations SFAS 141 and SFAS No. 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible
Assets SFAS 142. SFAS 141 requires business combinations initiated after June
30, 2001 to be accounted for using the purchase method of accounting, and
broadens the criteria for recording intangible assets separate from goodwill.
SFAS 142 requires the use of an amortization and non-amortization approach to
account for purchased goodwill and certain intangibles. Under a non-amortization
approach, goodwill and certain intangibles will not be amortized into results of
operations, but instead would be reviewed for impairment and written down and
charged to results of operations only in the periods in which the recorded value
of goodwill and certain  intangibles is more than its fair value. The
amortization and non-amortization provisions of SFAS 142 will be applied to all
goodwill and intangible assets acquired after June 30, 2001. The provisions of
each statement that apply to goodwill and intangible assets acquired prior to
June 30, 2001 will be adopted by the Company on January 1, 2002. We expect the
adoption of these accounting standards will have the impact of reducing our
amortization of the current goodwill and certain intangibles commencing January
1, 2002 and reviews for impairment may result in future periodic write-downs.
In August 2001, the FASB issued SFAS No. 144, Accounting for the Impairment
or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets, which is effective January 1, 2002. This
statement replaces SFAS No. 121, Accounting for the Impairment of Long-Lived
Assets and for Long-Lived Assets to Be Disposed Of, and some provisions of
Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 30, Reporting the Effects of Disposal of
a Segment of a Business and Extraordinary, Unusual and Infrequently Occurring
Events and Transactions. SFAS No. 144 requires that one accounting model be used
for long-lived assets to be disposed of by sale, whether previously held and
used or newly acquired. It also broadens the presentation of discontinued
operations to include more disposal transactions. The Company adoption of this
pronouncement on January 1, 2002 is not expected to have a material affect on
the Company financial position, results of operations, or cash flows. n Concentration of Credit Risk - Financial  instruments that potentially
subject the Company to credit risk consist principally of trade receivables. The
Company sells its products primarily to FI in the United States. The Company
believes that the concentration of credit risk in its trade receivables is
substantially mitigated by the Company on-going credit evaluation process and
the financial position of the FI that are highly regulated. The Company does
not generally require collateral from customers. The Company establishes an
allowance for doubtful accounts based upon factors surrounding the credit risk
of specific customers, historical trends and other information. As of December
31, 2001, the Company top six customer comprised approximately 52% of the net
accounts receivable balance.
3 INVESTMENTS
On January 20, 2000, Home Financial Network, Inc. HFN, a company in
which InteliData held approximately a 25% ownership interest, merged with
Sybase, Inc. Sybase. InteliData accounted for its investment in HFN using
the equity method. As of the merger date, such investment carrying value was
zero. In exchange for its portion of ownership in HFN, InteliData received
approximately $5,867,000 in cash and approximately 1,770,000 shares of Sybase
stock. The Company also held warrants to purchase HFN common stock. As part of
the merger agreement, such warrants were converted into warrants to purchase
Sybase common stock. The Company received 640,000 warrant units with an
exercise price of $260 per warrant unit. Upon exercise of each warrant unit,
the Company is entitled to receive $1153448 in cash and 034794 share of Sybase
common stock.
As part of this merger transaction, an escrow account was established to
provide Sybase indemnity protection against possible claims that might arise
against HFN. Approximately 133,000 shares of Sybase common stock owned by
InteliData were put in escrow, along with approximately $440,000 of cash. In
March 2001, the Company received the escrow payments less approximately $129,000
for miscellaneous claims under the escrow provision. During 2000, InteliData
recognized a gain of approximately $42,604,000 on this transaction and a gain of
$5,998,000 on the subsequent disposition of some of the Sybase common stock. The
remaining holdings of Sybase common stock were sold during 2001 for a net gain
of $507,000.
Additionally, the Company acquired approximately $251,000 of marketable
securities during 2000. The Company considers all of its investments to be
available-for-sale under the provisions of Statement of Financial Accounting
Standards No. 115, Accounting for Certain Investments in Debt and Equity
Securities, and as such, included within stockholders' equity as of December 31,
2001 is $10,000 of unrealized loss on investments net of taxes, which
represents the decrease in the fair market value of the investment holdings from
the acquisition price to December 31, 2001.
As of December 31, 2001, the Company has classified all investments, other
than the Sybase warrants, as available-for-sale. All fixed income securities are
due after five years. The amortized cost, gross unrealized holding gains, gross
unrealized holding losses and fair value of the securities were as follows in
thousands             Cost or     Gross      Gross

Cost      Gains      Losses      Value
Fixed income securities $  251     $  -     $ 10     $ 241
Prior to January 1, 2001, the Company considered its investment in warrants
to purchase common stock of Sybase, Inc. Sybase to be available-for-sale
under the provisions of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 115,
Accounting for Certain Investments in Debt and Equity Securities. Effective
January 1, 2001, the Company adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standards
No. 133, Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities SFAS
133, which establishes accounting and reporting standards for derivative
instruments and for hedging activities by requiring that all derivatives be
recognized in the balance sheet and measured at fair value.
SFAS 133 requires that all derivative financial instruments, such as
forward currency exchange contracts, interest rate swaps and the Company
warrants to purchase Sybase stock, be recognized in the financial statements and
measured at fair value regardless of the purpose or intent for holding them.
Changes in the fair value of derivative financial instruments are either
recognized periodically in income or stockholders' equity as a component of comprehensive income, depending on whether the derivative is being used to
hedge changes in fair value or cash flows. The Company holdings of the Sybase
warrants are defined as derivatives under this guidance. As discussed in Note 1,
effective January 1, 2001, the Company investment in the Sybase warrants were
accounted for in accordance with SFAS 133. The Company adoption of this
pronouncement, effective January 1, 2001, did not have a material effect on the
Company financial statements as of the adoption date. The Company adoption
of this pronouncement, effective January 1, 2001, did not result in an
adjustment for the cumulative effect of an accounting change, because the
carrying value reflected fair value under the previous accounting guidance. In
accordance with SFAS 133, the Company recorded an unrealized loss on investment
of $866,000 for the year ended December 31, 2001.
In accordance with SFAS 115, the balance sheets include $210,000 and
$494,000 of unrealized gain on investments net of taxes, within stockholders'
equity as of December 31, 2001 and 2000, respectively. As of December 31, 2000,
the unrealized gain on investments balance represented the increase in the fair
market value of the Sybase holdings from the January 20, 2000 merger transaction
date to the respective balance sheet date. As of December 31, 2001, the
accumulated other comprehensive loss balance represents the changes in the fair
market value of the Sybase common stock. In accordance with SFAS 133, the change
in the fair market value of the Sybase warrants was recorded in the statement of
operations see below.
As of December 31, 2001, the warrants to purchase Sybase common stock had
an estimated fair value of approximately $2,676,000. The fair value of the
warrants  described above was estimated on December 31, 2001 using the
Black-Scholes model using the following: no dividend yield, expected volatility
of 60%, life of 18 months, and a risk free interest rate of 610% per annum.

on the excess of the current estimates at completion of the total contract costs
over total contract revenues.
6 DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS
As of December 31, 2001, the net liabilities of discontinued operations of
$504,000 relate to the telecommunications divisions. This relates to the
potential environmental clean up associated with InteliData former New
Milford, Connecticut property. In January 2000, InteliData sold the New Milford,
Connecticut building, its only remaining asset in discontinued operations of the
telecommunications division. In the context of this sale InteliData agreed to undertake limited remediation of the site in accordance
with applicable state law. The subject site is not a federal or state Superfund
site and InteliData has not been named a potentially responsible party at the
site. The remediation plan agreed to with the purchaser allows InteliData to use
engineering and institutional controls e.g., deed restrictions to minimize the
extent and costs of the remediation. Further, at the time of the sale of the
facility,  InteliData  established a $200,000 escrow account for certain
investigation/remediation costs. As of December 31, 2001, this escrow account
balance remained at $200,000. Moreover, InteliData has obtained environmental
insurance to pay for remediation costs up to $6,600,000 in excess of a retained
exposure limit of $600,000. InteliData estimates its liability related to this
matter and other costs to be approximately $504,000 and has recorded a liability
for that amount.
The Company has engaged a legal firm and an environmental specialist firm
to represent InteliData regarding this matter. The timing of the ultimate
resolution of this matter is estimated to be from three to five years under the
Company proposed compliance plan, which involves a natural attenuation and
periodic compliance monitoring approach. Management does not believe that the
resolution of this matter will be likely to have a material adverse effect on
the Company financial condition or results of operations.
The Company leased Caller ID adjunct units under an agreement with US West,
whereby the Company leased Caller ID units directly to US West customers. The
leasing program enabled subscribers to pay a monthly fee for the equipment. In
1996, US West ceased leasing new Caller ID adjunct units under the program.
Notwithstanding the termination of this program, previously existing leases
remained in effect. The number of active records in the Company installed
lease base historically decreased at a rate of approximately 30% per year.
During 2000, US West notified the Company that US West would no longer permit
InteliData to include the lease billing on the US West telephone bills. As such,
InteliData has discontinued billing its legacy customers for Caller ID adjunct
unit leases in the US West telephone service territory, because the cost of
individually billing and pursuing collections for the leases would have made it
impractical and uneconomical for the Company to continue the lease program.
Accordingly, the results of operations from leasing activities have been
reported as discontinued operations.
During the second quarter of 1998, the Company adopted a plan to dispose of
its various telecommunications divisions through sale and liquidation. The
Company Caller ID adjunct inventory was sold in May 1998. The Company Plexus
inventory was sold in December 1998. The Company IPS and Landmark inventory
was sold in February 1999.
Discontinued operations consisted of results from the telecommunications
division and the Caller ID leasing business for the years ended December 31 in
thousands                                          2001    2000     1999

Summary of Discontinued Operations
In 2000, the Company experienced a loss of $262,000 in discontinued
operations of the Caller ID business, while there was a gain of $2,579,000 in
1999. The loss in 2000 was primarily the result of the Company write-off of
the remaining accounts receivable.
The gain on disposal of the telecommunications and interactive services
divisions was $3,226,000 in 1999, which represented adjustments to provisions
made in 1998 for items that were a direct result of the decision to dispose of
the segment including: favorable settlements with former telecommunications
customers, the success of other settlements with vendors and negotiated expense
settlements, aggressive collection efforts, and lower than anticipated costs for
warranty and customer service expenses attributable to closing down the
discontinued operations.
The 1998 loss on disposal of telecommunications and interactive service
divisions of $16,174,000 consisted of provisions for items that were a direct
result of the decision to dispose of the segment including: $2,696,000 in expected sales returns, $3,539,000 in property adjustments, $3,010,000 in
provisions for customer allowances, and $6,929,000 in actual and expected losses
from operations from the measurement date through the date of disposal.
All of the above results are net of applicable income taxes. There was no
tax effect in 2000 and 1999 because of the Company overall net losses and the
Company carryforward net operating losses from prior periods from both
continuing and discontinued operations.
7 STOCKHOLDERS' EQUITY
a Issuance and Subsequent Conversion of Preferred Stock and Warrants - On
July 22, 1999, the Company issued 600 shares of 4% Convertible Preferred Stock,
for net proceeds of $5,670,000. A portion of the proceeds was allocated to
warrants to purchase 120,000 shares of InteliData common stock and to the
beneficial conversion feature of such preferred stock, with the resulting
discount on the preferred stock being amortized as dividends. Each holder of the
preferred stock was entitled to convert up to 20% of the preferred stock issued
to the holder during each of the four months from and after August 1999. The
conversion price for each share of preferred stock was the lesser of $509 or
85% of the average of the three lowest closing sales prices per share of
InteliData common stock during the 22 trading days preceding the conversion date
of the share of preferred stock. In the fourth quarter of 1999, all of the
preferred stock was converted to common shares.
The fair value of these 120,000 warrants, which expire five years from the
issuance date and have an exercise price of $453, was estimated as of the grant
date using the Black-Scholes model. The following assumptions were used: no
dividend yield, expected volatility of 129%, life of 5 years, and a risk free
interest rate of 400% per annum.  Accordingly,  the Company  allocated
approximately $369,000 to these warrants and the charge was amortized over the
period that the preferred stock was outstanding. As of December 31, 2001 and
2000, 101,500 and 104,000 warrants respectively remained outstanding.
b Stock Options and Awards - The Company sponsors several stock option
and award plans that cover substantially all employees and directors. Options
and awards granted under such plans typically vest over periods ranging from one
to five years and generally expire in eight and ten years, although some grants
provide for vesting in annual increments or allow for accelerated vesting based
upon reaching performance milestones.
The Company amortizes the fair value of the stock awards based on the fair
value of common stock on the grant dates multiplied by the number of shares
granted over the respective vesting periods. In 2001, 2000, and 1999, the
Company recorded $1,484,000, $578,000, and $405,000 of compensation expense
related to these awards.
Options granted under the plans allow the purchase of stock at the fair
value of such common stock at the respective grant dates. Because options are
issued with exercise prices equal to the fair value of the common stock on the
grant dates, the Company does not record any compensation expense for these
options.
A summary of stock option activity for each of the Company stock option
plans is as follows                    Exercise Prices

The Company applies the intrinsic value method of Accounting Principles
Board Opinion No. 25 and related interpretations in accounting for its stock
plans. Had compensation cost been determined based on the fair value method of
Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123, the Company results of
operation would have been as follows in thousands, except for per share data
for the years ended December 31                         2001    2000    1999
Net income loss              $35,346 $ 18,836  $ 7,679
Basic earnings loss per common share   $ 077 $  049  $ 023
Diluted earnings loss per common share  $ 077 $  046  $ 023
The weighted average fair value of options granted during 2001, 2000, and
1999 was $357, $685, and $153, per share, respectively. The fair value of
options granted was estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes
option-pricing model. For 2001 year-end,  the following weighted average
assumptions were used: no dividend yield, expected volatility of 92%, and a risk
free interest rate of 456% per annum. For 2000 year-end, the following weighted
average assumptions were used: no dividend yield, expected volatility of 134 and a risk free interest rate of 516% per annum. For 1999 year-end, the
following weighted average assumptions were used: no dividend yield, expected
volatility of 156%, and a risk free interest rate of 55% per annum.

c Employee Stock Purchase Plan - Under  the  Employee Stock Purchase Plan,
approved in 1996, the Company is authorized to issue up to 500,000 shares of
common stock to its full-time employees, nearly all of who are eligible to
participate. Under the terms of the Plan, employees can choose each period to
have up to twenty percent of their annual base earnings withheld to purchase the
Company common stock. The purchase price of the stock is 85 percent of the
lower of its beginning-of-period or end-of-period market price. During the years
ended December 31, 2001, 2000, and 1999 the Company issued 28,822, 30,318, and
23,259, shares of stock under the Plan, respectively.
d Treasury  Stock - In 2001 and 2000, the Company paid $41,000 and $59,000
to acquire an additional 15,632 and 9,212 shares of its own common stock,
respectively. These shares were surrendered by employees of the Company to
satisfy tax-withholding obligations associated with the vesting of certain
restricted stock awards. Additionally, the Company participated in a program
permitted by the Securities and Exchange Commission and Nasdaq to buy-back
100,000 shares of its common stock shortly after the events surrounding the
terrorist attacks in September 2001 for a total of $309,000. As of December 31,
2001 and 2000, the Company had a total of 806,344 and 690,712 common shares in
treasury at an aggregate cost of $2,473,000 and $2,123,000, respectively.
e Stockholder Rights Plan - In January 1998, the Company Board of Directors
adopted a Stockholder Rights Plan. This plan was amended on May 24, 2000. The
rights are designed to assure that all the Company stockholders receive fair
and equal treatment in the event of any proposed takeover of the Company and to
guard against partial tender offers, open market accumulations and other tactics to
gain control of the Company without paying all stockholders a control premium.
Terms of the Stockholder Rights Plan provide for a dividend distribution of
one right for each share of common stock to holders of record at the close of
business on February 6, 1998. Shareholders will be able to exercise the rights
only in the event, with certain exceptions, an acquiring party accumulates 20
percent or more of the Company voting stock, or if a party an acquiring
person announces an offer to acquire 20 percent or more without prior approval
of the Company Board of Directors. The rights will expire on January 21, 2008.
Each right initially will entitle the holder to buy one one-thousandth of a
share of a new series of preferred stock at a price of $4250.
In addition, upon the occurrence of certain events, holders of the rights
will be entitled to purchase either the Company common stock or shares in an
acquiring person at half of market value. Further, at any time after a person or
group acquires 20 percent or more of the Company outstanding voting stock, the
board of directors may, at its option, exchange part or all of the rights other
than rights held by the acquiring person, which will become void for shares of
the Company common stock on a one-for-one basis. The rights will therefore
cause substantial dilution to a person or group that acquires 20 percent or more
of the Company common stock on terms not approved by the board.
f Stock Warrants - In 2000, the Company entered into a five-year agreement
with an unrelated party, whereby the Company issued warrants to this entity in
exchange for the entity becoming a premier reference site for InteliData
service bureau offering. As a premier reference site, the entity would make its
facility and personnel reasonably accessible for InteliData, InteliData
potential clients, analysts, and industry publication reporters, in order to
demonstrate or answer questions regarding a service bureau environment and
InteliData capabilities. On June 30, 2000, InteliData issued five-year,
fully-vested warrants to purchase 50,000 share of InteliData common stock at an
exercise price of $475 per share. The fair value of these warrants was
estimated as of the grant date using the Black-Scholes model. The following
assumptions were used: no dividend yield, expected volatility of 143%, life of 2
years, and a risk free interest rate of 644% per annum. Accordingly, the
Company recorded approximately $419,000 of deferred compensation that is being
amortized over the term of this agreement. For the years ended December 31, 2001
and 2000, the expense charged related to these warrants were $80,000 and
$60,000, respectively. As of December 31, 2001, all of these warrants were still
outstanding.
g Private Placement and Warrants - In November and December 2001, the Company
closed private placement sales of an aggregate of 2,862,727 shares of its common
stock for a price of $275 per share, and warrants exercisable for the purchase
of 1,431,364 shares of its common stock, at an exercise price of $275 per
share, resulting in a gross proceeds of approximately $7,872,500. The placement
agent in the transaction, Stonegate Securities, received approximately $472,350
in commissions and warrants exercisable for the purchase of 286,273 shares of
InteliData common stock, at an exercise price of $275 per share.
8 EMPLOYEE 401k SAVINGS PLAN
The Company sponsors a defined contribution plan Plan that qualifies
for tax treatment  under Section 401a of the Internal  Revenue Code.
Participation in the Plan is available to employees who are at least twenty-one
years of age. Company contributions to the Plan are based on a percentage of
employee contributions. The Company contributed $153,000, $89,000, and $60,000
in 2001, 2000, and 1999, respectively. The Company also pays for administrative
expenses incurred by the Plan.

provision.  The tax effects of temporary differences that give rise to
significant portions of the deferred tax assets and liabilities at December 31,

Net deferred tax assets          $   --    $                                      The net changes in the total valuation allowance for the years ended
December 31, 2001, 2000, and 1999 were an increase decrease of $30,020,000 8,140,000, and $602,000, respectively. A valuation allowance was established
for deferred tax assets as of December 31, 2001 and 2000 because it was deemed,
based on available evidence, that it is more likely than not that all of the
deferred tax asset will not be realized.
At December 31, 2001, the Company had net operating loss carryforwards for
federal income tax purposes of approximately $193 million, which expire in 2008
through 2021, general business tax credits of approximately $489,000, which
expire in 2005 through 2010, and an alternative minimum tax credit carryforward
of approximately $197,000, which may be carried forward indefinitely and used to
offset future regular taxable income. Annual use of net operating loss
carryforwards of approximately $45 million, which was incurred by Home Account
prior to its acquisition by the Company, will be limited under the Internal
Revenue Code as a result of cumulative changes in ownership of more than 50% in
2001.
10 COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES
a Leases - The Company leases facilities and equipment under cancelable and
noncancelable operating lease agreements. The facility leases are for terms from
one to five years. Rent expense was $1,436,000, $735,000, and $483,000 for the
years ended December 31, 2001, 2000, and 1999, respectively.
Future minimum lease payments under noncancelable operating leases with
initial or remaining terms in excess of one year at December 31, 2001, were as

b Patent Matters - The  Company  does  not  believe that its products and
services infringe on the rights of third parties. From time to time, third
parties assert infringement claims against InteliData. There can be no assurance
that any such assertion will not result in costly litigation or require the
Company to cease using, or obtain a license to use, intellectual property rights
of such parties.
c Litigation - The  Company  is  not currently  a party to any material
litigation. From time to time, the Company is a party to routine litigation
incidental to its business. Management does not believe that the resolution of any or all of such routine litigation will be likely to have a material
adverse effect on the Company financial condition or results of operations.
11 VALUATION AND QUALIFYING ACCOUNTS

As part of the Home Account acquisition during the year, the Company
acquired certain  accounts  receivables that were outstanding as of the
acquisition date. The Company pursued collections efforts, but ultimately
determined that some of these accounts were uncollectible. Such doubtful
accounts related to these acquired assets cannot be adjusted as part of the
purchase price allocation, but the bad debt expense must be recognized as
current operations. During 2001, the Company recorded costs associated with
these particular sets of uncollectible accounts in the amount of $1,090,000 and
began to write off some accounts. Additionally, the Company wrote off some
previously reserved legacy InteliData accounts.
12 ACQUISITION OF HOME ACCOUNT
On January 11, 2001, the Company acquired Home Account Holdings, Inc.
Home Account and its operating subsidiary, Home Account Network, Inc.,
pursuant to an agreement and plan of merger whereby a wholly-owned subsidiary of
the Company merged with and into Home Account, with Home Account surviving the
merger as the Company wholly-owned subsidiary. This acquisition was accounted
for as a purchase. Following the Company acquisition of Home Account,
InteliData provides a suite of UNIX-based electronic banking and electronic bill
presentment and payment EBPP products and services in an application
services provider ASP environment.
Pursuant to the merger agreement, the Company purchased Home Account for
approximately $320,000 in cash and 6,900,000 shares of Company common stock and
the merger was accounted for as a purchase. The purchase price was the result of
an arm-length negotiation between the Company and Home Account, based on the
Company evaluation of the fair market value of Home Account business,
including its revenues. The value of the shares issued as part of the purchase
consideration of approximately $29,011,000 was measured based on the average of
the market price of the issued common stock a few days before and after January
11, 2001 - the date that the merger transaction was agreed to and announced.
This amount coupled with the liability associated with the Home Account
Incentive Plan of $2,946,000 see below resulted in an increase of $31,957,000
in the accompanying statement of changes in stockholders' equity. The total
purchase price of approximately $31,186,000 consisted of the following in
thousands   Consideration and acquisition costs:
Value of shares issued        $  29,011
Cash consideration              320
Acquisition costs              1,855
$  31,186
The assets acquired and liabilities assumed were recorded at estimated fair
values as determined by the Company management based on information currently
available and on current assumptions as to future operations. The Company has
obtained independent professional services for the purchase price allocation to
the fair values of the acquired property, plant and equipment, and identified intangible assets,
and their remaining useful lives and has completed its review and determination
of the fair values of the other assets acquired and liabilities assumed. A
summary of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed in the acquisition
follows in thousands    Allocation of purchase price:
Current assets                        $ 1,562
Property, plant and equipment                  1,743
Intangibles straight-line amortization, 8 to 10 years    11,400
Liabilities assumed and other                 4,344
Liabilities associated with Home Account Incentive Plan    2,946
Acquisition integration liabilities              1,822
Goodwill straight-line amortization, 8 years         25,593
$ 31,186
Intangible assets consist of $4,200,000 for assembled workforce which has
an  estimated  useful  life  of  eight  years  and  $7,200,000  for
contracts/relationships which has an estimated useful life of ten years.
Assembled workforce was determined based on the number of Home Account
employees, function, compensation, fringe benefits, recruiting costs, training,
and other factors. Contracts/relationships was determined based on the history
of low attrition, the high cost of switching, market prices, forecasted
revenues, evaluation of competitors, and other factors.
As a result of the acquisition of Home Account, InteliData incurred
acquisition expenses for costs to exit certain activities at Home Account
locations and to involuntarily terminate employees of the acquired company.
Generally accepted  accounting  principles require that these acquisition
integration expenses, which are not associated with the generation of future
revenues, have no future economic benefit and which meet certain other criteria,
be reflected as assumed liabilities in the allocation of the purchase price to
the net assets acquired. The components of the acquisition  integration
liabilities balance of $1,822,000 included in the purchase price allocation are
approximately $1,010,000 for lease costs for the now vacated Home Account
headquarters in Emeryville, California, and $822,000 related to workforce
reduction. As of December 31, 2001, the Company had a remaining liability of
$777,000 associated with such lease costs, of which $237,000 is current and
$540,000 is noncurrent.
The workforce reductions focused on three key areas: 1 streamlining
development efforts, 2 eliminating redundant administrative overhead and
support  activities,  and  3  restructuring  and  repositioning  of the
sales/marketing  and research and development  organizations to eliminate
redundancies in these activities. As of December 31, 2001, 87 positions have
been terminated and approximately $822,000 had been paid.
The following pro forma financial information presents the combined results
of operations of InteliData Technologies Corporation and Home Account Holdings,
Inc. and gives effect to the acquisition of Home Account as if it occurred on
January 1, 1999. The pro forma condensed combined financial information set
forth below reflects certain adjustments, including among others, adjustments to
reflect the amortization of the goodwill associated with the acquisition.
However, pro forma results do not include any anticipated cost savings. The pro
forma condensed combined financial information for the years ended December 31,
2001, 2000, and 1999, set forth below neither purports to represent what the
consolidated results of operations or financial condition of InteliData would
actually have been if the Home Account acquisition had in fact occurred on such
date nor projects the future consolidated results of operations or financial
condition of InteliData in thousands, except for per share data                         2001     2000    1999

Basic net loss income per share      073    003    058
Diluted net loss income per share     073    003    058
Pro forma basic net income loss per share was computed using the
weighted-average number of shares of common stock outstanding after the issuance
of InteliData common stock to acquire the outstanding shares of Home Account.
Pro forma diluted net income loss per share also gives effect to any dilutive
options. Options and warrants are excluded from the computation during loss
periods, as their effect is anti-dilutive. 13 Home Account Incentive Plan
In 2000, Home Account approved the 2000 Incentive Plan to encourage the
retention of certain officers of Home Account through a change of control
transaction, and after such a transaction to the extent, up to one year, as
desired by the acquirer. Upon acquisition of Home Account by an acquirer, the
2000 Incentive Plan provided for the granting to plan participants of an
aggregate of 15% of the net amount of the merger consideration allocable to Home
Account preferred stockholders after payment of the debt preference and other
expenses associated with a transaction. Under the InteliData and Home Account
merger transaction, this incentive plan is payable in the form of InteliData
common stock and such payments are to be made by the group of former Home
Account preferred stockholders who are collectively considered as a principal
stockholder. Two-thirds of the 2000 Incentive Plan allocation vested on the
transaction closing date and represent a pre-acquisition expense to Home
Account. In connection with the merger transaction, the Company agreed to
advance the participants funds to pay for their tax withholding obligations
associated with the two-thirds portion. The original principal amount of this
receivable balance was approximately $1,116,000. The shares allocable to the
participants were placed in an escrow account and are released to the Home
Account Stockholders' Representative in accordance with the Merger Consideration
Escrow Agreement. As of December 31, 2001, the remaining outstanding receivable
balance, including interest, was approximately $466,000 and is reflected in the
Other receivable balance. On February 4, 2002, the remaining outstanding
balance plus additional interest accrued was paid in full.
The remaining one-third of the participants' allocation vested on January
11, 2002 one year from the transaction closing date. All forfeited shares
reverted to the preferred stockholders of Home Account. In connection with the
2000 Incentive Plan allocation, the deferred compensation for the one-third
portion is estimated to be $349,000 based on $283 the closing price of the
Company common stock at December 31, 2001 and is charged to expense over the
vesting period. For the year ended December 31, 2001, the Company recorded
compensation expense of approximately $339,000.
14 EARNINGS PER SHARE
Basic earnings  loss per share EPS are calculated  using the
weighted-average number of shares of common stock outstanding during each
period. Diluted EPS reflect the dilutive effect of stock options and stock
awards granted to employees under stock-based compensation plans, as well as
stock warrants. Basic and diluted earnings per share are calculated as follows

$1944 were outstanding during 2000, but were not included in the computation of
diluted earnings per share, because the options' exercise prices were greater
than the average market price of the common share. 15 UNAUDITED QUARTERLY FINANCIAL DATA
