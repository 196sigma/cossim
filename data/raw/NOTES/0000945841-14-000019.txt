These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audits.We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board UnitedStates. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated financial position of Pool Corporation at December31,2013 and 2012, and the consolidated results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2013, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board UnitedStates, PoolCorporation internal control over financial reporting as of December31,2013, based on criteria established in the Internal Control-Integrated Framework, issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission 1992 Framework, and our report dated February 27, 2014 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.NewOrleans, LouisianaFebruary 27, 201440POOL CORPORATIONConsolidated Statements of IncomeIn thousands, except per share dataYear Ended December 31,201320122011Net  of   and administrative  impairment6,9461,550Operating  expense, net6,7486,4697,964Income before income taxes and equity  for income taxes61,59056,74445,319Equity earnings in unconsolidated investments182316209Net  per  average shares  dividends declared per common share$073$062$055The accompanying Notes are an integral part of these Consolidated Financial Statements41POOL CORPORATIONConsolidated Statements of Comprehensive IncomeIn thousandsYear Ended December 31,201320122011Net  comprehensive income loss:Foreign currency translation  in unrealized gains and losses on interest rate swaps, net of tax of $660, $1,163 and  other comprehensive income   accompanying Notes are an integral part of the Consolidated Financial Statements42POOL CORPORATIONConsolidated Balance SheetsIn thousands, except share dataDecember 31,20132012AssetsCurrent assets:Cash and cash  net45,138113,859Receivables pledged under receivables facility80,149Product inventories, net429,197400,308Prepaid expenses and other current assets9,80211,280Deferred income taxes5,4575,186Total current assets577,749543,096Property and equipment,  intangible assets, net10,19611,053Equity interest investments1,2431,160Other assets, net10,2718,718Total  and stockholders' equityCurrent liabilities:Accounts  expenses and other current  portion of long-term debt and other long-term liabilities923Total current  income taxes19,10813,453Long-term debt246,418230,882Other long-term liabilities8,1476,622Total  equity:Common stock, $001 par value;

We distribute products through threenetworks: SCPDistributorsLLC SCP, Superior Pool ProductsLLC Superior and Horizon Distributors,Inc. Horizon. Superior and Horizon are both wholly owned subsidiaries of SCP, which is a wholly owned subsidiary of Pool Corporation.Basis of Presentation and Principles of ConsolidationWe prepared the Consolidated Financial Statements following U.S. generally accepted accounting principles GAAP and the requirements of the Securities and Exchange Commission SEC. The financial statements include all normal and recurring adjustments that are necessary for a fair presentation of our financial position and operating results. The Consolidated Financial Statements include the accounts of PoolCorporation and our wholly owned subsidiaries. We eliminated all significant intercompany accounts and transactions among our wholly owned subsidiaries.Use of EstimatesIn order to prepare financial statements that conform to GAAP, we make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in our financial statements and accompanying notes. Our most significant estimates are those relating to the allowance for doubtful accounts, inventory obsolescence reserves, vendor incentives, income taxes, incentive compensation accruals and goodwill impairment evaluations. We continually review our estimates and make adjustments as necessary, but actual results could be significantly different from what we expected when we made these estimates.Recent Accounting PronouncementsOn January 1, 2013, we adopted the Financial Accounting Standards Board Accounting Standards Update No. 2013-02, Reporting of Amounts Reclassified Out of Accumulated Other Comprehensive IncomeASU 2013-02.  Under the new standard we are required to disclose the effect on income statement line items from the reclassification of a component of accumulated other comprehensive income into net income. If a reclassification does not impact net income, we are required to disclose the resulting financial statement effects and reference the applicable accounting guidance. The adoption of this guidance did not have an impact on our financial position or results of operations. Segment ReportingSince all of our sales centers have similar operations and share similar economic characteristics, we aggregate our sales centers into a single reportable segment. Our chief operating decision maker CODM evaluates each sales center based on individual performance that includes both financial and operational measures. Additionally, our CODM makes decisions about how to allocate resources primarily on a sales center-by-sales center basis. We do not track sales by product lines and product categories on a consolidated basis. Based on the number of product lines and product categories that we have, and the fact that we make ongoing changes as to how products are classified within these groups, it is impracticable to report our sales by product category. 46Seasonality and WeatherOur business is highly seasonal and weather is one of the principal external factors affecting our business. In general, sales and net income are highest during the second and third quarters, which represent the peak months of both swimming pool use and installation and landscape installations and maintenance. Sales are substantially lower during the first and fourth quarters, when we may incur net losses.Revenue RecognitionWe recognize revenue when four basic criteria are met:1.persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists;2.delivery has occurred or services have been rendered;3.our price to the buyer is fixed or determinable; and4.collectibility is reasonably assured.We record revenue when customers take delivery of products. Customers may pick up products at any sales center location, or we may deliver products to their premises or job sites via our trucks or third party carriers. Products shipped via third party carriers are considered delivered based on the shipping terms, which are generally FOB shipping point. We include shipping and handling fees billed to customers as freight out income within net sales.We offer volume incentives to some of our customers and we account for these incentives as an adjustment to sales. Weestimate the amount of volume incentives earned based on our estimate of cumulative sales for the fiscal year relative to our customers progress toward achieving minimum purchase requirements. We record customer returns, including those associated with early buy programs, as an adjustment to sales. In the past, customer returns have not been material. Other items that we record as adjustments to sales include cash discounts, pricing adjustments and credit card fees related to customer payments.We also report sales net of tax amounts that we collect from our customers and remit to governmental authorities. These tax amounts may include, but are not limited to, sales, use, value added and some excise taxes.Vendor IncentivesMany of our arrangements with our vendors provide for us to receive incentives of specified amounts of consideration when we achieve any of a number of measures. These measures are generally related to the volume level of purchases from our vendors and may include negotiated pricing arrangements. We account for vendor incentives asa reduction of the prices of the vendors products and therefore as a reduction of inventory until we sell the product, at which time such incentives are recognized as a reduction of cost of sales in our income statement.Throughout the year, we estimate the amount of the incentive earned based on our estimate of total purchases for the fiscal year relative to the purchase levels that mark our progress toward earning the incentives. We accrue vendor incentives on a monthly basis using these estimates provided that we determine they are probable and reasonably estimable. Wecontinually revise these estimates to reflect actual incentives earned based on actual purchase levels and trends related to sales and purchasing mix. Whenwe make adjustments to our estimates, we determine whether any portion of the adjustment impacts the amount of vendor incentives that are deferred in inventory. We recognize changes in our estimates for vendor incentives as a cumulative catch-up adjustment to the amounts recognized to date in our Consolidated Financial Statements.Shipping and Handling CostsWe record shipping and handling costs associated with inbound freight as cost of sales. The table below presents shipping and handling costs associated with outbound freight, which we include in selling and administrative expenses  CompensationWe record share-based compensation for stock options and other share-based awards based on the estimated fair value as measured on the grant date. For stock option awards, we use a Black-Scholes model for estimating the grant date fair value. For additional discussion of share-based compensation, see Note6.Advertising CostsWe expense advertising costs when incurred. The table below presents advertising expense for the past three years  TaxesWe record deferred tax assets or liabilities based on differences between the financial reporting and tax basis of assets and liabilities using currently enacted rates and laws that will be in effect when we expect the differences to reverse. Dueto changing tax laws and state income tax rates, significant judgment is required to estimate the effective tax rate expected to apply to tax differences that are expected to reverse in the future.We record a valuation allowance to reduce the carrying amounts of net deferred tax assets if there is uncertainty regarding their future realization. We consider many factors when assessing the likelihood of future realization including our recent cumulative earnings experience by taxing jurisdiction, expectations of future taxable income, the carryforward periods available to us for tax reporting purposes and other relevant factors. For additional discussion of income taxes, see Note7.Equity Method InvestmentsWe account for our 50% investment in NorthparkCorporateCenter,LLC NCC using the equity method of accounting. Accordingly, we report our share of income or loss based on our ownership interest in this investment.Earnings Per ShareWe calculate basic earnings per share by dividing net income or loss by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding. We include outstanding unvested restricted stock awards of our common stock in the basic weighted average share calculation. Diluted earnings per share includes the dilutive effects of other share-based awards. For additional discussion of earnings per share, see Note8.Foreign CurrencyThe functional currency of each of our foreign subsidiaries is its applicable local currency. We translate our foreign subsidiary financial statements into U.S. dollars based on published exchange rates. We include these translation adjustments as a component of Accumulated other comprehensive income loss on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. We include realized transaction gains and losses that arise from exchange rate fluctuations in Interest expense, net on the Consolidated Statements of Income. Werealized net foreign currency transaction losses of $02 millionin 2013, net gains of $01 millionin 2012and net losses of $06 millionin 2011. Fair Value Measurements Our assets and liabilities that are measured at fair value on a recurring basis include the unrealized gains or losses on our interest rate swap contracts. We use significant other observable market data or assumptions Level 2 inputs as defined in the accounting guidance that we believe market participants would use in pricing similar assets or liabilities, including assumptions about risk when appropriate48The table below presents the estimated fair value of our interest rate swap contracts in thousands:Fair Value at December 31,Level 220132012Unrealized Losses on Interest Rate Swaps$1,710$3,404We include unrealized losses in Accrued expenses and other current liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.The carrying values of cash, receivables, accounts payable and accrued liabilities approximate fair value due to the short maturity of those instruments and the carrying value of long-term debt approximates fair value.Ourdetermination of the estimated fair value of long-term debt reflects a discounted cash flow model using our estimates, primarily those related to assumptions for borrowing rates Level 3 inputs as defined in the accounting guidance.Interest Rate SwapsWe designate our interest rate swaps as cash flow hedges and record the changes in fair value to Accumulated other comprehensive income loss on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. If our interest rate swaps became ineffective, we would immediately recognize the changes in fair value of our interest rate swaps in earnings. A portion of the change in the estimated fair value of our interest rate swap contracts between periods relates to future interest expense. Recognition of the change in fair value between periods attributable to accrued interest is reclassified from Accumulated other comprehensive income loss to Interest expense, net on the Consolidated Statements of Income. These amounts were not material in 2013.We recognize any differences between the variable interest rate payments and the fixed interest rate settlements from our swap counterpartiesas an adjustment to interest expense over the life of the swaps. Foradditional discussion of our interest rate swaps, see Note5. Cash EquivalentsWe consider all highly liquid investments with an original maturity of three months or less when purchased to be cash equivalents.Credit Risk and Allowance for Doubtful AccountsWe record trade receivables at the invoiced amounts less an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses we may incur if customers do not pay. We perform periodic credit evaluations of our customers and we typically do not require collateral. Consistent with industry practices, we generally require payment from our North American customers within 30days, except for sales under early buy programs for which we provide extended payment terms to qualified customers.At the end of each quarter, we perform a reserve analysis of all accounts with balances greater than $20,000and more than 60days past due. Additionally, we perform a separate reserve analysis on the balance of our accounts receivables with emphasis on the remainder of the past due portion of the aging. During the year, we write off account balances when we have exhausted reasonable collection efforts and determined that the likelihood of collection is remote. These write-offs are charged against our allowance for doubtful accounts.The following table summarizes the changes in our allowance for doubtful accounts for the past three years  at beginning of year$5,477$5,900$7,102Bad debt  net of  at end of  Inventories and Reserve for Inventory ObsolescenceProduct inventories consist primarily of goods we purchase from manufacturers to sell to our customers. We record inventory at the lower of cost, using the average cost method, or market. We establish our reserve for inventory obsolescence based on inventory turns byclass with particular emphasis on stock keeping units with the weakest sales over the previous 12months or 36months for tile products. The reserve is intended to reflect the net realizable value of inventory that we may not be able to sell at a profit.In evaluating the adequacy of our reserve for inventory obsolescence at the sales center level, we consider a combination of factors including:the level of inventory in relationship to historical sales by product, including inventory usage by class based on product sales at both the sales center and Company levels;changes in customer preferences or regulatory requirements;seasonal fluctuations in inventory levels;geographic location; andnew product offerings.We periodically adjust our reserve for inventory obsolescence as changes occur in the above-identified factors.The following table summarizes the changes in our reserve for inventory obsolescence for the past three years  at beginning of  for inventory  for inventory  at end of  and EquipmentProperty and equipment are stated at cost. We depreciate property and equipment on a straight-line basis over the following estimated useful lives:Buildings40 yearsLeasehold improvements 11 - 10 yearsAutos and trucks3 - 5 yearsMachinery and equipment3 - 10 yearsComputer equipment3 - 7 yearsFurniture and fixtures5 - 10 years1For substantial improvements made near the end of a lease term where we are reasonably certain the lease will be renewed, we amortize the leasehold improvement over the remaining life of the lease including the expected renewal period.The table below presents depreciation expense for the past three years in  use the acquisition method of accounting and recognize assets acquired and liabilities assumed at fair value as of the acquisition date. Any contingent assets acquired and contingent liabilities assumed are also recognized at fair value if we can reasonably estimate fair value during the measurement period which cannot exceed oneyear from the acquisition date. We expense all acquisition related costs as incurred, including any restructuring costs associated with a business combination50We remeasure any contingent liabilities at fair value in each subsequent reporting period. If our initial acquisition accounting is incomplete by the end of the reporting period in which a business combination occurs, we report provisional amounts for incomplete items. Once we obtain information required to finalize the accounting for incomplete items, we retrospectively adjust the provisional amounts recognized as of the acquisition date. We make adjustments to these provisional amounts during the measurement period.For all acquisitions, we include the results of operations in our Consolidated Financial Statements as of the acquisition date. Foradditional discussion of acquisitions, see Note2.Goodwill and Other Intangible AssetsGoodwill represents the excess of the amount we paid to acquire a company over the estimated fair value of tangible assets and identifiable intangible assets acquired, less liabilities assumed. We test goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment annually as of October1st and at any other time when impairment indicators exist.We estimate the fair value of our reporting units based on an income approach that incorporates our assumptions for determining the present value of future cash flows.We project future cash flows using management assumptions for sales growth rates, operating margins, discount rates and multiples. Theseassumptions are considered unobservable inputs Level 3 inputs as defined in the accounting guidance. If the estimated fair value of any of our reporting units falls below carrying value, we compare the estimated fair value of the reporting unit goodwill to its carrying value. Ifthe carrying value of a reporting unit goodwill exceeds its estimated fair value, we recognize the difference as an impairment loss in operating income. Since we define an operating segment as an individual sales center and we do not have operations below the sales center level, our reporting unit is an individual sales center. For additional discussion of goodwill and other intangible assets, see Note3.Receivables Securitization FacilityOur accounts receivable securitization facility the Receivables Facility provides for the sale of certain of our receivables to a wholly owned subsidiary the Securitization Subsidiary. The Securitization Subsidiary transfers variable undivided percentage interests in the receivables and related rights to certain third party financial institutions in exchange for cash proceeds, limited to the applicable funding capacities. We account for the sale of the receivable interests as a secured borrowing on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. The receivables subject to the agreement collateralize the cash proceeds received from the third party financial institutions. We classify the entire outstanding balance as Long-term debt on our Consolidated Balance Sheets as we intend to refinance the obligations on a long-term basis. We present the receivables that collateralize the cash proceeds separately as Receivables pledged under receivables facility on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. For additional discussion of the Receivables Facility, see Note 5.Self InsuranceWe are self-insured for employee health benefits, workers compensation coverage, automobile and property and casualty insurance. To limit our exposure, we also maintain excess and aggregate liability coverage. We establish selfinsurance reserves based on estimates of claims incurred but not reported and information that we obtain from third-party service providers regarding known claims. Our management reviews these reserves based on consideration of various factors, including but not limited to the age of existing claims, estimated settlement amounts and other historical claims data.Retained Deficit EarningsWe account for the retirement of treasury share repurchases as a reduction of Retained deficit earnings on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. As of December31, 2013, the retained deficit reflects cumulative net income, the cumulative impact of adjustments for changes in accounting pronouncements, treasury share retirements since the inception of our share repurchase programs of $6792 millionand cumulative dividends declared of $2373 million51Supplemental Cash Flow InformationThe following table presents supplemental disclosures to the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows in thousands:Year Ended December 31,201320122011Cash paid during the year  taxes, net of refunds47,13845,40439,771Note 2 - Acquisitions2013 Acquisitions In March 2013, we acquired certain distribution assets of Swimming Pool Supply Center, Inc., a local swimming pool products distributor with one sales center location in Los Angeles, California. This sales center will operate as a satellite location to more efficiently serve our west Los Angeles customers. In May 2013, we acquired certain distribution assets of B. Shapiro Supply,LLC, a swimming pool and hardscape products distributor with one sales center location in Warminster, Pennsylvania.We completed our preliminary acquisition accounting for these acquisitions, subject to adjustments in accordance with the terms of the purchase agreements during the respective one year measurement periods.These acquisitions did not have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations2012 AcquisitionsIn February2012, we acquired the distribution assets of Ideal Distributors Ltd., a regional swimming pool products distributor with four sales center locations in British Columbia, Canada. In March2012, we acquired the distribution assets of CCRDistribution, a swimming pool products distributor with one sales center in Ontario, Canada.In 2013, we completed the acquisition accounting for each of our 2012 acquisitions. These acquisitions did not have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations2011 AcquisitionsIn May 2011, we acquired certain distribution assets of The Kilpatrick Company, Inc., a regional distributor of landscape and irrigation products and a provider of equipment services with four sales center locations in South Florida. InNovember2011, we acquired the distribution assets of Poolway Schwimmbadtechnik GmbH, a manufacturer of swimming pool walls and filtration kits and a distributor of swimming pool products and supplies with one sales center in Germany. In December2011, we acquired the distribution assets of G.L. Cornell Company, a distributor of golf course equipment and irrigation products and a provider of equipment services with one sales center location in Maryland.In 2012, we completed the acquisition accounting for each of our 2011 acquisitions. These acquisitions did not have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations52Note 3 - Goodwill and Other Intangible AssetsThe table below presents changes in the carrying amount of goodwill in thousands:Goodwill gross at December 31, 2011$179,423Foreign currency translation adjustments174Goodwill gross at December 31, 2012179,249Accumulated impairment losses at December 31, 20112,320Goodwill impairment6,946Accumulated impairment losses at December 31, 20129,266Goodwill net at December 31, 2012$169,983Goodwill gross at December 31, 2012$179,249Foreign currency translation adjustments1,991Goodwill gross at December 31, 2013181,240Accumulated impairment losses at December 31, 20129,266Goodwill impairmentAccumulated impairment losses at December 31, 20139,266Goodwill net at December 31, 2013$171,974In October 2013, we performed our annual goodwill impairment test and did not identify any goodwill impairment at the reporting unit level. As of October1, 2013, we had 208reporting units with allocated goodwill balances.The highest goodwill balance was $57 millionand the average goodwill balance was $08 million. During the third quarter of 2012, we performed an interim goodwill impairment analysis for our United Kingdom reporting unit based on our identification of impairment indicators related to our results through the end of the 2012 pool season and our expectation for continued depressed economic conditions in the United Kingdom. Our results for the nine months ended September30, 2012 were significantly lower than our 2012 sales, gross profit and operating profit estimates for the United Kingdom reporting unit that we used in our 2011 annual goodwill impairment test. As a result of our interim impairment analysis, we recorded a noncash goodwill impairment charge of $69 millionon the Consolidated Statements of Income. Thischarge wasequal to the total September30,2012 goodwill carrying amount of our United Kingdom reporting unit of $69 million. 53Other intangible assets consisted of the following in thousands:December 31,20132012Horizon tradename indefinite life$8,400$8,400National Pool Tile NPT tradename 20 year life1,5001,500Non-compete agreements 5 year weighted average useful life 4,1404,531Other intangible assets14,04014,431Less: Accumulated amortization 3,8443,378Other intangible assets, net$10,196$11,053The Horizon tradename has an indefinite useful life and is not subject to amortization.However, we evaluate the useful life of this intangible asset and test for impairment annually.The NPT tradename and the non-compete agreements have finite useful lives and we amortize the estimated fair value of these agreements using the straight-line method over their respective useful lives.The useful lives for our non-compete agreements are based on their contractual terms.Other intangible amortization expense was $08 millionin 2013, $09 millionin 2012and $12 millionin 2011.The table below presents estimated amortization expense for other intangible assets for the next five years  4 - Details of Certain Balance Sheet AccountsThe table below presents additional information regarding certain balance sheet accounts in thousands:December 31,20132012Receivables, net:Trade accounts$14,150$86,177Vendor incentives33,77931,451Other, net1,7561,708Total receivables49,685119,336Less: Allowance for doubtful  net$45,138$113,859Prepaid expenses and other current assets:Prepaid expenses$9,670$8,647Other current assets1322,633Prepaid expenses and other current assets$9,802$11,280Property and equipment,  improvements28,04826,254Autos and trucks19,99414,221Machinery and equipment30,18126,871Computer  and fixtures8,8278,388Fixed assets in progress4,3362,384Total property and equipment130,002114,822Less: Accumulated  and equipment, net$52,328$46,566Accrued expenses and other current  expenses and other current  5 - DebtThe table below presents the components of our debt for the past two years in thousands:December 31,20132012Long-term debt, variable rate:Revolving Credit Facility described  Securitization Facility described below52,000Total debt$246,418$230,882Revolving Credit FacilityOn September20, 2013, we, along with our wholly owned subsidiaries, SCP Distributors Canada Inc., as the Canadian Borrower, and SCP Pool B.V., as the Dutch Borrower, executed an amendment the Amendment to our unsecured syndicated senior credit facility the Credit Facility. The Credit Facility provides us with borrowing capacity under a fiveyear revolving credit facility, and the Amendment amended certain terms, including extending the maturity date to September20, 2018, increasing the borrowing capacity to $4650 millionand providing additional capacity under certain negative covenants, including indebtedness, liens, investments, sale of assets and dividends. The Credit Facility includes sublimits for the issuance of swingline loans and standby letters of credit. Pursuant to an accordion feature, the aggregate maximum principal amount of the commitments under the Credit Facility may be increased at our request and with agreement by the lenders by up to $750 million, to a total of $5400 million.The Amendment amended and restated our Credit Facility agreement dated October19, 2011, which provided for $4300million in borrowing capacity and was scheduled to mature on October 19, 2016. Our obligations under the Credit Facility are guaranteed by substantially all of our existing and future direct and indirect domestic subsidiaries.The Credit Facility contains terms and provisions including representations, covenants and conditions and events of default customary for transactions of this type.If we default under the Credit Facility, the lenders may terminate their obligations under the Credit Facility and may require us to repay all amounts.At December31, 2013, there was $1944 millionoutstanding and $2674 millionavailable for borrowing under the Credit Facility.The weighted average effective interest rate for the Credit Facility as of December31, 2013was approximately 21%, excluding commitment fees.Revolving borrowings under the Credit Facility bear interest, at our option, at either of the following and, in each case, plus an applicable margin:a.a base rate, which is the highest of i the Wells Fargo Bank, National Association prime rate, ii the Federal Funds Rate plus 0500% and iii the London Interbank Offered Rate LIBOR Market Index Rate plus 1000%; or b.LIBOR. Borrowings by the Canadian Borrower bear interest, at the Canadian Borrowers option, at either of the following and, in each case, plus an applicable margin:a.a base rate, which is the greatest of i the Canadian Reference Bank prime rate and ii the annual rate of interest equal to the sum of the Canadian Dealer Offered Rate CDOR plus 1000%; or b.CDOR. Borrowings by the Dutch Borrower bear interest at LIBOR plus an applicable margin.The interest rate margins on the borrowings and letters of credit are based on our leverage ratio and will range from 1150% to 1625% on CDOR, LIBOR and swingline loans, and from 0150% to 0625% on Base Rate and Canadian Base Rate loans.Borrowings under the swingline loans are based on the LIBOR Market Index Rate LMIR plus any applicable margin.We are also required to pay an annual facility fee ranging from 0100%to 0250%, depending on our leverage ratio56Receivables Securitization FacilityOn October 11, 2013, we and certain of our subsidiaries entered into a new, twoyear accounts receivable securitization facility the Receivables Facility with a peak seasonal funding capacity of up to $1200 millionbetween March 1 and August 31 and up to $800 millionbetween September 1 and February 28. An additional seasonal facility limit of up to $400 millionmay be available between April 1 and June 30. The Receivables Facility provides for the sale of certain of our receivables to a wholly owned subsidiary the Securitization Subsidiary. The Securitization Subsidiary transfers variable undivided percentage interests in the receivables and related rights to certain third party financial institutions in exchange for cash proceeds, limited to the applicable funding capacities. Upon payment of the receivables by customers, rather than remitting to the financial institutions the amounts collected, we retain such collections as proceeds for the sale of new receivables until payments become due.  The Receivables Facility is subject to terms and conditions including representations, covenants and conditions precedent customary for transactions of this type. Failure to maintain certain ratios or meet certain of these covenants could trigger an amortization event.At December31, 2013, there was $520 millionoutstanding under the Receivables Facility at a weighted average effective interest rate of 09%, excluding commitment fees. Depending on the funding source used by the financial institutions to purchase the receivables, borrowings under the Receivables Facility bear interest at one of the following and, in each case, plus an applicable margin of 075%:a.for financial institutions using the commercial paper market, commercial paper rates based on the applicable variable rates in the commercial paper market at the time of issuance;b.for financial institutions not using the commercial paper market, LMIRWe also pay an unused fee of 035%on the excess of the facility limit over the average daily capital outstanding. We pay this fee monthly in arrears. Floating Rate Senior NotesOn February12, 2007, we issued and sold $1000 millionaggregate principal amount of Floating Rate Senior Notes theNotes in a private placement offering pursuant to a Note Purchase Agreement.We paid off the Notes at maturity on February12, 2012as reflected on our Statements of Cash Flows.  Interest Rate SwapsAs of December31, 2013, we had fiveinterest rate swap contracts in place to reduce our exposure to fluctuations in interest rates on the Credit Facility.These swaps convert the variable interest rates to fixed interest rates on borrowings under the Credit Facility.Each of these swap contracts terminates on October19, 2016.The following table provides additional details related to each of these swap contracts:DerivativeEffective DateNotionalAmountin  rate swap 1November21, 2011$2501185%Interest rate swap 2November21, 2011$2501185%Interest rate swap 3December21, 2011$5001100%Interest rate swap 4January17, 2012$2501050%Interest rate swap 5January19, 2012$2500990%Since inception, we have not recognized any gains or losses on these swaps through income and there has been no effect on income from hedge ineffectiveness. The net difference between interest paid and interest received related to our swap agreements resulted in incremental interest expense of $14 millionin 2013, $13 millionin 2012and $36 millionin 201157Failure of our swap counterparties would result in the loss of any potential benefit to us under our swap agreements. Inthis case, we would still be obligated to pay the variable interest payments underlying our debt agreements.Additionally, failure of our swap counterparties would not eliminate our obligation to continue to make payments under our existing swap agreements if we continue to be in a net pay position.We had two previous interest rate swap agreements in effect that reduced our exposure to fluctuations in interest rates on the Notes and our previous credit facility.One interest rate swap agreement converted the variable interest rate on the Notes to a fixed rate of 5088%on a notional amount of $500 million.This swap agreement was effective February 12, 2007and was scheduled to terminate on February 12, 2012.Our other interest rate swap agreement converted the variable interest rate on the previous credit facility to a fixed rate of 1725%on a notional amount of $500 million.This swap agreement was effective January 27, 2010and was scheduled to terminate on January 27, 2012. Wede-designated this interest rate swap when we replaced our previous credit facility on October19, 2011. In December 2011, we terminated both of these interest rate swaps and realized a loss of $03million.Financial and Other CovenantsFinancial covenants on the Credit Facility and Receivables Facility are closely aligned and include a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio and maintenance of a maximum average total leverage ratio, which are our most restrictive covenants. TheCredit Facility also limits the declaration and payment of dividends on our common stock to no more than 50%of the preceding years Net Income as defined in the Credit Facility, provided no default or event of default has occurred and is continuing, or would result from the payment of dividends. Additionally, we may declare and pay quarterly dividends notwithstanding that the aggregate amount of dividends paid would be in excess of the 50% limit described above so long as i the amount per share of such dividends does not exceed the amount per share paid during the most recent fiscal year in which we were in compliance with the 50% limit and ii our Average Total Leverage Ratio is less than 300 to 100 both immediately before and after giving pro forma effect to such dividends. Further, dividends must be declared and paid in a manner consistent with our past practice. Under the Credit Facility, we may repurchase shares of our common stock provided no default or event of default has occurred and is continuing, or would result from the repurchase of shares, and our maximum average total leverage ratio determined on a pro forma basis is less than 250to100. Othercovenants include restrictions on our ability to grant liens, incur indebtedness, make investments, merge or consolidate, and sell or transfer assets.Failure to comply with any of our financial covenants or any other terms of the CreditFacility could result in penalty payments, higher interest rates on our borrowings or the acceleration of the maturities of our outstanding debt.As of December31, 2013, we were in compliance with all covenants and financial ratio requirements related to the CreditFacility and the Receivables Facility.Deferred Financing CostsWe capitalize financing costs we incur related to implementing and amending our debt arrangements. We record these costs as Other assets, net on our Consolidated Balance Sheets and amortize them over the contractual life of the related debt arrangement.

Restricted stock awards granted under the Amended 2007 LTIP are issued at no cost to the grantee.Both stock options and restricted stock awards vest over time depending on an employees length of service with the Company.Share-based awards to our employees generally vest either fiveyears from the grant date or on a three/fiveyear split vest schedule, where half of the awards vest three years from the grant date and the remainder of the awards vest five years from the grant date.Sharebased awards to the chairman of the Board and our non-employee directors vest one year from the grantdate.Preceding PlansIn May 2002, our stockholders approved the 2002 Long-Term Incentive Plan the 2002 Plan, which authorized the Board to grant stock options and restricted stock awards to employees, agents, consultants or independent contractors. InMay2004, our stockholders approved an amendment to increase the number of shares authorized for issuance under the 2002 Plan from 1,575,000to 2,700,000shares.Granted stock options have an exercise price equal to our stocks market price on the grant date. These options generally vest either fiveyears from the grant date or on a three/fiveyear split vest schedule, as described above. These options expire tenyears from the grant date.In May 2007, the Board suspended the 2002 Plan. Options granted prior to the suspension were not affected by this action.The SCP Pool Corporation Non-Employee Directors Equity Incentive Plan the Director Plan permitted the Board to grant stock options to each non-employee director. No more than 1,350,000shares were authorized to be issued under this plan. Grantedoptions have an exercise price equal to our stocks market price on the grant date.The options generally were exercisable oneyear after the grant date, and they expire tenyears after the grant date.The Director Plan expired during 2006.Options granted prior to the expiration were not affected by this action.Stock Option AwardsThe following table summarizes stock option activity under our share-based plans for the year ended December31, 2013:SharesWeighted AverageExercise PriceWeighted AverageRemainingContractual TermYearsAggregateIntrinsic ValueBalance at December 31,   at December 31,  at December 31,  following table presents information about stock options outstanding and exercisable at December31, 2013:Outstanding Stock OptionsExercisable Stock OptionsRange of exercise pricesSharesWeighted AverageRemainingContractual TermYearsWeighted Average Exercise PriceSharesWeighted Average Exercise Price$ 1800 to $  2115 to $  3714 to $  following table summarizes the cash proceeds and tax benefits realized from the exercise of stock options:Year Ended December 31,in thousands, except share amounts201320122011Options   value of options  benefits realized$7,364$7,418$5,409We estimated the fair value of employee stock option awards at the grant date based on the assumptions summarized in the following table:Year Ended December 31,Weighted average201320122011Expected   interest rate151%161%310%Expected dividend yield15%20%20%Grant date fair value$1642$1266$897We calculated expected volatility over the expected term of the awards based on the historical volatility of our common stock.Weuse weekly price observations for our historical volatility calculation because we believe that they provide the most appropriate measurement of volatility given the trading patterns of our common stock.We estimated the expected term based on the vesting period of the awards and our historical exercise activity for awards with similar characteristics. The weighted average expected term is impacted by a higher expected term estimate for stock option awards granted to our named executive officers.Therisk-free interest rate is based on the U.S. Treasury zero-coupon issues with a remaining term approximating the expected term of the option. We determined the expected dividend yield based on the anticipated dividends over the expected term.For purposes of recognizing share-based compensation expense, we ratably expense the estimated fair value of employee stock options over the options requisite service period. The requisite service period for our share-based awards is either the vesting period, or if shorter, the period from the grant date to the date that employees meet the retirement provisions of our share-based award agreements. We recognize compensation cost for awards with graded vesting using the graded vesting recognition method60The following table presents the total share-based compensation expense for stock option awards and the related recognized tax benefits for the past three years in  compensation  tax benefits1,4311,6471,721At December31, 2013, the unamortized compensation expense related to stock option awards totaled $35 million.Weanticipate that this expense will be recognized over a weighted average period of 21years.Restricted Stock AwardsThe table below presents restricted stock awards activity under our share-based plans for the year ended December31, 2013:SharesWeighted AverageGrant Date Fair ValueBalance unvested at December 31, 2012516,186$2336Granted at market price80,4544631Less:  unvested at December 31, 2013490,264$2698At December31, 2013, the unamortized compensation expense related to the restricted stock awards totaled $27million.Weanticipate that this expense will be recognized over a weighted average period of 17years.The table below presents the total number of restricted stock awards that vested for the past three years and the related fair value of those awards in thousands, except share amounts:201320122011Shares vested102,53669,58032,856Fair value of restricted stock awards vested$4,544$2,338$812The following table presents the total share-based compensation expense for restricted stock awards for the past three years  compensation  Stock Purchase PlanIn March 1998, the Board adopted the SCP Pool Corporation Employee Stock Purchase Plan the ESPP. Under the ESPP, employees who meet minimum age and length of service requirements may purchase stock at 85%of the lower of:a.the closing price of our common stock at the end of a six month plan period ending either June30 or December31; or b.the average of the beginning and ending closing prices of our common stock for such six month period. 61No more than 956,250shares of our common stock may be issued under the ESPP. For the two six month offering periods in each year presented below, our employees purchased the following aggregate number of  grant date fair value for the most recent ESPP purchase period ended December31, 2013was $1064per share.Share-based compensation expense related to our ESPP was $03 millionin 2013, $03 millionin 2012and $02 millionin2011.Note 7 - Income TaxesIncome loss before income taxes and equity earnings is attributable to the following jurisdictions inthousands:Year Ended December 31,201320122011United   1The foreign loss before income taxes in 2012 includes the $69 million goodwill impairment charge related to the UnitedKingdom.The provision for income taxes consisted of the following in thousands:Year Ended December  and other7,4865,9587,675Total current provision for income  and other22684440Total deferred provision for income taxes4,6796,9154,794Provision for income taxes$61,590$56,744$45,319A reconciliation of the U.S. federal statutory tax rate to our effective tax rate on Income before income taxes and equity earnings is as follows:Year Ended December 31,201320122011Federal statutory rate3500%3500%3500%Change in valuation allowance057197037Other, primarily state income tax rate323403333Total effective tax rate3880%4100%3870%62The table below presents the components of our deferred tax assets and liabilities in thousands:December 31,20132012Deferred tax assets:Product  expenses4,0722,780Allowance for doubtful accounts346420Total current10,89410,903Less: Valuation  reclassified for net  current,   tax positions1,3431,226Net operating losses4,7096,703Interest rate swaps6671,327Equity losses in unconsolidated  non-current30,70934,986Less: Valuation  reclassified for net  non-current, net784740Total deferred tax assets6,2415,926Deferred tax liabilities:Trade discounts on purchases2,0222,681Prepaid expenses1,7241,452Total current3,7464,133Component reclassified for net  current, netIntangible assets, primarily   reclassified for net  non-current, net19,10813,453Total deferred tax liabilities19,10813,453Net deferred tax  December31, 2013, certain of our international subsidiaries had tax loss carryforwards totaling approximately $173 million, which expire in various years after 2014.Deferred tax assets related to the tax loss carryforwards of these international subsidiaries were $47 millionas of December31, 2013and $67 millionas of December31, 2012.We have recorded a corresponding valuation allowance of $47 millionand $67 millionin the respective years.The decrease in our net operating losses and corresponding valuation allowances in 2013 is primarily related to the statutory deductibility of the 2012 goodwill impairment charge in the United Kingdom, offset by an increase for current year net operating losses and related valuation allowances for other foreign subsidiaries. We have a $57 millionvaluation allowance recorded related to the deferred tax asset that we recorded for the writeoff of our investment in Latham Acquisition Corporation LAC.As presented in the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows, the changes in deferred income taxes include changes related to the deferred income tax provision and the estimated tax impact of accumulated other comprehensive incomeloss.We reduce federal and state income taxes payable by the tax benefits associated with the exercise of nonqualified stock options and the lapse of restrictions on restricted stock awards.To the extent realized tax deductions exceed the amount of previously recognized deferred tax benefits related to share-based compensation, we record an excess tax benefit in stockholders equity. Werecorded excess tax benefits of $46 millionin 2013and $45 millionin 2012.As of December31, 2013, United States income taxes were not provided on earnings of our foreign subsidiaries, as we have invested or expect to invest the undistributed earnings indefinitely.If in the future these earnings are repatriated to the UnitedStates, or if we determine that the earnings will be remitted in the foreseeable future, additional income tax provisions may be required. Determining the amount of unrecognized deferred tax liability on these undistributed earnings is not practicable due to the complexity of tax laws and regulations and the varying circumstances, tax treatments and timing of any future repatriation.We hold, through our affiliates, cash balances in the countries in which we operate, including amounts held outside the UnitedStates. Most of the amounts held outside the United States could be repatriated to the United States, but, under current law, may be subject to United States federal income taxes, less applicable foreign tax credits.Repatriation of some foreign balances is restricted by local laws including the imposition of withholding taxes in some jurisdictions. We have not provided for the United States federal tax liability on these amounts, and for financial statement purposes, these foreign cash balances are considered indefinitely reinvested, are not material as of December31, 2013and are intended to be used to fund current cash flow needs in the countries where held.The following table summarizes the activity related to uncertain tax positions for the past three years  at beginning of  for tax positions taken during a prior periodIncreases for tax positions taken during the current period1,140972914Decreases resulting from the expiration of the statute of  relating to settlements60115Balance at end of year$3,837$3,504$4,715The total amount of unrecognized tax benefits that, if recognized, would decrease the effective tax rate was $25 millionat December31, 2013and $23 millionat December31, 2012.We record interest expense related to unrecognized tax benefits in interest expense, while we record related penalties in selling and administrative expenses.For unrecognized tax benefits, we had interest income of $02 millionin 2013and $03 millionin 2012and interest expense of $03 millionin 2011.Accrued interest related to unrecognized tax benefits was approximately $04millionat December31, 2013and $05 millionat December31, 2012.We file income tax returns in the U.S. federal jurisdiction and various state and foreign jurisdictions.With few exceptions, we are no longer subject to U.S. federal, state and local, or non-U.S. income tax examinations by tax authorities for years before 201064Note 8 - Earnings Per ShareThe table below presents the computation of earnings per share, including the reconciliation of basic and diluted weighted average shares outstanding inthousands, except per share data:Year Ended December 31,201320122011Net  average shares  of dilutive securities:Stock options and employee stock purchase  per  stock options excluded from diluted earnings per share computations 14171,3811Since these options have exercise prices that are higher than the average market prices of our common stock, including them in the calculation would have an anti-dilutive effect on earnings per share.Note 9 - Commitments and ContingenciesWe lease facilities for our corporate office, sales centers, vehicles and equipment under operating leases that expire in various years through 2027. Most of our leases contain renewal options, some of which involve rate increases. Forleases with step rent provisions whereby the rental payments increase incrementally over the life of the lease, we recognize the total minimum lease payments on a straight-line basis over the minimum lease term. The table below presents rent expenses associated with operating leases for the past three years in  table below sets forth the approximate future minimum lease payments as of December31, 2013related to non-cancelable operating leases and the non-cancelable portion of certain vehicle operating leases with initial terms of one year or more  time to time, we are subject to various claims and litigation arising in the ordinary course of business, including product liability, personal injury, commercial, contract and employment matters. While the outcome of any litigation is inherently unpredictable, we do not believe, based on currently available facts, that the ultimate resolution of any of these matters will have a material adverse impact on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows65Note 10 - Related Party TransactionsPolicyOur policy for related party transactions is included in our written Audit Committee Charter.This policy requires that our Audit Committee review and approve all related party transactions required to be disclosed in our Annual Proxy Statement or required to be approved based on NASDAQ rules.TransactionsIn May 2005, we acquired a 50%membership interest in NCC through a $11 millioncash contribution.NCC owns and operates an office building in Covington, Louisiana.We lease corporate and administrative offices from NCC, occupying approximately 53,000square feet of office space.In May 2005 we amended the lease agreement, which has a ten year term. In June 2013 we exercised an option to extend the term of a portion of the lease agreement through May 2020.As of December31, 2013, we pay rent of $80,257per month.In January 2002, we entered into a lease agreement with SC Development, LLC SC for additional warehouse space adjacent to our Mandeville, Louisiana sales center.The sole owner of SC is A.

Eligible employees are able to contribute up to 75%of their compensation, subject to the federal dollar limit. Forplan participants, we provide a matching contribution. We contribute a total match on employee contributions of up to 4%of their compensation, with a 100%match on the first 3%of compensation deferred and a 50%match on deferrals between 3%and 5%of compensation.We have a nonqualified deferred compensation plan that allows certain employees who occupy key management positions to defer salary and bonus amounts.This plan also provides a matching contribution similar to that provided under our 401k plan to the extent that a participants contributions to the 401k plan are limited by IRS deferral and compensation limitations. The total combined company matching contribution provided to a participant under the 401k plan and the nonqualified deferred compensation plan for any one year may not exceed 4%of a participants salary and bonus.Theemployee and company matching contributions are invested in certain equity and fixed income securities based on individual employee elections66The table below sets forth our matching contributions for the past three years  contributions -  contributions - deferred compensation plan3626259Note 12 - Quarterly Financial Data UnauditedThe table below summarizes the unaudited quarterly results of operations for the past two years inthousands, except pershare    income  loss per  sum of basic and diluted earnings per share for each of the quarters may not equal the total basic and diluted earnings per share for the annual periods because of rounding differences anda difference in the way that in-the-money stock options are considered from quarter to quarter.The above amounts include the $69 million goodwill impairment charge recorded in the third quarter of 201267Item 1.Business1Item! 1A.Risk Factors8Item 1B.Unresolved Staff Comments11Item 2.Properties12Item 3.Legal Proceedings14Item! 4.Mine Safety Disclosures14PART II.Item 5. Controls and ProceduresThe term disclosure controls and procedures is defined in Rules 13a-15e and 15d-15e of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 the Act. The rules refer to the controls and other procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in reports that we file or submit under the Act is 1 recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the Commissions rules and forms and 2 accumulated and communicated to our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.As of December31, 2013, management, including the CEO and CFO, performed an evaluation of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures. Based on that evaluation, management, including the CEO and CFO, concluded that as of December31, 2013, our disclosure controls and procedures were effective.We maintain a system of internal control over financial reporting that is designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. Based on the most recent evaluation, we have concluded that no change in our internal control over financial reporting occurred during the last fiscal quarter that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting68Managements Report on Internal Control Over Financial ReportingPool Corporations management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as defined in Rules 13a-15f and 15d-15f under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. Our internal control system was designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding thereliabilityof financial reportingandthe preparation of published financial statements. All internal control systems, no matter how well designed, have inherent limitations. Therefore, even those systems determined to be effective can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement preparation and presentation. Any evaluation or projection of effectiveness to future periods is also subject to risk that controls may become inadequate due to changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.Pool Corporations management assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December31,2013. Inmaking this assessment, management used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission COSO in the Internal Control-Integrated Framework 1992 Framework.Based on this assessment, management has concluded that, as of December31,2013, Pool Corporations internal control over financial reporting was effective.The independent registered public accounting firm that audited the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item8 of this Form 10-K has issued a report on Pool Corporations internal control over financial reporting. This report appears below69Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting FirmThe Board of Directors and ShareholdersPool CorporationWe have audited Pool Corporations internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2013, based on criteria established in the Internal Control-Integrated Frameworkissued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission 1992 Framework the COSO criteria. Pool Corporations management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying Managements Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. Ourresponsibility is to express an opinion on PoolCorporations internal control over financial reporting based on our audit.We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board UnitedStates. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.A companys internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A companys internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that 1 pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; 2 provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and 3 provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the companys assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also,projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.In our opinion, Pool Corporation maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2013, based on the COSO criteria.We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board UnitedStates, the consolidated balance sheets of Pool Corporation as of December 31, 2013 and 2012, and the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, stockholders equity, and cash flows of Pool Corporation for each of the three years in the period ended December31,2013, and our report dated February 27, 2014 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.New Orleans, LouisianaFebruary 27, 201470Item 1.Business1Item! 1A.Risk Factors8Item 1B.Unresolved Staff Comments11Item 2.Properties12Item 3.Legal Proceedings14Item! 4.Mine Safety Disclosures14PART II.Item 5.
