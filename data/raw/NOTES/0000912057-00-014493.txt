15 NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
1  SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES GENERAL
Duff & Phelps Credit Rating Co. the Company is an internationally
recognized credit rating agency that provides ratings and research on corporate,
structured and sovereign financings, as well as insurance claims paying ability.
The Company has offices in Chicago, New York, London, Hong Kong, Tokyo,
Singapore, and Buenos Aires and operates directly or through international
partners in North America, South America, Europe, Asia and Africa.
On October 31, 1994, the spin-off of the Company from its former parent
company, Phoenix Investment Partners, Ltd., formerly Duff & Phelps Corporation
D, was finalized. The Company shares, held by D, were distributed
October 31, 1994, to D shareholders of record on October 26, 1994, as a
tax-free distribution for which a favorable tax ruling was obtained from the
Internal Revenue Service. D shareholders received one of the Company shares
for every three shares held of D common stock, and cash payments were made in
lieu of fractional shares. The distribution resulted in the Company operating as
a freestanding entity whose common stock is publicly traded on the New York
Stock Exchange under the ticker symbol DCR.
BASIS OF PRESENTATION
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally
accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and
assumptions. These estimates affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities
and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial
statements. In addition, they affect the reported amounts of revenues and
expenses during the period. Actual results could differ from these estimates.
The accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared in
accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and include those
assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses directly attributable to the
Company operations in the periods presented. Certain reclassifications have
been made to prior period financial statements to conform with the current
presentation.
PRINCIPLES OF CONSOLIDATION
During July 1994, the Company organized a U.S. subsidiary, Duff & Phelps
Credit Rating Co. of Europe, with an office located in London, England. In
July 1996, the Company organized a U.S. subsidiary, Duff & Phelps Credit
Rating Co. of Asia, which has offices in Hong Kong, Tokyo and Singapore. In
November 1999, the Company acquired its Argentine subsidiary, Duff & Phelps
de Argentina-Sociedad Calificadora de Riesgo, which has an office in Buenos
Aires. The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the
Company and its wholly-owned subsidiaries, Duff & Phelps Credit Rating Co. of
Europe, Duff & Phelps Credit Rating Co. of Asia and Duff & Phelps de
Argentina-Sociedad Calificadora de Riesgo. All significant intercompany
balances and transactions have been eliminated.                    16 EARNINGS PER SHARE
Earnings per share were computed using the weighted average number of
shares of common stock and common stock equivalents outstanding for each of
the periods presented. Common stock equivalents are based on outstanding
non-qualified stock options under the Company long-term stock incentive
plan.
Following is a reconciliation of the denominator used to calculate
basic earnings per share to the denominator used to calculate diluted
earnings per share for the years ended December 31 in thousands                                    1999       1998       1997
- 
Basic weighted average shares outstanding              4,589       4,767      4,986
Stock options outstanding                      1,079       1,310      1,179
Reduction in shares for treasury stock proceeds            703       882      835
Diluted weighted average shares outstanding             4,965       5,195      5,330
REVENUE RECOGNITION
Rating revenues are typically recognized when services rendered for credit
ratings are complete, generally when billed. Revenues are dependent, in large
part, on levels of debt issuance. The Company fee schedule depends on the type
and amount of securities rated and the complexity of securities issued. Research
revenues are billed in advance and amortized over the subscription period.
Certain monitoring fees are billed in advance and are amortized over the length
of the life of the security.
GOODWILL AND INTANGIBLE ASSETS
Goodwill and intangible assets are shown net of accumulated amortization.
Goodwill is amortized over its estimated remaining lives of approximately 28 and
40 years and intangible assets are amortized over remaining lives of four
through nine years. The Company periodically evaluates whether significant
events have occurred that may require a revision of the estimated useful life of
goodwill and intangible assets or an impairment of the recoverability of
remaining balances. The Company uses an estimate of future undiscounted cash
flows over the remaining useful life of goodwill and intangible assets to
measure recoverability. Management believes that the full amount of goodwill and
intangible assets is recoverable.
DEPRECIATION AND AMORTIZATION
Office furniture and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated
depreciation and are depreciated on a straight-line basis over the estimated
remaining lives of the assets, typically three to 10 years. Leasehold
improvements are amortized over the remaining lease terms, which are one to
nine years.                    17 2  RELATED PARTIES NAME USE FEES PAID TO D
A name use fee agreement in effect between the Company and the former
parent requiring payment of $20 million per year is included in the Company
financial results for the periods presented. Effective September 30, 2000, the
name use fee reduces to $10,000 per year.
SERVICE FEES PAID TO THE COMPANY
The Company provides the former parent with fixed-income research services
for an annual fee of $09 million. For the periods presented, the fixed-income
research fees are included in revenue. The fixed-income research agreement
expires on September 30, 2000.
3  OTHER LONG-TERM INVESTMENTS   The Company other long-term investments are composed of investments made
in international rating agency partnerships in Chile, Colombia, Czech Republic,
Egypt, India, Indonesia, Italy, Mexico, Pakistan, Peru, South Africa, Spain, Sri
Lanka, Turkey and Venezuela. These investments are primarily accounted for under
the cost method.
4  LINE OF CREDIT AND LONG-TERM DEBT   The Company debt obligation under its $400 million revolving credit
facility was zero at December 31, 1999. The Company debt obligation was $15
million at an interest rate of 60 percent on December 31, 1998.
The credit agreement contains financial covenants that require the Company
to maintain certain ratios and satisfy certain financial tests, including
restrictions on the ability to incur indebtedness and limitations on the amount
of capital expenditures and common stock dividends paid by the Company. The
Company was in compliance with such covenants for all years presented.
5  LITIGATION MATTERS   The Company and its subsidiaries are from time to time parties to various
legal actions arising in the normal course of business. Management believes that
there are no proceedings pending against the Company or any of its subsidiaries
which, if determined adversely, would have a material adverse effect on the
financial condition or results of operations of the Company.

20   The Plan is administered by a committee of the Board of Directors. As of
December 31, 1999, options to purchase 1,078,588 common shares were granted and
outstanding under the Plan; 1,062,421 were held by the Company employees,
officers, and directors, and 16,167 were held by former parent company
employees, officers, and directors. The options outstanding vest and become
exercisable, on average, in even annual installments over three years at a
weighted average exercise price of $3964. Options held by participants
terminate no later than 10 years from the date of grant.
The Company applies Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 25, Accounting
for Stock Issued to Employees, and related interpretations in accounting for
the Plan. Accordingly, no compensation expense has been recognized for its Plan.
Had compensation cost for the Company Plan been determined based on the
average fair value at the grant date for option awards under the Plan consistent
with the methodology prescribed under Statement of Financial Accounting
Standards No. 123, Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation, the Company net
income would have been reduced by approximately $06 million in 1999, $04
million in 1998 and $02 million in 1997. Basic earnings per share would have
been reduced by $014 in 1999, $008 in 1998 and $005 in 1997. Diluted earnings
per share would have been reduced by $013 in 1999, $007 in 1998 and $005 in
1997.
The average fair value of options granted in 1999 is estimated at $3894
per option on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option pricing model
with the following assumptions: dividend yield of 013 percent; volatility of
1947 percent; risk-free interest rate of 665 percent; assumed forfeiture rate
of 5 percent per year and an expected life of 10 years.
The average fair value of options granted in 1998 is estimated at $2094
per option on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option pricing model
with the following assumptions: dividend yield of 026 percent; volatility of
2021 percent; risk-free interest rate of 498 percent; assumed forfeiture rate
of 5 percent per year and an expected life of 10 years.
The average fair value of options granted in 1997 is estimated at $1816
per option on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option pricing model
with the following assumptions: dividend yield of 028 percent; volatility of
2485 percent; risk-free interest rate of 562 percent; assumed forfeiture rate
of 5 percent per year and an expected life of 10 years.

December 31, 1999 and 1998, and the related consolidated statements of income,
changes in stockholders' equity and cash flows for each of the three years in

responsibility of the Company management. Our responsibility is to express an
opinion on these financial statements based on our audits.
We conducted our audits in accordance with auditing standards generally

estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial
statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis
for our opinion.
In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly,
in all material respects, the financial position of Duff & Phelps Credit Rating
