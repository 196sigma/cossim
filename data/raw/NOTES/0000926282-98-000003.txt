ADTRAN, Inc.
We have audited the accompanying balance sheets of ADTRAN, Inc. as of December
31, 1997 and 1996, and the related  statements of income,  changes in
stockholders' equity, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period
ended December 31, 1997. These financial statements are the responsibility of
the Company management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these
financial statements based on our audits.
We conducted our audits in accordance with generally  accepted auditing
standards. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material
misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting
the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes
assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by
management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.
We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in
all material respects, the financial position of ADTRAN, Inc. as of December 31,
1997, and 1996, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of
the three years in the period ended December 31, 1997, in conformity with
generally accepted accounting principles. s/ Coopers & Lybrand L.L.P.

The accompanying notes are an integral part of these financial statements. Notes to Financial Statements
1.  Summary of Significant Accounting Policies
ADTRAN, Inc. the Company designs, develops, manufactures, markets, and
services a broad range of high-speed digital transmission products utilized by
telephone companies Telcos and corporate end-users to implement advanced
digital data services over existing telephone networks. The Company also
customizes many of its products for private label distribution and for original
equipment manufacturers to incorporate into their own products. Most of the
Company Telco and customer premises equipment products are connected to the
local loop, which is the large existing infrastructure of the telephone network,
predominantly consisting of copper wireline, which connects end-users to a
Telco Central Office. The Central Office is the Telco facility that provides
local switching and distribution functions. The balance of the Company
products are used in the Telcos' Central Offices.
Cash and Cash Equivalents:
Cash and cash equivalents represent demand deposits, money market accounts, and
short-term investments classified as held-to-maturity see Note 2 with original
maturities of three months or less.
Financial Instruments:
The carrying  amount reported in the balance sheets for cash and cash
equivalents, accounts receivable, and accounts payable approximates fair value
because of the immediate or short-term maturity of these financial instruments.
The carrying amount reported for the bonds payable approximates fair value
because the underlying  instruments are at variable rates that re-price
frequently.
Short-term investments represent re-marketed preferred stocks and municipal
bonds classified as available-for- sale securities. Re-marketed preferred stocks
are designed to be marketed as money market instruments. These instruments'
interest rates reset on a short-term basis to maintain the price of the
instruments at par. These instruments may be redeemed on the date the interest
rate resets. The fair value of short-term investments is estimated based on
quoted market prices see Note 2. Realized gains or losses are computed under
the specific identification method.
Inventory:
Inventory is carried at the lower of cost or market, with cost being determined
using the first-in, first-out method.
Property, Plant, and Equipment:
Property, plant, and equipment, which is stated at cost, is depreciated using
methods which approximate straight-line depreciation over the estimated useful
lives of the assets. Expenditures for repairs and maintenance are charged to
expense as incurred; betterments which materially prolong the lives of the
assets are capitalized.The cost of assets retired or otherwise disposed of and
the related accumulated depreciation are removed from the accounts and the gain 
or loss on such disposition is included in income.
Long-Lived Assets:
The Company recognizes impairment losses on long-lived assets used in operations
when indicators of impairment are present and the undiscounted cash flows
estimated to be generated by those assets are less than the assets' carrying
values. There were no such losses recognized during 1997, 1996, and 1995.
Research and Development Costs:
Research and development costs are expensed as incurred.
Use of Estimates:
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted
accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that
affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of
contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and
the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period. Actual
results could differ from those estimates.
Income Taxes:
The Company utilizes the asset and liability method of accounting for income
taxes which requires the establishment of deferred tax liabilities and assets,
as measured by enacted tax rates, for all temporary differences caused when the
tax bases of assets and liabilities differ from those reported in the financial
statements.
Earnings Per Share:
Earnings per common share and earnings per common share assuming dilution are
computed in compliance with SFAS No. 128, which the Company adopted December 31,
1997. This statement simplifies the standards for computing earnings per share
previously found in APB Opinion No. 15, Earnings per Share, and makes them
comparable to international EPS standards. It replaces the presentation of
primary EPS with a presentation of basic EPS. The statement requires a
computation for earnings per common share and earnings per common share assuming
dilution see Note 13.
Reclassifications:
Certain reclassifications have been made to the 1995 and 1996 financial
statements and related footnotes to conform with the 1997 presentation. These
reclassifications had no impact on retained earnings or net income.
Recently Issued Accounting Standards:
In June 1997, the Financial Accounting Standards Board FASB issued Statement
of Financial Accounting Standards SFAS No. 130, Reporting Comprehensive
Income, which requires the reporting and display of comprehensive income and its
components in an entity financial statements, and SFAS No. 131, Disclosures
about Segments of an Enterprise and Related Information, which specifies revised
guidelines for determining an entity operating segments and the type and level
of financial information to be required. The Company is required to adopt these
standards  in 1998.  The Company  does not expect the impact of these
pronouncements to be material.

1,276,456                         324,906 The options above were issued at exercise prices which approximate fair market
value at the date of grant. At December 31, 1997, 1,513,250 shares are available
for grant under the plans. The Company applies APB Opinion 25 and related
Interpretations in accounting for its stock plans. Accordingly, no compensation
cost has been recognized related to stock options. Had compensation cost for the
Company stock-based compensation plans been determined based on the fair value
at the grant dates for awards under those plans consistent with the method
prescribed in SFAS No. 123, the Company net income and earnings per share
would have been reduced to the pro forma amounts indicated below                      1997      1996      1995
Net income - as reported      $40,209,272  $39,819,904  $29,457,727
Net income - pro forma       $37,634,225  $38,018,766  $28,852,035

The pro forma amounts reflected above are not representative of the effects on
reported net income in future years because, in general, the options granted
typically do not vest for several years and additional awards are made each
year. The fair value of each option grant is estimated on the grant date using
the Black-Scholes option-pricing model with the following weighted-average
assumptions

In March 1990, the Company adopted an incentive savings plan the Savings
Plan for all of its employees. The Savings Plan provides certain employment
benefits to all eligible employees and qualifies as a deferred arrangement under
Section 401k of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended. The Company
matches one-third of a participant contribution,  limited to 5% of a
participant income. An employee interest in the Company contributions
becomes 100% vested at the date participation in the Savings Plan commenced.
Charges to operations for the plan amounted to $717,196, $547,072, $415,791 in
1997, 1996 and 1995, respectively.
12.  Major Customers
Sales of the Company transmission and test equipment to the Regional Bell
Operating Companies RBOCs amounted to approximately 33%, 36% and 40% of total
sales during the years ended December 31, 1997, 1996 and 1995, respectively. At
December 31, 1997, 1996 and 1995 respectively, 26%, 23% and 36% of the accounts
receivable balance consisted of amounts due from RBOCs. 13.   Earnings Per Share
