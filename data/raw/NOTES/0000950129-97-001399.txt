21           REPORT OF INDEPENDENT PUBLIC ACCOUNTANTS To the Board of Directors and Shareholders of
Index, Inc., and Subsidiaries We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Index, Inc., a
Texas corporation, and subsidiaries as of December 31, 1996 and 1995, and the
related consolidated statements of earnings, shareholders' equity and cash flows
for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 1996. These
financial statements are the responsibility of the Company management. Our
responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on
our audits.
We conducted our audits in accordance with generally accepted auditing
standards. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to
obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of
material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence
supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit
also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant
estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial
statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis
for our opinion.
In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in
all material respects, the consolidated financial position of Index, Inc., and
subsidiaries at December 31, 1996 and 1995, and the results of its operations 
and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31,
1996, in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles. s/ ARTHUR ANDERSEN LLP

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 1. SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES Basis of Presentation
Index, Inc. Index or the Company, a Texas corporation, was incorporated on
July 26, 1996, to facilitate a reorganization of SEPCO Industries, Inc.
SEPCO, a Texas corporation, in anticipation of an acquisition by Index as the
successor to SEPCO of Newman Communications Corporation Newman, a New Mexico
corporation. On December 4, 1996, the reorganization of SEPCO the SEPCO
Reorganization was effected through a merger of a wholly owned subsidiary of
the Company with and into SEPCO pursuant to which the Company acquired all of
the outstanding shares of SEPCO in exchange for shares of the Company.
Immediately following the SEPCO Reorganization, the Company acquired Newman
through a merger of a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company with and into
Newman the Newman Merger.
Prior to the SEPCO Reorganization, the Company had no operations and its only
assets consisted of $1,000 cash.
Prior to the Company acquisition of Newman, Newman was a nonoperating entity
with nominal assets. The Newman Merger was effected as a means to increase the
Company shareholder base.
The equity capitalization of the Company after giving effect to the SEPCO
Reorganization and Newman Merger consists of 15,987,900 shares of common stock,
3,366 shares of Series A preferred stock and 19,500 shares of Series B
convertible preferred stock. The holders of Series A preferred stock are
entitled to one-tenth of a vote per share on all matters presented to a vote of
shareholders generally, voting as a class with the holders of common stock, and
are not entitled to any dividends or distributions other than in the event of a
liquidation of the Company, in which case the holders of the Series A preferred
stock are entitled to a $100 liquidation preference per share. Each share of
the Series B convertible preferred stock is convertible into 112 shares of
common stock and a monthly dividend per share of $050. The holders of the
Series B convertible stock are also entitled to a $100 liquidation preference
per share after payment of the distributions to the holders of the Series A
preferred stock and to one-tenth of a vote per share on all matters presented
to a vote of shareholders generally, voting as a class with the holders of the
common stock.
SEPCO Reorganization Accounting Treatment
The SEPCO Reorganization was treated as a recapitalization of SEPCO into the
Company with respect to the SEPCO merger and the issuance of the Company
capital stock for the underlying tangible net assets of Newman with respect to
the Newman Merger for accounting and financial statement purposes because,
among other factors, the Company is a recently formed holding company with
nominal net assets, Newman is a nonoperating public shell company with cash as
its primary asset, and the SEPCO shareholders will control the Company after
the SEPCO Reorganization. Accordingly, the historical pre-SEPCO Reorganization
financial statements of the combined Company after the closing will be those of
SEPCO. The retained earnings of SEPCO will be carried forward after the SEPCO
Reorganization and the historical shareholders' equity of SEPCO prior to the
SEPCO Reorganization is retroactively restated for the equivalent number of
shares received in the SEPCO Reorganization.
Unless the context otherwise requires, references to the Company with respect
to historical operations shall mean the Company and SEPCO.                    24

Principles of Consolidation
The accompanying consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the
Company and its wholly owned subsidiaries. All significant intercompany
accounts and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.
Concentration of Credit Risk
The Company sells rotating equipment to a diversified customer base in the
southwestern region of the United States. The Company believes no significant
concentration of credit risk exists. The Company continually evaluates the
creditworthiness of its customers' financial positions and monitors accounts on
a periodic basis, but does not require collateral.
Inventory
Inventory consists principally of finished goods and is priced at lower of cost
or market, cost being determined using the last-in, first-out LIFO method.
Property, Plant and Equipment
Assets are carried on the basis of cost. Provisions for depreciation are
computed at rates considered to be sufficient to amortize the costs of assets
over their expected useful lives. Depreciation and amortization of property,
plant and equipment is computed using principally the straight-line method for
financial reporting purposes. Useful lives assigned to property, plant and
equipment range from three to 20 years. Maintenance and repairs of depreciable
assets are charged against earnings as incurred. Additions and improvements
are capitalized. When properties are retired or otherwise disposed of, the
cost and accumulated depreciation are removed from the accounts and gains or
losses are credited or charged to earnings.
In March 1995, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Statement of
Financial Accounting Standards SFAS No. 121, Accounting for the Impairment
of Long-Lived Assets and for Long-Lived Assets to Be Disposed Of, which
requires impairment losses to be recorded on long-lived assets used in
operations when indicators of impairment are present and the undiscounted cash
flows estimated to be generated by those assets are less than the assets'
carrying amounts. SFAS No. 121 also addresses the accounting for long-lived
assets that are expected to be disposed of. The Company adopted SFAS No. 121
in the first quarter of 1996, and the effect of adoption was not material.
Intangibles
Intangibles consist of noncompete and licensing agreements and goodwill. The
noncompete and licensing agreements are amortized over five years, and goodwill
is amortized over five to 15 years. All amortization of intangibles is
computed using the straight-line method.
Federal Income Taxes
The Company utilizes the liability method in accounting for income taxes.
Under this method, deferred taxes are determined based on differences between
financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities and are measured
using the enacted marginal tax rates and laws that will be in effect when the
differences reverse.                    25

fair value based upon the current rates and terms available to the Company for
instruments with similar remaining maturities. The carrying value of the notes
receivable from officers approximates fair value because the interest rate of
the notes 9 percent is consistent with the interest rate of the Company
revolving debt and with rates currently available in the market for similar
instruments.
Revenue Recognition
The Company recognizes revenue as products are shipped to the customer.
Use of Estimates
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted
accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions
that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying
notes. Actual results could differ from those estimates.
Reclassifications
Certain 1995 and 1994 amounts have been reclassified to conform with the 1996
presentation.

7. SHAREHOLDERS' EQUITY Prior to the SEPCO Reorganization, as more fully described in Note 1, SEPCO had
agreements with certain holders of common, Series A preferred and Series B
convertible preferred stock that, upon termination of employment, the
shareholders had an obligation to sell and SEPCO had the first opportunity to
buy the stock. SEPCO also had the opportunity to match a higher offer obtained
by the shareholder from another party. The selling price of the stock was at a
price per share equal to the equity per share for the common stock and $100 per
share for the Series A preferred and Series B convertible preferred stock.
Payment may be in the form of cash or a promissory note bearing interest at 10
percent and payable in five equal installments beginning on the first
anniversary date of the note. During 1995, SEPCO purchased 2,243,216 shares of
common stock and 2,431 shares of Series A preferred stock in exchange for a
note payable of $578,000 from a shareholder upon his retirement. Upon the
exchange of SEPCO shares for Index shares pursuant to the plan of
reorganization, the above agreements were terminated.
Stock Options
Prior to and during 1995, the Company issued nonqualified, book value plan
stock options to certain officers of the Company to purchase shares of its
common stock, which had exercise prices equal to the book value of the common
stock at the date of grant. The option agreement allowed the employee to put
the stock acquired back to the Company at the book value at that time. The
Company recognized compensation expense for increases in the book value of the
stock while the options were outstanding. Effective March 31, 1996, the
above-mentioned book value options were converted to fair market value
options once the put option was eliminated. A one-time charge to
compensation of $618,000 was made during the first quarter of 1996. In 1996,
the Company issued nonqualified fair market value stock options to certain
directors of the Company to purchase shares of its common stock which had
exercise prices equal to the fair market value of the Company common stock at
the date of grant. Additionally, the Company issued options to certain 
officers and employees pursuant to the terms of the Company long-term 
incentive plan.                    30
33
Compensation expense related to these option agreements of $618,000, $87,000
and $155,000 was recorded in 1996, 1995 and 1994, respectively. As of December
31, 1996 and 1995, a deferred compensation liability of $739,000 and $380,000,
respectively, has been recorded in conjunction with these option agreements.

The outstanding options at December 31, 1996, expire between May 31, 1998, and
October 24, 2005, or 90 days after termination of full-time employment. During
1995, the Company purchased 1,436,800 shares acquired by an officer upon 
exercise of his options at $041 per share.
Stock-Based Compensation
Pro forma information regarding net income and earnings per share is required
by SFAS No. 123 and has been determined as if the Company had accounted for its
stock options under the fair value method as provided therein. The fair value
of each option grant is estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes
option pricing model with the following weighted average assumptions used for
options issued in 1996 and 1995, respectively: risk-free interest rates of 6
percent and 65 percent; expected lives of five years; no assumed volatility;
and no expected dividends.
For purposes of pro forma disclosures, the estimated fair value of the options
is amortized to expense over the options' vesting period. Set forth below is a
summary of the Company net income and earnings per share as reported and pro
forma as if the fair value-based method of accounting defined in SFAS No. 123
had been applied. The pro forma information is not meant to be representative
of the effects on reported net income for future years because, as provided by
SFAS No. 123, only the effects of awards granted after January 1, 1995, are
considered in the pro forma calculation. Certain compensation expense related
to the Company book value stock option plans was recognized in 1996 and 1995.
The effect of such expense has been included in the pro forma disclosures.                                  1996              1995

operating leases. The future minimum rental commitments as of December 31,
1996, for noncancelable leases are as follows in thousands

Rental expense for operating leases was $1,417,000, $1,338,000 and $1,084,000
for the years ended December 31, 1996, 1995 and 1994, respectively.
The Company is currently undergoing an examination of its tax returns by the
Internal Revenue Service IRS which is asserting claims against the Company
for additional taxes and penalties of approximately $1 million plus interest of
approximately $310,000. This claim relates primarily to a challenge by the IRS
of the Company use of the LIFO method of accounting for inventory. The
Company believes that its LIFO elections were valid and currently is pursuing
its rights to administrative appeal. Although an unfavorable outcome on this
matter would result in the payment of additional taxes and impact the Company
liquidity position, the Company believes that any liability that may ultimately
result from the resolution of this matter will not have a material adverse
effect on the financial position of the Company. The Company has been engaged
in discussions with representatives of the IRS regarding this matter and has
reserved $30,000 to cover any possible tax liability related to this matter.
9. RETIREMENT PLANS SEPCO provides an employee stock ownership plan ESOP which is eligible to
employees having 1,000 hours of service in 12 consecutive months of employment.
Employer contributions are at the discretion of the board of directors. The
ESOP held 3,205,994 shares of the Company common stock at December 31, 1996
see Note 1. The Company contributed and expensed $150,000 in 1996, 1995 and
1994. The Company also offers a 401k profit-sharing plan for employees
having 1,000 hours of service in 12 consecutive months of employment. The
Company matches contributions at a rate of 10 percent. The Company contributed
$62,000, $56,000 and $49,000 in the years ended December 31, 1996, 1995 and
1994, respectively.
10.   SUBSEQUENT EVENTS     In February 1997, the Company signed a non-binding letter of intent to
purchase Pelican State Supply Company, Inc. Pelican, a general mill supply
company located in Baton Rouge, Louisiana. Pursuant to the proposed
acquisition, the Company would acquire all of the issued and outstanding shares
of capital stock of Pelican for $15 million in cash and 432,286 shares of
Common Stock. The consummation of the acquisition is subject to customary
conditions, including the negotiation and execution of mutually satisfactory
definitive documentation and the completion of a satisfactory due diligence
review by the Company. There can be no assurance, however, that the Company
will consummate the acquisition of Pelican or, if consummated, that the terms
will be as described above.                    32
