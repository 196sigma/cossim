SEALED AIR CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES      Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements      Amounts in tables in millions of dollars, except share and per share data    
Note1 General 
Sealed Air Corporation the Company, operating through its subsidiaries, manufactures and sells a wide range of food and protective packaging products. 
The
Company conducts substantially all of its business through two direct wholly-owned subsidiaries, Cryovac,Inc. and Sealed Air Corporation US. These two subsidiaries directly
and indirectly own substantially all of the assets of the business and conduct operations themselves and through subsidiaries around the globe. The Company adopted this corporate structure in
connection with the Cryovac transaction. See Note19 for a description of the Cryovac transaction and related terms used in these notes. 
Note2 Summary of Significant Accounting Policies 
Basis of Consolidation 
The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its subsidiaries. The Company has eliminated all significant intercompany
transactions and balances in consolidation. All amounts are approximate due to rounding. Prior period amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current year presentation. Such
reclassifications included the following: Effective
January1, 2004, the Company renamed its two reportable business segments as Food Packaging and Protective Packaging. This change reflects the Company
decision to include its medical films, tubing and connectors, which are used with a wide variety of medical applications, in the segment with its food packaging products. These specialty products had
previously been a part of the same segment as the Company protective packaging products. In addition, commencing as of January1, 2004, the Company has allocated the expenses related to the
implementation of its global information systems to its reportable business segments rather than reflecting them in the unallocated corporate operating expenses. See Note3, Business Segment
Information.
For
the year ended December31, 2004, the Company included the amortization of capitalized senior debt issuance costs in interest expense. Previously, the
amortization expense was included in administrative expenses.
In
2004, the Company reclassified its auction rate securities from cash and cash equivalents to short-term
investmentsavailable-for-sale securities. As a result, the Company reclassified the $672million of auction rate securities held at December31,
2003 from cash and cash equivalents to short-term investmentsavailable-for-sale securities. The Company also made corresponding adjustments to its
Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows to reflect the purchases and sales of these securities as investing cash flows. These reclassifications had no impact on the results of operations of the Company.
See Short-Term InvestmentsAvailable-for-Sale Securities below.
Certain
deferred tax assets in the amount of $430million have been reclassified from non-current to current as of December31, 2003 to conform to
the current year presentation. This reclassification had no impact on the results of operations or cash flows of the Company. 
48  Use of Estimates 
The preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, known
as US GAAP, requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the
financial statements and revenue and expenses during the period reported. These estimates include assessing the collectibility of accounts receivable, the use and recoverability of inventory, the
realization of deferred tax assets, useful lives and recoverability of tangible and intangible assets, assumptions used in the Company defined benefit pension plans, estimates related to
self-insurance such as the aggregate liability for uninsured claims using historical experience, insurance company estimates and estimated trends in claim values, valuation allowances
related to deferred taxes, and accruals for commitments and contingencies, among others. The Company reviews estimates and assumptions periodically and reflects the effects of revisions in the
consolidated financial statements in the period it determines any revisions to be necessary. Actual results could differ from these estimates. 
Revenue Recognition 
The Company revenue earning activities primarily involve manufacturing and selling products, and the Company considers revenues to be earned when the Company
has completed the process by which it is entitled to receive consideration. The following criteria are used for revenue recognition: persuasive evidence that an arrangement exists, shipment has
occurred, selling price is fixed or determinable, and collection is reasonably assured. 
Cash and Cash Equivalents 
The Company considers investments with original maturities of three months or less to be cash equivalents. The Company policy is to invest cash in excess of
short-term operating
and debt service requirements in cash equivalents and short-term investments discussed below. These instruments are stated at cost, which approximates market value because of the short
maturity of the instruments. 
Short-Term InvestmentsAvailable-for-Sale Securities 
The Company short-term investments consist of auction rate securities, all of which are classified as available-for-sale
securities. Such classification is determined at the time of purchase and reevaluated as of each balance sheet date. Available-for-sale securities are
marked-to-market based on quoted market values of the securities, with the unrealized gains or losses reported as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income loss,
net of tax. The Company recognizes realized gains and losses on the sales of the securities on a specific identification method and includes them in other income, net, in the consolidated statement of
operations. The Company includes interest and dividends on securities classified as available-for-sale in other income, net. The Company has classified its
available-for-sale securities as current assets regardless of their maturity as they are available for use in current operations. 
At
December31, 2004 and 2003, the Company available-for-sale securities consisted of auction rate securities for which interest or dividend rates are
generally re-set for periods of up to 90days. The auction rate securities outstanding at December31, 2004 were investments in preferred stock, which do 
49  not
have maturity dates. In 2004, the Company reclassified its auction rate securities from cash and cash equivalents to short-term
investmentsavailable-for-sale securities. As a result, the Company reclassified the $672million of auction rate securities held at December31,
2003 from cash and cash equivalents to short-term investmentsavailable-for-sale securities. At December31, 2004, the Company held auction rate
securities of $541million. 
At
December31, 2004 and 2003, the fair value of the available-for-sale securities held by the Company was equal to their cost. The proceeds from the sales
of available-for-sale securities were $4161million and $1361million in 2004 and 2003. Purchases of available-for-sale securities were
$4030million and $2033million in 2004 and 2003. There were no gross realized gains or losses from the sale of available-for-sale securities in 2004 and 2003.
The Company did not hold any available-for-sale securities during 2002. 
Allowance for Doubtful Accounts  The Company maintains accounts receivable allowances for estimated losses resulting from the inability of its customers to make required payments. Additional
allowances may be required if the financial condition of the Company customers deteriorates. 
Commitments and ContingenciesLitigation 
On an ongoing basis, the Company assesses the potential liabilities related to any lawsuits or claims brought against it. While it is typically very difficult to
determine the timing and ultimate outcome of these actions, the Company uses its best judgment to determine if it is probable that it will incur an expense related to the settlement or final
adjudication of these matters and whether a reasonable estimation of the probable loss, if any, can be made. In assessing probable losses, the Company makes estimates of the amount of insurance
recoveries, if any. The Company accrues a liability when it believes a loss is probable and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated. Due to the inherent uncertainties related to the eventual
outcome of litigation and potential insurance recovery, it is possible that disputed matters may be resolved for amounts materially different from any provisions or disclosures that the Company has
previously made. 
Self-Insurance 
The Company retains the obligation for specified claims and losses related to property, casualty, workers' compensation and employee benefit claims. The Company
accrues for outstanding reported claims, claims that have been incurred but not reported and projected claims based upon management estimates of the aggregate liability for uninsured claims using
historical experience, insurance company estimates and the estimated trends in claim values. Although management believes it has the ability to adequately project and record estimated claim payments,
it is possible that actual results could differ significantly from the recorded liabilities. 
Pensions 
Although the Company maintains a non-contributory profit sharing and contributory thrift and retirement savings plans in which most U.S. employees of
the Company are eligible to participate, the Company also maintains defined benefit pension plans for a limited number of its U.S. and for many of 
50  its
non-U.S. employees. The Company accounts for these pension plans in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards SFAS No87, Employers' Accounting for
Pensions. Under these accounting standards, the Company makes assumptions regarding the valuation of benefit obligations and performance of plan assets. The principal assumptions concern the discount
rate used to measure future obligations, the expected future rate of return on plan assets, the expected rate of future compensation increases and various other actuarial assumptions. Changes to these
assumptions could have a significant impact on costs and liabilities recorded under SFAS No87. 
Financial Instruments 
The Company may use cross currency swaps, interest rate swaps, caps and collars, U.S. Treasury lock agreements and foreign exchange forward contracts and options
relating to the Company borrowing and trade activities. 
The
Company may use these financial instruments from time to time to manage its exposure to fluctuations in interest rates and foreign exchange rates. The Company does not purchase, hold
or sell derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes. The Company faces credit risk if the counterparties to these transactions are unable to perform their obligations.
However, the Company seeks to minimize this risk by entering into transactions with counterparties that are major financial institutions with high credit ratings. 
The
Company reports all derivative instruments on its balance sheet at fair value and establishes criteria for designation and effectiveness of transactions entered into for hedging
purposes. Prior to entering into any derivative transaction, the Company identifies the specific financial risk it faces, the appropriate hedging instrument to use to reduce the risk and the
correlation between the financial risk and the hedging instrument. The Company uses purchase orders and historical data as the basis for determining the anticipated values of the transactions to be
hedged. The Company does not enter into derivative transactions that do not have a high correlation with the underlying financial risk. The Company regularly reviews its hedge positions and the
correlation between the transaction risks and the hedging instruments. 
The
Company accounts for derivative instruments as hedges of the related underlying risks if the Company designates these derivative instruments as hedges and the derivative instruments
are effective as hedges of recognized assets or liabilities, forecasted transactions, unrecognized firm commitments or forecasted intercompany transactions. 
The
Company records gains and losses on derivatives qualifying as cash flow hedges in other comprehensive income loss, to the extent that hedges are effective and until the underlying
transactions are recognized in the consolidated statement of operations, at which time the Company recognizes the gains and losses in the consolidated statement of operations. The Company recognizes
gains and losses on qualifying fair value hedges and the related loss or gain on the hedged item attributable to the hedged risk in the consolidated statement of operations. 
The
Company practice is to terminate derivative transactions if the underlying asset or liability matures or is sold or terminated, or if the Company determines the underlying
forecasted transaction is no longer probable of occurring. Any deferred gains or losses associated with derivative instruments, which on infrequent occasions may be terminated prior to maturity, are
recognized in income in the period in which the income or expense on the underlying hedged transaction is recognized. 
51  Accounts Receivable Securitization 
The Company two primary U.S. operating subsidiaries are party to an accounts receivable securitization program under which they can sell eligible U.S. accounts
receivable to an indirectly wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company that was formed for the sole purpose of entering into this program. The wholly-owned subsidiary in turn sells an undivided ownership
interest in these receivables to a bank or an issuer of commercial paper administered by that bank. The wholly-owned subsidiary retains the receivables it purchases from the two operating
subsidiaries, except those as to which it sells interests to the bank or to the issuer of commercial paper. If the wholly-owned subsidiary sells undivided ownership interests in receivables, the
Company removes the transferred ownership interest amounts from its consolidated balance sheet at the time of the sale and reflects the proceeds from the sale in cash provided by operating activities
in the consolidated statement of cash flows. 
The
Company reflects retained receivables in notes and accounts receivable on its consolidated balance sheets, and the carrying amounts thereof approximate fair value because of the
relatively short-term nature of the receivables. The Company reflects costs associated with the sale of receivables in other income, net, in the Company consolidated statements of
operations. 
Inventories 
The Company determines the cost of most U.S. inventories on a last-in, first-out or LIFO cost flow basis. The cost of U.S. equipment
inventories and most non-U.S. inventories is determined on a first-in, first-out or FIFO cost flow basis. The Company states inventories at the lower of cost or
market. 
Property and Equipment 
The Company states property and equipment at cost, except for property and equipment that have been impaired, for which the Company reduces the carrying amount to
the estimated fair value at the impairment date. The Company capitalizes significant improvements; the Company charges repairs and maintenance costs that do not extend the lives of the assets to
expense as incurred. The Company removes the cost and accumulated depreciation of assets sold or otherwise disposed of from the accounts and recognizes any resulting gain or loss upon the disposition
of the assets. 
The
Company depreciates the cost of property and equipment over its estimated useful life on a straight-line basis as follows: buildings20 to 40years;
machinery and other property and equipment3 to 20years. 
Goodwill and Identifiable Intangible Assets 
Goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the estimated fair value of net tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired and liabilities
assumed in business combinations. The Company reflects identifiable intangible assets in other assets at cost. These assets consist primarily of patents, licenses, trademarks and
non-compete agreements. The Company amortizes them over the shorter of their stated or statutory duration or their estimated useful lives on a straight-line basis, generally
ranging from 3 to 20years. Identifiable intangibles, other than goodwill, individually and in the aggregate, comprise less than 5% of the Company consolidated assets and therefore are
immaterial to the Company consolidated balance sheets. 
52  The
Financial Accounting Standards Board or the FASB issued SFAS No141, Business Combinations and SFAS No142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, which require
that companies use the purchase method of accounting for all business combinations initiated after June30, 2001 as well as all purchase method business combinations completed after
June30, 2001. SFAS No142 requires that companies no longer amortize goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite useful lives, but instead test for impairment on a reporting unit
basis at least annually in accordance with the provisions of SFAS No142. A company may initiate a review of goodwill prior to conducting the annual analysis if events or changes in
circumstances indicate that the carrying value of goodwill may be impaired. 
A
reporting unit is the operating segment unless, at businesses one level below that operating segmentthe component leveldiscrete financial information is
prepared and regularly reviewed by management, and the component has economic characteristics that are different from the economic characteristics of the other components of the operating segment, in
which case the component is the reporting unit. A company must use a fair value approach to test goodwill for impairment. A company must recognize an impairment charge for the amount, if any, by which
the carrying amount of goodwill exceeds its fair value. The Company derives an estimate of fair values for the Company as a whole and for each of the Company reporting units using an income
approach, which uses forecasted earnings and cash flows, and a market approach, which uses comparisons to other businesses. The Company performs this annual test for impairment during the fourth
quarter of each year. This standard also requires that the Company amortize intangible assets with definite useful lives over their respective estimated useful lives to their estimated residual values
and review these for impairment in accordance with SFAS No144, Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets. 
The
Company adopted the provisions of SFAS No141 upon issuance and adopted SFAS No142 effective January1, 2002. The Company did not amortize any goodwill or any
intangible assets determined to have an indefinite useful life that were acquired in a purchase business combination completed after June30, 2001, but evaluated these for impairment.

The Company periodically reviews long-lived assets, other than goodwill, for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the
carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. The Company recognizes impairments when the expected future undiscounted cash flows derived from long-lived assets are less than their
carrying value. For these cases, the Company recognizes losses in an amount equal to the difference between the fair value and the carrying amount. The Company records assets to be disposed of by sale
or abandonment, where management has the current ability to remove these assets from operations, at the lower of carrying amount or fair value less cost of disposition. The Company suspends
depreciation for these assets during the disposal period, which is generally less than one year. Assumptions and estimates used in the determination of impairment losses, such as future cash flows and
disposition costs, may affect the carrying value of long-lived assets and possible impairment expense in the Company consolidated financial statements. 
53  Asset Retirement Obligations 
In 2003, the Company adopted SFAS No143, Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations. SFAS No143 requires companies to record the fair value
of a liability for an asset retirement obligation in the period in which it is incurred, which is adjusted to its present value each subsequent period. In addition, companies must capitalize a
corresponding amount by increasing the carrying amount of the related long-lived asset, which is depreciated over the useful life of the related long-lived asset. 
The
Company has not recorded asset retirement obligations associated with owned or leased buildings because these retirement obligations have an indeterminate settlement date and,
accordingly, the retirement obligation cannot be reasonably estimated. Stock-Based Compensation 
The Company applies the fair value based method of accounting for stock-based compensation as permitted by SFAS No123, Accounting for Stock-Based
Compensation. Under the fair value based method, compensation cost is measured at the grant date based on the value of the award and is recognized over the service period, which is usually the
vesting period. The Company primary stock-
based employee compensation program is its contingent stock plan. See Note16 for further information on this plan. 
Terminated Stock Option Plans 
As of March31, 1998 in connection with the Cryovac transaction see Note19, the Company terminated stock option plans in which specified
employees of the Cryovac packaging business participated prior to that date, except with respect to options that remained outstanding as of that date. All of these options had been granted at an
exercise price equal to the fair market value of the underlying shares on the date of grant. All options outstanding upon the termination of the stock option plans in 1998 had fully vested prior to
December31, 2000. Since 1997, the Company has not issued any stock option awards and has no plans to do so in the future. 
Foreign Currency Translation 
In non-U.S. locations that are not considered highly inflationary, the Company translates the balance sheets at the end of period exchange rates with
translation adjustments accumulated in shareholders' equity. The Company translates the statements of operations at the average exchange rates during the applicable period. The Company translates
assets and liabilities of its operations in countries with highly inflationary economies at the end of period exchange rates, except that it translates specified financial statement amounts at
historical exchange rates. The Company translates items reflected in statements of operations of its operations in countries with highly inflationary economies at average rates of exchange prevailing
during the period, except that it translates specified financial statement amounts at historical exchange rates. Income Taxes 
The Company and its domestic subsidiaries filea consolidated U.S. federal income tax return. The Company non-U.S. subsidiaries file income
tax returns in their respective local jurisdictions. The 
54  Company
provides for income taxes on those portions of its foreign subsidiaries' accumulated earnings that it believes are not reinvested indefinitely in their businesses. The
Company accounts for income taxes under the asset and liability method. The Company recognizes deferred tax assets and liabilities for the future tax consequences attributable to
differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and tax benefit carryforwards. The Company determines deferred tax
liabilities and assets at the end of each period using enacted tax rates. 
The
Company believes that its taxable earnings during the periods when the temporary differences giving rise to deferred tax assets become deductible or when tax benefit carryforwards
may be utilized should be sufficient to realize the related future income tax benefits. For those jurisdictions where the expiration date of tax benefit carryforwards or the projected taxable earnings
indicate that realization is not likely, the Company provides a valuation allowance. 
In
assessing the need for a valuation allowance, the Company estimates future taxable earnings, with consideration for the feasibility of ongoing tax planning strategies and the
realizability of tax benefit carryforwards, to determine which deferred tax assets are more likely than not to be realized in the future. Valuation allowances related to deferred tax assets can be
impacted by changes to tax laws, changes to statutory tax rates and future taxable earnings. In the event that actual results differ from these estimates in future periods, the Company may need to
adjust the valuation allowance, which could materially affect the Company consolidated financial statements. 
Research and Development 
The Company expenses research and development costs as incurred. Research and development costs were $732million, $690million and
$593million in 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively. Earnings Loss per Common Share 
The Company calculates basic earnings loss per common share by dividing net earnings loss ascribed to common shareholders by the weighted average common
shares outstanding for the period. Net earnings loss ascribed to common shareholders represents net earnings loss adjusted for gains losses attributable to the repurchase or redemption of
preferred stock for an amount below or above its book value, less preferred stock dividends. The computation of diluted earnings loss per common share is similar, except that the weighted average
common shares outstanding for the period are adjusted to reflect the potential issuance of dilutive shares, which includes the effect of the conversion of the Company 3% convertible senior notes,
and net earnings loss ascribed to common shareholders are adjusted to reflect the reduction to interest expense, net of income taxes, that would occur as a result of the assumed conversion of the 3%
convertible senior notes. 
Environmental Expenditures 
The Company expenses or capitalizes environmental expenditures that relate to ongoing business activities, as appropriate. The Company expenses expenditures that
relate to an existing condition caused by past operations and which do not contribute to current or future net sales. The Company records liabilities when it determines that environmental assessments
or remediation expenditures are probable and that it can reasonably estimate the cost or a range of costs associated therewith. 
55  Note3 Business Segment Information 
The Company operates in two reportable business segments: iFood Packaging and iiProtective Packaging. The Food Packaging segment comprises
primarily the Company Cryovac food packaging products. The Protective Packaging segment includes the aggregation of the Company protective packaging products and shrink packaging
products, all of which products are used principally for non-food packaging applications. 
Effective
January1, 2004, the Company renamed its two reportable business segments as Food Packaging and Protective Packaging. This change reflects the Company decision to
include its medical films, tubing and connectors, which are used with a wide variety of medical applications, in the segment also containing its food packaging products. These specialty medical
products had previously been a part of the segment containing the Company protective packaging products. In addition, commencing as of January1, 2004, the Company has allocated the expenses
related to the implementation of its global information systems to its reportable business segments rather than reflecting them in unallocated corporate operating expenses. Prior period amounts have
been reclassified to conform to the current year presentation. 
The
Food Packaging segment consists primarily of flexible materials and related systems such as shrink bag and film products, laminated films, and packaging systems marketed primarily
under the Cryovac trademark for packaging a broad range of perishable foods, as well as medical packaging products. Also included in this segment are rigid packaging and absorbent pads
such as foam and solid plastic trays and containers for the packaging of a wide variety of food products and absorbent pads used for the packaging of meat, fish and poultry. Net sales of flexible
materials and related systems were: 2004$1,9765million; 2003$1,8680million; and 2002$1,6871million. Net sales of rigid packaging and
absorbent pads were: 2004$3704million; 2003$3506million; and
2002$3009million. The Company primarily sells products in this segment to food processors, distributors, supermarket retailers and food service businesses. 
The
Protective Packaging segment consists primarily of cushioning and surface protection products such as Bubble Wrap cushioning and other air cellular cushioning materials;
shrink and non-shrink films principally for non-food applications; polyurethane foam packaging systems sold under the Instapak trademark; polyethylene foam sheets
and planks; Jiffy mailers and bags and other protective and durable mailers and bags; paper-based protective packaging materials; suspension and retention packaging; inflatable packaging;
and packaging systems. Net sales of cushioning and surface protection products were: 2004$1,3964million; 2003$1,2654million; and
2002$1,1714million. Net sales of other products for 2004, 2003 and 2002 were approximately 1% of consolidated net sales. The Company primarily sells products in this segment to
distributors and manufacturers in a wide variety of industries.

In accordance with SFAS No131, Disclosures about Segments of an Enterprise and Related Information, and because the Company management views goodwill
as a corporate asset, the Company has allocated all of its goodwill to the corporate level rather than to the individual segments. However, in accordance with SFAS No142, Goodwill and Other
Intangible Assets, the Company has allocated goodwill to each reportable segment in order to perform its annual impairment review of goodwill, which it does during the fourth quarter of each year.
See Note8 for a discussion of the annual goodwill impairment review. 
58  The
allocation of goodwill in accordance with SFAS No142 for the years ended December31, 2004 and 2003 was as follows: Balance at

In
December2001, the Company and a group of its U.S. subsidiaries entered into an accounts receivable securitization program with a bank and an issuer of commercial paper
administered by the bank. On December7, 2004, which was the scheduled expiration date of this program, the parties extended this program for an additional term of three years ending
December7, 2007. 
Under
this receivables facility, the Company two primary operating subsidiaries, Cryovac,Inc. and Sealed Air Corporation US, sell all of their eligible U.S. accounts
receivable to Sealed Air Funding Corporation, an indirectly wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company that was formed for the sole purpose of entering into the receivables facility. Sealed Air Funding in
turn may sell undivided ownership interests in these receivables to the bank and the issuer of commercial paper, subject to specified conditions, up to a maximum of $1250million of
receivables interests outstanding from time to time. 
Sealed
Air Funding retains the receivables it purchases from the operating subsidiaries, except those as to which it sells receivables interests to the bank or the issuer of commercial
paper. The Company has structured the sales of accounts receivable by the operating subsidiaries to Sealed Air Funding, and the sales of receivables interests from Sealed Air Funding to the bank and
the issuer of commercial paper, as true sales under applicable laws. The assets of Sealed Air Funding are not available to pay any creditors of the Company or of its subsidiaries or affiliates. The
Company accounts for these transactions as sales of receivables under the provisions of SFAS No140, Accounting for Transfers and Servicing of Financial Assets and Extinguishment of
Liabilities. 
To
secure the performance of their obligations under the receivables facility, Sealed Air Funding and the operating subsidiaries granted a first priority security interest to the bank,
as agent, in accounts receivable owned by them, proceeds and collections of those receivables and other collateral. The bank and the issuer of commercial paper have no recourse to the Company, the
operating subsidiaries' or 
59  Sealed
Air Funding other assets for any losses resulting from the financial inability of customers to pay amounts due on the receivables when they become due. As long as a termination event with
respect to the receivables facility has not occurred, the operating subsidiaries service, administer and collect the receivables under the receivables facility as agents on behalf of Sealed Air
Funding, the bank and the issuer of commercial paper. 
Prior
to a termination event under the receivables facility, Sealed Air Funding uses collections of receivables not otherwise required to be paid to the bank or the issuer of commercial
paper to purchase new eligible receivables from the operating subsidiaries. The Company has undertaken to cause the operating subsidiaries to perform their obligations under the receivables facility. 
The
parties amended the receivables facility on April2, 2003 to provide that Sealed Air Funding could sell receivables interests aggregating up to $600million,
originated only by Sealed Air Corporation US, to the bank or the issuer of commercial paper until a definitive asbestos settlement agreement, satisfactory to the bank, had been entered into. The
receivables facility again became available for the sale of receivables interests originated by Cryovac,Inc. as well as Sealed Air Corporation US, up to the original maximum of
$1250million of receivables interests provided for by the receivables facility, on January26, 2004. 
The
receivables facility contains financial covenants relating to interest coverage and debt leverage. The Company was in compliance with these ratios at December31, 2004. 
Under
limited circumstances, the bank and the issuer of commercial paper can terminate purchases of receivables interests prior to the above dates. A downgrade of the Company
long-term senior unsecured debt to BB- or below by Standard Poor Rating Services or Ba3 or
below by Moody Investors Service,Inc., or failure to comply with interest coverage and debt leverage ratios could result in termination of the receivables facility. 
The
operating subsidiaries did not sell any receivables interests under the receivables facility during 2004 or 2003, and therefore the Company did not remove any related amounts from
the consolidated assets reflected on the Company consolidated balance sheets at December31, 2004 or 2003. 
The
receivables facility provides for a program fee of 0375% per annum on the greater of the unpaid amount of the receivables interests sold by Sealed Air Funding and 50% of the
$1250million purchase limit under the facility. The receivables facility also provides for a commitment fee of 020% per annum on the lesser of the unused portion of the facility and 50% of
the purchase limit under the facility. At December31, 2003, the receivables facility provided for a program fee of 045% per annum on the receivables interests sold by Sealed Air Funding, and
a commitment fee of 040% per annum on the unused portion of the receivables facility. 
The
costs associated with the receivables facility are reflected in other income, net, in the Company consolidated statements of operations for the years ended December31,
2004, 2003 and 2002. These costs primarily relate to the loss on the sale of the receivables interests to the bank or the issuer of commercial paper, which were zero for 2004 and 2003 and
$04million for 2002, and program and commitment fees and other associated costs, which were $05million, $06million and $04million for 2004, 2003 and 2002,
respectively. 
60  Note5 Acquisitions 
During the three-year period from 2002 to 2004, the Company made several acquisitions. The Company acquired these businesses for cash in the aggregate
amount of $64million, $25million and $105million in 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively, and accounted for the acquisitions under the purchase method of accounting. These
acquisitions resulted in goodwill of $23million in 2004, $05million in 2003 and $73million in 2002. In each year, cash used for acquisitions was net of cash acquired in
those acquisitions. Cash acquired in acquisitions was not material in 2004, 2003 or 2002. The Company did not assume any debt in acquisitions in 2004, 2003 and 2002. These acquisitions were not
material to the Company consolidated financial statements.

December31, 2004 and 2003, the Company determined the value of non-equipment U.S. inventories by the last-in, first-out or LIFO inventory
method. The value of U.S. inventories determined by that method amounted to $1389million and $1373million, respectively. If the Company had used first-in,
first-out or FIFO inventory method, which approximates replacement value, for these inventories, they would have been $249million and $226million higher at
December31, 2004 and 2003, respectively.

Note8 Goodwill and Identifiable Intangible Assets  Goodwill 
As of December31, 2004 and 2003, the Company had unamortized goodwill in the amount of $1,9534million and $1,9395million, respectively.
Beginning January1, 2002, in accordance with SFAS No142, the Company stopped recording amortization expense related to goodwill. Although the Company no longer systematically
amortizes goodwill, this standard requires that the Company conduct periodic reviews to assess whether or not the carrying amount of goodwill may be impaired. These reviews could result in future
write-downs of goodwill, which would be reflected as a charge against operating income. 
Goodwill
and intangible assets with indefinite useful lives have to be tested for impairment at least annually in accordance with the provisions of SFAS No142. The Company
completed its annual testing for impairment for 2004, 2003 and 2002 during the fourth quarter of each year and determined that no impairment charge was necessary on a reporting unit basis in any of
the periods. See Note3, Business Segment Information, for the allocation of goodwill by business segment. 
Identifiable Intangible Assets 
As of December31, 2004 and 2003, the Company had identifiable intangible assets with definite useful lives with a gross carrying value of
$772million and $708million, respectively, less accumulated amortization of $616million and $545million, respectively. These identifiable intangible assets
therefore are immaterial to the Company consolidated balance sheets. Amortization of identifiable intangible assets was approximately $90million for 2004. Assuming no change in the gross
carrying value of identifiable intangible assets from the value at December31, 2004, the estimated amortization for future years is as follows: 2005$58million,
2006$37million, 2007$27million, 2008$20million; and 2009$14million. These assets are reflected in other assets
in the Company consolidated balance sheets. At December31, 2004 and 2003, there were no identifiable intangible assets, other than goodwill, with indefinite useful lives as defined by SFAS
No142.

upon anticipated future results, the Company has concluded that it is more likely than not that it will realize the $3237million balance of deferred tax assets at
December31, 2004, net of the valuation allowance of $301million. The valuation allowance is related to the uncertainty of utilizing $672million of foreign net operating loss
carryforwards, or $193million on a tax-effected basis, most of which have no expiration period and $419million of foreign investment tax allowances, or
$117million on a tax-effected basis, that have no expiration period.

October22, 2004, the American Jobs Creation Act, known as the AJCA, became law. The AJCA provides a deduction of 85% of qualifying foreign earnings that the Company
repatriates, as defined in the AJCA, in 2005. This deduction produces the equivalent of a 525% effective tax rate on the repatriated earnings. The Company qualifies to repatriate up to approximately
$500million. 
The
Company is evaluating the effects of the repatriation provision. During the evaluation, the Company is principally considering global cash management objectives, its overall tax
position and restrictions on the use of repatriated cash. Pending completion of this evaluation, a range of potential income tax effects of repatriating cannot be reasonably estimated. If the Company
determines to repatriate funds in reliance upon the AJCA, the repatriation must be completed by the end of 2005. 
The
AJCA also provides a deduction for qualified production activities. The impact of the qualified production activities deduction on the Company taxable income is currently being
evaluated. While the implications of this provision vary based on transition rules and the future income mix, the Company expects the provision will provide a favorable impact on its effective tax
rate in the future. 
Note11 Restructuring Costs and Other Charges 
2004 Restructuring Program 
During the fourth quarter of 2004, the Company announced a series of separate profit improvement plans in various geographic regions in order to complement the
Company long-term growth programs and financial goals and to improve the Company operating efficiencies and lower its overall cost structure. The plans will principally reduce the
number of employees and consolidate or relocate operations in both of the Company reportable business segments. The Company expects to eliminate 473 full-time employees, of which 50
employees had been eliminated prior to December31, 2004. However, with the prospective addition of approximately 100 positions in connection with the Company realignment or relocation of
certain manufacturing activities, the net reduction in headcount positions is expected to be approximately 373. These actions affected principally production workers 
65  and
members of the Company sales force. The Company expects to complete these activities by June2006. These charges consisted of the following: Year Ended December31, 2004 Food
Packaging
Protective
Packaging
Total Cost Employee termination costs 175 41 216 Long-lived asset impairments 102 01 103 Facility exit costs 11 11 FAS 88 curtailment and settlements 03 03 Total 291 42 333 The
long-lived asset impairment of $103million consisted of write-downs and write-offs of property and equipment. The impairments related to decisions to
rationalize and realign production of some of the Company smaller product lines and to close several smaller scale European manufacturing facilities. Since the undiscounted cash flows, including
estimated salvage value, were less than the carrying values of these assets, they were written down to their estimated fair value. The Company plans to dispose of these facilities and much of the
equipment by mid-2005. The components of the restructuring charges, spending and other activity through December31, 2004 and the remaining accrual balance at December31, 2004 were as
follows: Employee

During 2001, the Company conducted a review of its business to reduce costs and expenses, simplify business processes and organizational structure and refine the
Company manufacturing operations and product offerings. As a result of this review, the Company announced and implemented a restructuring program that resulted in charges to operations of
$328million, of which $255million would result in cash outlays by the Company. These charges consisted of $239million for employee termination costs, $73million for
long-lived asset impairments and $16million for facility exit costs. Of the $328million charge, $211million was incurred in the Company food packaging segment
with the remaining $117million in the protective packaging segment. Since 2001, the Company made adjustments to the original provision amounts.

Profit-Sharing and Retirement Savings Plans 
The Company has a non-contributory profit-sharing plan covering most of its U.S. employees. Contributions to this plan, which are made at the
discretion of the Board of Directors, may be made in cash, shares of the Company common stock, or in a combination of cash and shares of the Company common stock. The Company also maintains
contributory thrift and retirement savings plans in which most of its U.S. employees are eligible to participate. The contributory thrift and retirement savings plans generally provide for Company
contributions based upon the amount contributed to the plans by the participants. Company contributions to or provisions for its profit-sharing and retirement savings plans are charged to operations
and amounted to $270million, $264million and $362million in 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively. In 2004 and 2002 there were no shares of common stock issued for the Company
contribution to its profit-sharing plan. The value of the 268,180 shares of common stock issued as part of the Company contribution to the profit-sharing plan in 2003 was $98million, with
the $183million balance of the 2003 contribution to this plan made in cash. U.S. Defined Benefit Pension Plans 
A limited number of the Company U.S. employees, including some employees who are covered by collective bargaining agreements, participate in defined benefit
pension plans. The following presents the Company funded status for 2004 and 2003 under SFAS No132 for its U.S. pension plans. The

level of investment risk. The investment strategy is focused on a long-term total return in excess of a pure fixed income strategy with short-term volatility less than that of
a pure equity strategy. To accomplish this objective, assets are invested in a balanced and diversified mix of equity and fixed income investments. The target asset allocation will typically be
50-65% in equity securities, with a maximum equity allocation of 75%, and 35-50% in fixed income securities, with a minimum fixed income allocation of 25% including cash.

The Company generally does not offer its employees postretirement benefits other than programs that are required by the foreign countries in which the Company
operates. In the U.S., the Company offers a program that is fully funded by the participating retired employees. These programs are not material to the Company consolidated financial statements. 
Since
March31, 1998, the Company has offered to some U.S. employees of the Cryovac packaging business a fixed subsidy applicable to participation in its U.S. postretirement
healthcare program. At December31, 2004, 2003 and 2002, the accrued benefit liability associated with these subsidies amounted to $23million, $22million and
$25million, respectively. The net periodic postretirement expense and credit components, together with other remaining postretirement healthcare plan disclosures under SFAS No132,
are not material to the Company consolidated financial statements.

4The
Company used the net proceeds of these offerings and additional cash on hand, an aggregate of $1,2981million, to redeem the outstanding shares of its SeriesA
convertible preferred stock in 2003. 
Revolving Credit Facilities: 
The 2006 Facility 
On December19, 2003, the Company entered into a $3500million unsecured multi-currency revolving credit facility that matures in 2006. The Company
has not borrowed under the 2006 facility since its inception, and no borrowings were outstanding as of December31, 2004 and 2003. 
The
2006 facility provides that the Company may borrow for working capital and general corporate purposes including payment of a portion of the $5125million cash payment
required to be paid upon 
73  the
effectiveness of an appropriate plan of reorganization in the Grace bankruptcy see Note19 for further discussion. The Company may re-borrow amounts repaid under the 2006
facility from time to time prior to the expiration or earlier termination of the 2006 facility. As of December31, 2004, facility fees were payable at the rate of 015% per annum on the total
amounts available under the 2006 facility. 
The
Company obligations under the 2006 facility bear interest at floating rates, which are generally determined by adding the applicable borrowing margin to the base rate or the
interbank rate for the relevant currency and time period. The 2006 facility provides for changes in borrowing margins based on the Company long-term senior unsecured debt ratings. 
The
2006 facility requires that, upon the occurrence of specified events that would adversely affect the settlement agreement in the Grace bankruptcy proceedings or would materially
increase the Company liability in respect of the Grace bankruptcy or the asbestos liability arising from the Cryovac transaction see Note19 for further discussion, the Company would be
required to repay any amounts outstanding under the 2006 facility, or refinance the facility, within 60days. 
ANZ Facility 
In March2002, the Company entered into an Australian dollar 1750million, dual-currency revolving credit facility that expired on
March12, 2005. This facility was reduced to 1700million Australian dollars on May31, 2004, as scheduled under the terms of the facility. The amount available was equivalent to
U.S. $1297million at December31, 2004. A syndicate of banks made this facility available to a group of the Company Australian and New Zealand subsidiaries for general corporate
purposes and the refinancing of previously outstanding indebtedness. The Company may re-borrow amounts repaid under the ANZ facility from time to time prior to the expiration or earlier
termination of the facility. No amounts were outstanding under the ANZ facility at December31, 2004 or 2003. In March2005, the Company renewed the facility for a 5-year
period expiring March 2010, with terms and conditions that are substantially equivalent to those in the expiring facility. Senior Notes Issued in July2003; Recapitalization 
In July2003, the Company issued a total of $1,2813million principal amount of its 5625% senior notes, 6875% senior notes and 3% convertible
senior notes in transactions that were exempt from registration in reliance upon Rule144A and other available exemptions under the Securities Act of 1933. The total net proceeds from the
July2003 issuances were $1,2611million after deducting the initial purchasers' discount, unamortized bond discount, except for the 3% convertible senior notes, and other offering
expenses. The net proceeds consisted of $3956million from the 5625% senior notes, $4440million from the 6875% senior notes and $4215million from the 3% convertible senior
notes. 
On
July18, 2003, the Company used the net proceeds from these offerings and additional cash on hand to redeem its SeriesA convertible preferred stock at the redemption
price of $5100 per share or $1,2981million of cash, plus an amount equal to dividends accrued from July1, 2003 through July17, 2003, for which the Company used
$24million of cash. As discussed in Note16 below, the Company had previously repurchased an aggregate of 750,600 shares of its SeriesA convertible preferred stock during 2003,
prior to the July18, 2003 redemption. 
74  The
holders of the 3% convertible senior notes may convert those notes into shares of the Company common stock at a conversion rate of 142857 shares per $1,000 principal amount of the
notes, which is equivalent to a conversion price of $7000 per share, subject to anti-dilution adjustments, before the close of business on June30, 2033. Holders may convert their
convertible senior notes only under the following circumstances: 1during any calendar quarter, if the closing sale price of the Company common stock exceeds 120% of the conversion price
for at least 20 trading days in the 30 consecutive trading days ending on the last trading day of the preceding calendar quarter; 2during any period in which ithe
long-term credit rating assigned to the notes by Standard Poor Rating Services, a division of the McGraw-Hill Companies, or Moody Investors Services,Inc.
is lower than BB+ or Ba2, respectively, iieither Standard Poor or Moody no longer rates the notes or has withdrawn or suspended this rating, or iiithe notes are not
assigned a rating by both Standard Poor and Moody; 3during the five business day period immediately after any five consecutive trading day period in which the trading price per
$1,000 principal amount of notes for each day of that period was less than 98% of the product of the closing sale price of the Company common stock and the conversion rate; 4if the notes
have been called for redemption; or 5upon the occurrence of specified corporate events. None of these circumstances that would allow for conversion of the notes has arisen at any time since
their issuance. 
The
Company has the option to redeem the 3% convertible senior notes beginning July2, 2007 at a price equal to 101286% of their aggregate principal amount, declining ratably to
100% of their aggregate principal amount on June30, 2010. 
The
holders of the 3% convertible senior notes have the option to require the Company to repurchase the 3% convertible senior notes on June30 of 2010, 2013, 2018, 2023 and 2028,
or upon the occurrence of a fundamental change in or a termination of trading of the Company common stock, at a price equal to 100% of their principal amount, plus accrued and unpaid interest. 
In
connection with the issuance of the 3% convertible senior notes, on September5, 2003 the Company filed a registration statement on FormS-3 with the
Securities and Exchange Commission to register for resale the 6,160,708 shares of the Company common stock issuable, subject to anti-dilution adjustments, upon conversion of the notes.
The registration statement became effective on January23, 2004. 5375% Senior Notes 
On April14, 2003, the Company issued $3000million aggregate principal amount of 5375% senior notes due April2008 in transactions exempt
from registration in reliance upon Rule144A and other available exemptions under the Securities Act. The net proceeds from the issuance of these senior notes after deducting the initial
purchasers' discount, unamortized bond discount and other offering expenses were $2961million. 
75  
Debt Redemption and Repurchases  2004 Debt Redemption 
On November26, 2004, the Company used net cash of $2118million to redeem the entire outstanding aggregate principal amount 1775million, of its 875% senior notes due July1, 2008 and terminated interest rate swaps on the 875% senior notes having a total notional amount of $1500million. The
Company had issued the senior notes on June26, 2001 under Rule144A and RegulationS of the Securities Act of 1933. The Company determined the redemption price in accordance with
the indenture governing the notes. The net cash used of $2118million consisted of cash used to purchase the senior notes at a premium plus accrued interest of $2134million and cash
received of $16million related to the termination of the interest rate swaps. The Company completed the redemption, funded with available cash, at a premium to the face amount of the notes,
which resulted in a loss of $296million, which the Company reflected in the statement of operations as Loss on debt redemption and repurchases. The annual interest expense on the redeemed
notes was approximately $155million without giving effect to any interest rate swaps and the amortization of amounts related to the senior notes. 
2004 and 2003 Debt Repurchases 
In November and December2004, the Company used available cash of $252million to repurchase in the open market $227million face amount of
its 695% senior notes due May2009 which included accrued interest and related fees. Since the Company completed these repurchases at a premium to the
face amount of the notes, it incurred a loss of $26million, which the Company reflected in the statement of operations as Loss on debt redemption and repurchases. 
In
December2003, the Company used net cash of $2082million to repurchase in the open market $1225million face amount of its 875% senior notes and
$500million face amount of its 695% senior notes and terminated interest rate swaps on the 875% senior notes with a total notional amount of $1000million. The net cash used of
$2082million consisted of cash used to purchase the senior notes at a premium plus accrued interest and related fees of $2089million and cash received of $07million related
to the termination of the interest rate swaps. The Company completed these repurchases at premiums to the face amounts of the notes, which resulted in a loss of $336million, which the Company
reflected in the statement of operations as Loss on debt redemption and repurchases. 
Covenants 
Each issue of the Company outstanding senior notes and the Company outstanding euro notes imposes limitations on the Company operations and those of
specified subsidiaries. The principal limitations restrict liens, sale and leaseback transactions and mergers, acquisitions and dispositions. The 2006 facility contains financial covenants relating to
interest coverage, debt leverage and minimum liquidity, and restrictions on the creation of liens, the incurrence of additional indebtedness, acquisitions, mergers and consolidations, asset sales, and
amendments to the asbestos settlement agreement discussed above. The ANZ facility contains financial covenants relating to debt leverage, interest coverage and tangible net worth, and restrictions on
the creation of liens, the incurrence of additional indebtedness and asset sales, in each case relating to the Australian and New Zealand subsidiaries of the Company that are borrowers under the
facility. The Company was in compliance with these limitations at December31, 2004 and 2003. 
76  Other Lines of Credit 
Substantially all the Company short-term borrowings of $198million and $182million at December31, 2004 and 2003,
respectively, were outstanding under lines of credit available to various of the Company U.S. and foreign subsidiaries. The weighted average interest rate on these outstanding lines of credit was
1137% and 1286% at December31, 2004 and 2003, respectively. Amounts available under these credit lines as of December31, 2004 and 2003 were approximately $2379million and
$2153million, respectively, of which approximately $2181million and $1970million, respectively, were unused. 
At
December31, 2004 and 2003, the Company had available committed and uncommitted lines of credit, including the credit lines discussed above, of $7176million and
$6937million, respectively, of which $6942million and $6754million were unused. As of December31, 2004 and 2003, the total available lines of credit included
committed lines of credit of $4797million and $4792million, respectively, and uncommitted lines of credit of $2379million and $2145million, respectively. The
Company principal credit lines were all committed and consisted of the 2006 facility and the ANZ facility. The Company is not subject to any material compensating balance requirements in connection
with its lines of credit. 
Debt Maturities 
Scheduled annual maturities of long-term debt, exclusive of debt discounts and the interest rate swap fair value adjustment, for the five years
subsequent to December31, 2004 are as follows: 2005 38 2006 2715 2007 35 2008 3033 2009 2307 Thereafter 1,2918 Total 2,1046 Note14 Derivatives and Hedging Activities 
The Company reports all derivative instruments on the balance sheet at fair value and establishes criteria for designation and effectiveness of transactions
entered into for hedging purposes. 
The
Company is exposed to market risk, such as fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates and changes in interest rates. To manage the volatility relating to these exposures, the
Company enters into various derivative instruments from time to time under its risk management policies. The Company designates derivative instruments as hedges on a transaction basis to support hedge
accounting. The changes in fair value of these hedging instruments offset in part or in whole corresponding changes in the fair value or cash flows of the underlying exposures being hedged. The
Company assesses the initial and ongoing effectiveness of its hedging relationships in accordance with its documented policy. The Company does not purchase, hold or sell derivative financial
instruments for trading purposes. 
77  Foreign Currency Forward Contracts 
The Company is exposed to market risk, such as fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. The Company subsidiaries have foreign currency exchange exposure
from buying and selling in currencies other than their functional currencies. The primary purpose of the Company foreign currency hedging activities is to manage the potential changes in value
associated with the amounts receivable or payable on transactions denominated in foreign currencies. At December31, 2004 and 2003, the Company was party to foreign currency forward contracts,
with aggregate notional amounts of $3423million maturing through August2005 and $1619million, which matured through April2004, respectively. The estimated fair values
of these contracts, which represent the estimated net payments that would be paid or received by the Company in the event of termination of these contracts based on the then current foreign exchange
rates, was zero and a net payable of $02million included in other current liabilities at December31, 2004 and 2003, respectively. These contracts qualified and were designated as cash
flow hedges, and had original maturities of less than twelve months. 
Interest Rate Swaps 
From time to time, the Company may use interest rate swaps to manage its exposure to fluctuations in interest rates. 2004 Interest Rate Swaps 
At December31, 2004, the Company had interest rate swaps with a total notional amount of $3000million that qualified and were designated as fair
value hedges. The Company entered into these interest rate swaps to convert the 5375% senior notes into floating rate debt. At December31, 2004, the Company recorded a reduction to
long-term debt to record the fair value of the 5375% senior notes due to changes in interest rates of $76million and an offsetting adjustment to other liabilities to record the
fair value of the related interest rate swaps. There was no ineffective portion to the hedges recognized in earnings during the period. In
connection with the Company redemption of the entire outstanding principal amount, $1775million, of its 875% senior notes in November2004 see Note13, the
Company terminated interest rate swaps with a total notional amount of $1500million and received net cash proceeds of $16million. 
The
Company also reduced interest expense by $62million for the year ended December31, 2004, due to the impact of interest rate swaps that were outstanding during the
year. 
2003 Interest Rate Swaps 
At December31, 2003, the Company had interest rate swaps with a total notional amount of $4000million that qualified and were designated as fair
value hedges. The Company entered into interest rate swaps to convert a portion of the 5375% senior notes and 875% senior notes into floating rate debt. At December31, 2003, the Company
recorded the following adjustments to long-term debt: an
adjustment to record a decrease in the fair value of the 5375% senior notes due to changes in interest rates of $61million and an offsetting adjustment to other
liabilities to record the fair value of the related interest rate swaps; and 
78  an
adjustment to record an increase in the fair value of the 875% senior notes due to changes in interest rates of $38million and an offsetting adjustment to other
assets to record the fair value of the related interest rate swaps. There
was no ineffective portion to the hedges recognized in earnings during the period. 
In
connection with the Company repurchase of a portion of the 875% senior notes in December2003 see Note13, the Company terminated interest rate swaps with a total
notional amount of $1000million and received net cash proceeds of $07million. 
The
Company also reduced interest expense $42million for the year ended December31, 2003, due to the impact of interest rate swaps that were outstanding during the year. U.S. Treasury Locks 
During the three months ended June30, 2003, the Company entered into U.S. Treasury lock agreements with a total notional amount of $7000million
that qualified and were designated as cash flow hedges. U.S. Treasury lock agreements are instruments used to manage the risks associated with movements in U.S. Treasury rates. The Company entered
into these agreements to manage interest rate risks arising from the planned issuance of the 5375% senior notes in April2003 and the planned issuance of the 5625% senior notes and the 6875%
senior notes in July2003 see Note13. The Company terminated these U.S. Treasury lock agreements prior to June30, 2003 and received net cash proceeds of $139million.
The Company has reflected this amount in other comprehensive income and is amortizing and reflecting it as a net reduction of interest expense over the lives of the respective senior notes. At
December31, 2004 and 2003, the Company was not party to any U.S. Treasury lock agreements. 
The
Company may use other derivative instruments from time to time, such as options and collars to manage its exposure to fluctuations in interest rates, foreign exchange options to
manage exposure to fluctuations in foreign exchange rates, and interest rate and currency swaps to gain access to additional sources of international financing while limiting foreign exchange exposure
and limiting or adjusting interest rate exposure by swapping borrowings in one currency for borrowings denominated in another currency. The
Company records gains and losses on derivatives qualifying as cash flow hedges in other comprehensive income loss, to the extent that these hedges are effective and until it
recognizes the underlying transactions in earnings, at which time it recognizes these gains and losses in the consolidated statement of operations. Other comprehensive income loss for the years
ended December31, 2004 and 2003 reflected net unrealized after tax gains losses of $04 million $08 million pre-tax and $80million $133million
pre-tax, respectively. The estimated net amount of the existing unrecognized net gain on derivative instruments that the Company expects to be reflected in the consolidated statement of
operations within the next twelve months is $12million, pre-tax. The unrealized amounts in other comprehensive income loss will fluctuate based on changes in the fair value of
open contracts during each reporting period. The Company practice is to terminate derivative transactions if the underlying asset or liability matures or is sold or terminated, or if the Company
determines the underlying forecasted transaction is no longer probable of occurring. The Company cash flow hedges for the years ended December31, 2004 and 2003 were effective hedges, meaning
that they qualified for hedge accounting treatment. 
79  The
Company bears credit losses if the counterparties to its outstanding derivative contracts are unable to perform their obligations. However, it does not expect any counterparties to
fail to perform as they are major financial institutions with high credit ratings and financial strength. Nevertheless, there is a risk that the Company exposure to losses arising out of derivative
contracts could be material if the counterparties to these agreements fail to perform their obligations. 
Note15 Financial Instruments 
Under US GAAP, the Company must disclose its estimate of the fair value of material financial instruments, including those recorded as assets or liabilities in
its consolidated financial statements and derivative financial instruments. 
The
carrying amounts of current assets and liabilities approximate fair value due to their short-term maturities. The
fair value of the Company euro notes and senior notes are based on quoted market prices. The Company derived the fair value estimates of the Company various other debt
instruments by evaluating the nature and terms of each instrument, considering prevailing economic and market conditions, and examining the cost of similar debt offered at the balance sheet date.
These estimates are subjective and involve uncertainties and matters of significant judgment and, therefore, the Company cannot determine them with precision. Changes in assumptions could
significantly affect the Company estimates. 
The
fair value of the debt in the table below differs from the carrying amount due to changes in interest rates based on the market conditions as of December31, 2004 and 2003.
Generally, the fair value of fixed rate debt will increase as interest rates fall and decrease as interest rates rise. 
The
fair values of the Company various derivative instruments, which are based on current market rates, generally reflect the estimated amounts that the Company would receive or pay to
terminate the contracts at the reporting date. 
80  The
carrying amounts and estimated fair values of the Company financial instruments at December31, 2004 and 2003 were as follows: 2004

carrying value and fair value of such debt includes adjustments due to interest rate swaps. See Note14. Credit and Market Risk 
Financial instruments, including derivatives, expose the Company to counterparty credit risk for nonperformance and to market risk related to changes in interest
or currency exchange rates. The Company manages its exposure to counterparty credit risk through specific minimum credit standards, diversification of counterparties, and procedures to monitor
concentrations of credit risk. The Company counterparties in derivative transactions are substantial investment and commercial banks with significant experience using such derivative instruments.
The Company monitors the impact of market risk on the fair value and cash flows of its derivative and other financial instruments considering reasonably possible changes in interest and currency
exchange rates and restricts the use of derivative financial instruments to hedging activities. The Company does not use derivative financial instruments for trading or other speculative purposes and
does not use leveraged derivative financial instruments. 
The
Company continually monitors the creditworthiness of its customers to which it grants credit terms in the normal course of business and generally does not require collateral.
Concentrations of credit risk associated with the Company trade accounts and notes receivable are considered minimal due to the Company diverse customer base. The terms and conditions of the
Company credit sales are designed to mitigate or eliminate concentrations of credit risk with any single customer. The Company sales are not materially dependent on a single customer or a small
group of customers.

723,415 Contingent Stock Plan and Directors Stock Plan 
The Company contingent stock plan provides for the grant to employees of awards to purchase common stock during the succeeding 60-day period. The
Organization and Compensation Committee of the Company Board of Directors has set the price to purchase the common stock pursuant to the grants at $100 per share, subject to appropriate adjustments
in the event of any stock dividend, split-up, recapitalization, merger, or other events affecting the Company common stock. Shares issued under the contingent stock plan are restricted
as to disposition by the holders for a period of at least three years after award. In the event of termination of employment prior to lapse of the restriction, the shares of contingent stock are
subject to a repurchase option by the Company at the price at which the shares were issued. This restriction lapses prior to the expiration of the vesting period if specified events occur that affect
the existence or control of the Company. The Company credits the aggregate fair value of contingent stock issued to the common stock and additional paid-in capital accounts and deducts the
unamortized portion of the compensation from shareholders' equity. The Company charges the excess of fair value over the award price of contingent stock to operations as compensation expense over a
three-year period on a straight-line basis. These charges are included in marketing, administrative and development expenses and amounted to $102million 82million, and $78million in 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively. The plan was amended in 2004 to permit tax withholding attributable to vested awards to be paid by withholding a
portion of the shares attributable to such awards. 
Non-cash
compensation in 2004, 2003 and 2002 comprises shares issued to non-employee directors in the form of awards under the Company 2002 Stock Plan for
Non-Employee Directors, which stockholders of the Company approved at the 2002 annual meeting. The 2002 Directors Stock Plan provides for annual grants of shares to
non-employee directors, and interim grants of shares to eligible 
82  directors
elected at times other than at an annual meeting, at a price per share equal to the par value of the shares, as all or part of the annual or interim retainer fees for
non-employee directors. During 2002, the Company adopted a plan that permits non-employee directors to elect to defer all or part of their annual retainer until the
non-employee director retires from the Board. The non-employee director can elect to defer the portion of the annual retainer payable in shares of stock. If a
non-employee director makes this election, the non-employee director may also elect to defer the portion, if any, of the annual retainer payable in cash. The Company charges
the excess of fair value over the price at which shares are issued under this plan to operations at the date of the grant. This charge is included in marketing, administrative and development expenses
and amounted to $03million in 2004, $03million in 2003 and $04million in 2002.

During 2004 the Company issued 50,000 shares of its common stock, par value $010 per share, to a non-employee under an intellectual property purchase agreement
as prepaid royalties under that agreement. These shares vest ratably over a five-year period. 
Amortization
expense related to the issuance of 60,000 and 50,000 shares in 2000 and 1999, respectively, of the Company common stock in exchange for non-employee consulting
services was $04million, $08million and $16million, in 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively. These shares vest ratably over a three-to five-year period.
The Company amortizes the cost associated with these shares on a straight-line basis. 
Redeemable Preferred StockSeriesA Convertible Preferred Stock 
On July18, 2003, the Company used cash of $1,2981million, including net proceeds of the Company July2003 senior notes offering of
$1,2611million, to redeem all the outstanding shares of its SeriesA convertible preferred stock at their redemption price of $5100 per share. The $5100 per share redemption price
included a $100 per share redemption premium, or $255million in the aggregate. The $255million paid for the redemption premium reduced shareholders' equity and net earnings ascribed
to common shareholders in 2003. 
83  
During 2003, prior to its redemption, the Company repurchased 750,600 shares of the Company convertible preferred stock at a cost of $367million,
representing a cost of $079million below book value. During 2002, the Company repurchased 782,500 shares of the convertible preferred stock at a cost of approximately $288million,
representing a cost of approximately $103million below book value. The Company recorded this excess of book value over the purchase price of the preferred stock as an increase to additional
paid-in-capital.

Stock option plans in which specified employees of the Cryovac packaging business participated were terminated effective March31, 1998 in connection with
the Cryovac transaction, except with respect to options that remained outstanding as of that date. All of these options had been granted at an exercise price equal to their fair market value on the
date of grant. Since 1997, the Company has not issued any stock option awards and has no plans to do so in the future. At December31, 2004, these options had per share exercise prices ranging
from $2234 to $4219, a weighted-average remaining contractual life of approximately 17years, and terms expiring up to March2007. During
2004, 2003 and 2002, the holders exercised options to purchase 33,136, 125,277 and 27,911 shares, respectively, with an aggregate exercise price of $11million 47million and $09million, respectively. At December31, 2004, 2003 and 2002, the cumulative number of options to purchase 46,820, 45,648 and 23,763 shares of common stock,
respectively, had expired. At December31, 2004, 2003 and 2002, options to purchase 154,522, 188,830 and 335,992 shares of common stock, respectively, were outstanding at average per share
exercise prices of $4071, $3936 and $3866, respectively.

Basic earnings loss per common share were $256 for 2004, $221 for 2003 and $420 for 2002. Diluted earnings loss per common share were $225 for 2004 197 for 2003 and $430 for 2002. 
During
2004, the EITF reached a consensus on EITF Issue No04-08, The Effect of Contingently Convertible Debt on Diluted Earnings per Share, which was effective for
reporting periods ending after December15, 2004. EITF Issue No04-08 requires that the dilutive effect of contingent convertible debt, such as the Company 3% convertible
senior notes due June2033, which were issued in July2003, be included in dilutive earnings per common share regardless of whether the contingency permitting holders to convert the debt
into shares of common stock had been satisfied. EITF Issue No04-08 is applicable retroactively and requires restatement of prior periods during which the contingent convertible
debt instrument was outstanding. As a result, the 2004 and 2003 diluted earnings per common share calculations include 62million additional shares of common stock and exclude the associated
interest expense of $78million and $39million, respectively, on the contingent convertible debt, net of income tax. 
The
diluted earnings per common share for 2003 includes a $026 per common share charge related to the Company redemption of all of its outstanding shares of SeriesA
convertible preferred stock on July18, 2003. The Company redeemed all of the outstanding shares of its SeriesA convertible preferred stock at a redemption price of $5100 per share.
The Company also paid accrued dividends on the preferred stock from July1, 2003 through July17, 2003 in the aggregate amount of $240million. The $5100 per share redemption
price included a $100 per share redemption premium, or an aggregate premium of $255million and is reflected in basic earnings per common share in 2003. 
85  The
basic earnings per common share calculations for 2003 and 2002 include gains of $08million and $103million, respectively, attributable to the repurchase of
preferred stock. The Company did not recognize any such gains for 2004 since it had redeemed all shares of its outstanding preferred stock during the third quarter of 2003. 
For
the purpose of calculating its diluted loss per common share for 2002, net earnings ascribed to common shareholders have been adjusted to exclude the gains attributable to the
repurchase of preferred stock and to add back dividends attributable to such repurchased preferred stock and the weighted average common shares outstanding also have been adjusted to reflect
conversion of the shares of preferred stock repurchased during this period in accordance with the FASB Emerging Issues Task Force Topic D-53 guidance. 
In
calculating diluted earnings per common share, the Company calculation of the weighted average number of common shares for 2004 and 2003 provides for the conversion of the Company
3% convertible senior notes due June2033 due to the application of EITF Issue No04-08, provides for the issuance of nine million shares of common stock reserved for the
Company previously announced asbestos settlement as described in Note19 to the Consolidated Financial Statements under the caption Asbestos Settlement and Related Costs, and provides for
the exercise of dilutive stock options, net of assumed treasury stock repurchases. For 2002, the calculation of weighted average number of common shares provides for the effect of the weighted average
conversion of repurchased shares of preferred stock. The Company has not assumed the conversion of the outstanding preferred stock in the calculation of diluted loss per common share in 2002, because
the treatment of the preferred stock as the common stock into which it was convertible would have been anti-dilutive, meaning the issuance would reduce the loss per common share. The
Company did not reflect the shares of common stock reserved for issuance for the asbestos settlement in the calculation of diluted loss per common share in 2002, since the effect would have been
anti-dilutive.

Asbestos Settlement and Related Costs 
On November27, 2002, the Company reached an agreement in principle with the Committees appointed to represent asbestos claimants in the bankruptcy case of
W. R. Grace Co., known as Grace, to resolve all current and future asbestos-related claims made against the Company and its affiliates in connection with the Cryovac transaction described
below. The settlement will also resolve the fraudulent transfer claims, as well as indemnification claims by Fresenius Medical Care Holdings,Inc. and affiliated companies, that had been made
against the Company in connection with the Cryovac transaction. On December3, 2002, the agreement in principle was approved by the 
87  Company
Board of Directors. The Company received notice that both of the Committees had approved the agreement in principle as of December5, 2002. For a description of the Cryovac
Transaction, asbestos-related claims and the parties involved, see Cryovac Transaction and Contingencies Related to the Cryovac Transaction below. The
Company recorded a charge of $8501million as a result of the asbestos settlement in its consolidated statement of operations as of December31, 2002. The charge
consisted of the following items: a
non-cash charge of $5125million covering a cash payment that the Company will be required under the settlement to make upon the effectiveness of a
plan of reorganization in the Grace bankruptcy. Because the Company cannot predict when a plan of reorganization may become effective, the Company recorded this liability as a current liability on the
consolidated balance sheet at December31, 2002. Under the terms of the settlement, this amount accrues interest at a 55% annual rate from December21, 2002 to the date of payment. The
Company has recorded this interest in interest expense in the consolidated statement of operations and in other current liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets. The accrued interest, which is
compounded annually, was $589million and $290million at December31, 2004 and 2003, respectively.
a
non-cash charge of $3215million representing the fair market value at the date the Company recorded the charge of nine million shares of the Company
common stock expected to be issued under the settlement upon the effectiveness of Grace plan of reorganization. These shares are subject to customary anti-dilution provisions that adjust
for the effects of stock splits, stock dividends and other events affecting the Company common stock. The fair market value of the Company common stock was $3572 per share as of the close of
business on December5, 2002. The Company recorded this amount in its consolidated balance sheet at December31, 2002 as follows: $09million representing the aggregate par value
of these shares in common stock reserved for issuance related to the asbestos settlement, and the remaining
$3206million, representing the excess of the aggregate fair market value over the aggregate par value of these common shares, in additional paid-in capital. The
December31, 2004 and 2003 diluted earnings per common share calculation reflects the shares of common stock reserved for issuance related to the asbestos settlement.
$161million
of legal and related fees as of December31, 2002. Asbestos
settlement and related costs in 2004 and 2003 reflected legal and related fees for asbestos-related matters of $20million and $28million, respectively. 
Cryovac Transaction 
On March31, 1998, the Company completed a multi-step transaction that brought the Cryovac packaging business and the former Sealed Air
Corporation business under the common ownership of the Company. These businesses operate as subsidiaries of the Company, and the Company acts as a holding company. As part of that transaction, the
parties separated the Cryovac packaging business, which previously had been held by various direct and indirect subsidiaries of the Company, from the remaining businesses previously held by the
Company. The parties then arranged for the contribution 
88  of
these remaining businesses to a company now known as W. R. Grace Co., and the Company distributed the Grace shares to the Company stockholders. As a result, W. R. Grace Co.
became a separate publicly owned company. The Company recapitalized its outstanding shares of common stock into a new common stock and a new convertible preferred stock. A subsidiary of the Company
then merged into the former Sealed Air, which became a subsidiary of the Company and changed its name to Sealed Air Corporation US. 
Contingencies Related to the Cryovac Transaction 
In connection with the Cryovac transaction, Grace and its subsidiaries retained all liabilities arising out of their operations before the Cryovac transaction,
whether accruing or occurring before or after the Cryovac transaction, other than liabilities arising from or relating to Cryovac operations. Among the liabilities retained by Grace are liabilities
relating to asbestos-containing products previously manufactured or sold by Grace subsidiaries prior to the Cryovac transaction, including its primary
U.S. operating subsidiary, W. R. Grace Co.Conn., which has operated for decades and has been a subsidiary of Grace since the Cryovac transaction. The Cryovac transaction
agreements provided that, should any claimant seek to hold the Company or any of its subsidiaries responsible for liabilities retained by Grace or its subsidiaries, including the asbestos-related
liabilities, Grace and its subsidiaries would indemnify and defend the Company. 
Since
the beginning of 2000, the Company has been served with a number of lawsuits alleging that, as a result of the Cryovac transaction, the Company is responsible for alleged asbestos
liabilities of Grace and its subsidiaries, some of which were also named as co-defendants in some of these actions. Among these lawsuits are several purported class actions and a number of
personal injury lawsuits. Some plaintiffs seek damages for personal injury or wrongful death, while others seek medical monitoring, environmental remediation or remedies related to an attic insulation
product. Neither the former Sealed Air nor Cryovac ever produced or sold any of the asbestos-containing materials that are the subjects of these cases. None of these cases has reached resolution
through judgment, settlement or otherwise. As discussed below, Grace Chapter 11 bankruptcy proceeding has stayed all these cases. 
While
the allegations in these actions directed to the Company vary, these actions all appear to allege that the transfer of the Cryovac business as part of the Cryovac transaction was a
fraudulent transfer or gave rise to successor liability. Under a theory of successor liability, plaintiffs with claims against Grace and its subsidiaries may attempt to hold the Company liable for
liabilities that arose with respect to activities conducted prior to the Cryovac transaction by W. R. Grace Co.Conn. or other Grace subsidiaries. A transfer would be a fraudulent
transfer if the transferor received less than reasonably equivalent value and the transferor was insolvent or was rendered insolvent by the transfer, was engaged or was about to engage in a business
for which its assets constitute unreasonably small capital, or intended to incur or believed that it would incur debts beyond its ability to pay as they mature. A transfer may also be fraudulent if it
was made with actual intent to hinder, delay or defraud creditors. If a court found any transfers in connection with the Cryovac transaction to be fraudulent transfers, the Company could be required
to return the property or its value to the transferor or could be required to fund liabilities of Grace or its subsidiaries for the benefit of their creditors, including asbestos claimants. The
Company has reached an agreement in principle and subsequently signed a settlement agreement, described below, that will resolve all these claims. 
89  In
the Joint Proxy Statement furnished to their respective stockholders in connection with the Cryovac transaction, both parties to the transaction stated that it was their belief that
Grace and its subsidiaries were adequately capitalized and would be adequately capitalized after the Cryovac transaction and that none of the transfers contemplated to occur in the Cryovac transaction
would be a fraudulent transfer. They also stated their belief that the Cryovac transaction complied with other relevant laws. However, if a court applying the relevant legal standards had reached
conclusions adverse to the Company, these determinations could have had a materially adverse effect on the Company consolidated financial position and results of operations. 
On
April2, 2001, Grace and a number of its subsidiaries filed petitions for reorganization under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code in the U.S. Bankruptcy Court in the
District of Delaware. Grace stated that the filing was made in response to a sharply increasing number of asbestos claims since 1999. In
connection with its Chapter 11 filing, Grace filed an application with the Bankruptcy Court seeking to stay, among others, all actions brought against the Company and specified
subsidiaries related to alleged asbestos liabilities of Grace and its subsidiaries or alleging fraudulent transfer claims. The court issued an order dated May3, 2001, which was modified on
January22, 2002, under which the court stayed all the filed or pending asbestos actions against the Company and, upon filing and service on the Company, all future asbestos actions. No further
proceedings involving the Company can occur in the actions that have been stayed except upon further order of the Bankruptcy Court. Committees
appointed to represent asbestos claimants in Grace bankruptcy case received the court permission to pursue fraudulent transfer and other claims against the Company and its
subsidiary Cryovac,Inc., and against Fresenius, as discussed below. The claims against Fresenius are based upon a 1996 transaction between Fresenius and W. R. Grace
Co.Conn. Fresenius is not affiliated with the Company. In March2002, the court ordered that the issues of the solvency of Grace following the Cryovac transaction and whether Grace
received reasonably equivalent value in the Cryovac transaction would be tried on behalf of all of Grace creditors. This proceeding is pending in the U.S. District Court for the District of Delaware
Adv. No02-02210. 
In
June2002, the court permitted the U.S. government to intervene as a plaintiff in the fraudulent transfer proceeding, so that the U.S. government could pursue allegations that
remediation expenses were underestimated or omitted in the solvency analyses of Grace conducted at the time of the Cryovac transaction. The court also permitted Grace, which asserted that the Cryovac
transaction was not a fraudulent transfer, to intervene in the proceeding. In July2002, the court issued an interim ruling on the legal standards to be applied in the trial, holding, among
other things, that, subject to specified limitations, post-1998 claims should be considered in the solvency analysis of Grace. The Company believes that only claims and liabilities that
were known, or reasonably should have been known, at the time of the 1998 Cryovac transaction should be considered under the applicable standard. 
With
the fraudulent transfer trial set to commence on December9, 2002, on November27, 2002, the Company reached an agreement in principle with the Committees prosecuting
the claims against the Company and Cryovac,Inc., to resolve all current and future asbestos-related claims arising from the Cryovac transaction. On the same day, the court entered an order
confirming that the parties had reached an amicable resolution of the disputes among the parties and that counsel for the Company 
90  and
the Committees had agreed and bound the parties to the terms of the agreement in principle. As discussed above, the agreement in principle calls for payment of nine million shares of Sealed Air
common stock and $5125million in cash, plus interest on the cash payment at a 55% annual rate starting on December21, 2002 and ending on the effective date of the Grace plan of
reorganization, when the Company is required to make the payment. These shares are subject to customary anti-dilution provisions that adjust for the effects of stock splits, stock
dividends and other events affecting the Company common stock. On December3, 2002, the Company Board of Directors approved the agreement in principle. The Company received notice that both
of the Committees had approved the agreement in principle as of December5, 2002. The parties subsequently signed a definitive settlement agreement as of November10, 2003 consistent
with the terms of the agreement in principle. On November26, 2003, the parties jointly presented the definitive settlement agreement to the U.S. District Court for the District of Delaware for
approval. On Grace motion to the U.S. District Court, that court transferred the motion to approve the settlement agreement to the Bankruptcy Court for disposition. After approval of the agreement,
the agreement will eventually be incorporated into Grace plan of reorganization and, assuming approval by Grace creditors as part of the approval of the plan of reorganization, will then be
implemented. The court has not yet addressed the joint motion to approve the definitive settlement agreement. Grace has stated in recent court filings that it does not plan to object to the definitive
settlement agreement, but others, including other creditors of Grace, may do so. On
June8, 2004, the Company filed a motion with the U.S. District Court for the District of Delaware, where the fraudulent transfer trial was pending, requesting that the court
vacate the July2002 interim ruling on the legal standards to be applied relating to the fraudulent transfer claims against the Company. The Company was not challenging the definitive
settlement agreement. The motion was filed as a protective measure in the event that the settlement agreement is ultimately not approved or implemented; however, the Company still expects that the
settlement agreement will become effective upon the court approval and Grace emergence from bankruptcy with a plan of reorganization that is consistent with the terms of the settlement agreement. As
a condition to the Company obligation to make the payments required by the settlement, Grace plan of reorganization must be consistent with the terms of the settlement, including
provisions for the trusts and releases referred to below and for an injunction barring the prosecution of any asbestos-related claims against the Company and its affiliates. In that case, the
settlement will provide that, upon the effective date of Grace plan of reorganization and payment of the shares and cash, all present and future asbestos-related claims against the Company and its
affiliates that arise from alleged asbestos liabilities of Grace and its affiliates including former affiliates that became affiliates of the Company through the Cryovac transaction will be
channeled to and become the responsibility of one or more trusts to be established under Section524g of the Bankruptcy Code as part of Grace plan of reorganization. The settlement will
also resolve all fraudulent transfer claims against the Company and its affiliates arising from the Cryovac transaction as well as the Fresenius claims described below. The settlement will provide
that the Company and its affiliates will receive releases of all those claims upon payment. Under the agreement, the Company cannot seek indemnity from Grace for the Company payments required by the
settlement. The Company expects that the order approving the settlement agreement will also provide that the stay of proceedings involving the Company described above will continue through the
effective date of Grace plan of reorganization, after which the 
91  Company
will be released from the liabilities asserted in those proceedings and their continued prosecution against the Company will be enjoined. 
In
January2005, Grace filed a proposed plan of reorganization and related documents with the Bankruptcy Court. There were a number of objections filed, and the Company does not
know whether the final plan will be consistent with the terms of the settlement agreement or if the other conditions to the Company obligation to pay the settlement amount will be met. If these
conditions are not satisfied or not waived by the Company, the Company will not be obligated to pay the settlement amount. However, if the Company does not pay the settlement amount, the Company and
its affiliates will not be released from the various asbestos-related, fraudulent transfer, and indemnification claims made against them, and all of these claims would remain pending and would have to
be resolved through other means, such as through agreement on alternative settlement terms or trials. The Company also cannot predict when a final plan of reorganization will become effective in
Grace bankruptcy. 
In
January2002, the Company filed a declaratory judgment action against Fresenius Medical Care Holdings,Inc., its parent, Fresenius AG, a German company, and specified
affiliates in New York State court asking the court to resolve a contract dispute between the parties. The Fresenius parties contended that the Company was obligated to indemnify them for liabilities
that they might incur as a result of the 1996 Fresenius transaction mentioned above. The Fresenius parties' contention was based on their interpretation of the agreements between them and W. R.
Grace Co.Conn. in connection with the 1996 Fresenius transaction. In February2002, the Fresenius parties announced that they had accrued a charge of $1720million
for these potential liabilities, which included pre-transaction tax liabilities of Grace and the costs of defense of litigation arising from Grace Chapter 11 filing. The Company believed
that it was not responsible to indemnify the Fresenius parties under the 1996 agreements and filed the action to proceed to a resolution of the Fresenius parties' claims. In April2002, the
Fresenius parties filed a motion to dismiss the action and for entry of declaratory relief in its favor. The Company opposed the motion, and in July2003, the court denied the motion without
prejudice in view of the November27, 2002 agreement in principle referred to above. As noted above, under the settlement agreement, there will be mutual releases exchanged between the
Fresenius parties and the Company releasing any and all claims related to the 1996 Fresenius transaction. 
In
November2004, the Company Canadian subsidiary Sealed Air Canada Co./Cie learned that it had been named a defendant in the case of Thundersky v. The
Attorney General of Canada, et al. File No. CI04-01-39818, which is pending in the Manitoba Court of Queen Bench. Grace and W. R. Grace
Co.Conn. are also named as defendants. The claim is brought as a putative class proceeding and seeks recovery for alleged injuries suffered by any Canadian resident, other than in the
course of employment, as a result of Grace marketing, selling, processing, manufacturing, distributing and/or delivering asbestos or asbestos-containing products in Canada. In January 2005, Grace
and W. R. Grace Co.Conn. agreed to defend, indemnify and hold harmless the Company and its affiliates in respect of any liability and expense, including legal fees and costs, in
this action. Grace proposed plan of reorganization provides that these claims will be paid by the trusts to be established under Section524g of the Bankruptcy Code as part of Grace plan
of reorganization, and it is anticipated that the defendants will ask the Canadian courts to enforce the terms of the plan of reorganization. Grace Canada,Inc. has previously obtained an order
in the Ontario Superior Court of Justice 
92  recognizing
the Grace Chapter 11 proceeding under the Canadian Companies' Creditors Arrangement Act. 
In
view of Grace Chapter 11 filing, the Company may receive additional claims asserting that the Company is liable for obligations that Grace had agreed to retain in the Cryovac
transaction and for which the Company may be contingently liable. To date, no material additional claims have been asserted or threatened against the Company. 
Final
determinations and accountings under the Cryovac transaction agreements with respect to matters pertaining to the transaction had not been completed at the time of Grace Chapter
11 filing in 2001. The Company has filed claims in the bankruptcy proceeding that reflect the costs and liabilities that it has incurred or may incur that Grace and its affiliates agreed to retain or
that are subject to indemnification by Grace and its affiliates under the Cryovac transaction agreements, other than payments to be made under the settlement agreement. Grace has alleged that the
Company is responsible for specified amounts under the Cryovac transaction agreements. Any amounts for which the Company may be liable to Grace may be used to offset the liabilities of Grace and its
affiliates to the Company. The Company intends to seek indemnification by Grace and its affiliates for defense costs related to asbestos and fraudulent transfer litigation and the Fresenius claims,
and approximately $81million paid by the Company on account of its guaranty of debt issued by W. R. Grace Co.Conn. Except to the extent of any potential setoff or
similar claim, the Company expects that its claims will be as an unsecured creditor of Grace. Since portions of the Company claims against Grace and its affiliates are contingent or unliquidated,
the Company cannot determine the amount of the Company claims, the extent to which these claims may be reduced by setoff, how much of the claims may be allowed, or the amount of the Company
recovery on these claims, if any, in the bankruptcy proceeding. 
On
September15, 2003, the case of Senn v. Hickey, et al. Case No03-CV-4372 was filed in the
U.S. District Court for the District of New Jersey Newark. This lawsuit seeks class action status on behalf of all persons who purchased or otherwise acquired securities of the Company during the
period from March27, 2000 through July30, 2002. The lawsuit names the Company and specified current and former officers and directors of the Company as defendants. The Company is
required to provide indemnification to the other defendants, and accordingly the Company counsel is also defending them. On June29, 2004, the court granted plaintiff Miles Senn motion for
appointment as lead plaintiff and for approval of his choice of lead counsel. The plaintiff amended complaint makes a number of allegations against the defendants. The principal allegations are that
during the above period the defendants materially misled the investing public, artificially inflated the price of the Company common stock by publicly issuing false and misleading statements and
violated US GAAP by failing to properly account and accrue for the Company contingent liability for asbestos claims arising from past operations of Grace. The plaintiffs seek compensatory damages
and other relief. The Company intends to vigorously defend the lawsuit, since the Company believes that it properly disclosed its contingent liability for Grace asbestos claims. Although the Company
currently believes that it should have no liability in this lawsuit, until the lawsuit has progressed beyond its current preliminary stage, the Company cannot estimate the potential cost of an
unfavorable outcome, if any. 
93  Leases 
The Company is obligated under the terms of various leases covering primarily warehouse and office facilities and production equipment, as well as smaller
manufacturing sites that it occupies. The Company accounts for substantially all of its leases as operating leases. Net rental expense was $282million, $270million and
$243million for 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively. Estimated future minimum annual rental commitments under noncancelable real and personal property leases are as follows:
2005$276million; 2006$229million; 2007$160million; 2008$96million; 2009$57million; and
subsequent years$123million. 
Long-Term Commitments 
The Company has the following significant long-term commitments: 150million
remaining obligation for the purchase of equipment over a five-year period which began in 2003, together with a potential termination fee in
an amount to be determined. The Company obligation is reduced or increased based on market price changes for the equipment and changes in the Packaging Machinery Manufacturers Index. Estimated
future minimum annual commitments are as follows: 2005$45million; 2006$50million; and 2007$55million. Failure to purchase any of the
minimum annual requirements in any year obligates the Company to pay an amount of 45% of such shortfall. During 2004 and 2003, the Company did not meet the minimum equipment purchase requirements and
recorded a charge of $09million and $10million, respectively.
$105million
minimum remaining commitment for the purchase of telecommunications and network capacity and services over a four-year period that began in
2004.
$73million
to a supplier if the Company fails to purchase an additional 1095million pounds of specified raw materials, at the then current market price,
over a ten-year period that ends in May2012. The amount of the potential contingent payment declines in proportion to the Company purchase of minimum quantities required under
the contract. At December31, 2004, the Company purchases satisfied the minimum quantity requirements under the agreement.
$16million
to a supplier of equipment and consumables declining to $03million over the five-year term of the commitment if the Company fails
to purchase approximately $65million of consumables per year over a five-year period that began in 2004.
31million
euros $41million at December31, 2004 to a supplier of electricity over a two-year period that began in 2004. Environmental Matters 
The Company is subject to loss contingencies resulting from environmental laws and regulations, and it accrues for anticipated costs associated with investigatory
and remediation efforts when an assessment has indicated that a loss is probable and can be reasonably estimated. These accruals do not take into account any discounting for the time value of money
and are not reduced by potential insurance recoveries, if any. The Company does not believe that it is reasonably possible that its liability in excess of the amounts that it has accrued for
environmental matters will be material to its 
94  consolidated
statements of operations, balance sheets or cash flows. Environmental liabilities are reassessed whenever circumstances become better defined or remediation efforts and their costs can be
better estimated. 
The
Company evaluates these liabilities periodically based on available information, including the progress of remedial investigations at each site, the current status of discussions
with regulatory authorities regarding the methods and extent of remediation and the apportionment of costs among
potentially responsible parties. As some of these issues are decided the outcomes of which are subject to uncertainties or new sites are assessed and costs can be reasonably estimated, the Company
adjusts the recorded accruals, as necessary. The Company believes that these exposures are not material to its consolidated results of operations and balance sheets. The Company believes that it has
adequately reserved for all probable and estimable environmental exposures. 
Note20New Accounting Pronouncements 
Recently Issued Statements of Financial Accounting Standards, Accounting Guidance and Disclosure Requirements 
In December2004, the FASB issued FASB Staff Position No. FAS109-1, Application of FASB Statement No109, Accounting for
Income Taxes, to the Tax Deduction on Qualified Production Activities Provided by the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004, indicating that this deduction should be accounted for as a special deduction
in accordance with the provisions of SFAS No109. Beginning in 2005 as qualifying activity occurs, the Company will recognize the allowable deductions through its effective tax rate at that
time. 
In
December2004, the FASB issued Staff Position No. FAS109-2, Accounting and Disclosure Guidance for the Foreign Earnings Repatriation Provision within the
American Jobs Creation Act of 2004, which provides a practical exception to the SFAS No109 requirement to reflect the effect of a new tax law in the period of enactment by allowing
additional time beyond the financial reporting period to evaluate the effects on plans for reinvestment or repatriation of unremitted foreign earnings. See Note10, Income Taxes, for the
required disclosures. 
In
December2004, the FASB issued SFAS No123 revised, Share-Based Payment. Statement123 revised replaces SFAS No123, Accounting for Stock-Based
Compensation, and supersedes APB Opinion No25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees. Statement 123 revised covers a wide range of share-based compensation arrangements and requires
that the compensation cost related to these types of payment transactions be recognized in financial statements. Cost will be measured based on the fair value of the equity or liability instruments
issued. Statement 123 revised becomes effective for periods starting after June15, 2005. The adoption of SFAS No123 revised will not have an impact on the 2005 consolidated
financial statements as the amounts currently recognized by the Company under its contingent stock plan would essentially be the same. 
In
November2004, the FASB issued SFAS No151, Inventory Costs, which amends the guidance in ARB No43, Chapter 4, Inventory Pricing. This amendment clarifies
the accounting for abnormal amounts of idle facility expense, freight, handling costs and wasted material spoilage. SFAS No151 requires that those items be recognized as current-period
charges regardless of whether they meet the criteria specified in ARB 43 of so abnormal. In addition, SFAS No151 requires that allocation of 
95  fixed
production overheads to the costs of conversion be based on normal capacity of the production facilities. SFAS No151 is effective for financial statements for fiscal years beginning
after June15, 2005. The Company is currently assessing the impact of SFAS No151 on its consolidated financial statements. 
In
December2003, the FASB issued FASB Interpretation No. FIN 46 revised December2003, Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities, which addresses how a business
enterprise should evaluate whether it has a controlling financial interest in an entity through means other than voting rights and, accordingly, should consolidate the entity. FIN 46R replaced FIN 46,
Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities, which was issued in January2003. The Company was required to apply FIN 46R to variable interests in VIEs created after December31, 2003.
For variable interests in VIEs created before January1, 2004, the Interpretation will be applied beginning on January1, 2005. For any VIEs that must be consolidated under FIN 46R that
were created before January1, 2004, the assets, liabilities, and noncontrolling interests of the VIE initially would be measured at their carrying amounts with any difference between the net
amount added to the balance sheet and any previously recognized interest being recognized as the cumulative effect of an accounting change. If determining the carrying amounts is not practicable, fair
value at the date FIN 46R first applies may be used to measure the assets, liabilities and noncontrolling interest of the VIE. The adoption of FIN 46R did not have any impact on the 2004 consolidated
financial statements.

3During
2004, the EITF reached a consensus on EITF Issue No04-08, The Effect of Contingently Convertible Debt on Diluted Earnings per Share, which was effective
for reporting periods ending after December15, 2004. EITF Issue No04-08 requires that the dilutive effect of contingent convertible debt, such as the Company 3%
convertible senior notes due June2033, which were issued in July2003, be included in dilutive earnings per common share regardless of whether the contingency permitting holders to
convert the debt into shares of common stock had been satisfied. The 2004 and 2003 diluted earnings per common share calculation includes additional shares of common stock and excludes the associated
interest expense, net of income tax. EITF Issue No04-08 was applied on a retroactive basis and requires restatement of prior periods presented during which the contingent
convertible debt instrument was outstanding.

Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
The Company maintains disclosure controls and procedures, as defined in Rule13a-15 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, that
are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in the Company reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the
time periods specified in the Securities and Exchange Commission rules and forms and that the Company employees accumulate this information and communicate it to the Company management,
including its Chief Executive Officer its principal executive officer and its Chief Financial Officer its principal financial officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding the
required disclosure. In designing and evaluating the disclosure controls and procedures, management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide
only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives, and management necessarily must apply its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible controls
and procedures. 
Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
As of the end of the period covered by this report, the Company carried out an evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operation of the Company
disclosure controls and procedures under Rule13a-15. The Company management, including the Company Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, supervised and
participated in this evaluation. Based upon that evaluation, the Company Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that the Company disclosure controls and procedures were
effective. Management Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
The Company management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as such term is defined in
Rule13a-15f under the Exchange Act. The management of the Company evaluated, with the participation of its Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, the effectiveness,
as of the end of its 2004 fiscal year, of the Company internal control over financial reporting. The suitable recognized control framework on which management evaluation of the Company internal
control over financial reporting is based is the Internal ControlIntegrated Framework established and distributed for public comment by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the
Treadway Commission COSO. Based upon that evaluation under the COSO framework, the Company management concluded that its internal control over financial reporting as of the end of its 2004 fiscal
year was effective. The independent registered public accounting firm that audited the financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form10-K, KPMG LLP, has issued an
attestation report on management assessment of the Company internal control over financial reporting. KPMG attestation report is included below in this Annual Report on
Form10-K. 
Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm 
The
Board of Directors and Shareholders of Sealed Air Corporation: 
We
have audited management assessment, included in the accompanying Management Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting, that Sealed Air Corporation maintained effective
internal control over financial reporting as of December31, 2004, based on criteria established in Internal ControlIntegrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring
Organizations of the Treadway Commission COSO. Sealed Air Corporation management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the
effectiveness of internal 
98  control
over financial reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on management assessment and an opinion on the effectiveness of Sealed Air Corporation internal control over financial
reporting based on our audit. 
We
conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board United States. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to
obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control
over financial reporting, evaluating management assessment, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control, and performing such other procedures as we considered
necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion. 
A
company internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of
financial statements for external purposes in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. A company internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and
procedures that 1pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company;
2provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, and
that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and 3provide reasonable assurance regarding
prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. 
Because
of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future
periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. 
In
our opinion, management assessment that Sealed Air Corporation maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of December31, 2004, is fairly stated, in
all material respects, based on criteria established in Internal ControlIntegrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission COSO. Also,
in our opinion, Sealed Air Corporation maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December31, 2004, based on criteria established in
Internal ControlIntegrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission COSO. We
also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board United States, the consolidated balance sheets of Sealed Air Corporation and
subsidiaries as of December31, 2004 and, 2003, and the related consolidated statements of operations, shareholders' equity, cash flows and comprehensive income loss for each of the years in
the three-year period ended December31, 2004, and the related consolidated financial statement schedule and our report dated March21, 2005, expressed an unqualified opinion
on those consolidated financial statements.  KPMG
