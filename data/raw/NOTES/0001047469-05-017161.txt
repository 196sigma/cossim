Accelrys, Inc. Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements    
1.Organization and Description of Business 
Accelrys,Inc. through its wholly owned subsidiaries the Company is a provider of software for computation, simulation, and the management and mining of
scientific data used by biologists, chemists and materials scientists, including nanotechnology researchers, for product design as well as drug discovery and development. The Company technology and
services are designed to meet the needs of research organizations. 
On
April1, 2004, the Company changed its fiscal year end from December31 to March31. 
On
April30, 2004, the Company spun off our drug discovery subsidiary, Pharmacopeia Drug Discovery,Inc. PDD, which integrates proprietary small molecule combinatorial
and medicinal chemistry, high-throughput screening, in-vitro pharmacology, computational methods and informatics to discover and optimize lead compounds and drug candidates.
The spin-off of PDD resulted in PDD becoming an independent, separately traded, publicly held company. This was accomplished through the distribution to the Company stockholders of a
dividend of one share of PDD common stock for every two shares of Accelrys common stock. In accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No144, Accounting for the Impairment
or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets, the Company has reclassified PDD current and prior period results of operations, assets and liabilities as discontinued operations in the financial
statements. Further, the following footnotes exclude results of operations, assets and liabilities of PDD. 
On
May11, 2004, the Company shareholders approved the change of the Company name to Accelrys,Inc. from Pharmacopeia,Inc. On
September27, 2004, the Company acquired all of the outstanding common stock of Scitegic,Inc. Footnote 4. 
2.Significant Accounting Policies 
Principles of Consolidation 
These consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Accelrys,Inc. and its subsidiaries. All intercompany balances and transactions have been
eliminated in consolidation. 
Cash and Cash Equivalents 
The Company considers all highly liquid investments with an original maturity of three months or less to be cash equivalents. The Company invests its cash with
financial institutions in money market funds, United States Treasury securities and other investment grade securities such as prime-rated commercial paper. 
Marketable Securities 
Marketable securities consist of fixed-income investments with an original maturity of greater than three months such as United States Treasury securities,
obligations of United States Government agencies and other investment grade securities such as prime-rated commercial paper and corporate bonds. The Company accounts for investments in marketable
securities in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No115 Accounting for Certain Investments in Debt and Equity Securities SFAS115. The Company marketable
securities are classified as available-for-sale and are recorded at estimated fair value with unrealized gains or losses reported in accumulated comprehensive 
48  income
in stockholders' equity. Based on a review of the marketable securities at March31, 2005, the Company does not believe that any declines in fair market value are
other-than-temporary. 
Marketable
securities, including the restricted cash balance which is invested in marketable securities, consisted of the following in thousands: March 31, 2005

marketable securities by contractual maturity at March31, 2005 are as follows in thousands: Due within one year 11,929 Due after one year through four years 27,365 Total 39,294 Property and Equipment 
Property and equipment is stated at cost. Depreciation is provided on the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the related assets,
which range from two to ten years. Assets under capital leases are amortized over their estimated useful life or the applicable lease period, whichever period is shorter. The Company amortizes
leasehold improvements over the shorter of their estimated useful lives or the remaining term of the related lease. Repair and maintenance costs are charged to expense as incurred. Advertising Costs 
The cost of advertising is expensed as incurred. The Company incurred $01million, $03million, and $02million in advertising costs
during the twelve months ended March31, 2005, December31, 2003 and December31, 2002 and $43thousand and $44thousand during the three months ended
March31, 2004 and 2003 unaudited, respectively. 
Product Development Costs 
In accordance with SFAS No86, Accounting for the Cost of Computer Software to be Sold, Leased or Otherwise Marketed SFAS 86, costs incurred in the
research and development of new software products and significant enhancements to existing software products are expensed as incurred until technological feasibility of the product has been
established. After technological feasibility has been established, production costs, such as programming and testing, are capitalized until general release of the product. 
Capitalized
costs are stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value. The Company amortizes capitalized costs on a straight-line basis over the estimated product life,
not to exceed three years from the date on which the product is available for general release. The estimated product life may be reduced based on obsolescence or other factors, which could affect the
carrying value of capitalized software and result in changes to operating results. 
49  Shipping Costs 
The cost of shipping is expensed as incurred and included in cost of revenue. The Company incurred $07million, $09million, and
$10million in shipping costs during the twelve months ended March31, 2005, December31, 2003 and December31, 2002 and $02million and $03million during
the three months ended March31, 2004 and 2003 unaudited, respectively. 
Foreign Currency Translation 
The Company translates the financial statements of its foreign operations in accordance with SFAS No52, Foreign Currency Translation SFAS 52. The
financial statements of the Company international operations are translated into United States dollars the Company functional currency using period-end exchange rates for assets and
liabilities and average exchange rates during the period for revenues and expenses. Cumulative translation gains and losses are excluded from results of operations and recorded as a separate component
of comprehensive income loss within stockholders' equity. Gains and losses resulting from foreign currency transactions are included in interest and other income/expense in the consolidated
statement of operations. 
Concentrations of Risk 
The Company international sales are generally denominated in foreign currencies. Conversion of foreign-denominated receivables into Unites States dollars could
have a material adverse effect on the Company results of operations. The Company conducts business in Europe and in the Asia/Pacific region, primarily in Japan. Any significant decline in the
economies or the value of the currencies in these regions could have a material adverse impact on the Company. 
Use of Estimates 
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that
affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. Actual future results could differ from those estimates. 
Revenue Recognition 
The Company recognizes software license revenue upon delivery if no significant obligations remain deliverable to the customer, the sales contract fee is fixed or
determinable, amounts are due within one year and collection is probable, and when no material uncertainties regarding customer acceptance exist. Customer payments received in connection with license
sales are recorded as deferred revenue until such time as all of the above criteria are met. Prepaid post-contract support and maintenance PCS revenue bundled with software license
agreements is unbundled and deferred based on objective, vendor specific evidence. Software license revenue on annual contracts and PCS revenue is recognized pro-rata over the related
service period, which is generally one
year. Software license revenue for perpetual contracts is recognized up-front. Consulting and training fees are recognized upon rendering of service. Support revenues are recognized
ratably over the applicable contract periods or as services are performed. Revenue from multiple-element arrangements is allocated to each individual element based on vendor specific objective
evidence. Amounts billed but not yet recognized as revenue, and other payments received prior to recognition of revenue, are recorded as deferred revenue. 
The
Company also earns software revenue under consortia agreements wherein several unrelated parties enter into a joint software development agreement. These agreements are generally one
to three years in length, require an annual membership fee, and contain best efforts development milestones. Customers receive a consortium membership and are required to license specified 
50  prerequisite
software modules. Consortium fees associated with consortium membership are recognized on a straight-line basis over the term of the agreement. The Company is not required to
deliver specified products under the agreements and the consortium fees are generally non-refundable. If the Company is successful in developing software under a consortia agreement as
described above, a non-transferable license is typically awarded to the consortium members. 
Allowance for Doubtful Accounts 
The Company maintains an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments. This
estimate is based on a specific customer analysis and an analysis of our historical write-offs as a percent of outstanding accounts receivable balances. If the financial condition of a
customer were to deteriorate, resulting in an impairment of its ability to make payments, an additional allowance may be required. 
Goodwill and Purchased Intangible Assets 
The Company assesses goodwill and intangible assets for impairment in accordance with SFAS No142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets
SFAS142. Under SFAS142, goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives are no longer amortized but are assessed annually or more frequently if impairment indicators arise for
impairment. In making this annual assessment, the Company relies on a number of factors including operating results, business plans, economic projections, anticipated future cash flows, and market
place data. The Company completed its annual intangible asset impairment test during the quarter ended March31, 2005, and concluded that the carrying value of its goodwill was not impaired. 
Impairment of Long-Lived Assets 
The Company reviews long-lived assets; including intangible assets, leasehold improvements, property and equipment, and capitalized software
development costs for impairment whenever events or changes in business circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not be fully recoverable. The Company has identified no such
material impairment losses as of March31, 2005 or March31, 2004. 
Income Taxes 
The Company accounts for income taxes using the liability method. Under the liability method, deferred income taxes are recognized for the tax consequences of
temporary differences by applying enacted statutory tax rates applicable to future years to differences between the financial carrying amounts and the tax basis of existing assets and liabilities.
The provision for income taxes is based on the Company estimates for taxable income of the various legal entities and jurisdictions in which it operates. As such, income tax expense may vary from
the customary relationship between income tax expense and pre-tax accounting income. 
Net Income Loss Per Share 
The Company computes net income loss per share pursuant to SFAS No128, Earnings Per Share SFAS128. Under the provisions of SFAS128,
basic net income loss per share is computed by dividing the net income loss available to common stockholders for the period by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the
period. Diluted net income loss per share is computed by dividing the net income loss for the period by the weighted average number of common and common equivalent shares outstanding during the
period. Common equivalent shares, composed of unvested restricted common shares and incremental common shares issuable upon the exercise of stock options, are included in diluted net income loss per
share to the extent these shares are dilutive. 
51  The
following table sets forth the computation of basic and diluted net loss per share as follows in thousands, except per share amounts: Twelve Months Ended
Three Months Ended March 31, 2005
December 31, 2003
December 31, 2002
March 31, 2004

common stock equivalents would include the dilutive effects of common stock options and restricted stock that has not yet fully vested. Potentially dilutive common stock
equivalents totaled approximately 3,230,000, 3,530,000, and 3,818,000 shares for the years ended March31, 2005, December31, 2003, and December31, 2002 and 1,655,000 and
7,025,000 for the three months ended March31, 2004 and 2003 unaudited, respectively. Potentially dilutive common stock equivalents were excluded from the March31, 2005,
December31, 2003, December31, 2002, March31, 2004 and March31, 2003 diluted earnings per share calculations because of their anti-dilutive effect. 
Comprehensive Income Loss 
The Company has adopted the provisions of SFAS No130, Reporting Comprehensive Income SFAS130. SFAS130 establishes standards for
reporting comprehensive income loss and its components in financial statements. Comprehensive income loss, as defined, includes all changes in equity net assets during a period from
non-owner sources. Net income loss and other comprehensive income loss, including foreign currency translation adjustments, and unrealized gains and losses on investments shall be
reported, net of their related tax effect, to arrive at comprehensive loss. The Company net income loss and its total comprehensive income loss are included in the statement of stockholders'
equity. 
Stock Based Compensation 
As permitted by SFAS No123, Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation SFAS123, the Company elected to follow Accounting Principles Board
Opinion No25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees APB 25and related interpretations in accounting for its employee stock option plans. Under APB 25, no compensation expense
is recognized at the time of option grant if the exercise price of the Company employee stock option equals the fair market value of the underlying common stock on the date of grant. SFAS123
requires pro forma information regarding net income loss and earnings per share as if the Company had accounted for its employee stock options and warrants granted
subsequent to

In December2004, the Financial Accounting Standards Board FASB issued Statement Financial Accounting Standard No123 revised 2004, Share-Based
Payment SFAS123R. SFAS123R requires all companies to measure compensation costs for all share-based payments including employee stock options at fair value. The effective date of
SFAS123R is as of the beginning of the first interim or annual reporting period of the Company first fiscal year beginning on or after June15, 2005. Accordingly, we will be required
to apply SFAS123R for the year beginning April1, 2006. The adoption of SFAS123R will have a significant adverse impact on our reported results of operations because the
stock-based compensation expense will be charged directly against our reported earnings. 
Reclassification 
Certain prior period amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current period presentation. 
53  3.Divestiture of Pharmacopeia Drug Discovery,Inc. 
On April30, 2004 the Company completed the spin-off of PDD into an independent, separately traded, publicly held company through the
distribution to its stockholders of a dividend of one share of PDD common stock for every two shares of Accelrys common stock. The Company has received an opinion of counsel that the transaction
qualified for treatment as a tax-free spin-off. As part of this transaction, the Company contributed $423million in marketable securities and $54million in
cash to PDD and incurred transaction costs of approximately $23. For the one-month ended April30, 2004, the discontinued PDD operations had revenue of $13million and a
pretax loss of $11 million. 
The
Company has reclassified PDD current and prior period results of operations, assets and liabilities as discontinued operations in the financial statements. Further, the footnotes
exclude results of operations, assets and liabilities of PDD. 
4.Acquisition of SciTegic,Inc. 
On September27, 2004, the Company acquired all of the outstanding common shares of SciTegic,Inc. SciTegic. The results of SciTegic
operations have been included in the consolidated financial statements since that date. SciTegic is a leading provider of workflow software solutions for the scientific research market. The primary
reason for the acquisition was to complement the Company existing product offerings. 
The
aggregate purchase price was $208million including $134million of cash and 1,166,218 shares of the Company common stock valued at $74million. The per
share value of the stock issued was $637, determined based on the average market price of Accelrys' common shares over the five-day period including two days before, the day of and two
days after the terms of the acquisition were agreed to and announced. On the date of acquisition, 1,040,119 shares of common stock were issued to SciTegic stockholders and 126,099 shares of common
stock earnout shares were deposited into an escrow account. Further, the Company deposited $32million of the cash consideration into an escrow account. 
On
January31, 2005, a portion of the cash escrow was released to the former SciTegic stockholders pursuant to the terms of the merger agreement. Subject to indemnification claims
by the Company, the remaining cash escrow may be released to the former SciTegic stockholders on September27, 2005. The earnout shares held in escrow will be released in four
semi-annual installments to former SciTegic stockholders subject to, among other things, the continued employment by the Company of two founders of SciTegic through the period starting
September27, 2004 and ending September27, 2006. 
In
addition to the earnout shares above, 208,225 shares of common stock were deposited in the escrow account for the two founders of SciTegic. The Company recorded deferred compensation
of $13million related to these shares. Additionally, the Company converted SciTegic employees' unvested stock options into unvested options in the Company resulting in deferred compensation
of $02million. The deferred compensation balances will be ratably amortized into compensation expense over the two-year earn-our period. As of March31, 2005,
the remaining deferred compensation balance was $12million.

The Company accounts for income taxes using the liability method. Under the liability method, deferred income taxes are recognized for the tax consequences of
temporary differences by applying enacted statutory tax rates applicable to future years to differences between the financial carrying amounts and the tax basis of existing assets and liabilities. Significant
components of the Company deferred tax assets and liabilities are as follows in thousands: March 31 2005
2004 Deferred tax assets Net operating loss carryforwards 51,616 38,407 Unused tax credits 4,018 3,739 Accruals and reserves 5,017 5,636 Gross deferred tax asset 60,651 47,782 Deferred tax liabilities Fixed assets 543 536 Intangibles 7,649 3,006 Net asset before valuation allowance 52,459 44,240 Valuation allowance 52,459 44,240 Net deferred tax asset Income
tax expense is based on pretax financial accounting income under the liability method. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the difference between the
financial statement and tax basis of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse. We must then assess the likelihood that the
resulting deferred tax assets will be realized. To the extent we believe that realization is not more likely than not, we establish a valuation allowance. To date the Company has provided a full
valuation allowance for all net deferred tax assets. 
In
addition to the net operating loss carryforwards above, the Company had pre-acquisition net operating loss carryforwards of $615million from acquisitions outside
the United States as of March31, 2005, which has been fully reserved. To the extent the pre-acquisition operating loss carryforwards are used, such amounts will reduce goodwill. As
of March31, 2005 and December31, 
56  2003 07million and $03million of pre-acquisition tax deductions had been used, and accordingly, a corresponding amount of valuation allowance reduced goodwill. As
of March31, 2005, approximately $30million of the valuation allowance relates to pre-acquisition tax deductions, which to the extent recognized, will
result in a reduction of goodwill. 
As
of March31, 2004, the Company had a tax reserve of $25million which consisted of $15million for transfer pricing and other issues, $05million of tax
reserve from the acquisition of Oxford Molecular, and $05million for estimated income tax payments. During fiscal 2005, the Company determined that $10million of the tax reserve
related to potential tax risks was no longer necessary. Additionally, the $05million tax provision for the acquisition of Oxford Molecular was reversed against goodwill as the statute of
limitations expired. As of March31, 2005, the Company had a tax reserve of $06million which primarily consisted of a potential transfer pricing issue. 
Pretax
loss from the Company domestic operations totaled approximately $282 million, $62 million, and $118 million during the twelve months ended March31, 2005,
December31, 2003 and December31, 2002 and $174million and $56 million during the three months ended March31, 2004 and 2003 unaudited, respectively. 
Pretax
income from the Company foreign operations totaled approximately $36million, $52million, and $43million during the twelve months ended
March31, 2005, December31, 2003 and December31, 2002 and $02million and $10million during the three months ended March31, 2004 and 2003 unaudited,

As of March31, 2005, the Company has United States federal net operating loss carryforwards of approximately $1342million, and credit carryforwards of approximately
$40million. The United States federal net operating losses and credits begin to expire in 2008 through 2023, if not fully utilized. Realization is dependent on generating sufficient taxable
income prior to expiration of the loss and credit carryforwards. Approximately $437million of the net operating losses relate to stock option deductions which will result in an increase to
paid-in capital and a decrease in income taxes payable at such time that the tax benefit is realized. 
In
April2003, the Company established a wholly owned subsidiary, Accelrys Software Solutions Pvt.Ltd., in Bangalore, India. This subsidiary qualifies under applicable
Indian law for a tax holiday though March2009. The aggregate dollar amount of the tax holiday was $02million $001 per share. A
portion of the Company United States federal net operating loss carryforwards that relate to the acquired companies may be subject to annual usage limitations under
Section382 of the Internal Revenue Code.

Operating Leases 
The Company has several operating leases or sub-leases for office space, which expire at various dates through 2022. The leases for the Company
primary facilities in San Diego, California, Cambridge, United Kingdom, and Bangalore, India, provide generally for scheduled rent increases, options to extend the leases with certain changes to the

The terms of the Company leases of its corporate office in San Diego, California include a tenant improvement allowance of up to $18million. As of
March31, 2005, $15million of this allowance remains as outstanding receivable from the landlord. The Company has recorded this receivable from the landlord as a current asset and as
short- and long-term liabilities, as appropriate. The liabilities will be ratably reduced over the life of the lease which will reduce rent expense in accordance with EITF
88-3, Rental Concessions Provided by Landlord. In the event a portion of the $15million is not collected from the landlord, the other asset and the liability will be adjusted
accordingly. 
Guarantee of Lease Obligation of Others 
On April30, 2004, the landlords of the New Jersey facilities related to the PDD operations consented to the assignment of the leases to PDD. Despite the
assignment, the landlords required Accelrys to guarantee the remaining lease obligations representing approximately $250million in future payments through April2016. The
probability-weighted fair market value of this guarantee was calculated in accordance with Financial Accounting Standard Board Interpretation No46 FIN 46Guarantor Accounting and
Disclosure Requirements for Guarantees, Including Indirect Guarantees of Indebtedness of Others and resulted in a liability and a charge to stockholders' equity. The liability is being adjusted
against stockholders' equity to reflect the change in the fair market value of the obligation over the lease term. At March31, 2005, the liability is $07million. 
11.Commitments and Contingencies 
Royalties 
The Company pays royalties to approximately forty entities for worldwide licenses to enhance and market certain software developed at universities, corporations,
and other institutions. A majority of the royalty agreements are long term or perpetual in nature and the royalty obligations are generally based on a percentage of revenues derived from certain
software licenses plus associated revenues from 
62  post-contract
support and maintenance. The royalty agreements require quarterly payments and generally do not limit the maximum royalty amount under the agreement. Certain agreements
contain provisions for quarterly and annual minimum royalty payments that total approximately $04million on an annual basis. In the twelve months ended March31, 2005,
December31, 2003, and December31, 2002 the Company incurred related royalty expense of $28million, $28million, and $32million, respectively. In the three
months ended March31, 2004 and March31, 2003 unaudited the Company incurred related royalty expense of $04million and $05million, respectively. 
Litigation 
In the ordinary course of business, the Company maybe subject to claims and, from time to time, is named in various legal proceedings. The Company is currently
not involved in any matters of material litigation. Commitments 
FASB Interpretation No45 FIN 45elaborates on previously existing disclosure requirements for most guarantees, including loan guarantees such as
standby letters of credit. It also clarifies that at the time a company issues a guarantee, the company must recognize an initial liability for the fair value, or market value, of the obligations it
assumes under the guarantee and must disclose that information in its interim and annual financial statements. The provisions related to recognizing a liability at inception of the guarantee for the
fair value of the guarantor obligations do not apply to product warranties, indemnifications or to guarantees accounted for as derivatives. The initial recognition and initial measurement provisions
apply on a prospective basis to guarantees issued or modified after December31, 2002. We
may provide indemnifications of varying scope and size to certain customers against claims of intellectual property infringement made by third parties arising from the use of our
products. We
evaluate estimated losses for such indemnifications under SFAS 5, Accounting for Contingencies, as interpreted by FIN 45. We consider such factors as the degree of probability of an unfavorable
outcome and the ability to make a reasonable estimate of the amount of loss. To date, we have not encountered material costs as a result of such obligations and have not accrued any liabilities
related to such indemnifications in our financial statements. Indemnifications 
The Company has entered into indemnification agreements with its officers and directors. The Company has not incurred material costs to defend lawsuits or settle
claims related to these indemnification provisions. As of March31, 2005, the Company had not accrued a liability for this guarantee, because the likelihood of incurring a payment obligation in
connection with this guarantee is not probable and estimable. 
In
connection with the spin-off of PDD, the Company and PDD entered into the agreements described below. Master Separation and Distribution Agreement 
The Company entered into a master separation and distribution agreement with PDD providing for, among other things, certain corporate transactions required to
effect the spin-off and other arrangements between the Company and PDD subsequent to the spin-off. In particular, the agreement provided for ownership of the business, assets
and liabilities necessary for the continuation of the Company business directly or indirectly, by the Company, and PDD remaining business assets and liabilities, directly or indirectly, by
Accelrys. 
63  Transition Services Agreement 
The Company entered into a transition services agreement with PDD, pursuant to which the Company has provided PDD and PDD has provided the Company certain
services during a transition period that commenced on the spin-off date. The obligation to provide services terminated no later than the first anniversary of the spin-off date. Under
the terms of the transition services agreement, the Company provided PDD with business development, financial information systems advice and support, support for the maintenance of
corporate records and personnel administration and services. PDD provided the Company with office space during the transition period. 
The
transition services agreement also provided that the Company make available a sum of $1million to be held as a Services Fund in a segregated account, in trust for the
benefit of the Company and PDD. During the period, PDD used $05million of the Services Fund to acquire a financial system appropriate for its business. As of March31, 2005, the
remaining $05million available under the Services Fund was remitted to the Company. In
addition, the Company made a capital contribution of $733thousand in relation to costs, expenses and fees associated with PDD consolidation of its facilities. 
Tax Sharing and Indemnification Agreement 
In order to allocate the Company responsibilities for taxes and certain other tax matters, the Company and PDD entered into a tax sharing and indemnification
agreement. 
Under
the tax sharing and indemnification agreement, the Company is responsible for filing all federal consolidated income tax returns and all consolidated, combined, or unitary state
and local income tax returns including PDD for all periods through the distribution date, and for paying all taxes related to those returns. The Company will act as PDD agent in connection with the
filing of those returns, paying those taxes and responding to any audits that may arise in connection with those returns. The Company will be entitled to any refunds of income taxes related to those
returns, and except for certain spin-off taxes discussed below will be responsible for any increased tax payments related to those returns as a result of any audits.

Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No142 SFAS142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, stipulates a two-step process
to ascertain whether there is an indication that goodwill is impaired. The first step of the process is to compare the fair value of the Company to the carrying value. The fair value of the Company
was determined by relying on a number of factors Footnote 2. If the first step of the process indicates that the fair value of the Company is less than the carrying value, then the second step of
the process is to calculate the implied value of goodwill. The Company completed its annual intangible asset impairment test on January1, 2005, and concluded that the carrying value of its
goodwill was not impaired as the fair value exceeded the carrying value. 
67  The
following is a summary of the changes in goodwill in thousands: Goodwill Balance at December 31, 2002 34,404 Deductions Use of pre-acquisition deferred tax assets 332 Balance at December 31, 2003 34,072 No changes to goodwill Balance at March 31, 2004 34,072 Additions Acquistion of SciTegic 9,784 Deductions Reversal of tax reserve for acquisiton from 2000 500 Use of pre-acquisition deferred tax assets 747 Balance at March 31, 2005 42,609 The

15.Restricted Cash  During the quarter ended June30, 2004, the Company entered into a nine-year lease agreement for corporate facilities in San Diego, California.
Under the terms of the lease, the Company was

pursuant to which cash is released to Accelrys. At March31, 2005, the Company had a restricted cash balance of $66million which consisted entirely of marketable securities. 
16.Variable Interest Entity 
In January2003, the Financial Accounting Standards Board FASB issued FASB Interpretation 46, Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities, an
Interpretation of ARB No51 FIN 46. In December2003, the FASB modified FIN 46 to make certain technical corrections and address certain implementation issues that had arisen. FIN 46
provides a new framework for identifying variable interest entities VIEs and determining when a company should include the assets, liabilities, noncontrolling interest and results of activities of a
VIE in its consolidated financial statements. 
In
general, a VIE is a corporation, partnership, limited-liability corporation, trust, or any other legal structure used to conduct activities or hold assets that either 1has
an insufficient amount of equity to carry out its principal activities without additional subordinated financial support, 2has a group of equity owners that are unable to make significant
decisions about its activities, or 3has a group of equity owners that do not have the obligation to absorb losses or the right to receive returns generated by its operations. 
FIN
46 requires a VIE to be consolidated if a party with an ownership, contractual or other financial interest in the VIE a variable interest holder is obligated to absorb a majority
of the risk of loss from the VIE activities, is entitled to receive a majority of the VIE residual returns if no party absorbs a majority of the VIE losses, or both. A variable interest holder
that consolidates the VIE is called the primary beneficiary. Upon consolidation, the primary beneficiary generally must initially record all of the VIE assets, liabilities and
non-controlling interest at fair value and subsequently account for the VIE as if it were consolidated based on majority voting interest. FIN 46 also requires disclosures about VIEs that
the variable interest holder is not required to consolidate but in which it has a significant variable interest. 
FIN
46 was effective immediately for VIEs created after January31, 2003. The provisions of FIN 46, as revised, were adopted as of December31, 2003, for the Company
interest in all VIEs. In October2004, the FASB revised FIN 46 to include rabbi trusts as a VIE since the company sponsoring the rabbi trust is the primary beneficiary in the event of
bankruptcy. The Company established a rabbi trust in March2000 for the benefit of directors and officers of the Company under its deferred compensation plan. Since the rabbi trust inception,
the assets of the rabbi trust have been consolidated in the Company other current assets and the liabilities have been consolidated in the Company accrued compensation and benefits. As of
March31, 2005 and 2004, both the asset and liabilities were $08million and $17million, respectively. Changes in values of assets held by the rabbi trust accrue to the
Company directors and officers and not the Company. 17.Related Party Transactions 
A former member of the Company board of directors is a partner in the former principal outside law firm that provided legal services to the Company. For the
years ended December31, 2003, 2002, 2001, the three months ended March31, 2004, and the one month ended April30, 2004 date at which the former member of the Company board
was no longer considered a related party the Company expended a total of $05million, $08million, $22million, $04million, and $02million, respectively, in
fees related to services provided by such firm. 
The
Company former Chairman, President, and CEO, is also the Chairman of the board of directors of a customer. For the twelve months ended March31, 2005, December31,
2003, and December31, 2002, and for the three months ended March31, 2004, the Company received $01million, $07million, $02million, and $2thousand,
respectively, in payment for services and products provided to the customer.

Conclusion Regarding the Effectiveness of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
Under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, we conducted an
evaluation of our disclosure controls and procedures, as such term is defined under Rule13a-15e promulgated under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended the Exchange

Management Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as such term is defined in Exchange Act
Rule13a-15f. Under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, we conducted an
evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting based on the framework set forth in Internal ControlIntegrated
Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Based on our evaluation under the framework set forth in Internal ControlIntegrated
Framework, our management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of March31, 2005. Our management assessment of the
effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of March31, 2005 has been audited by Ernst Young LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm that audited
the consolidated financial statements of the Company included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, as stated in their report which is included herein. Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm on Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
The
Board of Directors and Stockholders
Accelrys, Inc. 
We
have audited management assessment, included in the accompanying Management Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting that Accelrys, Inc. maintained effective internal
control over financial reporting as of March 31, 2005, based on criteria established in Internal ControlIntegrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the
Treadway Commission the COSO criteria. Accelrys management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on
management assessment and an opinion on the effectiveness of the company internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. 
We
conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board United States. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to
obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control
over financial reporting, evaluating management assessment, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control, and performing such other procedures as we considered
necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion. 
70  A
company internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of
financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures
that 1 pertain to the
maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; 2 provide reasonable assurance that transactions are
recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only
in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and 3 provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or
disposition of the comapny assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. 
Because
of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future
periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. 
In
our opinion, management assessment that Accelrys, Inc. maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of March 31, 2005, is fairly stated, in all material
respects, based on the COSO criteria. Also, in our opinion, Accelrys, Inc. maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of March 31, 2005, based on the
COSO criteria. 
We
also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board United States, the consolidated balance sheets as of March 31, 2005 and 2004,
and the related consolidated statements of operations, stockholders' equity and cash flows for each of the two years in the period ended December 31, 2003, the three months ended March 31, 2004 and
the year ended March 31, 2005 of Accelrys, Inc. and our report dated June 9, 2005 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon. San Diego, California
