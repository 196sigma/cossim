LEGAL PROCEEDINGS In September 2003, we and Pinnacle Systems, Inc.
Pinnacle were served with a complaint in YOUCre8,
Inc. a/k/a DVDCre8, Inc.v. Pinnacle Systems, Inc., Dazzle
Multimedia, Inc., and SCM Microsystems, Inc. Superior Court of
California, Alameda County Case No.RG03114448. The
complaint 13 Table of Contents was filed by a software company whose software was distributed
by Dazzle Multimedia, now SCM Multimedia. The complaint alleges
that in connection with our sale of certain assets of our former
Dazzle video products business to Pinnacle, Dazzle breached the
Software License Agreement between the Plaintiff and Dazzle. The
complaint further alleges that we and Pinnacle tortiously
interfered with DVDCre8s commercial relationships, engaged
in acts to restrain competition in the DVD software market,
misappropriated DVDCre8s trade secrets, and engaged in
unfair competition. In December of 2003, Dazzle filed a
Cross-Complaint against the Plaintiff seeking $600,000 in
damages for alleged breach of the Software License Agreement
between the Plaintiff and Dazzle. In June of 2004, Plaintiff
filed a First Amended Complaint asserting additional claims
against Pinnacle. In July of 2004 and January of 2005, the
parties participated in settlement discussions before a private
mediator which were unsuccessful. In February of 2005, Plaintiff
circulated a draft Second Amended Complaint, which drops
contract claims and a claim for injunctive relief against
Pinnacle, as well as the misappropriation of trade secrets claim
against all defendants, and adds new allegations against Dazzle
and SCM Microsystems, including a claim for damages in excess of
$58million. No trial date has been set, and the parties
are currently engaged in discovery. Pursuant to the Asset
Purchase Agreement between SCM and Pinnacle, we and Pinnacle are
seeking indemnification from each other, respectively, for all
or part of the damages and the expenses incurred to defend the
Plaintiffs claims. We believe the claims by DVDCre8 are
without merit and intend to vigorously defend the action, but we
cannot predict the final outcome of this lawsuit, nor accurately
estimate the amount of time and resources that we may need to
devote to defending ourselves against it. Specific damages
amounts have not been specified, nor assessed at this early
stage of the litigation, so the potential damages claims cannot
be estimated. Accordingly, if we were to be unsuccessful in our
defense of this lawsuit, and if the Plaintiff were to be able to
establish substantial damages, we could be forced to pay an
amount, currently unknown, which could have an adverse effect on
our business. In addition, although we believe that we are
entitled to indemnification in whole or in part for any damages
and costs of defense and that Pinnacles claim for
indemnification is without merit, there can be no assurance that
we will be successful on the indemnification claim or recover
all or a portion of any damages assessed or expenses incurred,
and we may even be forced to pay Pinnacle an amount, currently
unknown, which could have an adverse effect on our business.

MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL
CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Overview SCM Microsystems designs, develops and sells hardware, software
and silicon solutions that enable people to conveniently and
securely access digital content and services, including content
and services that have been protected through digital
encryption. We sell our products primarily to original equipment
providers, or OEMs, who typically either bundle our products
with their own solutions, or repackage our products for resale
to their customers. Our OEM customers include: digital TV
operators and broadcasters and conditional access providers for
our conditional access modules; government contractors, systems
integrators, large enterprises, computer manufacturers, as well
as banks and other financial institutions for our smart card
readers; and computer and photographic equipment manufacturers
for our digital media readers. We sell and license our products
through a direct sales and marketing organization, as well as
through distributors, value added resellers and systems
integrators worldwide. Until the middle of 2003, our operations included a retail
Digital Media and Video business that accounted for
approximately half of our sales. We sold this business in the
third quarter of 2003, so that we are now solely focused on our
core OEM Security business. As a result of this sale and
divestiture, beginning in the second quarter of fiscal 2003, we
have accounted for the retail Digital Media and Video business
as a discontinued operation, and statements of operations for
all periods presented have been restated to reflect the
discontinuance of this business. For comparability, certain 2002
figures have been reclassified, where appropriate, to conform to
the financial statement presentation used in 2003 and 2004,
including the adjustments necessary to conform to the
discontinued operations presentation of the retail Digital Media
and Video business during 2002. See Note2 of Notes to
Consolidated Financial Statements. We have experienced a significant drop in revenues during the
three year period from 2002 to 2004. The decline in our revenues
is primarily related to a significant decrease in Digital TV
product sales, which have been adversely affected by overall
weak demand in the digital television subscriber market in
Europe, historically our largest market for these products, as
well as by the entry of new competition in the second half of
2003. Sales of our PC Security products also declined
significantly in 2003 when orders for a major
U.S.government project slowed following the completion of
the high-volume purchase phase of the project; however, revenue
levels from this product area remained stable in 2004. Sales of
Flash Media Interface products have declined slightly over the
past two years from 2002 levels. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition
and Results of Operations discusses SCMs consolidated
financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance
with accounting principles generally accepted in the United
States of America. The preparation of these financial statements
requires management to make estimates and assumptions that
affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the
date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of
revenues and expenses during the reporting period. On an
on-going basis, management evaluates its estimates and
judgments, including those related to product returns, customer
incentives, bad debts, inventories, asset impairment, deferred
tax assets, accrued warranty reserves, restructuring costs,
contingencies and litigation. Management bases its estimates and 17 Table of Contents judgments on historical experience and on various other factors
that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the
results of which form the basis for making judgments about the
carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily
apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from
these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. Our significant accounting policies are outlined in Note1
to the Consolidated Financial Statements, which appear in
PartII, Item8 of this Annual Report on
Form10-K. Some of those accounting policies require us to
make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported
by us. Management believes the following critical accounting
policies, among others, affect our more significant judgments
and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated
financial statements.   
We recognize product revenue upon shipment provided that risk
and title have transferred, a purchase order has been received,
collection is determined to be probable and no significant
obligations remain. Maintenance revenue is deferred and
amortized over the period of the maintenance contract.
Provisions for estimated warranty repairs and returns and
allowances are provided for at the time products are shipped. We
maintain allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses
resulting from the inability of our customers to make required
payments. If the financial condition of our customers were to
deteriorate, resulting in an impairment of their ability to make
payments, additional allowances may be required.     
We write down inventory for estimated obsolescence or
unmarketable inventory equal to the difference between the cost
of inventory and the estimated market value based upon
assumptions about future demand and market conditions. If actual
demand or market conditions are less favorable than those
projected by management, additional inventory write-downs may be
required. In 2004, 2003 and 2002, we wrote down approximately
$54million, $08million and $40million of
inventory, respectively, based on such judgments.     
We record an investment impairment charge when we believe an
investment has experienced a decline in value that is other than
temporary. Future adverse changes in market conditions or poor
operating results of underlying investments could result in
losses or an inability to recover the carrying value of the
investment that may not be reflected in an investments
current carrying value, thereby possibly requiring an impairment
charge in the future. In 2004, we recognized no impairment
charges related to investments. In 2003, we recorded impairment
charges of approximately $05million in continuing
operations related to our investments.     
In assessing the recoverability of our goodwill and other
intangibles, we must make assumptions regarding estimated future
cash flows and other factors to determine the fair value of the
respective assets. If these estimates or their related
assumptions change in the future, we may be required to record
impairment charges for these assets not previously recorded. On
January1, 2002, we adopted Statement of Financial
Accounting Standard No142 SFASNo142,
Goodwill and Other Intangibles Assets, and management is
required to analyze goodwill and intangible assets for
impairment issues on a periodic basis. In the fourth quarters of
2004 and 2002, we recorded $04million and
$66million, respectively, of asset impairment in
continuing operations based on conclusions that the goodwill and
intangible assets from past acquisitions were impaired.     
The carrying value of our net deferred tax assets reflects that
we have been unable to generate sufficient taxable income in
certain tax jurisdictions. A valuation allowance is provided for
deferred tax assets if it is more likely than not these items
will either expire before we are able to realize their benefit,
or that future deductibility is uncertain. Management evaluates
the realizability of the deferred tax assets quarterly. In 2002,
we reevaluated the realizability of the deferred tax assets and
recorded an additional valuation allowance of
$127million, increasing our 2002net loss. The
deferred tax assets are still available for us to use in the
future to offset taxable income, which would result in the
recognition of a tax benefit and a reduction in our effective
tax rate. The divestiture of our retail Digital Media and Video
business to Pinnacle Systems and Zio Corporation, as well as
future changes to the operating structure of our new strategic
focus on our Security business, may limit our ability to utilize
our deferred tax assets. 18 Table of Contents   
We accrue the estimated cost of product warranties during the
period of sale. While we engage in extensive product quality
programs and processes, including actively monitoring and
evaluating the quality of our component suppliers, our warranty
obligation is affected by actual warranty costs, including
material usage or service delivery costs incurred in correcting
a product failure. If actual material usage or service delivery
costs differ from our estimates, revisions to our estimated
warranty liability would be required.     
On January1, 2003, we adopted SFASNo146,
Accounting for Costs Associated with Exit or Disposal
Activities, which requires that a liability for a cost
associated with an exit or disposal activity initiated after
December31, 2002 be recognized when the liability is
incurred and that the liability be measured at fair value.
During 2002, the accounting for restructuring costs required us
to record provisions and charges when we had a formal and
committed plan. In connection with plans we had adopted, we
recorded estimated expenses for severance and outplacement
costs, lease cancellations, asset write-offs and other
restructuring costs. We continually evaluate the adequacy of the
remaining liabilities under our restructuring initiatives.
Although we believe that these estimates accurately reflect the
costs of our restructuring plans, actual results may differ,
thereby requiring us to record additional provisions or reverse
a portion of such provisions. Recent Accounting Pronouncements In December 2004, the Financial Accounting Standards Board
FASB issued SFASNo123R,
Share-Based Payment. SFASNo123R is a
revision of SFASNo123 Accounting for Stock-Based
Compensation and supersedes Accounting Principles Board
APBOpinion No25. SFASNo123R
eliminates the alternative of applying the intrinsic value
measurement provisions of APB Opinion No25 to stock
compensation awards issued to employees. Rather, the new
standard requires enterprises to measure the cost of employee
services received in exchange for an award of equity instruments
based on the grant-date fair value of the award. That cost will
be recognized over the period during which an employee is
required to provide services in exchange for the award, known as
the requisite service period usually the vesting period. We have not yet quantified the effects of the adoption of
SFASNo123R, but it is expected that the new
standard may result in significant stock-based compensation
expense. The actual effects of adopting SFASNo123R
will be dependent on numerous factors including, but not limited
to, the valuation model that we choose to value stock-based
awards; the assumed award forfeiture rate; the accounting
policies adopted concerning the method of recognizing the fair
value of awards over the requisite service period; and the
transition method as described below chosen for adopting
SFASNo123R. SFASNo123R will be effective for our fiscal quarter
beginning July1, 2005, and requires the use of the
Modified Prospective Application Method. Under this method
SFASNo123R is applied to new awards and to awards
modified, repurchased, or cancelled after the effective date.
Additionally, compensation cost for the portion of awards for
which the requisite service has not been rendered such as
unvested options that are outstanding as of the date of
adoption shall be recognized as the remaining services are
rendered. The compensation cost relating to unvested awards at
the date of adoption shall be based on the grant-date fair value
of those awards as calculated for pro forma disclosures under
the original SFASNo123. In addition, companies may
use the Modified Retrospective Application Method. This method
may be applied to all prior years for which the original
SFASNo123 was effective or only to prior interim
periods in the year of initial adoption. If the Modified
Retrospective Application Method is applied, financial
statements for prior periods shall be adjusted to give effect to
the fair-value-based method of accounting for awards on a
consistent basis with the pro forma disclosures required for
those periods under the original SFASNo123. Acquisitions On May22, 2002, we paid $45million in cash for all
the outstanding share capital of Towitoko AG, a privately held
smart card-based security solutions company based in Munich,
Germany. The acquisition has been accounted for under the
purchase method of accounting and the results of operations were
included in our results of operations since the date of the
acquisition. In connection with the acquisition, we incurred 19 Table of Contents acquisition costs of approximately $01million. At the
time of the acquisition, Towitoko had no significant research
and development projects that were incomplete. Intangible assets and goodwill from the acquisition approximated
$35million and represented the excess of the purchase
price over the fair value of the tangible assets acquired less
the liabilities assumed. Non-compete agreements entered into in
connection with the acquisition were amortized on a
straight-line basis over the term of the agreements of two
years. The trade name and goodwill of $11million were
evaluated for impairment in the fourth quarter of 2002 and were
written off. All other intangible assets are being amortized on
a straight-line basis over their useful lives of five years. Results of Operations The following table sets forth our statements of operations as a

Fiscal 2004 Revenue Compared with Fiscal 2003
Revenue Net revenue for the twelve months ended December31, 2004
was $491million, compared to $665million in 2003,
a decrease of 26%. This decline was primarily related to lower
revenues from our Digital TV products. PC Security and Flash
Media Interface product revenues also decreased slightly year to
year. In our Digital TV product line, sales decreased 46%, from
$353million in 2003 to $191million in 2004. The
majority of our Digital TV sales come from shipments of
conditional access modules, which are used in conjunction with
set-top boxes or integrated digital televisions to decrypt
digital pay-television broadcasts. To date, sales primarily have
been to small European operators or broadcasters or to
distributors and conditional access suppliers serving these
operators and broadcasters. Beginning in the third quarter of
2003 and continuing through fiscal 2004, our Digital TV products
sales were significantly adversely impacted by new competition
from suppliers that have emulated the conditional access
decryption software for pay-TV content on conditional access
modules that may be used to provide unauthorized access to that
content. We are pursuing, and in some cases have already
obtained, legal injunctions against these suppliers. However, we
do not expect to be able to regain the market share we have
lost. Our strategy in 2004 was to target new mid-sized operators
and broadcasters in Europe and to sign agreements with operators
in Korea as this country begins to utilize conditional access
modules under a government mandate as the country begins to
convert its broadcasting operations to digital technology. While
we did experience some success with this strategy in 2004, we
did not ship significant volumes of product to these target
customers. Sales of our PC Security products decreased 3%, from
$207million in 2003 to $200million in 2004. This
product line consists of smart card readers and related chip
technology that are utilized principally in security programs
where smart cards are used to identify and authenticate people
in order to control access to computers, computer networks and
buildings or other facilities. In 2004 our readers were
purchased for the U.S.Department of Defenses Common
Access Card personal identification program, various on-line
banking programs in Europe, employee identification at oil field
operations and other smart card-based security programs. Market
research firms, the U.S. and other governments and our customers
have indicated to us that they expect a significant increase in
the volume of secure access projects requiring readers such as
ours over the next few years. However, during 2004 there was no
significant increase in the number of smart card readers being
deployed in these projects. The timing of any new projects that
may increase demand for smart card readers remains unpredictable. 21 Table of Contents Revenues from our Flash Media Interface product line decreased
4%, from $105million in 2003 to $100million in
2004. Flash Media Interface revenues consist of sales of digital
media readers and related ASIC technology used to provide an
interface for flash memory cards in computer printers and
digital photography kiosks, which are used to download and print
digital photos.   
Fiscal 2003 Revenue Compared with Fiscal 2002
Revenue Net revenue for the twelve months ended December31, 2003
was $665million, compared to $901million in 2002,
a decrease of 26%. While sales decreased across all three
product areas, the decline was most pronounced in PC Security,
which decreased by 36% in 2003, and in Digital TV, which
decreased 24%. PC Security sales decreased from $325million in 2002 to
$207million in 2003. Throughout 2002, we were a major
supplier, through prime contractors, to the U.S.Department
of Defense for its Common Access Card program, which is the
worlds largest personal identity program based on smart
cards to date. At the end of 2002, high volume purchases of
smart cards and readers under this program had been
substantially completed. We therefore experienced a sharp drop
in sales beginning in the first quarter of 2003, as shipments of
our smart card readers to the U.S.government declined
substantially. Our PC Security sales in 2003, therefore,
consisted of smaller volume shipments of readers for smaller
scale projects with European banks, corporate enterprises and
the U.S.government. In our Digital TV product line, sales decreased from
$465million in 2002 to $353million in 2003. In the
third quarter of 2002, we lost a significant customer in Europe,
and the loss of this customer resulted in lower levels of sales
in the remainder of 2002 and throughout 2003. In addition,
beginning in 2002 and continuing through 2003, many of the
larger television operators and broadcasters in Europe
experienced lower subscription rates and accordingly had
financial difficulties. Because of their size and industry
influence, we believe this further weakened demand from our
customer base, the smaller operators, as well. Beginning in the
third quarter of 2003 and continuing through the fourth quarter,
we also were significantly adversely impacted by new competition
from suppliers that have emulated the conditional access
decryption software for pay-TV content on conditional access
modules that may be used to provide unauthorized access to that
content. Revenues from our Flash Media Interface product line remained
relatively stable year to year, with sales of $105million
in 2003 versus $111million in 2002, a decrease of 6%. 22 Table of Contents

Gross profit for 2004 was $149million, or 30% of total
net revenue. Gross profit was adversely impacted by a write-down
of inventory of $54million, of which $40million
related to Digital TV product inventory, $07million
related to PC Security product inventory and $07million
related to Flash Media Interface product inventory. Gross profit for 2003 was $268million, or 40% of total
net revenue. Gross profit was adversely impacted by a write-down
of inventory of $08million for a European Digital TV
customer whose sales did not meet forecast. Gross profit for 2002 was $336million, or 37% of total
net revenue. Gross profit was adversely impacted by a write-down
of inventory of $20million related to Digital TV and PC
Security products that were discontinued during the year. Our gross profit has been and will continue to be affected by a
variety of factors, including competition, the volume of sales
in any given quarter, product configuration and mix, the
availability of new products, product enhancements, software and
services, and the cost and availability of components.
Accordingly, gross profit percentages are expected to continue
to fluctuate from period to period.

23 Table of Contents Research and development expenses consist primarily of employee
compensation and fees for the development of prototype products.
Research and development costs are related to hardware and chip
development, as well as software development. To date, the
period between achieving technological feasibility and
completion of software has been short, and software development
costs qualifying for capitalization have been insignificant.
Accordingly, we have not capitalized any software development
costs. Research and development expenses rose 9% in 2004 as compared to
2003, primarily due to an increase in development activity to
finalize and launch new products, as well as to higher costs
associated with the effect of foreign currency exchange related
to the payment of European employees in Euros. Research and development expenses increased 11% in 2003 compared
with 2002. In addition to higher costs associated with the
effect of foreign currency exchange related to the payment of
European employees in Euros, the increase was primarily related
to two additional factors. First, the 2003 figures include
expenses for our Indian research and development center, which
had previously been associated with product development for our
retail Digital Media and Video business, now accounted for as
discontinued operations. When we sold the retail Digital Media
and Video business in mid 2003, we retained the engineering
resources in India and phased in the costs of this organization
from discontinued operations to continuing operations through
the third and fourth quarters, with full expenses recognized in
continuing operations from approximately October 2003. Second,
our acquisition in May 2002 of Towitoko resulted in higher
research and development expenses in 2003, as Towitoko product
development costs were included for only about seven months of
fiscal 2002, but for the full 12months of 2003. We expect our research and development expenses to vary based on
future project demands.

Selling and marketing expenses consist primarily of employee
compensation as well as tradeshow participation and other
marketing costs. Selling and marketing expenses increased in the first half of
2004 as part of our strategy to launch new products and enter
new markets and then decreased in the second half of the year to
better align with actual revenue levels. While there was an
overall decrease in spending, this decrease was offset by
increased costs associated with the effect of foreign currency
exchange related to the payment of European employees in Euros.
For the year as a whole, sales and marketing expenses remained
at the same level in 2004 as 2003. Selling and marketing expenses increased 10% in 2003 compared
with 2002. In addition to higher costs associated with the
effect of foreign currency exchange related to the payment of
European employees in Euros, the increase was primarily related
to two additional factors. The first was an increase in
headcount and marketing costs from the acquisition of Towitoko
in May 2002. Towitoko-related expenses were included for only
about seven months of fiscal 2002, but for the full
12months of 2003. Second, we incurred incremental costs
during 2003 as we transitioned some employees from our retail
Digital Media and Video business to our Security organization. We expect our sales and marketing costs will vary as we continue
to align our resources to address existing and new market
opportunities. 24 Table of Contents

General and administrative expenses consist primarily of
compensation expenses for employees performing our
administrative functions, professional fees arising from legal,
auditing and other consulting services and charges for
allowances for doubtful accounts receivable. General and administrative expenses decreased 10% in 2004 as
compared with 2003 primarily as a result of cost reduction
measures taken by SCM in the second half of 2004, including a
small reduction in headcount and a reduction in expenditures for
third-party professional fees, including investor relations and
legal services. These cost reduction measures were partially
offset by increased costs associated with the effect of foreign
currency exchange related to the payment of European employees
in Euros and increased spending related to Sarbanes-Oxley
compliance. General and administrative expenses in 2003 increased 2% from
2002 levels primarily as a result higher costs associated with
the effect of foreign currency exchange related to the payment
of European employees in Euros, as well as incremental expenses
we incurred to execute a major restructuring of our
organization. These incremental expenses included legal and
professional costs, primarily in Europe, in conjunction with
various tax and Value Added Tax audit activities. We expect that our general and administrative costs will remain
high as a percentage of revenue relative to other companies our
size, as our global operations make it necessary to maintain our
current business infrastructure.

As of January1, 2002, we adopted SFASNo142
and as a consequence, stopped amortizing goodwill that resulted
from business combinations completed prior to June30,
2001. Intangible assets relating to continuing operations of
approximately $01million were reclassified to goodwill
and amortization ceased effective January1, 2002.   
Impairment of Goodwill and Intangibles As required under SFASNo142, SCM evaluates the
carrying value of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible
assets on our balance sheet from time to time and we will record
a charge for impairment whenever events or changes in
circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of long-lived
assets may not be recoverable. In 2004 we concluded that the carrying value of customer
relations and core technology relating to a past acquisition was
not supportable because the estimate of future cash flows
related to these intangible assets was not sufficient to recover
the carrying value of such intangibles. Accordingly, we took a
charge of $04million under SFAS No144 for
intangible asset impairment. In 2003, no charge for impairment was recorded. In the fourth quarter of 2002, we concluded that the carrying
value of goodwill and trade name assets relating to past
acquisitions was not supportable in light of our then-current
capital stock market valuation. 25 Table of Contents Accordingly, we took a charge of $154million for goodwill
and other indefinite-lived intangible asset impairment.   
Restructuring and Other Charges Credits During 2004, SCM incurred restructuring and other credits
related to continuing operations of $02million, which
resulted primarily from restructuring costs related to cost
reduction actions taken by management during the second half of
the year that included employee severance charges of
$08million and legal and professional costs of
$01million; other costs of $06million, primarily
related to settlement costs of claims asserted by a European
customer, as well as other legal settlements and related legal
costs; and offsetting credits of $17million resulting
from changes in estimates to European tax related matters. During 2003, we recorded restructuring and other charges of
$47million related to the closure and relocation of SCM
facilities following the planned and subsequently completed sale
of our Digital Media and Video business and the restructuring of
our organization. The greatest proportion of restructuring costs
related to employee severance. Other charges consisted of legal,
accounting and professional fees related to the announced
separation of our retail Digital Media and Video business and to
tax related costs. The greatest proportion of other charges was
for a change in estimate to tax provisions recorded in the
previous year. During 2002, we recorded restructuring and other charges of
$85million related to the closure and relocation of SCM
facilities resulting from the planned separation of our Digital
Media and Video business. The greatest proportion of
restructuring costs related to lease commitments and employee
severance. Other charges consisted of legal, accounting and
professional fees related to the announced separation of our
retail Digital Media and Video business and to tax related
costs. The greatest proportion of other charges was for a tax
provision that related to foreign taxes due from customers and
deemed non-collectible, followed by legal, accounting and
professional costs related to the announced separation of our
retail Digital Media and Video business.   
Loss from Investments From time to time, we make strategic investments in both private
and public companies. During each quarter, we evaluate our
investments for possible asset impairment. We examine a number
of factors, including the current economic conditions and
markets for each investment, as well as its cash position and
anticipated cash needs for the short and long term. We had no strategic investments in 2004 and therefore did not
record a loss or gain related to investments. During 2003, we recorded a loss of $04million from our
investment in Cryptovision. This was offset by a gain of
$02million from the sale of our investment in ActivCard.
The result was a loss on investments of $02million for
the year. During 2002, we wrote down our investment in ActivCard. The
result was a charge to the statement of operations of
$12million.   
Interest Income, Net Interest income, net consists of interest earned on invested
cash, offset by interest paid or accrued on outstanding debt. Interest income, net was $08million in each of the years
2004 and 2003 and $07million in 2002. The reduction in
investable cash balances in 2004 compared with 2003 was offset
by higher rates of return on invested funds. During 2003, cash
balances declined for part of the year, resulting in a decrease
in interest income from cash. This was offset by additional
interest income recorded for a tax refund that we received in
the third quarter of 2003. 26 Table of Contents   
Foreign Currency Gains and Losses and Other Income and
Expenses Foreign currency losses and other expenses were
$12million in 2004, compared with foreign currency gains
and other income of $07million in 2003 and foreign
currency losses and other expenses of $24million in 2002. During 2004, net foreign currency losses resulted from foreign
currency losses of $15million, due primarily to the
decrease in the value of the U.S.dollar as compared with
the euro, offset by other income of $03million, primarily
attributable to the settlement of transactional tax issues in
Europe. During 2003, a weakening U.S.dollar negatively impacted
foreign currency exchange rates. However, we did record a small
gain for the year on foreign currency transactions, which was
augmented by other income of $05million, resulting from
the refund to us of an investment made in prior periods. During 2002, we recorded foreign currency transaction losses
from the revaluation of receivables especially U.S.dollar
denominated receivables to the functional currency of our
subsidiaries in Singapore, Germany and France. In addition,
other expense of $04million was also generated from
various non-operating activities which occurred throughout the
year.   
Income Taxes In 2004, we recorded a net benefit for income taxes of
$02million, primarily due to changes in estimates for
taxes related to foreign tax jurisdictions. In 2003, we recorded a net benefit for income taxes of
$14million, which consisted of a $21million refund
for taxes paid in the U.S., offset by a tax provision of
$07million for other tax jurisdictions. In 2002, we recorded a provision for income taxes of
$32million, which consisted of the related valuation
allowance against deferred tax assets for our continuing
Security business recorded during the third quarter of 2002.   
Discontinued Operations During 2003, we completed two transactions to sell our retail
Digital Media and Video business. On July25, 2003, we
completed the sale of our digital video business to Pinnacle
Systems and on August1, 2003, we completed the sale of our
retail digital media reader business to Zio Corporation. Net revenue for the retail Digital Media and Video business in
2004 and 2003 was $16,000 and $248million, respectively.
Operating loss for the same periods was $03million and
$151million, respectively and net loss was
$02million and $143million, respectively. During 2004, net gain on disposal of the retail Digital Media
and Video business was $04million and included
$16million of inventory and asset recoveries, offset by
changes in estimate of lease commitments of $04million
and legal costs of $08million. During 2003, net loss on
disposal of the retail Digital Media and Video business was
$151million and included net inventory write-downs of
$05million; asset write-downs of $31million;
increased liabilities of $02million; severance of
$28million; contract settlements and lease commitments of
$45million; transactional costs to sell the businesses of
$26million; and other costs of $14million that
related to the write-down of the cumulative translation
adjustment for those subsidiaries considered to be substantially
liquidated. Liquidity and Capital Resources As of December31, 2004, our working capital, which we have
defined as current assets less current liabilities, was
$392million compared to $507million as of
December31, 2003. Working capital decreased in 2004 by
approximately $116million, due to a decrease in cash,
cash equivalents and short-term investments of
$89million, a decrease in accounts receivable of
$17million, a decrease in inventory of $08million
and a decrease in other current assets of $65million,
partially offset by a decrease in current liabilities of
$63million. 27 Table of Contents In 2004, cash and cash equivalents decreased by
$182million, primarily due to cash used in operating
activities of $112million and cash used in investing
activities of $99million, partially offset by cash
provided by financing activities of $08million and the
effect of exchange rates on cash and cash equivalents of
$21million. Cash used in continuing operations of
$108million was primarily due to a net loss of
$188million, depreciation and amortization of
$32million, the loss on disposal of fixed assets of
$01million, the impairment of intangible assets of
$04million, decreases in accounts receivable and
inventory of $16million and $14million,
respectively and an increase in other assets of
$73million. These were partially offset by decreases in
accounts payable of $22million, accrued expenses of
$27million, income taxes payable of $08million and
gain from discontinued operations of $03million. Cash
used in operating activities from discontinued operations was
$04million. Cash used in investing activities from continuing operations was
primarily for capital expenditures of $04million and net
purchases of short-term investments of $95million. Cash
used in financing activities was primarily from the issuance of
common stock of $08million related to the Companys
employee stock purchase and stock option programs. At
December31, 2004, our outstanding stock options as a
percentage of outstanding shares were 19%, compared to 19% at
December31, 2003. During the fourth quarter of 2002, our Board of Directors
authorized a stock repurchase program in which up to
$5million may be used to purchase shares of our stock on
the open market in the United States or Germany from time to
time over two years, depending on market conditions, share
prices and other factors. Such repurchases could be used to
offset the issuance of additional shares resulting from employee
stock option exercises and the sale of shares under the employee
stock purchase plan. No shares were repurchased under the stock
repurchase program during fiscal 2004 and the program ended in
the fourth quarter of 2004. During the two years in which the
program was active, we repurchased a total of
618,400shares of our common stock for an aggregate of
$28million. The Company has two separate overdraft facilities for the
Companys manufacturing facility of 40million and
59million Singapore dollars approximately
$24million and $36million as of December31,
2004 with base interest rates of 48% and 70% respectively.
All of the facilities are unsecured and due upon demand. There
were no amounts outstanding under any of these credit facilities
as of December31, 2004. During 2004, we used $108million in cash to fund
continuing operations. In the coming months, we expect to
continue to use cash to fund operations, and we currently expect
that our current capital resources and available borrowings
should be sufficient to meet our operating and capital
requirements through at least the end of 2005. We may, however,
seek additional debt or equity financing prior to that time.
There can be no assurance that additional capital will be
available to us on favorable terms or at all. The sale of
additional debt or equity securities may cause dilution to
existing stockholders. Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements We have not entered into off-balance sheet arrangements, or
issued guarantees to third parties. Contractual Obligations The following summarizes expected cash requirements for

28 Table of Contents Factors That May Affect Future Results Our business and results of operations are subject to
numerous risks, uncertainties and other factors that you should
be aware of, some of which are described below. The risks,
uncertainties and other factors described below are not the only
ones facing our company. Additional risks, uncertainties and
other factors not presently known to us or that we currently
deem immaterial may also impair our business operations. If any of the following actually occur, our business,
financial condition, results of operations, cash flows or
product market share could be materially adversely affected and
the trading price of our common stock could decline
substantially.   
We have incurred operating losses and may not achieve
profitability. We have a history of losses with an accumulated deficit of
$1803million as of December31, 2004. We may
continue to incur losses in the future and may be unable to
achieve or maintain profitability.   
Our quarterly operating results will likely
fluctuate. Our quarterly operating results have varied greatly in the past
and will likely vary greatly in the future depending upon a
number of factors. Many of these factors are beyond our control.
Our revenues, gross margins and operating results may fluctuate
significantly from quarter to quarter due to, among other things   
business and economic conditions overall and in our markets     
the timing and amount of orders we receive from our customers
that may be tied to budgetary cycles, product plans or equipment
roll-out schedules     
cancellations or delays of customer product orders, or the loss
of a significant customer     
our backlog and inventory levels     
our customer and distributor inventory levels and product
returns     
competition     
new product announcements or introductions     
our ability to develop, introduce and market new products and
product enhancements on a timely basis, if at all     
our ability to successfully market and sell products into new
geographic or customer market segments     
the sales volume, product configuration and mix of products that
we sell     
technological changes in the market for our products     
reductions in the average selling prices that we are able to
charge due to competition or other factors     
fluctuations in the value of foreign currencies against the
U.S.dollar     
the timing and amount of marketing and research and development
expenditures     
our investment experience related to our strategic minority
equity investments;and     
costs related to events such as acquisitions, organizational
restructuring, litigation and write-off of investments. Due to these and other factors, our revenues may not increase or
even remain at their current levels. Because a majority of our
operating expenses are fixed, a small variation in our revenue
can cause significant variations in our earnings from quarter to
quarter and our operating results may vary significantly in
future periods. Therefore, our historical results may not be a
reliable indicator of our future performance. 29 Table of Contents   
It is difficult to estimate operating results prior to the
end of a quarter. We do not typically maintain a significant level of backlog. As
a result, revenue in any quarter depends on contracts entered
into or orders booked and shipped in that quarter. Historically,
many of our customers have tended to make a significant portion
of their purchases towards the end of the quarter, in part
because they believe they are able to negotiate lower prices and
more favorable terms. This trend makes predicting revenues
difficult. The timing of closing larger orders increases the
risk of quarter-to-quarter fluctuation. If orders forecasted for
a specific group of customers for a particular quarter are not
realized or revenues are not otherwise recognized in that
quarter, our operating results for that quarter could be
materially adversely affected.   
Our strategy to grow revenue and become profitable depends
on our ability to identify and secure new customers and market
opportunities at a faster rate than the rate of decline in our
sales from legacy customers and products. Over the last several quarters, sales of our legacy Digital TV
products have declined significantly, primarily due to
competition for our traditional customer base. Sales of our PC
Security products have also declined, to a lesser degree, due to
the slow pace of large digital security projects which could
utilize our products. We have adopted a strategy to address our
declining revenue that is based on introducing new Digital TV
and PC Security products to offset the rate of decline of our
legacy Digital TV product sales and to address new market
opportunities. To date, this strategy has been only partially
successful. Technical issues with our new conditional access
modules for Europe have limited their sales and competition in
this market segment has increased. Government delays with
issuing digital certificates to operators have delayed
deployment of our CableCARD modules in Korea and as a result,
shipment of our modules to Korean operators has been postponed.
Our physical access control product for the U.S.government
faces substantial competition, and there is no guarantee that we
will be successful in securing a significant portion of this
market opportunity. If we are not able to sell and ship new
products into the new markets we have identified, we may not be
able to counter our revenue decline and our losses could
increase.   
Our listing on the Prime Standard of the Frankfurt Stock
Exchange exposes our stock price to additional risks of
fluctuation. Our common stock is listed both on the Prime Standard of the
Frankfurt Stock Exchange and on the Nasdaq Stock Market and we
currently experience a significant volume of trading on the
Prime Standard. Because of this, factors that would not
otherwise affect a stock traded solely on Nasdaq Stock Market
may cause our stock price to fluctuate. For example, investors
outside the United States may react differently and more
negatively than investors in the United States to events such as
acquisitions, one-time charges and lower than expected revenue
or earnings announcements. Any negative reaction by investors in
Europe to such events could cause our stock price to decrease
significantly. The European economy and market conditions in
general, or downturns on the Prime Standard specifically,
regardless of the Nasdaq Stock Market conditions, could
negatively impact our stock price. In addition, our inclusion or
removal from European stock indices could impact our stock
trading patterns and price. For example, in September 2004 our
stock was removed from the European TecDAX index of technology
companies. The performance of companies on the TecDAX is widely
publicized in Europe and stocks in the TecDAX may experience
volatility related to that publicity. As a result of our removal
from the TecDAX, some investors decreased their positions in our
stock and we experienced significantly higher trading volumes
and a reduction in our stock price.   
Our stock price has been and is likely to remain
volatile. Over the past few years, the Nasdaq Stock Market and the Prime
Standard of the Frankfurt Exchange have experienced significant
price and volume fluctuations that have particularly affected
the market prices of the stocks of technology companies. For
example, during the 12-month period from March 10, 2004 to
March9, 2005, the closing prices for our common stock on
the Nasdaq Stock Market ranged between $251 30 Table of Contents and $821per share. Volatility in our stock price on
either or both exchanges may result from a number of factors,
including, among others   
variations in our or our competitors financial and/or
operational results     
the fluctuation in market value of comparable companies in any
of our markets     
expected or announced relationships with other companies     
comments and forecasts by securities analysts     
trading patterns of our stock on the Nasdaq Stock Market or
Prime Standard of the Frankfurt Stock Exchange     
the inclusion or removal of our stock from market indices, such
as groups of technology stocks or other indices     
any loss of key management     
announcements of technological innovations or new products by us
or our competitors     
litigation developments;and     
general market downturns. In the past, companies that have experienced volatility in the
market price of their stock have been the object of securities
class action litigation. If we were the object of securities
class action litigation, it could result in substantial costs
and a diversion of our managements attention and resources.   
A significant portion of our sales comes from a small
number of customers and the loss of one of more of these
customers could negatively impact our operating results. Our products are generally targeted at OEM customers in the
consumer electronics, digital photography, computer and
conditional access system industries, as well as digital
television operators, broadcasters and distributors, the
government sector and corporate enterprises. Sales to a
relatively small number of customers historically have accounted
for a significant percentage of our total revenues. For example,
three customers accounted for approximately 19% of our total net
revenue in the twelve months ended December31, 2004 and
two customers accounted for approximately 29% of our total net
revenue in the twelve months ended December31, 2003. The
July 2003 divestiture of our retail Digital Media and Video
business increased our dependence on a small customer base. Any
additional consolidation of our business lines could further
increase our dependence on a limited number of customers. We
expect that sales of our products to a relatively small number
of customers will continue to account for a high percentage of
our total sales for the foreseeable future. The loss or
reduction of orders from a significant customer, including those
due to product performance issues, changes in customer buying
patterns, or market, economic or competitive conditions in our
market segments, could result in decreased revenues and/or
inventory or receivables write-offs and otherwise harm our
business and operating results.   
Sales of our products depend on the development of several
emerging product markets. We sell our products primarily to emerging product markets that
have not yet reached a stage of mass adoption or deployment. If
demand for products in these markets does not develop further
and grow sufficiently, our revenue and gross profit margins
could decline or fail to grow. We cannot predict the future
growth rate, if any, or size or composition of the market for
any of our products. The demand and market acceptance for our
products, as is common for new technologies, is subject to high
levels of uncertainty and risk and may be influenced by several
factors, including, but not limited to, the following   
general economic conditions     
the slow pace and uncertainty of adoption in Europe and Asia of
open systems digital television platforms that require
conditional access modules, such as ours, to decrypt pay-TV
broadcasts 31 Table of Contents   
the strength of entrenched security and set-top receiver
suppliers in the United States who may resist the use of
removable conditional access modules, such as ours, and prevent
or delay opening the U.S.digital television market to
greater competition     
the adoption and/or continuation of industry or government
regulations or policies requiring the use of products such as
our conditional access modules or smart card readers     
the timing of adoption of smart cards by the
U.S.government, European banks and other enterprises for
large scale security programs beyond those in place today     
the ability of financial institutions, corporate enterprises and
the U.S.government to agree on industry specifications and
to develop and deploy smart card-based applications that will
drive demand for smart card readers such as ours;and     
the ability of high capacity flash memory cards to drive demand
for digital media readers, such as ours, that enable rapid
transfer of large amounts of data, for example digital
photographs.   
Our products may have defects, which could damage our
reputation, decrease market acceptance of our products, cause us
to lose customers and revenue and result in liability to us,
including costly litigation. Products such as our conditional access modules and smart card
readers may contain defects for many reasons, including
defective design, defective material or software
interoperability issues. Often, these defects are not detected
until after the products have been shipped. If any of our
products contain defects or perceived defects or have
reliability, quality or compatibility problems or perceived
problems, our reputation might be damaged significantly, we
could lose or experience a delay in market acceptance of the
affected product or products and we might be unable to retain
existing customers or attract new customers. In addition, these
defects could interrupt or delay sales or our ability to
recognize revenue for products shipped could be impacted. For
example, in late January 2004 we learned that Digital TV modules
shipped to a customer during the fourth quarter of 2003
encountered performance issues and that the customer was
unwilling to pay for the products until all issues were
resolved. As a result, we did not recognize revenue for the
shipments of those products in the fourth quarter of 2003 and
our revenue levels in that quarter were below the range of
estimates originally provided by management. In the event of a defect or other problem or a perceived defect
or problem, we may have to invest significant capital,
technical, managerial and other resources to investigate and
correct the potential defect or problems and potentially divert
these resources from other development efforts. If we are unable
to provide a solution to the potential defect or problem that is
acceptable to our customer, we may be required to incur
substantial product recall, repair or replacement or even
litigation costs. These costs could have a material adverse
effect on our business and operating results In addition, because the majority of our customers rely on our
digital security products to prevent unauthorized access to
their digital information, a malfunction of or design defect in
our products or even a perceived defect could result in legal
or warranty claims against us for damages resulting from
security breaches. If such claims are adversely decided against
us, the potential liability could be substantial and have a
material adverse effect on our business and operating results.
Furthermore, the publicity associated with any such claim,
whether or not decided against us, could adversely affect our
reputation. In addition, a well-publicized security breach
involving smart card-based and other security systems could
adversely affect the markets perception of products like
ours in general, or our products in particular, regardless of
whether the breach is actual or attributable to our products.
Any of the foregoing events could cause demand for our products
to decline, which would cause our business and operating results
to suffer.   
If we do not achieve our targeted levels of revenues or
anticipate the correct mix of products that will be sold, we may
be required to record further charges related to excess
inventories. Due to the unpredictable nature of the demand for our products,
we are required to place orders with our suppliers for
components, finished products and services in advance of actual
customer commitments to purchase these products. Significant
unanticipated fluctuations in demand could result in costly
excess 32 Table of Contents production or inventories. If we were to determine that we could
not utilize or sell this inventory, we may be required to write
down its value. In order to minimize the negative financial
impact of excess production, we may be required to significantly
reduce the sales price of the product to increase demand, which
in turn could result in a reduction in the value of the original
inventory purchase. Writing down inventory or reducing product
prices could adversely impact our cost of revenues and financial
condition. For example, we recorded inventory write-downs in
each of the four quarters of 2004, totaling $59million in
charges to inventory for our Digital TV, PC Security and Flash
Media Interface Products. These charges to our cost of revenues
negatively impacted our gross and operating margins for each of
the four quarters of 2004 and for the year as a whole.   
We rely heavily on our strategic relationships. If we are unable to anticipate market trends and the price,
performance and functionality requirements for our products, we
may not be able to develop and sell products that are
commercially viable and widely accepted. We must collaborate
closely with our customers, suppliers and other strategic
partners to ensure that critical development, marketing and
distribution projects proceed in a coordinated manner. Also,
this collaboration is important because these relationships
increase our exposure to information necessary to anticipate
trends and plan product development. If any of our current
relationships terminate or otherwise deteriorate, or if we are
unable to enter into future alliances that provide us with
comparable insight into market trends, our product development
and marketing efforts may be adversely affected, and we could
lose sales.   
Our business could suffer if we or our third-party
manufacturers cannot meet production requirements. Most of our products are manufactured outside the United States,
either by us or by contract manufacturers. Any significant delay
in our ability to obtain adequate supplies of our products from
our current or alternative sources would materially and
adversely affect our business and operating results. Our
reliance on foreign manufacturing poses a number of risks,
including, but not limited to   
difficulties in staffing     
currency fluctuations     
potentially adverse tax consequences     
unexpected changes in regulatory requirements     
tariffs and other trade barriers     
political and economic instability     
lack of control over the manufacturing process and ultimately
over the quality of our products     
late delivery of our products, whether because of limited access
to our product components, transportation delays and
interruptions, difficulties in staffing, or disruptions such as
natural disasters     
capacity limitations of our manufacturers, particularly in the
context of new large contracts for our products, whether because
our manufacturers lack the required capacity or are unwilling to
produce the quantities we desire;and     
obsolescence of our hardware products at the end of the
manufacturing cycle. If we or any of our contract manufacturers cannot meet our
production requirements, we may be required to rely on other
contract manufacturing sources or identify and qualify new
contract manufacturers. Despite efforts to do so, we may be
unable to identify or qualify new contract manufacturers in a
timely manner or at all or on reasonable terms and these new
manufacturers may not allocate sufficient capacity to us in
order to meet our requirements. 33 Table of Contents   
Our future success will depend on our ability to keep pace
with technological change and meet the needs of our target
markets and customers. The markets for our products are characterized by rapidly
changing technology and the need to differentiate our products
through technological enhancements, and in some cases, price.
Our customers needs change, new technologies are
introduced into the market, and industry standards are still
evolving. As a result, product life cycles are short, and
frequently we must develop new products quickly in order to
remain competitive in light of new market requirements. Rapid
changes in technology, or the adoption of new industry
standards, could render our existing products obsolete and
unmarketable. If a product is deemed to be obsolete or
unmarketable, then we might have to reduce revenue expectations
or write off inventories for that product. For example, in the
second quarter of 2004 we determined that we would no longer be
able to sell one of our legacy Digital TV products because of a
sharp decrease in market demand due to competition from
unlicensed products in the market. We also determined that a
newer Digital TV product was unmarketable after we received
notice from a customer that it would no longer purchase the
product, which had been customized for that customer. As a
result, we recognized significantly less revenue than
anticipated and wrote down significant levels of inventory in
the second quarter, and reduced our future expectations for
revenue related to these products. Our future success will depend upon our ability to enhance our
current products and to develop and introduce new products with
clearly differentiated benefits that address the increasingly
sophisticated needs of our customers and that keep pace with
technological developments, new competitive product offerings
and emerging industry standards. For example, we are beginning
to bring to market a line of smart card readers designed to
provide secure physical access to U.S.government buildings
and other facilities. Industry specifications and market
requirements for physical access are still evolving and
competition for this market is already well established. We must
be able to demonstrate that our products have features or
functions that are clearly differentiated from existing or
anticipated competitive offerings, or we may be unsuccessful in
selling these products. In addition, in cases where we are
selected to supply products based on features or capabilities
that are still under development, we must be able to complete
our product design and delivery process on a timely basis, or
risk losing current and any future revenue from those products. In some cases, we depend upon partners who provide one or more
components of the overall solution for a customer in conjunction
with our products. If our partners do not adapt their products
and technologies to new market or distribution requirements, or
if their products do not work well, then we may not be able to
sell our products into certain markets. Because we operate in markets for which industry-wide standards
have not yet been fully set, it is possible that any standards
eventually adopted could prove disadvantageous to or
incompatible with our business model and product lines. For
example, authentication tokens other than smart cards, such as
USB tokens, could become a preferred solution for secure network
or business access. If any of the standards supported by us do
not achieve or sustain market acceptance, our business and
operating results would be materially and adversely affected.   
Our markets are highly competitive. The markets for our products are intensely competitive and
characterized by rapidly changing technology. We believe that
the principal competitive factors affecting the markets for our
products include   
the extent to which products must support existing industry
standards and provide interoperability     
the extent to which standards are widely adopted and product
interoperability is required within industry segments     
technical features     
quality and reliability     
our ability to develop new products quickly to satisfy new
market and customer requirements 34 Table of Contents   
ease of use     
strength of distribution channels;and     
price. We currently experience competition from a number of companies
in each of our target market segments and we believe that
competition in our markets is likely to intensify as a result of
increasing demand for digital access products. We may not be
successful in competing against offerings from other companies,
and could lose business as a result. In our Digital TV business, we are adversely affected by
competition from companies that provide conditional access
modules using unlicensed, emulated conditional access decryption
systems. We have lost and will likely continue to lose business
to these competitors and their presence causes us to implement
more costly anti-piracy mechanisms on our own products to
prevent their unlicensed use. We also experience indirect competition from certain of our
customers who currently offer alternative products or are
expected to introduce competitive products in the future. For
example, we sell our products to many OEMs who incorporate our
products into their offerings or who resell our products in
order to provide a more complete solution to their customers. If
our OEM customers develop their own products to replace ours,
this would result in a loss of sales to those customers as well
as increased competition for our products in the marketplace. In
addition, these OEM customers could cancel outstanding orders
for our products, which could cause us to write down inventory
already designated for those customers. We may in the future
face competition from these and other parties that develop
digital data security products based upon approaches similar to
or different from those employed by us. In addition, the market
for digital information security and access control products may
ultimately be dominated by approaches other than the approach
marketed by us. Many of our current and potential competitors have significantly
greater financial, technical, marketing, purchasing and other
resources than we do. As a result, our competitors may be able
to respond more quickly to new or emerging technologies or
standards and to changes in customer requirements. Our
competitors may also be able to devote greater resources to the
development, promotion and sale of products and may be able to
deliver competitive products at a lower end user price. Current
and potential competitors have established or may establish
cooperative relationships among themselves or with third parties
to increase the ability of their products to address the needs
of our prospective customers. Therefore, new competitors, or
alliances among competitors, may emerge and rapidly acquire
significant market share. Increased competition is likely to
result in price reductions, reduced operating margins and loss
of market share.   
Sales of smart card readers to the U.S.government
could be impacted by uncertainty of timelines and budgetary
allocations as well as by the delay of standards for information
technology ITprojects. Historically, we have sold a significant proportion of our smart
card reader products to the U.S.government and we
anticipate that some portion of our future revenues will also
come from the U.S.government. The timing of
U.S.government smart card projects is not always certain.
For example, during 2003, our sales of smart card reader
products for the U.S.governments Common Access Card
program significantly decreased from 2002 levels as this program
neared full deployment. While the U.S.government has
announced plans for several new smart card-based security
projects, none have yet reached a stage of sustained high volume
card or reader deployment, in part due to the lack of agreement
on specifications for a new federally mandated set of identity
credentials. In addition, government expenditures on IT projects
have varied in the past and we expect them to vary in the
future. As a result of shifting priorities in the federal budget
and in Homeland Security, U.S.government spending may be
reallocated away from IT projects, such as smart card
deployments. The slowing or delay of government projects for any
reason could negatively impact our sales.   
We may have to take back unsold inventory from our
customers. Although our contractual obligations to accept returned products
from our distributors and OEM customers are limited, if demand
is less than anticipated, these customers may ask that we accept
returned 35 Table of Contents products that they do not believe they can sell. We may
determine that it is in our best interest to accept returns in
order to maintain good relations with our customers. While we
have experienced some product returns to date, returns may
increase beyond present levels in the future. Once these
products have been returned, we may be required to take
additional inventory reserves to reflect the decreased market
value of slow-selling returned inventory, even if the products
are in good working order. In this regard, we incurred charges
related to inventory write-downs in 2002, 2003 and 2004.   
We have global operations, which require significant
financial, managerial and administrative resources. Our business model includes the management of three separate
product lines that address three disparate market opportunities,
which are dispersed geographically. While there is some shared
technology across our products, each product line requires
significant research and development effort to address the
evolving needs of our customers and markets. To support our
development and sales efforts, we maintain company offices and
business operations in several locations around the world.
Managing our various development, sales and administrative
operations places a significant burden on our financial systems
and has resulted in a level of operational spending that is
disproportionately high compared to our current revenue levels.
Based on our business model and geographic structure, if we do
not grow revenues, we will likely not reach profitability. Operating in diverse geographic locations also imposes
significant burdens on our managerial resources. In particular,
our management must   
divert a significant amount of time and energy to manage
employees and contractors from diverse cultural backgrounds and
who speak different languages     
maintain sufficient internal financial controls in multiple
geographic locations that may have different control
environments     
manage different product lines for different markets     
manage our supply and distribution channels across different
countries and business practices;and     
coordinate these efforts to produce an integrated business
effort, focus and vision. Any failure to effectively manage our operations globally could
have a material adverse effect on our business and operating
results.   
We conduct the majority of our operations outside the
United States. Economic, political, regulatory and other risks
associated with international sales and operations could have an
adverse effect on our results of operation. We were originally a German corporation and we continue to
conduct a substantial portion of our business in Europe.
Approximately 69% and 76% of our revenues for the years ended
December31, 2004 and 2003, respectively, were derived from
customers located outside the United States. Because a
significant number of our principal customers are located in
other countries, we anticipate that international sales will
continue to account for a substantial portion of our revenues.
As a result, a significant portion of our sales and operations
may continue to be subject to risks associated with foreign
operations, any of which could impact our sales and/or our
operational performance. These risks include, but are not
limited to   
changes in foreign currency exchange rates     
changes in a specific countrys or regions political
or economic conditions and stability, particularly in emerging
markets     
unexpected changes in foreign laws and regulatory requirements     
potentially adverse tax consequences     
longer accounts receivable collection cycles     
difficulty in managing widespread sales and manufacturing
operations;and 36 Table of Contents   
less effective protection of intellectual property. In addition, the ongoing involvement of U.S.military
forces in Iraq coupled with the possibility of terrorist attacks
could have an adverse effect upon an already weakened world
economy and could cause U.S.and foreign businesses to slow
spending on products and services and to delay sales cycles. The
economic uncertainty or other consequences resulting from the
current military action in Iraq could negatively impact consumer
as well as business confidence, at least in the short term.   
Our key personnel are critical to our business, and such
key personnel may not remain with us in the future. We depend on the continued employment of our senior executive
officers and other key management and technical personnel. If
any of our key personnel were to leave and not be replaced, our
business could be adversely affected. We also believe that our future success will depend in large
part on our ability to attract and retain highly qualified
technical and management personnel. However, competition for
such personnel is intense. We may not be able to retain our key
technical and management employees or to attract, assimilate or
retain other highly qualified technical and management personnel
in the future.   
We are subject to a lengthy sales cycle and additional
delays could result in significant fluctuations in our quarterly
operating results. Our initial sales cycle for a new OEM customer usually takes a
minimum of six to nine months. During this sales cycle, we may
expend substantial financial and managerial resources with no
assurance that a sale will ultimately result. The length of a
new customers sales cycle depends on a number of factors,
many of which we may not be able to control. These factors
include the customers product and technical requirements
and the level of competition we face for that customers
business. Any delays in the sales cycle for new customers could
delay or reduce our receipt of new revenue and could cause us to
expend more resources to obtain new customer wins. If we are
unsuccessful in managing sales cycles, our business could be
adversely affected.   
We face risks associated with our past and future
acquisitions. A component of our business strategy is to seek to buy
businesses, products and technologies that complement or augment
our existing businesses, products and technologies. From time to
time we may buy or make investments in additional complementary
companies, products and technologies. Any acquisition could
expose us to significant risks.   
Use of Cash or Issuance of Securities A potential investment is likely to result in the use of our
limited cash balances or require that we issue debt or equity
securities to fund the acquisition. Future equity financings
would be dilutive to the existing holders of our common stock.
Future debt financings could involve restrictive covenants that
could have an adverse effect on our business operations. There
is no assurance that we would be able to obtain equity or debt
financing on favorable terms or at all.   
Acquisition Charges We may incur acquisition-related accounting charges in
connection with an acquisition, which could adversely affect our
operating results. 37 Table of Contents   
Integration Risks Integration of an acquired company or technology frequently is a
complex, time consuming and expensive process. The successful
integration of an acquisition requires, among other things, that
we   
integrate and train key management, sales and other personnel     
integrate the acquired products into our product offerings both
from an engineering and a sales and marketing perspective     
integrate and support pre-existing supplier, distributor and
customer relationships     
coordinate research and development efforts;and     
consolidate duplicate facilities and functions. The geographic distance between the companies, the complexity of
the technologies and operations being integrated, and the
disparate corporate cultures being combined may increase the
difficulties of integrating an acquired company or technology.
Managements focus on the integration of operations may
distract attention from our day-to-day business and may disrupt
key research and development, marketing or sales efforts. In
addition, it is common in the technology industry for aggressive
competitors to attract customers and recruit key employees away
from companies during the integration phase of an acquisition.   
Unanticipated Assumption of Liabilities If we buy a company, we may have to incur or assume that
companys liabilities, including liabilities that are
unknown at the time of the acquisition.   
We have a limited number of suppliers of key components,
and may experience difficulties in obtaining components for
which there is significant demand. We rely upon a limited number of suppliers of several key
components of our products, which may expose us to certain risks
including, without limitation, an inadequate supply of
components, price increases, late deliveries and poor component
quality. In addition, some of the basic components we use in our
products, such as flash memory for our digital media readers,
are in great demand. This could result in the components not
being available to us timely or at all, particularly if larger
companies have ordered more significant volumes of the
components; or in higher prices being charged for the
components. Disruption or termination of the supply of
components or software used in our products could delay
shipments of these products. These delays could have a material
adverse effect on our business and operating results and could
also damage relationships with current and prospective customers.   
We may be exposed to risks of intellectual property
infringement by third parties. Our success depends significantly upon our proprietary
technology. We currently rely on a combination of patent,
copyright and trademark laws, trade secrets, confidentiality
agreements and contractual provisions to protect our proprietary
rights. We seek to protect our software, documentation and other
written materials under trade secret and copyright laws, which
afford only limited protection. Although we often seek to
protect our proprietary technology through patents, it is
possible that no new patents will be issued, that our
proprietary products or technologies are not patentable or that
any issued patent will fail to provide us with any competitive
advantages. There has been a great deal of litigation in the technology
industry regarding intellectual property rights and from time to
time we may be required to use litigation to protect our
proprietary technology. This may result in our incurring
substantial costs and there is no assurance that we would be
successful in any such litigation. Despite our efforts to protect our proprietary rights,
unauthorized parties may attempt to copy aspects of our products
or to use our proprietary information and software without
authorization. In addition, the laws of some foreign countries
do not protect proprietary and intellectual property rights to
as great an extent as do the 38 Table of Contents laws of the United States. Because many of our products are sold
and a portion of our business is conducted overseas, primarily
in Europe, our exposure to intellectual property risks may be
higher. Our means of protecting our proprietary and intellectual
property rights may not be adequate. There is a risk that our
competitors will independently develop similar technology,
duplicate our products or design around patents or other
intellectual property rights. If we are unsuccessful in
protecting our intellectual property or our products or
technologies are duplicated by others, our business could be
harmed.   
Changes to financial accounting standards may affect our
results of operations and cause us to change our business
practices. We prepare our financial statements to conform with generally
accepted accounting principles, or GAAP, in the United States.
These accounting principles are subject to interpretation by the
American Institute of Certified Public Accountants, the
Securities and Exchange Commission and various bodies formed to
interpret and create appropriate accounting policies. A change
in those policies can have a significant effect on our reported
results and may affect our reporting of transactions completed
before a change is announced. Changes to those rules or the
questioning of current practices may adversely affect our
reported financial results or the way we conduct our business.
For example, under the recently issued Financial Accounting
Standard Board Statement No, 123R, we will be required to apply
certain expense recognition provisions beginning July1,
2005 to share-based payments to employees using the fair value
method. This new accounting policy and any other changes in
accounting policies in the future may result in significant
accounting charges.   
We face costs and risks associated with compliance with
Section404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. Under section404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, on an
annual basis our management is required to report on, and our
independent auditors are required to attest to, the
effectiveness of our internal controls over financial reporting.
The process of maintaining and evaluating the effectiveness of
these controls is expensive, time-consuming and requires
significant attention from our management. While we believe that
our internal controls are effective, we cannot be certain that
we will consistently be able to report that our controls are
without material weakness, or to complete our evaluation of
those controls in a timely fashion. Similarly, we cannot be
certain that our auditors will consistently be able to attest
that no material weakness in our controls exists. If we fail to maintain an effective system of disclosure
controls or internal control over financial reporting, including
satisfaction of the requirements of Section404 of the
Sarbanes-Oxley Act, we may discover material weaknesses that we
would then be required to disclose. We may not be able to
accurately or timely report on our financial results, and we
might be subject to investigation by regulatory authorities. As
a result, the financial position of our business could be
harmed; current and potential future shareholders could lose
confidence in the Company and/or its reported financial results,
which may cause a negative effect on the trading price of our
common stock; and we could be exposed to litigation or
regulatory proceedings, which may be costly or divert management
attention. In addition, all internal control systems, no matter how well
designed, have inherent limitations. Therefore, even those
systems determined to be effective can provide only reasonable
assurance with respect to the preparation and presentation of
financial statements. Projections of any evaluation of controls
effectiveness to future periods are subject to risks. Over time,
controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions
or deterioration in the degree of compliance with policies or
procedures.   
We face risks from litigation. From time to time, we may be subject to litigation, which could
include claims regarding infringement of the intellectual
property rights of third parties, product defects,
employment-related claims, and claims related to acquisitions,
dispositions or restructurings. Any claims or litigation may be
time-consuming and costly, cause product shipment delays,
require us to redesign our products, require us to accept return
of product and 39 Table of Contents write off inventory, or have other adverse effects on our
business. Any of the foregoing could have a material adverse
effect on our results of operations and could require us to pay
significant monetary damages. We expect the likelihood of intellectual property infringement
and misappropriation claims to increase as the number of
products and competitors in our markets grows and as we
increasingly incorporate third-party technology into our
products. As a result of infringement claims, we could be
required to license intellectual property from a third party or
redesign our products. Licenses may not be offered when we need
them or on acceptable terms. If we do obtain licenses from third
parties, we may be required to pay license fees or royalty
payments or we may be required to license some of our
intellectual property to others in return for such licenses. If
we are unable to obtain a license that is necessary for us to
manufacture our allegedly infringing products, we could be
required to suspend the manufacture of products or stop our
suppliers from using processes that may infringe the rights of
third parties. We may also be unsuccessful in redesigning our
products. Our suppliers and customers may be subject to
infringement claims based on intellectual property included in
our products. We have historically agreed to indemnify our
suppliers and customers for patent infringement claims relating
to our products. The scope of this indemnity varies, but may, in
some instances, include indemnification for damages and
expenses, including attorneys fees. We may periodically
engage in litigation as a result of these indemnification
obligations. Our insurance policies exclude coverage for
third-party claims for patent infringement.   
We are exposed to credit risk on our accounts receivable.
This risk is heightened in times of economic weakness. We distribute our products both through third-party resellers
and directly to certain customers. A substantial majority of our
outstanding trade receivables are not covered by collateral or
credit insurance. While we seek to monitor and limit our
exposure to credit risk on our trade and non-trade receivables,
we may not be effective in limiting credit risk and avoiding
losses. Additionally, if the global economy and regional
economies deteriorate, one or more of our customers could
experience a weakened financial condition and we could incur a
material loss or losses as a result.   
Factors beyond our control could disrupt our
operations. We face a number of potential business interruption risks that
are beyond our control. For example, in past periods, the State
of California experienced intermittent power shortages and
interruption of service to some business customers.
Additionally, we may experience natural disasters that could
disrupt our business. For example, our corporate headquarters
are located near a major earthquake fault. Power shortages,
earthquakes or other disruptions could affect our ability to
report timely financial statements.   
Provisions in our agreements, charter documents, Delaware
law and our rights plan may delay or prevent the acquisition of
our Company, which could decrease the value of your
shares. Our certificate of incorporation and bylaws and Delaware law
contain provisions that could make it more difficult for a third
party to acquire us or enter into a material transaction with us
without the consent of our board of directors. These provisions
include a classified board of directors and limitations on
actions by our stockholders by written consent. Delaware law
imposes some restrictions on mergers and other business
combinations between us and any holder of 15% or more of our
outstanding common stock. In addition, our board of directors
has the right to issue preferred stock without stockholder
approval, which could be used to dilute the stock ownership of a
potential hostile acquirer. We have adopted a stockholder rights plan. The triggering and
exercise of the rights would cause substantial dilution to a
person or group that attempts to acquire SCM on terms or in a
manner not approved by SCMs Board of Directors, except
pursuant to an offer conditioned upon redemption of the rights.
While the rights are not intended to prevent a takeover of SCM,
they may have the effect of rendering more difficult or
discouraging an acquisition of SCM that was deemed to be
undesirable by our Board of Directors. Although we believe the above provisions and the adoption of a
rights plan may provide for an opportunity to receive a higher
bid by requiring potential acquirers to negotiate with our Board
of Directors 40 Table of Contents these provisions will apply even if the offer were to be
considered adequate by some of our stockholders. Also, because
these provisions may be deemed to discourage a change of
control, they could decrease the value of our common stock.   
ITEM7A.
QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK Foreign Currencies We transact business in various foreign currencies, primarily in
certain European countries, Singapore, India and Japan.
Accordingly, we are subject to exposure from adverse movements
in foreign currency exchange rates. This exposure is primarily
related to local currency denominated sales and operating
expenses in Europe, Singapore, India and Japan, where we conduct
business in both local currencies and U.S.dollars. We
assess the need to utilize financial instruments to hedge
foreign currency exposure on an ongoing basis. Our foreign currency transactions gains and losses are primarily
the result of the revaluation of intercompany
receivables/payables denominated in U.S.dollars and
trade receivables denominated in a currency other than the
functional currency to the functional currency of the
subsidiary. We have performed a sensitivity analysis as of
December31, 2004 and 2003 using a modeling technique which
evaluated the hypothetical impact of a 10% movement in the value
of the U.S.dollar compared to the functional currency of
the subsidiary, with all other variables held constant, to
determine the incremental transaction gains or losses that would
have been incurred. The foreign exchange rates used were based
on market rates in effect at December31, 2004 and 2003.
The results of this hypothetical sensitivity analysis indicated
that a hypothetical 10% movement in foreign currency exchange
rates would result in increased foreign currency gains or losses
of $18million and $62million for 2004 and 2003,
respectively. Fixed Income Investments We do not use derivative financial instruments in our investment
portfolio. We do, however, limit our exposure to interest rate
and credit risk by establishing and strictly monitoring clear
policies and guidelines for our fixed income portfolios. At the
present time, the maximum duration of any investment in our
portfolio is limited to two years. The guidelines also establish
credit quality standards, limits on exposure to one issue,
issuer, as well as the type of instrument. Due to the limited
duration and credit risk criteria we have established, our
exposure to market and credit risk is not expected to be
material. At December31, 2004, we had $312million in cash and
cash equivalents and $150million in short-term
investments. Based on our cash and cash equivalents and short
term investments as of December31, 2004, a hypothetical
10% change in interest rates along the entire interest rate
yield curve would not materially affect the fair value of our
financial instruments that are exposed to changes in interest
rates.
