Valuation and Qualifying Accounts                 76                    41 REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER
FINANCIAL REPORTING Board of Directors
Englobal Corporation
Houston, Texas
We were engaged to audit management assessment included in the accompanying
Management Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting that ENGlobal
Corporation and Subsidiaries the Company did not maintain effective internal
control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2006, because of the effect
of material weaknesses described therein, based on criteria established in
Internal Control -- Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring
Organizations of the Treadway Commission COSO. The Company management is
responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting
and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial
reporting.
The scope of our audit of management assessment and the effectiveness of
internal control over financial reporting was limited as a result of
management substantial delay in the performance of and delivery to us of its
completed assessment. Specifically, we were provided substantially all of the
documentation related to management assessment subsequent to December 31, 2006
and, as a result, we were unable to obtain sufficient evidence that the controls
were designed and operating effectively at December 31, 2006.
A material weakness is a significant deficiency, or combination of significant
deficiencies, that results in more than a remote likelihood that a material
misstatement of the annual or interim consolidated financial statements will not
be prevented or detected. The following material weaknesses have been identified
and included in management assessment as of December 31, 2006   1.  Deficiencies in the Company Control Environment. Our control
environment did not sufficiently promote effective internal control
over financial reporting throughout the organization. Specifically,
the Company had a shortage of support and resources in our accounting
department, which resulted in insufficient: i documentation and
communication of our accounting policies and procedures; and ii
internal audit processes of our accounting policies and procedures.
2.  Deficiencies in the Company Information Technology Access Controls.
The Company did not maintain effective controls over preventing access
by unauthorized personnel to end-user spreadsheets and other
information technology programs and systems.
3.  Deficiencies in the Company Accounting System Controls. The Company
did not effectively and accurately close the general ledger in a
timely manner and we did not provide complete and accurate disclosure
in our notes to financial statements, as required by generally
accepted accounting principles.
4.  Deficiencies in the Company Controls Regarding Purchases and
Expenditures. The Company did not maintain effective controls over the
tracking of our commitments and actual expenditures with third-party
subsidiaries on a timely basis.
5.  Deficiencies in the Company Controls Regarding Fixed-Price Contract
Information. The Company did not maintain effective controls over the
complete, accurate, and timely processing of information relating to
the estimated cost of fixed-price contracts.
6.  Deficiencies in the Company Revenue Recognition Controls. The
Company did not maintain effective policies and procedures relating to
revenue recognition of fixed price contracts.
42   7.  Deficiencies in the Company Controls over Income Taxes. The Company
did not maintain sufficient internal controls to ensure that amounts
provided for in the financial statements for income taxes accurately
reflected the Company income tax position as of December 31, 2006.
8.  Deficiency in Completing Management Assessment of Internal Control
over Financial Reporting in a Timely Manner. The Company did not meet
the documentation and testing requirements under section 404 of the
Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 as of December 31, 2006. As a result,
management was unable to assess the effectiveness of the Company
internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2006 as
required by the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 in sufficient time for an
audit of management assessment to be completed as of December 31,
2006.
These material weaknesses were considered in determining the nature, timing, and
extent of the audit tests applied in our audit of the 2006 consolidated
financial statements, and this report does not affect our report dated March 15,
2007 on those consolidated financial statements.
A company internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to
provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting
and the preparation of consolidated financial statements for external purposes
in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States
of America. A company internal control over financial reporting includes those
policies and procedures that i pertain to the maintenance of records that, in
reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and
dispositions of the assets of the company; ii provide reasonable assurance
that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial
statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the
United States of America, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are
being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of
the company; and iii provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or
timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the
company assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting
may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of
effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become
inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance
with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
Since management failed to provide us with timely documentation of the Company
internal control over financial reporting and we were unable to apply other
procedures to satisfy ourselves as to the effectiveness of the Company
internal control over financial reporting, the scope of our work was not
sufficient to enable us to express, and we do not express, an opinion on either
management assessment or on the effectiveness of the Company internal
control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2006.
We do not express an opinion or any other form of assurance on management
statements referring to any and all remediation steps taken.
We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company
Accounting Oversight Board United States, the consolidated balance sheets of
ENGlobal Corporation and subsidiaries as of December 31, 2006 and 2005, and the
related consolidated statements of operations, stockholders' equity, and cash
flows for each of the years in the three year period ended December 31, 2006.
Our report thereon dated March 15, 2006 expressed an unqualified opinion. Hein & Associates LLP

Consolidated Financial Statements
Board of Directors
ENGlobal Corporation
Houston, Texas
We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of ENGlobal
Corporation and subsidiaries theCompany as of December 31, 2006 and 2005,
and the related consolidated statements of operations, stockholders' equity, and
cash flows for each of the years in the three year period ended December 31,
2006. We have also audited the schedule listed in the accompanying Item 16.
These consolidated financial statements and schedule are the responsibility of
the Company management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these
consolidated financial statements and schedule based on our audits.
We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company
Accounting Oversight Board United States. Those standards require that we plan
and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the
consolidated financial statements and schedule are free of material
misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting
the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements and
schedule, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates
made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the
consolidated financial statements and schedule. We believe that our audits
provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present
fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of ENGlobal Corporation
and subsidiaries at December 31, 2006 and 2005, and the results of their
operations and their cash flows for each of the years in the three year period
ended December 31, 2006 in conformity with accounting principles generally
accepted in the United States of America.
Also, in our opinion, the schedule presents fairly, in all material respects,
the information set forth, therein in relation to the financial statements taken
as a whole.
We were also engaged to audit, in accordance with the standards of Public
Company Accounting Oversight Board United States, management assessment and
the effectiveness of ENGlobal Corporation and subsidiaries internal control over
financial reporting as of December 31, 2006, based on criteria established in
Internal Control Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring
Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Our report dated March 15, 2007, did
not express an opinion on management assessment and the effectiveness of
internal control over financial reporting. Hein & Associates LLP

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS NOTE 2 - SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
Cash
Cash includes cash in bank at December 31, 2006. The Company banking
system provides for daily replenishment of major bank accounts for
check-clearing requirements. Accordingly, there were negative book balances
of $27 million on December 31, 2006 and $20 million on December 31, 2005.
Such balances result from outstanding checks that have not yet been paid by
the bank and are reclassified to accounts payable in the accompanying
consolidated balance sheets.
Revenue Recognition
The Company revenue is composed of engineering, construction and
procurement service revenue and product sales. The Company recognizes
service revenue as soon as the services are performed. The majority of the
Company engineering services have historically been provided through
cost-plus contracts whereas a majority of the Company product sales are
earned on fixed-fee contracts.
On occasion, the Company, serving as an agent for the client procures
materials and equipment on behalf of the client and the cost of such
materials and equipment is reimbursed with no mark-up or profit. In
accordance with Statement of Position SOP 81-1, revenue and cost for
these types of purchases are not included in total revenue and cost. For
financial reporting, this pass-through type of transaction is reported
net. During 2006 and 2005, pass-through transactions totaled $89 million
and $206 million, respectively.
Profits and losses on fixed-fee contracts are recorded on the
percentage-of-completion method of accounting, measured by the
percentage-of-contract cost incurred to date relative to estimated total
direct contract cost. Direct contract cost includes professional
compensation and related benefits, materials, subcontractor services and
other direct cost of projects. Any freight charges and inspection costs are
directly charged to the project to which the charges relate. The cost
recognized for labor includes all actual employee compensation plus a
burden factor to cover estimated variable labor expenses for the year.
These variable labor expenses consist of payroll taxes, self-insured
medical plan expenses, workers compensation insurance, general liability
insurance, and employee benefits for paid time off. The actual periodic
cost for these expenses is adjusted at the end of each quarter to provide
consistent cost recognition throughout the year.
Variable costs such as travel, repairs and maintenance, supplies and
depreciation directly related to producing revenues are included in
contract costs to arrive at gross profit.
Under the percentage-of-completion method, revenue recognition is dependent
upon the accuracy of a variety of estimates, including the progress of
engineering and design efforts, material installation, labor productivity,
cost estimates and others. These estimates are based on various
professional judgments made with respect to the factors noted and are
difficult to accurately determine until projects are significantly
underway. Due to uncertainties inherent to the estimation process, it is
possible that actual completion costs may vary materially from estimates.
Anticipated losses on uncompleted contracts are charged to operations as
soon as such losses can be estimated. Changes in job performance, job
conditions, estimated profitability and final contract settlements may
result in revisions to costs and income and are recognized in the period in
which the revisions are determined.
Selling, general and administrative cost includes management and staff
compensation, office cost such as rents and utilities, depreciation,
amortization, travel and other expenses that are unrelated to specific
client contracts, but directly relate to the support of each segment
operations.
Occasionally, it is appropriate under SOP 81-1 to combine or segment
contracts. Contracts are combined in those limited circumstances when they
are negotiated as a package in the same economic environment with an
overall profit margin objective and constitute, in essence, an agreement to
do a single project. In such cases, we recognize revenue and cost over the
performance period of the combined contracts as if they were one. Contracts
may be segmented if the customer had the right to accept separate elements
of a contract and the total economic returns and risks of the separate
contract elements are similar to the economic returns and risks of the
51           ENGLOBAL CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS NOTE 2 - SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES Continued
overall contract. For segmented contracts, we recognize revenue as if they
were separate contracts over the performance periods of the individual
elements or phases.
We have five major types of contracts   Cost-Plus, Labor Plus Fixed Mark-up
Under cost-plus, labor plus fixed mark-up contracts, clients are charged
based on actual labor rates plus a fixed mark-up that includes estimated
recoverable direct and indirect cost and a profit component, which is
applied as a percentage of the recoverable labor, to arrive at a total
dollar estimate in negotiating a cost-plus, labor plus fixed mark-up
contract. We recognize revenue based on a multiple of the actual total
number of labor hours completed on a project multiplied by the actual labor
rates and multiplied by the negotiated fixed mark-up percentage, plus other
non-labor costs at cost plus a fixed mark-up that we negotiate at the time
of contract award. Aggregate revenue from cost-plus, labor plus fixed
mark-up contracts may vary in scope and we generally must obtain a change
order in order to receive additional revenue relating to any additional
costs that exceed the original contract estimate see Change Orders.
Cost-Plus, Fixed Labor Rate
Under cost-plus, fixed labor rate contracts, clients are charged based on
fixed labor rates by work classification Project Manager, Sr. Engineer,
Designer, CADD Operator, etc. whereby the fixed labor rate includes
estimated recoverable direct and indirect cost plus a profit component. In
negotiating cost-plus, fixed labor rate contracts the total dollar estimate
is a multiple of the fixed labor rates times the recoverable work class
labor man-hours estimated to complete the project. We recognize revenues
based on a multiple of the fixed labor rates times the actual total number
of labor hours completed on a project, plus other non-labor costs at cost
plus a fixed rate negotiated at the time of contract award. Aggregate
revenues from cost-plus, fixed labor rate contracts may vary in scope and
we generally must obtain a change order in order to receive additional
revenues relating to any additional cost that exceed the original contract
estimate see Change Orders.
Cost-Plus, Not-To-Exceed
Under cost-plus, not-to-exceed contracts, clients are charged on the same
basis as either cost-plus, labor plus fixed mark-up, or cost-plus fixed
labor rate contracts. The contract is awarded with a set maximum aggregate
revenue, referred to as the not-to-exceed amount. The Company does not earn
revenue over the not-to-exceed amount unless we obtain a change order. The
Company is not obligated to complete the contract once the not-to-exceed
amount has been reached.
Fixed-Price
Under fixed-price contracts, clients are charged an agreed amount
negotiated in advance of a specific scope of work, be it related to
engineering, construction and procurement service revenue or product sales.
We recognize revenue on fixed-price contracts using the
percentage-of-completion method described above. Prior to completion, gross
profit recognition on any fixed-price contract is dependent upon the
accuracy of our estimates and will increase to the extent that current
estimates of aggregate actual cost are below the amounts previously
estimated. Conversely, if the Company current estimated cost exceeds
prior estimates, gross profit will decrease and we may realize a loss on a
project. In order to increase aggregate revenue on a contract, we generally
must obtain a change order to receive payment for additional cost see
Change Orders.
Guaranteed Max
Under a guaranteed max contract, clients are charged on the same basis as
either cost-plus, labor plus fixed markup or cost-plus fixed labor rate.
The contract is awarded with a set maximum aggregate revenue amount
referred to as the guaranteed max amount. The Company is required to
complete the scope of contract even if they have reached the guaranteed max
amount. Therefore, the Company recognizes revenue on guaranteed max
contracts using the percentage of completion method described above and
commonly treats them the same as fixed-price contracts. In
52           ENGLOBAL CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS NOTE 2 - SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES Continued
order to increase aggregate revenue on a contract, we generally must obtain
a change order to receive payment for additional cost see change
orders.
Change Orders
Change orders are modifications of an original contract that effectively
change the deliverables under the contract without adding new provisions.
Either we or our clients may initiate change orders. Change orders may
include changes in specifications or design, manner of performance,
equipment, materials, scope of work and/or the period of completion of the
project.
Change orders occur when changes are required or requested after work on a
contract has begun. Change orders are documented and the terms of change
orders are agreed with the client before the work is performed.
Circumstances, at times, may require that work progress without the
client written agreement before the work is performed. Cost related to
change orders is recognized when they are incurred. Change orders are
included in the total estimated contract revenue when it is probable that
the change orders will result in a bona fide addition to value that can be
reliably estimated.
Inspection and Acceptance Cost-plus Contracts
Generally, other than on fixed-price contracts, clients inspect and accept
work as executed based on designated milestones or billing cycles, although
such acceptance does not waive the client right to a claim under a
warranty provision for work deficiencies that fail to meet industry
standards.
Inspection and Acceptance Fixed-Price Contracts
Generally, clients inspect and accept work based on designated milestones,
although such acceptance does not waive the client right to a claim under
a warranty provision for work deficiencies.
Contract Termination Provisions
Generally, our clients may terminate at any time and for any reason any
part of the Company project work by giving proper notice, specifying the
part of the work to be terminated and the effective date of the
termination. If any part of the work on a project is terminated, the
client, with respect to such work, is required to reimburse the Company for
all cost incurred prior to the effective date of termination and for all
additional amounts that are directly related to the work performed. The
client is required to issue a change order with respect to any termination.
Property and Equipment
All property and equipment is stated at cost, adjusted for accumulated
depreciation. Depreciation is calculated using a straight-line method over
the estimated useful lives of the related assets. The useful life is
estimated to be 3 years for computers and autos, 5 years for software,
furniture and fixtures, 10 years for machinery and equipment, and 39 years
for buildings. Leasehold improvements are amortized over the term of the
related lease.

useful lives to their estimated residual values and reviewed for impairment
in accordance with SFAS No. 144, Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal
of Long-Lived Assets.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS NOTE 2 - SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES Continued
The Company adopted SFAS 142 effective January 1, 2002. Upon adoption, the
Company tested goodwill for impairment at January 1, 2002 according to the
provisions of SFAS 142, which resulted in no impairment identified. The
Company tested goodwill for impairment at December 31, 2005 and 2006
resulting in no impairment of goodwill.
In 2004, acquisitions of assets of several companies resulted in an
increase of $1,725,000 to goodwill. Acquisitions of the assets of
Engineering Design Group, Inc. EDGI, InfoTech, and Cleveland Inspection
Services, Inc. CIS resulted in increases to goodwill of $139,000,
$270,000 and $1,316,000, respectively. In 2005, goodwill increased $170,000
primarily from earn-outs related to acquisitions. In 2006, goodwill
increased $30 million primarily from the deferred tax benefit realized on
acquisitions of WRC plus additional earn-outs related to acquisitions.
Long-lived Assets
The Company reviews long-lived assets and certain identifiable intangible
assets for impairment annually or whenever events or changes in
circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be
recoverable. An impairment loss would be recognized when estimated future
cash flows expected to result from the use of the asset and its eventual
disposition is less than its carrying amount. The Company has not
identified any such impairment losses.
Software Development Costs
Under the provisions of SOP-98-1 ENGlobal capitalizes costs associated with
software developed or obtained for internal use when both the preliminary
project stage is completed and when management authorizes funding for the
project which is deemed probable of completion. Costs include 1 external
direct costs of materials and services incurred in obtaining and developing
the software, and 2 payroll and payroll related costs for employees who
are directly associated with and devote time to the project. Capitalization
of these costs ceases no later than the point at which the project is
substantially complete and ready for its intended use. At that time, the
costs are reclassified to fixed assets. Amortization of such costs is
provided on the straight-line basis over 5 years.
Income Taxes
The Company accounts for deferred income taxes in accordance with the asset
and liability method, whereby deferred income taxes are recognized for the
tax consequences of temporary differences by applying enacted statutory tax
rates applicable to future years to differences between the financial
statement and tax bases of its existing assets and liabilities. The
provision for income taxes represents the current tax payable or refundable
for the period plus or minus the tax effect of the net change in the
deferred tax assets and liabilities during the period.
In June 2006, FASB Interpretation FIN No. 48, Accounting for Uncertainty
in Income Taxes, an interpretation of FASB Statement 109 Accounting for
Income Taxes, was issued. FIN No. 48 describes accounting for uncertainty
in income taxes, and includes a recognition threshold and measurement
attribute for recognizing the effect of a tax position taken or expected to
be taken in a tax return. FIN No. 48 is effective for fiscal years
beginning after December 15, 2006. The Company adopted FIN No. 48 on
January 1, 2007, and will not have a material effect on the Company
financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows.
Stock Based Compensation
The Company currently sponsors a stock-based compensation plan as described
below. Effective January 1, 2006, the Company adopted the provisions of
Statement of Financial Accounting Standards SFAS No. 123 Revised,
Share-Based Payment SFAS No. 123R. Under the fair value recognition
provisions of SFAS No. 123 R, stock-based compensation is measured at the
grant date based on the value of the awards and is recognized as expense
over the requisite service period usually a vesting period. The Company
selected the modified prospective method of adoption described in SFAS No.
123R. The fair values of the stock awards recognized under SFAS No.
123R are determined based on the vested portion of the awards; however,
the total compensation expense is recognized on a straight-line basis over
the vesting period.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS NOTE 2 - SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES Continued
Prior to January 1, 2006, the Company accounted for stock-based
compensation using the intrinsic value method prescribed in Accounting
Principles Board APB Opinion No. 25, Accounting for Stock Issued to
Employees, and related interpretations. Under APB Opinion No. 25, no
compensation expense was recognized for stock options issued to employees
because the grant price equaled, or was above, the market price on the date
of grant for options issued by the Company.

Use of Estimates
The preparation of the Company consolidated financial statements in
conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United
States of America requires the Company management to make estimates and
assumptions that affect the amounts reported in these financial statements
and accompanying results. Actual results could differ from these estimates.
Fair Value of Financial Instruments
The fair value of financial instruments, primarily accounts receivable,
notes receivable and accounts payable, closely approximate the carrying
values of the instruments due to the short-term maturities of such
instruments. Based on the borrowing rate currently available to the Company
for loans with similar terms, we believe the fair value of the long-term
obligations approximate their carrying value.

Comprehensive Income
Comprehensive income is defined as all changes in stockholders' equity,
exclusive of transactions with owners, such as capital investments.
Comprehensive income includes net income or loss, changes in certain assets
and liabilities that are reported directly in equity, such as translation
adjustments on investments in foreign subsidiaries, and certain changes in
minimum pension liabilities. The cumulative translation adjustment is
included in accumulated other comprehensive income. See Note 4
Reclassifications
Amounts in prior years' financial statements are reclassified as necessary
to conform to the current year presentation. Such reclassifications had
no effect on net income.
NOTE 3 - RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS
In September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 157, Fair Value Measurements.
This statement establishes a framework for measuring fair value in
generally accepted accounting principles and expands disclosures about fair
value measurements. SFAS No. 157 is effective for financial statements
issued for fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2007, and interim
periods within those fiscal years. The provisions of SFAS No. 157 should be
applied prospectively as of the beginning of the fiscal year in which SFAS
No. 157 is initially applied, except in limited circumstances. The Company
expects to adopt SFAS No. 157 beginning January 1, 2008. The Company is
currently evaluating the impact that this interpretation may have on its
consolidated financial statements.
In September 2006, the SEC released Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 108,
Considering the Effects of Prior Year Misstatements when Quantifying
Misstatements in Current Year Financial Statements SAB No. 108, which
provides interpretive guidance on how the effects of the carryover or
reversal of prior year misstatements should be considered in quantifying a
current year misstatement. The SEC staff believes that registrants should
quantify errors using both a balance sheet and an income statement approach
and evaluate whether either approach results in quantifying a misstatement
that, when all relevant quantitative and qualitative factors are
considered, is material. The provisions of SAB No. 108 are effective for
the Company beginning in the first quarter of 2007. The Company does not
expect any impact to its consolidated financial statements upon adoption of
SAB No. 108.
In June 2006, FASB Interpretation FIN No. 48, Accounting for Uncertainty
in Income Taxes, an interpretation of FASB Statement 109 Accounting for
Income Taxes, was issued. FIN No. 48 describes accounting for uncertainty
in income taxes, and includes a recognition threshold and measurement
attribute for recognizing the effect of a tax position taken or expected to
be taken in a tax return. FIN No. 48 is effective for fiscal years
beginning after December 15, 2006. The Company is in the process of
assessing the impact on its financial statements, but does not expect any
material impact on the Company financial condition, results of
operations, or cash flows.
In December 2004, SFAS No. 123 Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation
was revised SFAS No. 123R. SFAS No. 123R focuses primarily on
accounting for transactions in which an entity obtains employee services in
share-based payment transactions and requires that companies record
compensation expense for employee stock option awards. SFAS No. 123R is
effective for annual periods beginning after June 15, 2005. The Company
adopted SFAS No, 123R on January 1, 2006 using the modified prospective
method. See Note 11.
In March 2005, FASB Interpretation No. 47, Accounting for Conditional
Asset Retirement Obligations - An interpretation of FASB Statement No.
143, was issued. FIN No. 47 clarifies the term conditional asset
retirement obligation as used in SFAS No. 143, Accounting for Asset
Retirement Obligations, and clarifies when an entity would have sufficient
information to reasonably estimate the fair value of an asset retirement
obligation. FIN No. 47 was effective for the year ended December 31, 2005,
but did not have a material effect on the Company financial condition,
results of operations or cash flows.

In February 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 155, Accounting for Certain
Hybrid Financial Instruments - an amendment of FASB Statements No. 133 and
140. SFAS No. 155 amends SFAS No. 133, Accounting for Derivative
Instruments and Hedging Activities, and SFAS No. 140, Accounting for
Transfers and Servicing of Financial Assets and Extinguishments of
Liabilities. This Statement also resolves issues addressed in Statement
No. 133 Implementation Issue No. D1, Application of Statement 133 to
Beneficial Interests in Securitized Financial Assets. SFAS No. 155 permits
fair value remeasurement for any hybrid financial instrument that contains
an embedded derivative that otherwise would require bifurcation and
clarifies which interest-only strips and principal-only strips are not
subject to the requirements of SFAS No. 133. SFAS No. 140 is amended to
eliminate the prohibition on a qualifying special-purpose entity from
holding a derivative financial instrument that pertains to a beneficial
interest other than another derivative financial instrument. SFAS No. 155
is effective for all financial instruments acquired or issued during fiscal
years beginning after September 15, 2006. The Company does not expect this
statement to have a material impact on its consolidated financial
statements.
NOTE 4 - COMPREHENSIVE INCOME LOSS
Comprehensive income loss represents net earnings loss and any
revenue, expenses, gains and losses that, under accounting principles
generally accepted in the United States of America, are excluded from net
earnings loss and recognized directly as a component of stockholders'
equity.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDAED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS NOTE 8 - LINE OF CREDIT AND DEBT
The Company has a Credit Facility with Comerica Bank Comerica.
Effective July 27, 2006, the Company and Comerica entered into an amendment
to the Company existing Credit Facility the Comerica Credit Facility.
The maturity date of the Comerica Credit Facility was extended to July 26,
2009 and the limit on the revolving note was increased from $22 million to
$30 million, subject to loan covenant restrictions. The Comerica Credit
Facility is collateralized by substantially all the assets of the Company.
The outstanding balance on the line of credit as of December 31, 2006 and
2005 was $240 million and $38 million, respectively. At the election of
the Company, the interest rate will be the lesser of prime or a three
tiered Eurodollar rate, plus 150, 175, or 200 basis points, respectively,
based on the ratio of total funded debt to EBITDA for the trailing 12
months, of less than 200, between 200 and 250, and greater than 250,
respectively. The commitment fee on the unused line of credit is 0250%.
The remaining borrowings available under the line of credit as of December
31, 2006 and 2005, respectively, were $60 and $120 million after
consideration of loan covenant restrictions.
The Comerica Credit Facility contains covenants requiring the Company, as
of the end of each calendar month, to maintain certain ratios, including
total average funded debt to EBITDA; total average funded debt to total
liabilities, plus net worth; and total funded debt to accounts/unbilled
receivables. The Company is also required, as of the end of each quarter,
to maintain minimum levels of net worth, and the Company must comply with
an annual limitation on capital expenditures. Due to additional losses
incurred on two fixed-price projects during the fourth quarter, the Company
requested and was successful in obtaining a waiver and subsequent amendment
to its credit agreement with Comerica Bank in order to meet the monthly
fixed charge ratio. The Company was in compliance with all covenants under
the Comerica Credit Facility as of December 31, 2006.
Letters of credit
As of December 31, 2006, the Company had no standby letters of credit
outstanding. Standby letters of credit had previously been issued to a
refining client to cover contractual obligations funded by the client for
progress payments made to equipment manufacturers for major project items.
That contractual obligation expired in August 2006.

NOTE 10 - EMPLOYEE BENEFIT PLANS
The Company sponsors a 401k profit sharing plan for its employees.
Effective October 1, 2005, the Company amended the Plan to implement a
mandatory matching contribution equal to 25% of employee contributions up
to 4% of employee compensation for non-regular employees. For regular
employees, the Company makes mandatory matching contributions equal to 50%
of employee contributions up to 4% of employee compensation. The Company,
as determined by the Board of Directors, may make other discretionary
contributions. The employees may elect to make contributions pursuant to a
salary reduction agreement upon meeting age and length-of-service
requirements. The Company made contributions of approximately $1,310,000,
$401,000, and $221,000, respectively, for the years ended December 31,
2006, 2005, and 2004. Effective April 1, 2006, the Company increased its
matching contributions to the ENGlobal Corporation 401k Plan equal to 50%
of regular employee contributions up to 6% of employee compensation, and
all other employees will be matched at 3333% of employee contribution up
to 6% of compensation, as defined.
On June 17, 2004, ENGlobal shareholders ratified the Company adoption of
the 2004 Employee Stock Purchase Plan Plan. Beginning April 2004, the
Company provided eligible employees with the opportunity and a convenient
means to purchase shares of the Company common stock as an incentive to
exert maximum efforts for the success of the Company. ENGlobal intended
that options to purchase stock granted under the Plan would qualify as
options granted under an employee stock purchase plan as defined in
Section 423b of the Code. The Plan was construed so as to be consistent
with Section 423 of the Code, including Section 423b5 which requires
that all participants have the same rights and privileges with respect to
options granted under the Plan. The cash deferred by participants into the
plan, although not significant, was used to meet the Company cash
requirements or was applied to the reduction of the Company long-term
debt. Because of requirements of SFAS 123R, and probable reduction of
benefits that would result, the Company elected to terminate the Plan
effective December 31, 2005.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDAED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS NOTE 11 - STOCK OPTION PLAN
The Company has an incentive plan that provides for the issuance of options to
acquire up to 2,650,000 shares of common stock. The incentive plan Option
Plan provides for grants of non-statutory options, incentive stock options,
restricted stock awards and stock appreciation rights. All stock option grants
are for a ten-year term. Stock options issued to executives and management
generally vest over a four-year period; one-fifth at grant date and one-fifth at
December 31 of each year until they are fully vested. Stock options issued to
directors vest one-half on grant date and the remaining half upon the first
anniversary of grant date. In 2006 one grant was issued fully vested following
termination of a series under which the employee held a similar amount of
shares. All stock options grants are issued at the market value of the Company
stock on the date of the grant.
Effective January 1, 2006, the Company adopted SFAS No. 123R. This statement
requires compensation expense relating to share-based payments to be recognized
in net income using a fair-value measurement method. Under the fair value
method, the estimated fair value of awards is charged over the requisite service
period, which is generally the vesting period. The Company elected the modified
prospective method as prescribed in SFAS No. 123R and therefore, prior periods
were not restated. Under the modified prospective method, this statement was
applied to new awards granted after the time of adoption. Options Granted in 2006 Fair Values, Assumptions, and Impact on Net Income

expected lives of two to six years based on the simplified-method
calculation. The maximum term of each option is ten years.
The Company policy for exercising options begins with the option holder
submitting an Exercise Notice to the Investor Relations Officer IRO.
The IRO determines the option holder eligibility and current employment
status. The IRO then prepares the Option Exercise Notification Form.
Options holders at the Named Executive level must be approved to exercise
their options by the Compensation Committee. Any required notice is then
filed with the SEC. The options holder may then purchase shares at the
exercise price.

NOTE 12 - RELATED-PARTY TRANSACTIONS
On May 25, 2006, the Company, through its wholly-owned subsidiary ENGlobal
Corporate Services, Inc., purchased a one-third partnership interest in PEI
Investments, A Texas Joint Venture PEI, from Michael L. Burrow, the
Company President and CEO, and another one-third interest from a
stockholder who owns less than 1% of the Company common stock. The
partnership interests were purchased for a total of $69,000. The remaining
one-third interest was already held by the Company through its wholly-owned
subsidiary EEI. PEI owns the land on which our Beaumont, Texas office
building, destroyed by Hurricane Rita in September 2005, was located. The
remains of the building were razed in July 2006. In September 2006, the
Company acquired approximately 12 acres immediately adjacent to the former
facility and is developing plans to construct a new facility utilizing both
parcels of land.
NOTE 13 - CONCENTRATION OF CREDIT RISK AND MAJOR CUSTOMERS
The Company provides engineering and fabricated systems and services
primarily to major integrated oil and gas companies throughout the world.
It also fabricates power systems and battery chargers. The Company performs
ongoing credit evaluations of its customers and generally does not require
collateral. Management reviews all trade receivable balances that exceed 30
days past due and based on its assessment of current credit worthiness,
estimate what portion, if any seems doubtful for collection. A valuation
allowance that reflects management best estimate of the amounts that will
not be collected is established.
For the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005, and 2004, the Company had
sales in the engineering segment totaling approximately $425 million,
$848 million and $879 million attributable to a single customer. In 2006,
approximately 16% of our revenues were from one client, approximately 15%
of our revenues were from another client and another 10% were from a third
client. During 2005 and 2004, a single customer represented approximately
44% and 59% of total sales, respectively. As of December 31, 2006 the
Company had amounts due from 2 customers totaling $117 million with 1
customer exceeding 10% of trade receivables. At December 31, 2005, the
Company had amounts due from two customer totaling $83 million with
neither customer exceeding 10% of trade receivables. At December 31, 2004,
the Company had amounts due from one customer totaling $70 million; no
other customer exceeded 10% of trade receivables at that date.
NOTE 14 - RETIREMENT OF TREASURY SHARES AND REDEEMABLE PREFERRED STOCK
Treasury stock was recorded on our books at $592,231. Upon
retirement/cancellation of the shares in 2006 our Paid in Capital account
was reduced by $592,231 and the treasury stock account was credited to
reduce it to zero.

ENGlobal has a class of preferred stock with 5,000,000 shares originally
authorized for issuance. The Company issued to Equus II Incorporated
2,500,000 shares of preferred stock in 2001 and stock dividends totaling
88,000 shares in 2002 and 146,833 shares in 2003. Par value for the
preferred stock was $0001 with a fair value of $100 per share at the time
of issuance. The preferred shares outstanding were converted into 1,149,089
shares of common stock in August 2003. Following the conversion, the
Company reduced the authorized shares of preferred stock to 2,265,167. This
class of preferred stock was eliminated by a vote of the Company
stockholders in June, 2006.
A new class of capital stock of the Company, consisting of 2,000,000 shares
of Preferred Stock, par value $0001 per share the Preferred Stock was
approved by the Company stockholders at its June 2006 meeting. The Board
of Directors have the authority to approve the issuance of all or any
shares of these shares of Preferred Stock in one or more series, to
determine the number of shares constituting any series and to determine any
voting powers, conversion rights, dividend rights, and other designations,
preferences, limitations, restrictions and rights relating to such shares
without any further action by the stockholders. The designations,
preferences, limitations, restrictions and rights of any series of
Preferred Stock designated by the Board of Directors will be set forth in
an amendment to the Amended and Restated Articles of Incorporation
Amended Articles filed in accordance with Nevada law.
Blank Check Authority
The Preferred Stock is referred to as a blank check because the Board of
Directors, in their discretion, will be authorized to provide for the
issuance of all or any shares of the stock in one or more classes or
series, specifying the terms of the shares, subject to the limitations of
Nevada law. The Board of Directors would make a determination as to whether
to approve the terms and issuance of any shares of Preferred Stock based on
its judgment as to the best interests of the Company and its stockholders.
Reason for the Authorization of Blank Check Preferred Stock. The reason
for authorizing blank check Preferred Stock is to provide the Company with
the flexibility in connection with its future growth. Although the Company
presently has no intentions of issuing shares of Preferred Stock,
opportunities may arise that require the Board to act quickly, such as
businesses becoming available for acquisition or favorable market
conditions for the sale of a particular type of Preferred Stock. The Board
believes that the authorization to issue Preferred Stock is advisable in
order to enhance the Company ability to respond to these and similar
opportunities.                    67           ENGLOBAL CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES

The Company has a federal net operating loss carryforward at December 31,
2006 of approximately $1,049,000. Earlier utilization of the net operating
loss on the Company 2002 and 2003 consolidated tax returns was disallowed
by the IRS which resulted in a reinstated carry-forward that will be
available for utilization in 2007 through 2010.
The Company also has a foreign net operating loss carryforward at December
31, 2006 of approximately $770,000. This loss is available for utilization
in 2007 through 2016.
The Company is unsure of its ability to fully utilize the foreign net
operating loss. Therefore, the Company has set up a valuation allowance of
$308,000 against the entire net operating loss.
NOTE 16 - ACQUISITIONS
Assets acquired and liabilities assumed by the Company in acquisitions have
been recorded on the Company Consolidated Balance Sheets as of the
respective acquisition dates based upon their estimated fair values at such
dates. The results of operations of our acquisitions have been included in
the Company Consolidated Statement of Operations since the respective
dates of acquisition. The excess of the purchase price over the estimated
fair values of the underlying assets acquired and liabilities assumed has
been allocated to goodwill.
During 2006, the Company acquired Denver-based WRC Corporation WRC and
certain assets of Analyzer Technology International, Inc. ATI, and
accounted for the acquisitions using the purchase method of accounting for
business combinations. In both cases, the purchase price and costs
associated with the acquisitions exceeded the preliminary estimated fair
value of net assets acquired by approximately $56 million and $18 million
respectively, which was preliminarily assigned to goodwill. During early
2007, the Company completed the valuation of the intangible assets acquired
in both the WRC and the ATI transactions and pursuant to those valuations
has re-assigned approximately $40 million and $18 million respectively
from goodwill to non-compete agreements and customer relationships with
such assets being amortized over 5-6 years.
On October 6, 2006, the Company, through its wholly-owned subsidiary,
ENGlobal Construction Resources, Inc. ECR, acquired certain assets of
WATCO Management, Inc. WATCO, a Houston-based business providing
construction management, turnaround management, asset management, and
project commissioning and start-up services, and related services for
projects and facilities located in process plants. The addition of WATCO
will provide ECR with opportunities to expand its current services to
existing WATCO clients in addition to a complementary business allowing
expansion of current services to both existing and future clients. The
aggregate purchase price was $10 million, including $500,000 in cash and
an unsecured promissory note in the principal amount of $500,000 payable in
four equal annual installments, bearing interest at the rate of 4% per
annum. The estimated fair values of the acquired assets include
69           ENGLOBAL CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS   NOTE 16 - ACQUISITIONS Continued
approximately $800,000 in intellectual property, $52,000 in fixed assets
and $148,000 in goodwill. The Company is in the process of obtaining
third-party valuations of the intangible assets; thus the allocation of the
purchase price is subject to adjustment.
The Company purchased Denver-based WRC Corporation WRC on May 25, 2006.
WRC provides integrated land management, engineering, and related services
to the pipeline, power, and transportation industries, among others. WRC
has become a wholly-owned subsidiary of ENGlobal and will now serve as the
Company provider of land management, environmental compliance and
governmental regulatory services. WRC currently has approximately 200
employees, with revenues in the 12 months prior to the acquisition
exceeding $20 million. The Company expects to utilize WRC Denver facility
as a beachhead for expansion of its services into the Rocky Mountain and
Western U.S. regions. ENGlobal purchased all of the outstanding capital
stock of WRC in exchange for consideration of cash, a promissory note of
$24 million to be paid over four years, 175,000 shares of ENGlobal common
stock and the repayment of certain obligations of WRC as part of the
transaction. At June 30, 2006, goodwill from this transaction was estimated
to be $15 million.
In January 2006, one of the Company subsidiaries, ENGlobal Systems, Inc.
ESI acquired certain assets of Analyzer Technology International, Inc.
ATI, a Houston-based analyzer systems provider of online process
analyzer systems. ATI relocated its operation to ESI Houston facility,
which the Company expects will enable ESI clients to perform a more
efficient factory adaptable test by temporarily connecting both control and
analyzer systems onsite prior to delivery. The addition of ATI will provide
ESI with a greater presence in the process anlayzer sector, especially for
larger downstream opportunities of foreigh grassroots projects.
In December 2004, ESI purchased contract rights and other assets of
InfoTech Engineering Company, LLC, a limited liability company
InfoTech, headquartered in Baton Rouge, Louisiana. The Company paid
$325,000 in cash, a promissory note in the amount of $225,000 and entered
into a non-compete agreement with the former owner in exchange for
approximately $55,000 in computer equipment and certain intangible assets.
The acquisition resulted in approximately $270,000 in goodwill which is
being recorded and amortized over 15 years for tax purposes. The InfoTech
acquisition expands ESI capability in controls system integration in both
the automation and process control services. InfoTech primary experience
is in the onshore and offshore oil and gas and petrochemical industries.
In October 2004, one of the Company subsidiaries, ENGlobal Construction
Resources, Inc., purchased the name and certain assets of Cleveland
Inspection Services, Inc. CIS. CIS provides inspection and
constructionmanagement services in support of the oil and gas, utility, and
pipeline industries. The Company paid $25 million consisting of cash,
discounted promissory notes and the assumption of certain designated
contract obligations and entered into non-compete agreements with CIS and
its principals in exchange for approximately $10 million in machinery and
equipment, furniture and fixtures, computer equipment, software and other
intangible assets. The acquisition resulted in approximately $13 million
in goodwill which is being recorded and amortized over 15 years for tax
purposes.
One of the Company subsidiaries, ENGlobal Technical Services, Inc.
ETS formerly known as ENGlobal Design Group, Inc. EDG, purchased
certain assets of Tulsa-based Engineering Design Group, Inc. EDGI
effective February 1, 2004. The Company believes that the acquisition of
these assets enhance its capabilities related to various government and
public sector facilities. ETS most active sector is the Automated Fuel
Handling Systems which serves the U.S. Military. In connection with the
purchase, the Company acquired $344,000 in tangible assets including
furniture and fixtures, computer equipment and software. The Company also
assumed a liability for $44,000 in accrued compensated absences for former
EDGI employees hired at the time of the purchase, issued two $150,000 notes
bearing interest at 5% per annum maturing in December 2008 and a $25
million five-year contingent promissory note, with payments due annually,
as part of an earn-out based on revenues of the ETS operations over the
five years following the acquisition. ETS did not pay any cash or issue any
stock in the transaction. The original consideration given for the purchase
of certain EDGI assets approximated the fair value of the net assets
acquired; therefore, no goodwill arose from the transaction. Principal
70           ENGLOBAL CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS NOTE 16 - ACQUISITIONS Continued
and interest on the $25 million five-year contingent promissory note is
being charged to goodwill. As of December 31, 2005, $218,000 in principal
and interest payments on the contingent promissory note has been charged to
goodwill and is being amortized over 15 years for tax purposes.
NOTE 17 - SALE OF THERMAIRE
The Company completed its sale of assets of its subsidiary, Thermaire,
Inc., d/b/a Thermal Corporation, the only company in the manufacturing
segment, to a medium-sized HVAC equipment manufacturer in December 2003.
The disposition had been actively pursued since November 2001 in order to
permit the Company to strategically focus on its core operations. This
discontinued segment had reported losses from operations of $154,000 in
2003. The sale resulted in the receipt of $545,000 in cash and a $26,000
gain, net of tax. The 37,000 square foot office and manufacturing facility
owned by Thermaire was not included in the transaction and has been
separately listed for sale.
In March 2005, the Company completed the sale of the building formerly
occupied by Thermaire, Inc. The Company received proceeds of $823,350. The
Company realized a gain on the sale of the building of $119,000.
NOTE 18 - SEGMENT INFORMATION
With the sale of the manufacturing segment, the Company operates in two
business segments: engineering and systems. The engineering segment
provides services primarily to major integrated oil and gas companies that
for the most part are located in the United States. The systems segment
operates primarily full-service systems/controls engineering and
integration with some uninterruptible power systems and battery chargers
that for the most part are located in the United States. Sales, operating
income, identifiable assets, capital expenditures and depreciation for each
segment are set forth in the following table. The amount in the corporate
segment includes those activities that are not allocated to the operating
segments and include costs related to business development, executive
functions, finance, accounting, safety, human resources and information
technology that are not specifically identifiable with the two segments.
The inter-company elimination column includes the amount of administrative
costs allocated to the segments. The Corporate function supports both
business segments and therefore cannot be specifically assigned to either.
A significant portion of Corporate costs are allocated to each segment
based on each segment revenues and subsequently eliminated in
consolidation.
Financial information about geographic areas
Revenues from the Company non-U.S. operations are currently not material.
Long-lived assets located in Canada are currently not material.
Segment information for 2006, 2005 and 2004 was as follows   Note: Previously, within the Systems Segment, ESI provided products and
services supporting the advanced automation and integrated controls fields.
In January 2006, EAG assumed responsibility for these services, which
resulted in a move of this division of ESI to the Engineering Segment.
Revenues and expenses have been reclassified between the segments to
provide comparative results. Amounts will tie in total to prior reporting,
however, individual segments will vary from prior reports.

NOTE 19 - COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES
In connection with the 2001 merger of Petrocon Engineering, Inc.
Petrocon and a wholly-owned subsidiary of ENGlobal Corporation, certain
former Petrocon shareholders the Significant PEI Shareholders entered
into an Indemnification Escrow Agreement, an Option Escrow Agreement, a
Voting Agreement and a Significant PEI Shareholder Voting Agreement
collectively, the 2001 Agreements. In August 2004, the Company and the
requisite percentage of Significant PEI Shareholders entered into a
Termination Agreement the Termination Agreement terminating the 2001
Agreements. The 2001 Agreements included the following     Indemnification Escrow.
Pursuant to the Indemnification Escrow Agreement, 1,000,000 shares of
ENGlobal common stock owned by the Significant PEI Shareholders were
deposited into an escrow to serve as a fund against which the Company
72           ENGLOBAL CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS NOTE 19 - COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES Continued
could make claims for indemnity pursuant to the Merger Agreement with
Petrocon. Pursuant to the terms of the Termination Agreement, the
remaining shares in the Indemnification Escrow agreement have been
released pro rata to the Significant PEI Shareholders.
Voting Agreement.
ENGlobal, the Significant PEI Shareholders, and certain other parties
entered into a Voting Agreement which obligated the parties thereto to
vote for certain persons to serve on the Board of Directors of
ENGlobal. Pursuant to the terms of the Termination Agreement, the
Voting Agreement has been terminated.
Significant PEI Shareholder Voting Agreement.
The Significant PEI Shareholders entered into a Significant PEI
Shareholders Voting Agreement governing the manner in which they would
designate three ENGlobal director nominees under the Voting Agreement
and vote shares held in escrow. Pursuant to the terms of the
Termination Agreement, the Significant PEI Shareholders Voting
Agreement has been terminated.
Option Escrow.
Pursuant to the Option Escrow Agreement, the Significant PEI
Shareholders deposited 1,737,473 shares of ENGlobal common stock into
an escrow account. The Option Escrow Agreement required that if
ENGlobal issued shares of its common stock on the exercise of incentive
options granted as replacement options for outstanding Petrocon
incentive options Replacement Options, a like number of shares of
ENGlobal common stock would be surrendered from the escrow account to
ENGlobal. As a result, no dilution to ENGlobal stockholders would occur
upon the exercise of Replacement Options.
The Company management determined that, due to the cost and complexity
associated with administering the 2001 Agreements, it would be in the best
interest of the Company and its stockholders to terminate the same.
Pursuant to the terms of the Termination Agreement, ENGlobal purchased the
652,377 shares being held in escrow underlying the Replacement Options with
an exercise price of $096 per share for a discounted payment of $592,231,
payable over three years to the Significant PEI Shareholders. ENGlobal also
terminated its rights to any of the remaining shares held in escrow and
those shares were distributed to the Significant PEI Shareholders. The
transaction resulted in 652,377 shares of Treasury Stock and a decrease in
Shareholders' Equity of $592,231 until such time as the replacement options
are exercised and the exercise price is remitted to the Company. As of
December 31, 2006, all payments due to Significant PEI Shareholders had
been made.
Employment Agreements
The Company has employment agreements with certain of its executive
officers and certain other officers, the terms of which expire in January
2009. Such agreements provide for minimum salary levels. If the Company
terminates the employment of the employee for any reason other than 1
termination for cause, 2 voluntary resignation, or 3 employee death,
the Company is obligated to provide a severance benefit equal to six months
of the employee salary, and, at its option, an additional six months at
50% to 100% of the employee salary in exchange for an extension of the
non-compete. These agreements are renewable for one year at the Company
option.
Litigation
From time to time, we are involved in various legal proceedings arising in
the ordinary course of business alleging, among other things, breach of
contract or tort in connection with the performance of professional
services, the outcome of which cannot be predicted with certainty. As of
the date of this filing, we are party to several legal proceedings that
have been reserved for or are covered by insurance, or that, if determined
adversely to us individually or in the aggregate, would not have a material
adverse effect on our results of operations or financial position.

NOTE 20 - SUBSEQUENT EVENTS
In December 2006, ENGlobal Engineering, Inc. began its plan to merge its
Dallas, Texas operations with operations being performed at the Tulsa,
Oklahoma and Houston, Texas offices. The transfer of activities at the
Dallas office was the result of a decision to consolidate the Company
Texas-based operations while streamlining or reducing overhead costs. A
large number of the 25 Dallas employees were offered transfers to
ENGlobal Tulsa, Oklahoma or Houston, Texas offices. Certain employees
were asked to remain with the Company in Dallas through March 31, 2007 to
allow for an orderly transfer of on-going projects.
On February 14, 2007, the Company ceased operations through its Dallas
office and transferred all remaining operational support to its Tulsa
office. At the same time, the Company entered into a sublease commencing on
March 1, 2007, for approximately 75% of the continuing lease obligations
and sold a majority of the assets which were valued at approximately
$90,000. The Company will calculate the remaining obligations related to
the move from the Dallas area and record a charge during the first quarter
of 2007. The Company estimates the charge will range from $100,000 to
$125,000.
On February 16, 2007, the Company, through its wholly-owned subsidiary, RPM
Engineering, Inc. RPM, entered into an Agreement to Purchase and Sell
the property the Agreement, together with the building and all
improvements thereon located in Baton Rouge, Louisiana for approximately
$19 million with 20% of purchase price being paid at closing and the
balance self-financed for a period no longer than 60 months, amortized over
180 months, payable in equal monthly installments and one irregular
installment consisting of the interest and principle due at the end of the
60 months. The interest rate is based on NY prime plus 25%, initially to
be 85%. Under certain conditions prior to closing and up to sixty days for
the last signing of the Agreement, the purchaser may be entitled to the
return in full of any deposit held by RPM. The financed portion of the
purchase price is secured by a first mortgage on the property. The
Company basis in the property, together with the building and all
improvements is approximately $14 million at December 31, 2006. It is
intended that the closing shall take place on or about April 30, 2007.

Item 3.  Controls and Procedures
a Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures
Disclosure controls and procedures are controls and other procedures of a
registrant designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by the
registrant in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is
properly recorded, processed, summarized, and reported, within the time periods
specified in the Securities and Exchange Commission SEC rules and forms.
Disclosure controls and procedures include processes to accumulate and evaluate
relevant information and communicate such information to a registrant
management, including its Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer,
as appropriate, to allow for timely decisions regarding required disclosures.
We evaluated the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure
controls and procedures as of December 31, 2006, as required by Rule 13a-15 of
the Exchange Act. As described below, under Management Report on Internal
Control Over Financial Reporting, material weaknesses were identified in our
internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2006, relating to
our control environment, information technology access, accounting system,
purchases and expenditures, fixed-price contract information, and revenue
recognition. Based on the evaluation described above, our Chief Executive
Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that, as of December 31,
2006, our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective to ensure 1
that information required to be disclosed by us in the reports we file or submit
under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported, within
the time periods specified in the SEC rules and forms, and 2 information
required to be disclosed by us in our reports that we file or submit under the
Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our
Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow
timely decisions regarding required disclosure.
b Management Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting
Effective June 30, 2006, ENGlobal Corporation met the definition of accelerated
filer, as described by Rule 12b-2 of the Exchange Act. As an accelerated filer,
we are required by the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 to include an assessment of
our internal control over financial reporting for the year ended December 31,
2006. Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate
internal control over financial reporting. Our internal control over financial
reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the
reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of our financial
statements for external reporting purposes in accordance with generally accepted
accounting principles.
Internal control over financial reporting cannot provide absolute assurance of
achieving financial reporting objectives because of its inherent limitations.
Internal control over financial reporting is a process that involves human
diligence and compliance and is subject to lapses in judgment and breakdowns
resulting from human failures. Internal control over financial reporting also
can be circumvented by collusion or improper management override. Because of
such limitations, there is a risk that material misstatements may not be
prevented or detected on a timely basis by internal control over financial
reporting. However, these inherent limitations are known features of the
financial reporting process. Therefore, it is possible to design into the
process safeguards to reduce, though not eliminate, this risk.
77 A material weakness in internal control over financial reporting as defined in
Auditing Standard No. 2 of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board is a
significant deficiency, or combination of significant deficiencies, that results
in more than a remote likelihood that a material misstatement of the annual or
interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected. A significant
deficiency is a control deficiency, or combination of control deficiencies, that
adversely affects a company ability to initiate, authorize, record, process,
or report external financial data reliably in accordance with generally accepted
accounting principles, such that there is more than a remote likelihood that a
misstatement of the company annual or interim financial statements that is
more than inconsequential will not be prevented or detected.
Management assessed the effectiveness of the Company internal control over
financial reporting as of December 31, 2006, the end of the fiscal period
covered by this report, but management did not complete its assessment until
March 2, 2007. Due to the lack of adequate time to permit Hein to audit
management assessment, Hein is unable to render an opinion on our assessment
of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of
December 31, 2006. Accordingly, management has identified this as a material
weakness. Management assessment process did not conclude in adequate time to
permit Hein to audit management assessment due to a number of factors,
including: i.our failure to prepare and plan for a timely completion of
management assessment, including adding the resources necessary to do so; and
ii our failure to ensure that our accounting department was adequately staffed
and sufficiently trained to meet deadlines.
Management assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial
reporting as of December 31, 2006, using the criteria set forth by the Committee
of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission COSO in Internal
Control--Integrated Framework. In assessing the effectiveness of our internal
control over financial reporting, management identified the following additional
material weaknesses in internal control over financial reporting as of December
31, 2006   1.  Deficiencies in the Company Control Environment. Our control
environment did not sufficiently promote effective internal control
over financial reporting throughout the organization. Specifically, we
had a shortage of support and resources in our accounting department,
which resulted in insufficient: i documentation and communication of
our accounting policies and procedures; and ii internal audit
processes of our accounting policies and procedures.
2.  Deficiencies in the Company Information Technology Access Controls.
We did not maintain effective controls over preventing access by
unauthorized personnel to end-user spreadsheets and other information
technology programs and systems.
3.  Deficiencies in the Company Accounting System Controls. We did not
effectively and accurately close the general ledger in a timely manner
and we did not provide complete and accurate disclosure in our notes
to financial statements, as required by generally accepted accounting
principles.
4.  Deficiencies in the Company Controls Regarding Purchases and
Expenditures. We did not maintain effective controls over the tracking
of our commitments and actual expenditures with third-party
subsidiaries on a timely basis.
5.  Deficiencies in the Company Controls Regarding Fixed-Price Contract
Information. We did not maintain effective controls over the complete,
accurate, and timely processing of information relating to the
estimated cost of fixed-price contracts.
6.  Deficiencies in the Company Revenue Recognition Controls. We did not
maintain effective policies and procedures relating to revenue
recognition of fixed price contracts, which accounted for
approximately 11% of the Company revenues in 2006.
7.  Deficiencies in the Company Controls over Income Taxes. We did not
maintain sufficient internal controls to ensure that amounts provided
for in our financial statements for income taxes accurately reflected
our income tax position as of December 31, 2006.
78 As a result of the material weaknesses described above, our management concluded
that we did not maintain effective internal control over financial reporting as
of December 31, 2006, based on the criteria established by COSO.
c Changes in Internal Controls Over Financial Reporting
No change in our internal control over financial reporting as defined in Rule
13a-15f under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 occurred during the fourth
quarter of fiscal 2006 that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to
materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. Management and
the Audit Committee of the Company Board of Directors have begun to develop
remedial measures to address the internal control deficiencies identified above.
The Company will monitor the effectiveness of planned actions and will make any
other changes and take such other actions as management or the Audit Committee
determines to be appropriate.
d Remediation Initiatives
During 2007, we plan to implement a number of remediation measures to address
the material weaknesses described above. The Company remediation plans
include   1.  We plan to hire additional personnel to assist us with documenting and
communicating our accounting policies and procedures to ensure the
proper and consistent application of those policies and procedures
throughout the Company. Recruitment for this positions has begun and
the selection process is expected to be completed during the second
quarter of 2007.
2.  We plan to implement formal processes requiring periodic
self-assessments, independent tests, and reporting of our personnel
adherence to our accounting policies and procedures.
3.  We plan to design effective policies and procedures to control
security of and access to spreadsheet information. If necessary, we
will also consider implementing a software solution with automatic
control checkpoints for day-to-day business processes.
4.  We plan to i require additional training for our current accounting
personnel; ii to hire additional accounting personnel to enable the
allocation of job functions among a larger group of accounting staff;
iii to engage outside consultants with technical accounting
expertise, as needed; and iv to consider restructuring our
accounting department, each to increase the likelihood that our
accounting personnel will have the resources, experience, skills, and
knowledge necessary to effectively perform the accounting system
functions assigned to them.
79   5.  We plan to improve procurement and operational efficiencies by
implementing a software system and a matrix organization to more
completely, accurately, and timely track commitments on Company-wide
purchase and expenditure transactions.
6.  We plan to improve revenue recognition policies and procedures
relating to fixed-price contracts by evaluating the level of economic
success achieved by past fixed-price contracts and by stressing
throughout the Company the importance of i accurately estimating
costs, ii timely updating cost estimates to reflect the accuracy of
the cost savings, iii accurately estimating expected profit, iv
timely identifying when a project scope changes, v promptly
reporting man hours and costs in excess of those originally estimated;
and vi closely scrutinizing the bid process.
7.  We plan to train personnel to effectively implement and evaluate the
overall design of the Company fixed-price project control processes.
Specifically, we plan to enhance and tighten controls as they relate
to the initial bid process and the attendant recognition and
management of risk by only bidding on large procurement and
construction activities on a cost plus basis.
Management recognizes that many of these enhancements require continual
monitoring and evaluation for effectiveness. The development of these actions is
an iterative process and will evolve as the Company continues to evaluate and
improve our internal controls over financial reporting.
Management will review progress on these activities on a consistent and ongoing
basis at the Chief Executive Officer and senior management level in conjunction
with our Audit Committee. We also plan to take additional steps to elevate
Company awareness about and communication of these important issues through
formal channels such as Company meetings, departmental meetings, and training.
