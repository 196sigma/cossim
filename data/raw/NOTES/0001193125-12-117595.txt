Controls and Procedures Evaluation of
Disclosure Controls and Procedures Our management maintains disclosure controls and procedures that are designed to ensure
that information required to be disclosed in our periodic reports pursuant to the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended the Exchange Act, is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the
SECs rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer, our Chief Financial Officer, and our Principal Accounting Officer, as appropriate, to allow for timely
decisions regarding required financial disclosures. Our management evaluated, with the participation of our Chief Executive
Officer, our Chief Financial Officer and our Principal Accounting Officer, the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures pursuant to Exchange Act Rules13a-15e or 15d-15e as of December31,
2011. Based 
58  
on this evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer, our Chief Financial Officer, and our Principal Accounting Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of
December31, 2011. Our managements report on internal control over financial reporting as defined in Exchange Act
Rules 13a-15e or 15d-15f and the independent registered public accounting firms related audit report on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting are included in this Item9A of this Annual Report on
Form10-K. Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 
There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting as such term is defined in Rules13a-15f and 15d-15f
under the Exchange Act during the quarter ended December31, 2011 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. 
Managements Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as defined in Exchange Act Rules13a-15f and 15d-15f. Our management is required
to assess the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of the end of the fiscal year and to report, based on that assessment, whether our internal control over financial reporting is effective. 
Our internal control over financial reporting is a process designed under the supervision of our Chief Executive Officer, our Chief
Financial Officer, and our Principal Accounting Officer to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of our financial statements for external reporting purposes in accordance with accounting
principles generally accepted in the United States. Our internal control over financial reporting includes policies and
procedures that: ipertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect transactions and dispositions of assets; iiprovide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to
permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, and that receipts and expenditures are being made only in accordance with authorizations of the Companys management
and board of directors; and iiiprovide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of our assets that could have a material effect on our financial statements. 
A control system, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of
the control system are met. Further, the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs. Because of the inherent limitations in any
control system, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements due to human error, or the improper circumvention or overriding of internal controls. In addition, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to
future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions and that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may change over time. 
As of December31, 2011, management conducted an assessment of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting
based on the framework established in Internal ControlIntegrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission COSO. Based on this assessment, management has determined that our internal
control over financial reporting as of December31, 2011 was effective. The effectiveness of our internal control over
financial reporting as of December31, 2011 has been audited by Deloitte Touche LLP, our independent registered public accounting firm, which also audited our consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form
10-K. 
59  REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM 
To the Audit Committee and Stockholders of 
Deltek, Inc. Herndon, Virginia 
We have audited the internal control over financial reporting of Deltek, Inc. and its subsidiaries the Company as of December31,
2011, based on the criteria established in Internal ControlIntegrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. The Companys management is responsible for maintaining effective
internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Managements Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. Our
responsibility is to express an opinion on the Companys internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We conducted our
audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board United States. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over
financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and
operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion. 
A companys internal control over financial reporting is a process designed by, or under the supervision of, the companys principal executive
and principal financial officers, or persons performing similar functions, and effected by the companys board of directors, management, and other personnel to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and
the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A companys internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that 1pertain to the
maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; 2provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation
of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and
3provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the companys assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. 
Because of the inherent limitations of internal control over financial reporting, including the possibility of collusion or improper management override
of controls, material misstatements due to error or fraud may not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. Also, projections of any evaluation of the effectiveness of the internal control over financial reporting to future periods are subject to
the risk that the controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. In our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December31, 2011, based on the criteria established in Internal
ControlIntegrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. We have also audited,
in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board United States, the consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended December31, 2011 of the Company and our report dated March14, 2012
expressed an unqualified opinion on those financial statements.  s/ DELOITTE TOUCHE LLP McLean, Virginia
