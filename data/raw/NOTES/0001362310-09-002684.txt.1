the NEON acquisition further discussed below in the RCN Metro Segment section. Pro forma for the
NEON acquisition, consolidated revenue grew by approximately 6%. We also continued our margin
expansion progress, driven largely by a decrease in our selling, general and administrative costs
excluding stock-based compensation expense as a percentage of revenue by approximately 200 basis
points, to 38% of revenue. 4 Table of Contents Residential / SMB Segment. Residential/SMB revenue grew by approximately 4% in 2008. We
achieved this growth through the addition of approximately 12,000 customers and 18,000 revenue
generating units, as well as an increase in average revenue per customer of approximately $1 per
month. In addition, during 2008 we launched project Analog Crush in each of our major
metropolitan markets excluding Lehigh Valley, migrating all customers in those markets to an
all-digital video platform, freeing up valuable video spectrum for 100 HD channels, a
best-in-class international tier, and hundreds of digital channels available for new programming.
This key initiative, which was completed in early 2009, drove a significant increase in digital
penetration to 87% of our video customers at the end of 2008, up from 69% at the end of 2007. RCN Metro Segment. RCN Metro revenue grew by approximately 91% in 2008, driven primarily by
the NEON acquisition. Pro forma for the NEON acquisition, RCN Metro revenue grew by approximately
11% in 2008. This growth was primarily the result of continued strong demand for our high-capacity,
high-availability, and diverse data transport services. With the NEON integration
now substantially complete, we are one of the premier competitive telecommunications providers in our footprint,
offering enterprise and carrier customers high-bandwidth data transport services in the largest
Northeastern U.S. cities, as well as to a number of other Northeastern U.S. cities and towns, along
network routes that provide both redundancy to, and diversity from, solutions offered by competing
carriers. Description of our Businesses Residential / SMB Segment In 2008, our Residential/SMB segment generated approximately 77% of our consolidated
revenues see Note 15 Financial Data by Business Segment to our Consolidated Financial
Statements. Through our RCN and RCN Business Services business units, we offer video, traditional
circuit-switched telephone, and high-speed Internet products to
residential and SMB customers. Customers can purchase our products on an a la carte basis, or they may choose
to bundle multiple services into a single subscription with single billing and a single point of
installation and support. Customers who bundle services typically receive those services at a
discount to the sum of the a la carte prices of the individual products. Our bundle approach
reduces operating costs due to efficiencies in customer care, billing, and support, and we believe
offers our customers a greater value. Approximately 68% of our current customer base purchases
bundled products. Video Services Our video service delivers multiple channels of television programming to subscribers who pay
a monthly recurring fee. Subscription rates and other related charges vary depending on the type
of service selected and equipment used by the subscriber. We offer varied channel line-ups in each
system serving a particular geographic market. Channel offerings are in accordance with applicable
local and federal regulatory requirements and are also based on programming preferences and
demographics in each of our markets. We receive television signals delivered from television
networks over-the-air, by fiber-optic transport, or via satellite delivery to our antennas,
microwave relay stations and satellite earth stations. We aggregate and organize these signals in
our technical facilities and deliver a specified lineup of programming services to our subscribers
in an all-digital format. Our video services include   
Basic and Signature Services: Our video customers receive a package of basic
programming that generally consists of local broadcast television stations, local
community programming including governmental and public access, and limited
satellite-delivered or non-broadcast channels. The basic channel line-up generally
includes up to 50 channels. Our Signature or expanded basic programming package
includes approximately 150 additional channels, including many popular regional and
national cable networks. Both of these service levels are available in a 100%
digital viewing format for our customers who utilize a digital set-top box which,
following the completion of project Analog Crush, is now required for customers in
all markets except Lehigh Valley, where digital set-top boxes remain optional.   
Enhanced Digital Services: We offer additional programming content to customers
who utilize a digital set-top box and desire broader programming choices. With the
use of the digital-set top box, our customers enjoy an interactive program guide and
access to our video on demand VOD library, as well as the ability to access
hundreds of additional channels through our Premiere service package, which
includes special interest networks, movie and entertainment networks, and digital
music.   
Premium Channels: Our customers can also purchase premium movie and entertainment
channels, such as Showtime, HBO, Starz, and Encore on an a la carte basis for a
monthly fee. All such services include Video-on-Demand content as part of the
monthly subscription. We also provide foreign language programming and adult
content for an additional monthly fee.   
High-Definition Television HDTV: Our HDTV service provides customers who
utilize advanced digital set-top boxes with improved, high-resolution picture
quality, improved audio quality and a wide screen format. We currently offer our
HDTV customers approximately 75 high-definition channels in most areas, including
most broadcast networks, leading
national cable networks, regional sports networks, and premium channels, and we expect
to increase our offering to 100 or more high-definition channels in 2009. In addition,
our HDTV customers have access to selected video on demand content in high-definition
format. 5 Table of Contents   
Video on Demand and Subscription Video on Demand SVOD: Our VOD service
provides customers with access to an extensive library of movies and other television
content with control over the timing and playback of that content. A substantial
portion of this content is free to our customers who utilize digital set-top boxes,
and we continue to expand our library as more content becomes available. RCN also
offers SVOD services which provide our customers with on demand access to additional
content that is either associated with premium content to which they subscribe, or
made available for an additional fee.   
Digital Video Recorder DVR: RCN offers a dual-tuner High-Definition DVR
set-top box that allows our customers to record one program while viewing another
whether it is recorded in standard definition or high-definition. DVR technology
affords the ability to our customers to digitally record, store and play television
programs without the inconvenience of tapes or DVDs.   
Pay-Per-View PPV: Our PPV service provides customers with the ability to
order, for a separate fee, movies as well as Big Event programming such as sporting
events or music concerts on an unedited, commercial-free basis.   
Lehigh Valley Studio: We operate a video production studio located in Lehigh
Valley, Pennsylvania, where we produce sports, news, and entertainment programs
focused on community and local interest in our markets. Much of this RCN-produced
content is made available on an on-demand basis through our VOD platform. We plan to
continue to utilize our ability to produce original programming to distinguish our
video offerings from our competitors.   
Bulk Video Services: We provide video services to hotels, hospitals, universities,
and other organizations seeking to deliver multiple video connections by means of a
single relationship with a video provider. Our bulk video products generally offer
more limited video lineups than available to our residential customers. These
services, however, generally involve more extensive installation and network design /
development than residential applications, and are often combined with voice,
Internet and data transport services as a bundled, customized communications
solution. High-Speed Data Services We
offer high-speed Internet services to residential and SMB customers at download
speeds ranging from 15 megabits per second, or Mbps, to 20 Mbps, depending on the level of service
selected. These services include Internet access, email and webmail, Internet security services,
and other web-based services. During 2009, we plan to make investments in our network to
significantly increase both download and upload speeds for our customers. Voice Services We provide local, long distance, and international voice telephone services. We offer a full
range of calling plans that generally include unlimited local, regional, and long distance calling
with a variety of calling features. Our voice service features include voicemail, caller
identification, call waiting, call forwarding, 3-way calling, 911 access, operator services, and
directory assistance. We provide voice services through a traditional, switched platform in most of
our markets, although in certain markets, we use a digital phone architecture that transmits data
signals over our broadband network between the customer premises and an RCN switch for carriage to
and from the public switched telephone network. As a voice provider, we operate as a
facilities-based competitive local exchange carriers CLEC, meaning that we have independent
access to phone numbers, can initiate and terminate calls anywhere in the U.S. or internationally
and provide 911 access to all of our voice customers by means of our traditional circuit-switched
communications network. RCN and RCN Business Services Network Our RCN and RCN Business Services network architecture consists of a hybrid-fiber-coax network
predominantly designed and built to support a bandwidth of 860 Megahertz. This architecture
enables us to offer video, high-speed data, and local and long distance voice services to customers
over a common network infrastructure. Our network also supports two-way interactive services such
as VOD and linear pay-per-view services, as well as higher bandwidth high-definition video
services. In the markets where we have completed project Analog Crush, the conversion to an
all-digital video platform has allowed us to reallocate bandwidth on our network and to launch
expanded and enhanced programming services. Our RCN and RCN Business Services distribution network relies on service nodes, which receive
video, data and voice signals from our fiber optic network and transmit those signals along our
coaxial last mile distribution cables to customers premises. Our fiber cable entering any
particular service node typically reaches to within 1,000 feet of the customers premises, and the
node service area typically consists of approximately 150 homes or small business locations. This
small node service area combined with the deep fiber architecture provides for better operational
performance of our network and also provides higher bandwidth per home than the traditional network
design of
other cable and telecommunication service providers. While we currently have sufficient
bandwidth to deliver all of our services, we are considering several new technologies, including
DOCSIS 30 and MPEG4 digital compression, which could significantly increase our ability to deliver
higher bandwidth services in the future. 6 Table of Contents Our RCN and RCN Business Services data network consists of the networking and computer
equipment required to provide complete internet service provider ISP services to both our
residential and SMB customers. We maintain an Internet backbone network
that is used to interconnect to both settlement-free and settlement-based carriers. We maintain
this backbone network as a means to provide service to our high-speed data customers. We also maintain a carrier grade voice network that is capable of delivering high-quality
voice services to residential, small business, enterprise and carrier customers. Fiber-optic
backbone facilities using synchronous optical network SONET transport electronics typically
provide interconnection from the RCN local telephony switch to the telephony distribution
electronics. Our voice network provides primary line service with full interconnection to the local
emergency 911 centers and includes reserve batteries in the network or at the customers premise to
provide backup power in the event of a commercial power outage. In certain markets, we use a
digital phone architecture that transmits data signals over our broadband network between the
customer premises and an RCN switch, which then transports and terminates the call over the public
switched telephone network. We anticipate that we will continue to offer traditional switch-based
telephony services, which includes our digital phone product for the foreseeable future.
However, we are evaluating opportunities to transition our voice platform to an IP-based
architecture to reflect changing market trends. Customer Service Customer service is an essential element of our business. We provide customer support for
routine customer technical and billing questions through a third party outsourcing provider, which
utilizes domestic U.S. and international customer care professionals. More advanced customer
questions and technical problems are handled by RCN employees, either in our centralized call
center locations in Pennsylvania or the local markets we serve. We also provide certain customer
service functions via the Internet. Sales and Marketing We sell our products through a variety of channels, including inbound and outbound telesales
which account for the majority of our sales, local direct sales representatives, customer care
representatives, and our e-commerce platform. We use targeted marketing techniques to generate
interest in our products, including direct mail which accounts for the majority of our marketing
spend, radio, and print advertising, as well as local market promotions directed at specific
multi-dwelling units and well-attended entertainment and sporting events. We also use search
engine marketing and customer referrals to market our products. Since our serviceable area is
typically smaller than the overall media footprint in the metro markets we serve, we tend to focus
more on direct mail and targeted local tactics rather than broader sources of media. Pricing of Our Products and Services Our revenues are generated principally from the monthly fees paid by our customers for
services we offer. We also earn revenue from fees for services other than our delivery of
traditional video programming packages, such as Pay-Per-View services, certain subscription-based
and transactional VOD offerings, and certain Internet broadband services. We price our services to
promote sales of bundled packages, primarily through volume discounts and other promotions. An
installation fee is generally charged to new and reconnected customers. We also charge monthly fees
for customer premise equipment. We have historically increased our prices by varying amounts based
upon the increase in our costs of programming services we purchase from networks. Competition We compete with a wide range of service providers in each market, including incumbent local
exchange carriers ILECs, incumbent multiple system cable operators MSOs, Direct Broadcast
Satellite DBS providers, wireless providers and competitive telecommunications and Internet
service providers. In recent years, competition has increased significantly for video, voice and
data services in our markets, and we believe it will continue to intensify in the future. Our
primary competitors, particularly Comcast, Time Warner, Verizon and ATT possess significantly
greater financial resources than we do, which they are using to fund substantial network expansions
and upgrades, as well as product and service enhancements, and because we are presently unable to
match this level of overall investment, we rely on our ability to provide more personalized and
effective services to our customers and to operate more efficiently to compete against these
companies. Our primary competition for video services consists of incumbent MSOs and ILECs named above in
our metro markets, Service Electric in Lehigh Valley, PA, and the DBS providers, DirecTV and
Echostar. We also, to a lesser degree, compete with interactive broadband services, wireless and
other emerging technologies that provide for the distribution and viewing of video programming, as
well as home video products. 7 Table of Contents Our primary competition for voice and high-speed Internet services consists of incumbent MSOs
and ILECs named above in our metro markets, Service Electric in Lehigh Valley, PA, CLECs, VoIP
service providers, and wireless providers. Sources of Supply To provide video service, we purchase programming content from a number of networks. Our
programming contracts generally continue for a fixed period of time and are subject to periodic,
negotiated renewal, and we generally pay a monthly license fee based on the number of subscribers
who access the programming. Some content providers offer financial incentives to support the
launch of a channel and/or ongoing marketing efforts. For shopping and certain VOD and
Pay-Per-View services, we receive a percentage of the amount that our customers spend from the
content providers. In an effort to achieve greater purchasing power, we purchase some of our programming content
through the National Cable Television Co-op, or the NCTC, a cooperative buying organization that
provides volume discounts to its members on programming purchased through the NCTC. The remainder
of our programming is the result of direct agreements with the programmers. Our programming costs
have increased every year we have operated and we expect them to continue to increase due to a
variety of factors, including annual rate increases required under existing contracts, increases
from programming agreement renewals, increases resulting from enhancements to existing channel
content, and increases from the addition of new channels. We also rely heavily on a limited number of key vendors for the infrastructure and software
needed to run our network, including customer premise equipment. RCN Metro Segment In 2008, our RCN Metro segment generated approximately 23% of our consolidated revenues see
Note 15 Financial Data by Business Segment to our Consolidated Financial Statements. Through our
RCN Metro segment, we offer commercial transport products and services to large enterprise and
carrier customers. We distinguish RCN Metro in our markets by offering high-bandwidth, high-availability, diverse and redundant solutions for our customers, as well as superior customer
service and technical responsiveness. Our RCN Metro network includes numerous unique fiber routes,
making us an attractive provider of telecommunications services to critical customer locations that
require redundant and diverse communications solutions. Our enterprise customers are generally large corporations, financial, healthcare and
educational institutions, and government agencies seeking high-bandwidth data transport services.
We target Fortune 1000 companies and work closely with enterprise clients to develop custom
telecommunications solutions that leverage our network and operational expertise. We have
developed significant expertise in meeting the telecommunications needs of financial services
firms, with several stock exchanges and major banks among our customers. Enterprise customers
represent approximately 40% of RCN Metros revenue. Our carrier customers are telecommunications services companies, including ILECs, CLECs, and
other service providers, who utilize our services to provide redundancy for their own networks and
to develop customer-specific applications. Wireless communications providers are among our largest
carrier customers, to whom we provide backhaul transport services to aggregate traffic from their
geographically-dispersed cell sites and switch sites. Carrier customers represent approximately
60% of RCN Metros revenue. RCN Metro Products Our commercial product offerings include metro and intercity SONET, dense wavelength division
multiplexing DWDM, and Ethernet based transport services, co-location services, and high-speed
internet access services. We can also provide enterprise customers with services traditionally
associated with our residential and SMB units, including video and voice. Following the
initiation of RCN Metro service to a customer in any building, we target other potential customers
in that building to deliver higher margin, incremental products and services to multiple customers
located in that building.   
Transport Services: We provide SONET and Ethernet-based data transport services both
within our metro markets and between cities over our intercity fiber network. Specific
service offerings include: SONET Private Line services at bandwidth levels including DS-1,
DS-3, OC-3, OC-12, OC-48, and OC-192; Wavelength DWDMservices enabling flexible and
scalable high-capacity transport at 25 and 10 Gbps; and Ethernet services via dedicated,
point-to-point as well as point-to-multipoint connectivity. We offer these services
utilizing a variety of equipment platforms, enabling us to deliver services to customers in
their preferred telecommunications architecture, including Cisco, Nortel, Lucent, and Ciena
equipment.   
Co-Location Services: We offer co-location services to our customers by maintaining
secured and monitored technical space in the same facilities as several of our larger
network operations locations. We offer full disaster recovery and data back-up
capabilities in facilities that help assure maximum server and data availability, as well
as customized monitoring, maintenance and hosting services,
and provide cost-effective pricing for customers who desire to combine co-location and
hosting services with our data transport services.   
Internet Access: Our Internet access offerings include dedicated access services
targeted at businesses that desire single or multipoint high-speed, dedicated connections
to the Internet. Our dedicated Internet access service provides internet speeds of up to a
Gigabit per second. We maintain numerous public and private peering arrangements with
other Internet backbone networks in our geographic footprint. 8 Table of Contents RCN Metro Network RCN Metros network is a fiber-based, highly redundant, survivable network optimized to
deliver carrier grade telecommunications services to enterprise and carrier customers. The RCN
Metro fiber-optic network is predominantly wholly-owned by RCN, and in certain cases may be leased
from third party providers under long term leases. In several of our markets, particularly New
York, the majority of our commercial fiber cable deployed is placed in entirely separate conduit
facilities from those of the incumbent service providers, providing a major competitive
differentiator and selling point for our enterprise and carrier products. In other cases, we
utilize the rights-of-way provided by incumbent telecommunications and utility providers, or our
own facilities in public rights-of-way. The acquisition of NEON substantially extended the reach
of our RCN Metro network, adding intercity transport routes that extend from Maine to Virginia.
Several of these newly added routes follow geographic paths that are diverse from the I-95 corridor
along which many of the industrys existing north-south telecommunications facilities traditionally
follow. A substantial majority of our RCN Metro revenue is earned using network routes and equipment
that are distinct from our RCN and RCN Business Services network assets. We are able, however, to
leverage the deeply penetrated fiber footprints of our RCN and RCN Business Services networks to
deliver high-bandwidth enterprise and carrier products to locations that many competitors are not
able to service. In addition, we maintain two separate RCN Metro network operations centers,
staffed by telecommunications engineers and operations professionals trained specifically to
support RCN Metro customers and provide additional redundancy through our separate RCN and RCN
Business Services network operations center. Finally, the design, installation, support, and
disconnection of RCN Metro services are generally performed by technicians trained specifically to
work in our RCN Metro network environment. We utilize common back-office, IT, and other support
services with our RCN and RCN Business Services units to obtain cost efficiencies while maintaining
our focus on enterprise and carrier customers. Our RCN Metro network was designed to provide highly redundant fiber facilities between key
customer locations within the central business districts of the major cities and regions in which
we operate. Our fiber network is comprised of over 7,000 miles of fiber cable routes, offering
nearly 313,000 fiber miles of network capacity. Our services are delivered over fiber optic cable
installed, monitored, and maintained entirely by RCN. We currently deliver fiber-based
communications services to over 1,300 on-net locations, including connections to more than 144 ILEC
central offices and 23 co-location facilities, enabling us to deliver our customers
telecommunications traffic efficiently and for attractive prices. Sales and Customer Support We rely primarily on a direct sales strategy to sell our enterprise and carrier services,
supplemented by referrals from our other business units and key vendors. We distinguish our
commercial offerings by combining attractive pricing, industry leading reliability and redundancy,
a large number of diverse network routes, and a customer-focused support and care orientation. We
provide our customers with dedicated customer account managers to support technical and billing
inquiries. Pricing Our RCN Metro services are typically priced on an individual case basis, although we maintain
standard rates for our more standardized communications products. We strive to maintain pricing
that is competitive with, or superior to, the prices available from competing telecommunications
providers. Pricing is predominantly driven by a combination of the volume of business conducted by
a customer with RCN Metro, the prevailing market rate for the applicable services, RCN Metros
construction and other costs incurred to provide the services, and RCN Metros internal thresholds
for return on individual customer transactions. Competition Our RCN Metro business unit competes against the largest ILECs, CLECs, and other data
transport providers, including Verizon Business, ATT, Qwest, and Level 3 Communications. The
ILECs, in particular, have significant advantages over RCN Metro, including greater capital
resources, local networks in many markets where we do not have facilities, and longstanding
customer relationships, particularly in buildings that we have not previously serviced. We also
face competition from smaller competitive access providers, CLECs and other new entrants. We seek
to distinguish our products by offering diverse network paths, redundancy, superior care and
technical responsiveness, and value-added product offerings, such as co-location, tailored to the
needs of our customers. 9 Table of Contents Regulation Overview Telecommunications and cable television operators are subject to extensive regulation by the
Federal Communications Commission FCC, state Public Utilities Commissions PUCs, and Local
Franchise Authorities LFAs. These regulations affect the manner in which we operate our
business and can also have direct and indirect impacts on our costs of operation and profitability.
Set forth below is a summary of significant federal, state, and local existing and proposed
regulations and legislation that may affect our provision of video, data and voice services. Other
aspects of existing federal regulations, copyright licensing, and, in many jurisdictions, state and
local franchise and telecommunications regulatory requirements, are also subject to judicial
proceedings, legislative hearings and administrative proposals that could change, in varying
degrees, the operations of telecommunications companies such as ours. Regulation of Video Services Cable Television Systems Our cable television systems are subject to Federal regulation under the Cable Television
Consumer Protection and Competition Act of 1992 the 1992 Cable Act. The 1992 Cable Act
regulates, among other things, broadcast signal carriage requirements that allow local commercial
television broadcast stations to require a cable system to carry the station. Local commercial
television broadcast stations may elect once every three years to require a cable system to carry
the station must-carry, subject to certain exceptions, or to withhold consent and negotiate the
terms of carriage retransmission consent. A cable system generally is required to devote up to
one-third of its activated channel capacity for the carriage of local commercial television
stations whether under the must-carry or retransmission consent requirements of the 1992 Cable Act.
The 1992 Cable Act also permits LFAs to require cable operators to set aside certain channels for
public, educational and governmental PEG programming. Cable systems with 36 or more channels
must also make available a portion of their channel capacity for commercial leased access by third
parties to provide programming that may compete with services offered by the cable operator. Local
non-commercial television stations are also given mandatory carriage rights. Our FCC licenses also
include certain earth station radio licenses pursuant to which we operate our cable head-end
equipment. Because cable communications systems use local streets and rights-of-way, they are generally
also subject to state and local regulation, typically imposed through the local franchising process
and by local cable regulatory ordinances. The terms and conditions of state or local government
franchises vary from jurisdiction to jurisdiction. Generally, they contain provisions governing
franchise fees, monetary and in-kind contributions to PEG channels and services, franchise term,
time limitations on commencement and completion of construction, system technical standards, and
other conditions of service, including the number of PEG channels, the provision of free cable
and/or broadband service to schools and other public institutions, liquidated damages and the
maintenance of insurance and indemnity bonds, maintenance obligations, customer service standards,
franchise renewal, sale or transfer of the franchise, use and occupancy of public streets, and
types of cable services provided. LFAs may not award exclusive franchises within their
jurisdictions. The 1992 Cable Act also provides that, in granting or renewing franchises, LFAs may
establish requirements for cable-related facilities and equipment, but may not regulate video
programming content other than in broad categories. From time to time a LFA may amend its local
cable ordinances or we may disagree with a LFA as to our obligations under our franchise or the
cable ordinance, the outcome of which could have a material effect on our results of operations. We have approximately 126 cable franchises and open video system OVS agreements, permits
and similar authorizations Franchise Agreements issued by local, state and federal government
authorities. OVS In some jurisdictions, we provide cable television programming as an OVS provider pursuant to
certificates issued to us by the FCC. The OVS framework is an alternative regulatory structure,
established at the federal level, for operators providing multi-channel video service to
subscribers. Although exempted by federal law from some of the regulations that apply to cable
operators, the FCC rules require OVS operators to make channel capacity on the system available to
unaffiliated video programming providers VPPs. We have provided VPPs with notice of the
opportunity to obtain capacity on our operational OVS systems, but to date no VPP has requested
carriage on any of our systems. OVS networks, like cable systems, are also subject to local
regulation for use of local streets and rights-of-way. We have entered into agreements with each
of the municipalities where we offer OVS services that provide for the payment of the fees and
carriage of PEG channels required by the federal Telecommunications Act of 1996, as amended the
1996 Act. The terms and conditions of our OVS agreements vary from jurisdiction to
jurisdiction, but generally contain provisions governing gross receipts fees, term, PEG channel and
funding requirements, and other right-of-way management requirements similar to those in our cable
franchises. Local cable ordinances may also regulate certain aspects of our OVS service, and OVS
operators are also subject to the same requirements as cable operators with regard to
retransmission consent and must-carry, carriage of non-commercial television stations, and certain
other programming-related regulatory requirements, as well as other cable-related FCC regulations. 10 Table of Contents Cable and OVS Regulation Our existing cable franchises and OVS Franchise Agreements expire at varying times. Prior to
the scheduled expiration of most Franchise Agreements, we initiate renewal proceedings with the
granting authorities, and historically, our Franchise Agreements that have reached their expiration
dates have been renewed or extended. The 1992 Cable Act provides for a cable license renewal
process in which granting authorities may not unreasonably withhold cable franchise renewals. Our
OVS authorizations are issued by the FCC, which would provide a forum for appeal if a LFA were to
unreasonably withhold a renewal of an OVS agreement. Currently, several of our cable franchises in
the eastern Pennsylvania market and our New York City OVS agreement are beyond their stated
expiration dates but are continuing under their existing terms and conditions during renewal
negotiations. Although we cannot be certain that we will be able to renew these or other Franchise
Agreements on acceptable terms, our experience and the experience of other cable providers has been
that, absent any significant disputes as to compliance with the prior agreement, Franchise
Agreements are generally renewed upon substantially similar terms upon expiration by mutual
agreement between the LFA and the provider. The 1992 Cable Act limits franchise fees to 5% of gross revenues derived from the provision of
cable services. Accordingly, most Franchise Agreements require us to pay the granting authority a
fee of up to 5% of our gross cable service revenues earned in the franchised territory. We are
entitled to and generally pass this fee through to our customers. In addition, franchises
generally provide for monetary or in-kind capital contributions to support PEG services PEG
Fees. In our OVS markets, we are required to match the franchise and PEG Fees paid by incumbent
operators. Those PEG Fees typically range from 1% to 3% of gross revenues or are assessed on a
per subscriber basis and often include in kind services, such as the dedication of fiber
facilities for use by the franchise authority and other PEG entities. However, certain
jurisdictions have adopted flat rate contributions rather than a rate based on revenues or numbers
of subscribers. In flat rate jurisdictions, we are at a cost disadvantage compared to larger cable
systems that pay a lower effective per subscriber fee. The FCC recently adopted an order that would place a cap of 5%, inclusive of all PEG Fees, on
the fees paid by new cable entrants. A subsequent FCC order affords similar relief to existing
operators, like RCN, at the time their existing Franchise Agreements are renewed. These orders
give new cable providers who may enter certain of our markets a temporary cost advantage over us
and other existing cable operators, since the new entrants will pay a maximum of 5% and not have to
contribute the additional PEG Fees and in-kind contributions assessed on existing operators in the
market for the period until their current Franchise Agreements expire. A number of state legislatures, including several in our service areas, have adopted
legislation that is intended to facilitate new entry into the cable market. Where such statewide
franchise laws are adopted, the FCC will defer to the state with respect to franchise procedures.
Like the FCC franchise orders, these laws generally enable new operators to enter our markets more
quickly than they would have been able to do under the traditional franchise procedures. However,
these new statewide franchise procedures will also be available to us to facilitate our expansion
into new service areas and, like the FCC orders, may also facilitate and lessen the obligations
imposed by LFAs in our future renewal processes. In addition, the FCC has adopted several net neutrality principles that assure access by
consumers to their choice of Internet content, connection equipment, and applications without
unreasonable restrictions by cable, broadband and other network providers. We are committed to
compliance with the FCCs net neutrality requirements. However, a number of parties have urged
the FCC to adopt more comprehensive net neutrality rules and regulations that would affect the
manner in which we manage our broadband network which, if adopted, could impose significant costs
on us and restrict the manner in which we conduct our business. The FCC and Congress have recently begun to explore whether cable companies should be required
to offer programming services on an unbundled a la carte basis so that consumers can have more
choice over which channels of programming they purchase. We have supported the concept of a la
carte programming tiers. We have, for example, developed MiVision, a group of four mini tiers
of Spanish-language programming, and have also begun to offer other pods of themed programming in
connection with our all-digital video platform. However, restrictions in our programming contracts
greatly inhibit our ability to expand such offerings. Moreover, we believe any legislative or
regulatory mandate requiring us to implement a la carte programming that does not recognize
technological and contractual limitations, or that mandates particular a la carte service offerings
or requires channels to be offered on an individual basis and does not permit us to develop a la
carte programming tiers based upon market demand and conditions, could impose significant costs on
us and the manner in which we conduct our business. The FCC has issued rules establishing standards for the mandated digital television DTV
transition in which television stations will convert to full digital broadcasting now scheduled to
occur on June12, 2009 DTV Transition. Although TV stations will only broadcast in digital
format as of the DTV Transition, the FCC recently adopted a rule that will require cable operators
who still transmit analog cable programming after that time to down-convert digital over-the-air
broadcast signals to analog and transmit them to subscribers in both analog and digital formats.
Although this requirement will not affect any of our all-digital markets, it will require that we
devote spectrum in our Lehigh Valley market to such analog transmissions that we could otherwise
use for digital programming, including additional HD and video-on-demand programming. The FCC is
also considering whether to expand its ruling to require cable operators to carry more than one
digital program stream from each of the broadcasters in their markets. If adopted, this would
result in dedication of considerable additional channel capacity by cable operators to the
broadcasters after the DTV Transition. The proposal, which would affect all of our markets, has
been the subject of considerable debate and cable industry opposition at the FCC, and it is too
soon to tell whether the FCC will adopt such a
rule. If adopted, it would also affect all of our cable competitors and any such ruling would
likely not have a disproportionate effect on our ability to compete with other cable operators in
the market. 11 Table of Contents In addition to the FCC regulations previously discussed, there are other FCC cable regulations
that directly affect the way that we operate our video businesses in areas such as: equal
employment opportunity; syndicated program exclusivity; network program non-duplication;
registration of cable systems; maintenance of various records and public inspection files;
microwave frequency usage; lockbox availability; sponsorship identification; antenna structure
notification; tower marking and lighting; carriage of local sports broadcast programming;
application of rules governing political broadcasts; limitations on advertising contained in
non-broadcast childrens programming; consumer protection and customer service; ownership and
access to cable home wiring and home run wiring in multiple dwelling units MDUs; indecent
programming; programmer access to cable systems; programming agreements; technical standards; and
consumer electronics equipment compatibility and closed captioning. The FCC has the authority to enforce its regulations by imposing substantial fines, issuing
cease and desist orders and/or imposing other administrative sanctions, such as revoking FCC
licenses needed to operate transmission facilities often used in connection with cable operations. Regulation of Information Services Our broadband Internet access service and the other information services we offer using
Internet protocol are largely unregulated at this time. Broadband Internet access providers, as
well as voice services providers, are subject to federal laws requiring them to provide certain
capabilities for intercepting and recording communications to authorized law enforcement agencies.
Some federal, state, local and foreign governmental regulators are considering a number of
legislative and regulatory proposals with respect to Internet user privacy, infringement, pricing
and quality of products and services, and intellectual property ownership. Regulation of Telecommunications Services Federal Regulation The use of our network for interstate and international voice and data telecommunications
services, including the local component of any interstate or international call, is regulated by
the FCC under the Communications Act. We provide domestic interstate voice services nationwide and
have been authorized by the FCC to offer worldwide international services. The rates, terms, and
conditions of these services are no longer subject to FCC tariffing, but we remain subject to the
FCCs jurisdiction over complaints regarding these services. We are required to pay various
regulatory fees and assessments to support programs authorized by the FCC. We must also comply with
FCC rules regarding the disclosure of rates, terms and conditions of service; the content and
format of invoices; obtaining proper authorization for carrier changes; and other consumer
protection matters. In addition, the FCC requires prior approval for transfers of control and asset
transfers by regulated carriers, including reorganizations and asset transfers undertaken in
connection with restructuring transactions. The 1996 Act gives us important rights to connect with the networks of ILECs in the areas
where we operate. This law, among other things, requires ILECs to provide nondiscriminatory access
and interconnection to potential competitors, such as cable operators, wireless telecommunications
providers and long distance companies. These obligations include the following   
InterconnectionRequires the ILECs to permit their competitors to interconnect with ILEC
facilities at any technically feasible point in the ILECs network.   
Reciprocal CompensationRequires all ILECs and CLECs to complete calls originated by
competing local exchange carriers under reciprocal arrangements at prices set by the FCC,
PUCs or negotiated prices.   
Access to Unbundled Network ElementsRequires ILECs to provide nondiscriminatory access
to unbundled network elements UNEs, including network facilities, equipment, features,
functions and capabilities, at any technical feasible point within their networks, on
nondiscriminatory terms, at prices based on the ILECs forward looking costs, which may
include a reasonable profit.   
Collocation of EquipmentAllows CLECs to install and maintain their own network
equipment in ILEC central offices.   
ResaleRequires the ILEC to establish wholesale discounted rates for services it
provides to end-users at retail rates.   
Number PortabilityRequires all ILECs and CLECs to permit users of telecommunications
services to retain existing telephone numbers without impairment of quality, reliability or
convenience when switching from one telecommunications provider to another.   
Dialing ParityRequires the ILECs and CLECs to establish dialing parity so that all
customers must dial the same number of digits to place the same type of call.   
Access to Rights-of-WayRequires all ILECs to permit competing carriers access to poles,
ducts, conduits and rights-of-way at regulated prices. 12 Table of Contents Regulations promulgated by the FCC to implement these provisions of the law require local
exchange carriers to provide competitors with access to UNEs at prices based on incremental cost
studies. In orders released in 2003 and 2005, the FCC adopted significant changes to its UNE rules.
Because we own or lease our own network rather than relying on the ILECs facilities, these changes
have affected us less than they have some of our competitors. The FCC in certain cases has agreed to forbear from applying its UNE requirements in certain
geographic markets where it has determined that sufficient competition exists in the provision of
local telecommunications services. To date, none of these decisions have affected markets in which
we are operating. The FCC recently denied Verizons requests for forbearance in six markets,
including Boston, New York, and Philadelphia. Verizon has appealed this decision and we are unable
to predict the outcome of the appeal, or the potential effect a reversal of the FCC order might
have upon our operations in these markets. We have interconnection agreements with Verizon, ATT, and other ILECs serving the markets
where they provide telephone service. These agreements, which are required under the terms of the
1996 Act, are usually effective for terms of two or three years. As a general matter, these
agreements provide for service to continue without interruption while a new agreement is
negotiated. Most of the agreements also provide for amendments in the event of changes in the law,
such as the regulatory and court decisions described above. Reciprocal Compensation Our interconnection agreements with ILECs entitle us to collect reciprocal compensation
payments from them for local telephone calls that terminate on our facilities. In 2001, the FCC
adopted rules limiting the compensation that we can collect for terminating dial-up Internet
traffic, and it modified these rules in 2004 and re-affirmed them in November2008, although this
most recent decision has been appealed to a federal court. Under these rules, the maximum rate for
termination of this class of traffic was reduced in a series of steps to its current level of
$0007 per minute, which will remain in effect until further action by the FCC. Changes in the
FCC rules due to court review, or on the FCCs own initiative, could have a material effect on the
amount of revenue we obtain from these payments. Access Charges We remit access fees directly to local exchange carriers or indirectly to underlying long
distance carriers for the origination and termination of our interstate and intrastate long
distance voice traffic. Generally, intrastate access charges are higher than interstate access
charges. Therefore, to the degree access charges increase or a greater percentage of our long
distance traffic is intrastate, our costs of providing long distance services will increase. When
providing local telephone service, we also bill access charges to long distance providers for the
origination and termination of those providers long distance calls. Accordingly, we benefit from
the receipt of intrastate and interstate long distance traffic. As an entity that both collects and
remits access charges, we have implemented systems designed to ensure that we properly track and
record the jurisdiction of our telecommunications traffic and remit or collect access charges
accordingly. The FCC currently is considering public comments on a proposal to substantially
reduce both access charges and reciprocal compensation payments over a period of several years. It
is not known yet when the FCC will act on this proposal, or whether it will adopt any portion of
it. Because we make payments to and receive payments from other carriers for exchange of local and
long distance calls, the FCCs ultimate determination may have a material effect upon our business. Slamming and Cramming Customers may change local and long distance service providers at any time. The FCC and some
states regulate this process and require that specific procedures be followed. When these
procedures are not followed, particularly if the change is unauthorized, the process is known as
slamming. The FCC has levied substantial fines for slamming. The risk of financial damage, in the
form of fines, penalties and legal fees and costs, and to business reputation from slamming is
significant. FCC rules and other laws also regulate the types of services that can appear on a local
telephone bill, as well as the format of those bills. Only charges for services authorized by the
subscriber may appear on bills. The practice of billing for unauthorized services is known as
cramming. Violations of rules regarding cramming may result in fines, penalties, and other costs. We have implemented internal procedures designed to ensure that new subscribers are switched
to our services in accordance with federal and state regulations and that our customer bills comply
with the law. Because of the large volume of service orders we process, it is possible that some
unauthorized carrier changes may be processed inadvertently or that subscribers may be billed for
services they did not order, and we cannot assure you that we will not be subject to slamming or
cramming complaints. 13 Table of Contents Digital Phone In certain markets we use a digital phone architecture that transmits data signals over our
broadband network between the customer premise and an RCN switch for carriage to and from the
public switched telephone network PSTN. We use this technology for delivery of voice telephone
services to some of our subscribers. The FCC currently is investigating what, if any, regulatory
requirements should apply to the provision of telephone service over Internet facilities, and
whether regulation of this service should differ from regulation of traditional telephone service.
Although we consider this a facilities-based service where phone calls transit through the PSTN
rather than through the public Internet, the FCC classifies this as a VoIP service for emergency
9-1-1 reporting. The FCC has adopted rules requiring providers of VoIP services that are
interconnected to the public switched telephone network to comply with many of the same regulatory
obligations as traditional telephone carriers, including among other things providing all customers
with emergency 9-1-1 dialing service with certain capabilities, paying various regulatory fees, and
installing network capabilities required by law enforcement agencies for interception of
communications pursuant to the Communications Assistance for Law Enforcement Act. Because we
operate as a regulated telephone carrier, our digital phone service was already required to comply
with these obligations and we did not incur any additional burdens as a result of the FCC orders. State Regulation State PUCs have jurisdiction over intrastate communications i.e., those that originate and
terminate in the same state. Providers of intrastate local and long distance telephone services
typically must receive a certificate of public convenience and necessity or similar authorization
in order to offer local and intrastate toll services. We are also subject to state laws and
regulations regarding slamming, cramming, and other consumer protection and disclosure regulations.
Our rates for intrastate-switched access services, which we provide to long distance companies to
originate and terminate in-state toll calls, are subject to the jurisdiction of the state PUC where
the call originated and terminated. All such state regulations could materially and adversely
affect our revenues and business opportunities within that state. State PUCs also have jurisdiction over the terms and conditions of interconnection agreements
between ILECs and other carriers. In each state, we have the option of adopting the terms of an
agreement negotiated by another carrier. If no such agreement is available, we can negotiate a new
agreement with the ILEC, and in the event of an impasse either the ILEC or we may request binding
arbitration by the PUC. Taxes and Regulatory Fees We are subject to numerous local, state and federal taxes and regulatory fees, including the
federal excise tax, FCC universal service fund contributions and regulatory fees, and numerous PUC
regulatory fees. We have procedures in place designed to ensure that we properly collect taxes and
fees from our customers and remit such taxes and fees to the appropriate entity pursuant to
applicable law and/or regulation. Other Regulatory Issues Digital Set-Top Box Regulation Currently, most subscribers access video services through a leased set-top box that integrates
programming security features we need to prevent theft of our signals with the channel navigation
function of the box. The FCC adopted regulations that became effective on July1, 2007 that
require the distribution of set-top boxes that separate the security features from the channel
navigation features to further its policy of permitting subscribers to use equipment provided by
third parties to obtain the services we deliver. We obtained a one-year waiver from the FCC so that
we could continue to deploy our most basic set-top box until July1, 2008, which was subsequently
extended to January31, 2009. Requests for extension of the waiver are currently pending at the
FCC but to date have not been acted upon. There is no assurance that the FCC will grant such
requests, and absent a further extension, our costs to transition our Lehigh Valley network to an
all-digital video platform and to deploy new set-top boxes in the ordinary course of business in
our other markets could increase substantially. Although the rule also affects the costs of all of
our cable competitors, it is possible that we could be disproportionately affected if our larger
competitors, who have significantly greater volume purchasing power, are able to negotiate volume
discounts on equipment purchases not available to RCN. Right-of-Way Access The City of New York has imposed a right-of-way fee on our gross revenue for
telecommunications services that is in addition to the gross revenues fees we pay pursuant to our
OVS agreement. Although the City of New York imposes a similar fee on the telecommunications
services offered by our cable and CLEC competitors, the fee has the effect of raising our costs as
compared to Verizon, who is not currently subject to the fee. 14 Table of Contents Pole and Conduit Attachments The 1996 Act requires phone companies and other utilities other than those owned by
municipalities or cooperatives to provide cable systems with nondiscriminatory access to any pole
or right-of-way controlled by the utility. The rates that utilities may charge for such access are
regulated by the FCC or, alternatively, by states that certify to the FCC that they regulate such
rates. There is always the possibility that the
FCC or a state could permit the increase of pole attachment rates paid by cable operators.
Additionally, higher pole attachment rates apply to pole attachments that are subject to the FCCs
telecommunications services pole rates. In a ruling of particular importance to us, the United
States Supreme Court held that broadband service providers that co-mingled video,
telecommunications, and Internet services over their networks were entitled to the protections of
the FCC regulations regarding pole attachment rates. The FCC is currently considering whether to
require a uniform rate structure for telecommunications and cable pole attachments. There is a
risk that we will face higher pole attachment costs as a result of this proceeding. Program Access Section628 of the Federal Communications Act currently precludes any cable operator or
satellite video programmer affiliated with a cable company or with a common carrier providing video
programming directly to its subscribers, from favoring an affiliated company over competitors. In
certain circumstances, programmers are required to sell their programming to other multi-channel
video distributors. The law and related FCC rules also limit the ability of program suppliers
affiliated with cable companies to offer exclusive programming arrangements to their affiliates.
Unless the FCC decides to further extend these requirements, the law and related FCC regulations
are currently scheduled to sunset in 2012. We therefore do not have guaranteed future access to
certain programming that is highly desirable to our customers, which could materially impact our
ability to compete effectively in our markets. In addition, these statutory and regulatory
limitations apply only to programming that is distributed by satellite and do not apply to
terrestrially-delivered programming and do not apply to DBS providers or cover programming that is
distributed by programming suppliers who are not affiliates of cable operators. Commercial Leased Access Cable systems with 36 or more channels must make available a portion of their channel capacity
for commercial leased access by third parties to facilitate competitive programming efforts. We
have not been subject to many requests for carriage under the leased access rules. However, the
FCC has modified the way that cable operators must calculate their rates for such access. It is
possible that, unless this change is reversed on appeal, there may be more carriage requests in the
future. We cannot assure that we would be able to recover our costs under the new methodology or
that the use of our network capacity for such carriage would not materially impact our ability to
compete effectively in our markets. Building Access In certain instances, we have had difficulty gaining access to the video distribution wiring
in certain MDUs because building management will not permit us to install our own distribution
wiring and/or the incumbent cable company has not permitted use of the existing wiring on an
equitable basis when we attempt to initiate service to an individual unit previously served by the
incumbent. We are also at times precluded from serving an MDU because the owner has entered into an
exclusive agreement with another provider. In some instances, these exclusive agreements are
perpetual. The FCC recently prohibited cable operators from enforcing such exclusive access
contracts for the provision of video service in MDUs and from entering into such contracts in the
future. The order does not go so far as to require that MDU owners allow access to other
operators, but there are mandatory building access statutes in several of the states in which we
operate that give us that right, including New York, Massachusetts, the District of Columbia, and
Illinois. As a result, we presently expect that the FCC order prohibiting the enforcement of
exclusive access agreements will not have a negative impact on us, as we have not had the ability
to enter into such exclusive contracts over the vast majority of our operating footprint, but
rather will have a positive impact insofar as it prohibits our competitors from enforcing and
entering into new exclusive agreements. The FCCs order has been appealed by several parties, and
to the extent that it is overturned on appeal, incumbent cable operators would be able to continue
to enforce and enter into new exclusive contracts with MDUs in the areas where there are no state
mandatory access laws. This could materially impede our ability to serve subscribers located in
those MDUs. The FCC is also considering whether to impose similar prohibitions on the enforcement and
entry of bulk sales agreements and exclusive marketing agreements between MDU owners and cable
operators. To date there has been no decision in that proceeding, but to the extent that the FCC
were to render current bulk sales and exclusive marketing agreements unenforceable or prohibit them
going forward, it could affect the way we market and offer our services in some markets. Customer Proprietary Network Information RCN collects and uses various types of customer information, including personally identifiable
information and information regarding customers use of our services. FCC rules govern our
handling of Customer Proprietary Network Information CPNI, which includes information that
relates to the quantity, technical configuration, type, destination, location, and amount of use of
a telecommunications or interconnected VoIP service, subscription information, and information
contained in customer bills. We have implemented numerous company-wide measures designed to ensure
compliance with the CPNI rules, but cannot assure you that we will not be subject to CPNI penalties
or complaints arising during the process of implementing these measures. 15 Table of Contents Red Flag Rules RCN maintains accounts for, and collects in arrears certain fees and charges from, residential
customers. As a result, under the Federal Trade Commissions FTC recently enacted Red Flag
Rules, RCN is a creditor that must comply with certain requirements designed to prevent, detect and
mitigate identity theft on residential and certain other customer accounts. The Red Flag Rules
require that creditors establish and implement an Identity Theft Prevention Program and take
certain other measures to prevent, detect and mitigate identity theft. FTC enforcement of the Red
Flag Rules will commence as of May1, 2009. We are implementing company-wide measures designed to
ensure compliance with the Red Flag Rules, but cannot assure you that we will not be subject to
enforcement action arising during the implementation of these measures or thereafter. Employees As of December31, 2008, we had approximately 1,500 employees, substantially all of which are
full-time. Approximately 85% of these employees are associated with the RCN and RCN Business
Services Segment. None of the employees are covered by a collective bargaining agreement. ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS We have a history of net losses and we emerged from Chapter11 reorganization in 2004. We have had a history of net losses and expect to continue to report net losses for the
foreseeable future. As discussed in greater detail above, we sought protection under Chapter11 of
the U.S. Bankruptcy Code in May2004 and emerged on December21, 2004. We reported net losses of
$707million, $1520million, $119million and $1361million for the years ended December31,
2008, 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. Our net losses are principally attributable to
insufficient revenue to cover our operating expenses, which we expect will remain significant. We are subject to regulation by federal, state and local governments, which may impose costs
and restrictions. As discussed in greater detail above, federal, state and local governments extensively
regulate the cable industry and the telephone services industry and are beginning to regulate
certain aspects of the Internet services industry. There are numerous proceedings pending before
the FCC, state PUCs and state and federal courts that may materially affect the way that we do
business. For example, Congress, the FCC, and some states are considering various regulations and
legislation pertaining to network neutrality, digital carriage obligations, digital set top box
requirements, program access rights, digital telephone services, and changes to the pricing at
which we interconnect exchange traffic with other telephone companies any of which may materially
affect our business operations and costs. With respect to VoIP services, the FCC is considering
whether it should impose additional VoIP E911 obligations on interconnected VoIP providers,
including a proposed requirement that interconnected VoIP providers automatically determine the
physical location of their customer rather than allowing customers to manually register their
location. Also, the FCC continues to evaluate alternative methods for assessing USF charges. We
cannot predict what actions the FCC or state regulators may take in the future, nor can we
determine the potential financial impact of those possible actions. We also expect that new legislative enactments, court actions and regulatory proceedings will
continue to clarify and in some cases change the rights and obligations of cable operators,
telecommunications companies and other entities under federal, state, and local laws, possibly in
ways that we have not foreseen. Congress and state legislatures consider new legislative
requirements potentially affecting our businesses virtually every year and new proceedings before
the FCC, state PUCs and state and federal courts are initiated on a regular basis that may also
have an impact on the way that we do business. Actions by local authorities may also affect our business. Local franchise authorities grant
franchises or other agreements that permit us to operate our cable and OVS systems, and we have to
renew or renegotiate these agreements from time to time. Local franchise authorities often demand
concessions or other commitments as a condition to renewal or transfer, and such concessions or
other commitments could be costly to us in the future. In addition, we could be materially
disadvantaged if we remain subject to legal constraints that do not apply equally to our
competitors, such as where local telephone companies that enter our markets to provide video
programming services are not subject to the local franchising requirements and other requirements
that apply to us. For example, the FCC has adopted rules and several states have enacted
legislation to ease the franchising process and enable state-wide franchising for new entrants.
While reduced franchising limitations could also benefit us if we were to expand our systems, the
chief beneficiaries of these rules are the larger, well funded traditional telephone carriers, such
as Verizon. The results of these ongoing and future legislative, judicial and administrative actions may
materially affect our cost of business operations and profitability. See Regulation in Item1 to
this Annual Report on Form 10-K. 16 Table of Contents We depend on certain third party suppliers for equipment, software and outsourced services,
and in some cases, a single vendor in order to obtain economies of scale. If we are unable to
receive quality goods or services from these vendors on reasonable terms and on a
timely basis, our ability to offer services could be impaired, and our brand, growth,
operations, and financial results could be materially adversely affected. We depend on third party suppliers and licensors to provide some of the hardware, software and
operational support functions necessary to provide some of our services. We obtain these goods and
services from a limited number of vendors, and in certain cases, rely on a single vendor in order
to maximize our volume-based purchasing discounts. If demand exceeds these vendors capacity or if
these vendors experience operating or financial difficulties, or are otherwise unable to provide
the goods and services we need in a quality, timely manner and at reasonable prices, our ability to
provide some services might be materially adversely affected. The need to procure or develop
alternative sources of the affected goods or services might delay our ability to serve our
customers. These events could materially and adversely affect our ability to retain and attract
customers, and have a material negative impact on our operations, business, results of operations
and financial condition. In the event of a substantial failure or disruption of our network or information systems, or
loss of key facilities or personnel, we may not be able to fully recover our services for an
extended period, which would adversely affect our financial position and future results of
operations. Our disaster recovery framework to control and address systems and key facilities risks may
not currently permit for timely recovery of our primary service delivery capability and information
systems functions in any of our key geographic markets in the event of a catastrophic event or loss
of major systems capabilities, including those arising from abusive or malicious Internet
activities. We may incur substantial costs, delays and customer complaints before restoring our
primary business if such a catastrophic failure was to occur. In the event of a disaster impairing
our primary service delivery and operational capabilities, we would expect to experience a
substantial negative effect on our results of operations and financial condition. Programming costs have risen in past years and are expected to continue to rise, and we may
not be able to pass such programming costs through to our customers, which could adversely affect
our cash flow and operating margins. The cost of obtaining programming is the largest operating cost associated with providing our
video service. These costs have increased each year, and we expect them to continue to increase,
especially the costs associated with sports programming. Many of our programming contracts cover
multiple years and provide for future increases in the fees we must pay. In addition, local
over-the-air television stations are increasingly seeking substantial fees for retransmission of
their stations over our cable networks. Historically, we have absorbed increased programming costs
in large part through increased prices to our customers. We cannot assure you that competitive and
other marketplace factors will permit us to continue to pass through these costs, particularly as
an increasing amount of programming content is available via the Internet at little or no cost.
Despite our efforts to manage programming expenses, we cannot assure you that the rising cost of
programming will not adversely affect our cash flow and operating margins. In addition,
programming costs are generally related directly to the number of subscribers to which the
programming is provided. Larger cable and DBS systems generally pay lower per subscriber
programming costs. This cost difference can cause us to suffer reduced operating margins as prices
decrease, while our competitors will not suffer similar margin compression due to their generally
lower costs. In addition, as programming agreements come up for renewal, we cannot assure you that
we will be able to renew these agreements on comparable or favorable terms. To the extent that we
are unable to reach acceptable agreements with programmers, we may be forced to remove programming
from our line-up, which could result in a loss of customers and materially adversely affect our
results of operations and financial condition. Our markets are highly competitive, and many of our competitors have significant advantages.
We may not be able to respond quickly or effectively to changes in the competitive environment,
which could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations and financial position. In each of our markets we face significant competition from incumbent MSOs and ILECs, CLECs,
VoIP service providers, and wireless providers. These competitors have numerous advantages,
including   
significant economies of scale   
greater brand recognition   
greater financial, technical, marketing and other resources   
well-established customer and vendor relationships   
significant control over limited conduit and pole space in the case of incumbent cable and
telephone companies; and   
ownership of content and/or significant cost advantages in the acquisition of content. Due to the relatively small size of our customer-base and market share in each of our markets,
our service pricing is competitively sensitive. If our competitors were to market their services
at substantially lower prices, this could lead to pressure on the pricing of our services, and
could materially adversely affect our results of operations and ability to add or retain customers
and to expand the services purchased by our customers. 17 Table of Contents In particular, we face increasing competition from incumbent telephone companies. For
example, Verizon now offers video services in several of our service areas and is expected to
continue deploying video services in most of our remaining service areas excluding Chicago
in the next several years. Incumbent telephone companies competitive position has been
improved by recent operational, regulatory and legislative advances. The attractive demographics
of our major urban markets make many of our service areas desirable locations for investment in
video distribution technologies by both incumbents and new entrants. By the nature of our
relatively mature markets, the introduction of a viable new entrant will increase competitive
intensity, leading to downward pricing pressure on, and customer losses for, the prior market
competitors. For example, during 2007 and 2008, while we grew video connections, customers and
revenue on a consolidated basis, we lost video connections, customers and revenue in the geographic
areas where Verizon offered video service. While these declines did not have a material impact on
our results of operations, we cannot predict the extent to which increased competition,
particularly from large incumbents, will impact our results of operations in the future. We may be unable to successfully anticipate and respond to various competitive factors
affecting our industry, including regulatory changes that may affect our competitors differently
from us, new technologies and services that may be introduced, changes in consumer preferences,
demographic trends and discount pricing strategies by competitors, which could have a material
adverse impact on our results of operations and financial position. Our business is highly susceptible to changes in general economic conditions, and any
significant downturn in the U.S. economy as a whole, or in any geographic market in which we
provide services, could substantially impact our sales, customer churn, bad debt and collections,
and overall results of operations. While our customers generally place a high value and priority on the services we provide,
customers could reevaluate their expenditures on these services in times of uncertainty and
hardship, which could cause them to cancel all or portions of our services, respond more quickly to
price-based promotions from our competitors, and delay or suspend the payment of their monthly
bills. As a result, given the prevailing economic conditions in the markets where we operate, and
in the event of a further downturn in economic conditions, our results of operations could be
negatively impacted, and the impact could be more severe for us than for our larger competitors or
for those businesses that deliver products or services that customers deem to be higher in
priority. If general economic conditions worsen, we may not be able to continue to deliver
customer and revenue growth, or manage bad debt and collections effectively, any of which could
cause a material adverse impact on our operations, business, results of operations and financial
condition. Our inability to respond to technological developments and meet customer demand for new
products and services could limit our ability to compete effectively. Our business is characterized by rapid technological change and the introduction of new
products and services, some of which are bandwidth-intensive. We cannot assure you that we will be
able to fund the capital expenditures necessary to keep pace with technological developments or
that we will successfully anticipate the demand of our customers for products and services
requiring new technology or bandwidth. Any inability to maintain and expand our upgraded systems
and provide advanced services in a timely manner, or to anticipate the demands of the marketplace,
could materially adversely affect our ability to attract and retain customers. Consequently, our
growth, financial condition and results of operations could suffer materially. We experience turnover among our experienced and trained employee base, which could result in
our inability to continue performing certain functions and completing certain initiatives in
accordance with our existing budgets and operating plans. We depend on the performance of our executive officers and key sales, engineering, and
operations personnel, many of whom have significant experience in the cable and telecommunications
industries and substantial tenures with either our company or one of the companies we have
acquired. We experience turnover among our employees as a whole, and if we are not able to retain
our executive officers or other key employees, we could experience a material and adverse effect on
our financial condition and results of operations. Future sales of our common stock could adversely affect the price of our stock and our ability
to raise capital. A significant portion of our outstanding common stock is held by institutions, which own large
blocks of our shares. Due to the relatively low trading volume in our stock, a decision by any of
these investors to sell all or a portion of their holdings could cause our stock price to drop
significantly, or cause significant volatility in our stock price. In addition, we have a
significant number of shares that we are obligated to issue or that will become available for
resale in the future. For instance, we have issued warrants that are currently exercisable for
8,018,276 shares of our common stock at a per share price of $1672. An ownership change could limit our ability to utilize our federal net operating loss
carryforwards. As of December31, 2008, we had approximately $15billion of usable federal net operating
loss carryforwards for U.S. income tax purposes, that begin to expire in 2022. Our ability to use
these net operating losses can be negatively impacted if there is an ownership change as defined
in Section382 of the Internal Revenue Code. In general, this would occur if shareholders that
each own 5percent or more of the Company in the aggregate were to own 50
percentage points more than the lowest amount they owned in the
previous three year period. In the event
an ownership change were to occur, our ability to utilize these net operating losses could be
significantly limited and could cause us to pay cash federal income taxes much sooner than
currently anticipated. 18 Table of Contents We and our subsidiaries have had, and may in the future incur, a significant amount of
indebtedness, which could adversely affect our financial position and our ability to react to
changes in our business. We currently have a significant amount of debt, and may subject to applicable restrictions in
our debt instruments incur additional debt in the future. As of December31, 2008, our total
debt was approximately $743million and our interest expense based on the aggregate debt
outstanding and interest rates in effect on such date, is anticipated to be approximately $44
million in 2009. Our credit agreement includes a variety of negative covenants that require us to
dedicate a significant portion of our cash flow from operating activities to make payments on our
debt, thereby reducing our funds available for working capital, capital expenditures, and other
general corporate expenses. We cannot guarantee that we will be able to reduce our level of indebtedness or generate
sufficient cash flow to service our debt and meet our capital expenditure requirements. If we
cannot do so, we would need to seek additional financing, reduce our capital expenditures or take
other steps, such as disposing of assets. We cannot assure you that financing would be available
on acceptable terms or that asset sales could be accomplished on acceptable terms. In connection with operating our business and building our network, we have incurred operating
and net losses and we expect to continue to experience losses for the foreseeable future. We have
experienced negative cash flow in the past and may not be able to achieve or sustain operating
profitability in the future The covenants in our credit agreement restrict our financial and operational flexibility. Our credit agreement imposes operating and financial restrictions that affect our ability to,
among other things   
incur additional debt   
create liens on our assets   
make particular types of investments or other restricted payments   
engage in transactions with affiliates   
acquire assets or make certain capital expenditures   
utilize proceeds from asset sales for purposes other than debt reduction, except for limited
exceptions for reinvestment in our business   
merge or consolidate or sell substantially all of our assets; and   
pay dividends or repurchase shares of our common stock. These requirements may affect our ability to finance future operations or to engage in other
beneficial business activities. These restrictions may also limit our flexibility in planning for,
or reacting to, changes in market conditions and cause us to be more vulnerable in the event of a
downturn in our business. If we violate any of these lien restrictions, we could be in default
under our credit agreement and our creditors could seek to accelerate our repayment obligations
and/or foreclose on our assets, either of which would materially and adversely affect our financial
position. Item1 Business

Item5. PROPERTIES Real Estate As of December31, 2008, RCN leased approximately 107 facilities, including 93 technical and
14 non-technical facilities, which encompassed approximately 646,000 and 338,000 square feet,
respectively, to support its operations. These leases are typically non-cancelable with terms
ranging from one to 21years. RCN is actively seeking to sublease or negotiate a termination of
the leases in part or all of three facilities, including two technical and one non-technical
facility, which contain approximately 21,700 and 18,700 square feet, respectively. RCN also
currently owns seven technical facilities, which encompass approximately 58,700 square feet.
Thirty two of the leased facilities and three of the owned facilities are used by our RCN Metro
segment in their operations. We lease our corporate office space in Herndon, VA. We believe that our properties are generally in good operating condition and are suitable for
our business operations. 19 Table of Contents ITEM 3. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS City of Chicago Franchise Fee We, like other cable providers, currently do not pay a franchise fee on our cable modem
Internet access services on the basis that the FCC has determined that such Internet services are
not cable services, as defined in the Communications Act. Our position has been challenged by the
City of Chicago, which has brought suit against RCNs Chicago subsidiary, as well as ATT Broadband
now Comcast, the incumbent cable operator in RCN-Chicagos franchised service area, and the other
franchised cable television operator in the City of Chicago collectively, the Defendants.
Although the Defendants prevailed in the Cook County Circuit Court, the City of Chicago appealed
that decision to the Illinois Appellate Court. The Illinois Appellate Court reversed the lower
court decision and ruled in favor of the City finding that the franchise agreements are valid
contracts under state law and that the agreements are not preempted by federal law including the
Communications Act. The Appellate Court further ruled that the Defendants are in violation of
their contractual terms under the franchise agreements by nonpayment of franchise fees on cable
modem service since April2002. In June2007, Comcast filed a Petition for Rehearing of that decision. The Petition for
Rehearing was denied by the Appellate Court. The three Defendants subsequently filed petitions on
September21, 2007 for leave to appeal to the Illinois Supreme Court. Although the City opposed
these petitions, the Illinois Supreme Court granted the leave to appeal on November29, 2007. On
November20, 2008, the Supreme Court of Illinois reversed the judgment of the Appellate Court and
affirmed the ruling of the Cook County Circuit Court that such services are not cable services
and, therefore, not subject to payment of the franchise fee. We are party to various other legal proceedings that arise in the normal course of business.
In the present opinion of management, none of these proceedings, individually or in the aggregate,
are likely to have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position or consolidated
results of operations or cash flows. However, we cannot provide assurance that any adverse outcome
would not be material to our consolidated financial position or consolidated results of operations
or cash flows. Item1 Business

All of the shares included in column cof the table above were repurchased in connection
with the $25million share repurchase program announced on May24, 2007. There is no expiration
date for the repurchase program. No repurchase programs expired during the periods presented above,
and management does not intend to terminate the repurchase program. Dividends Between our emergence from bankruptcy on December21, 2004 and June10, 2007, we did not
declare or pay a cash dividend on our common stock. Our debt agreements that existed during that
time period did not permit such dividends to be declared or paid. On June11, 2007, in connection
with the refinancing of our senior debt, we paid a special cash dividend of $933 per share on all
issued and outstanding RCN common stock as of June4, 2007, totaling approximately $347million.
The total dividend paid in June2007 excluded $45million of dividends due upon vesting of
unvested restricted stock issued to employees prior to the dividend record date, the majority of
which has now been paid. The Company does not intend to pay additional dividends for the
foreseeable future. Description of RCN Corporations Equity Securities Pursuant to RCNs 2004 Plan of Reorganization Plan, on December21, 2004, all of the
securities of RCN, including the then existing common stock, preferred stock, stock options, and
warrants, were extinguished and deemed cancelled. We filed an amended and restated certificate of
incorporation authorizing new shares of common stock. In accordance with the Plan, RCN issued
36,020,850 shares of common stock with a par value of $001 of which 31,919,044 were distributed to
certain of its former bond holders and other general unsecured creditors on the date of emergence,
and 4,101,806 of which were placed in reserve to settle disputed claims against RCN that were
outstanding as of the date of emergence. In 2005 and 2006, RCN distributed 3,303,868 shares and
172,839 shares of common stock, respectively, from the reserve in settlement of filed claims. On
October11, 2006, the remaining 625,099 shares were distributed from the bankruptcy reserve to our
general unsecured creditors and former bondholders in satisfaction of all remaining claims related
to our bankruptcy. Additionally, RCN was authorized by the Plan to issue warrants to the former
stockholders of RCN to purchase an aggregate of 735,119 shares of RCNs common stock. Each such
warrant allowed the holder to purchase one share of RCNs common stock for a price of $3416.
During 2005 and 2006, a total of 184 such warrants were exercised. The warrants expired on
December21, 2006. As contemplated in the Plan, RCN issued Convertible Notes, which, pursuant to their terms,
were convertible into approximately five million shares of RCN common stock, subject to certain
limitations. All such Convertible Notes were repurchased by RCN in May2007 as part of our
recapitalization initiative, as more fully discussed in Item7. As part of the consideration for
the purchase of such Convertible Notes, RCN issued to former holders of such Convertible Notes
warrants to purchase 5,328,521 shares of RCN common stock at an exercise price of $2516 per share
subject to adjustment. Following the adjustments caused by the special cash dividend see Note
11 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, the warrants are currently exercisable for
approximately 8,018,276 shares of common stock at an exercise price of $1672. All of these
warrants were outstanding as of December31, 2008 and expire on June21, 2012. 21 Table of Contents As of December31, 2008, RCN has reserved for issuance under the RCN Stock Compensation Plan
the Stock Plan 8,327,799 shares of our common stock, to be issued in connection with the
exercise of equity compensation grants made to RCNs directors, officers, and employees. The
remaining information required by this item regarding securities authorized for issuance under
equity compensation plans is incorporated by reference to the information set forth in Item12 of
this Form 10-K. ITEM 6. SELECTED FINANCIAL DATA The table below presents the selected financial data from the Companys audited Consolidated
Financial Statements for the years 2004 through 2008. Certain reclassifications have been made to
financial data previously reported to reclassify discontinued operations related to the sale of our
San Francisco operations and the exit of our Los Angeles operations in 2007, as more fully
discussed in Item7. The information contained in the Selected Financial Data is not necessarily indicative of
the results of operations to be expected for future years, and should be read in conjunction with
Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, included
in Item7, and the Consolidated Financial Statements and related notes thereto included in Item8
of this Form 10-K. The Consolidated Financial Statements of RCN for the period from May27, 2004 to December20,
2004 referred to as Predecessor below, were prepared while RCN was involved in Chapter11
proceedings and, accordingly, were prepared in accordance with the American Institute of Certified
Public Accountants AICPA Statement of Position No90-7 SOP 90-7. As a result, the selected
historical financial data for such periods does not include any adjustments relating to the
recoverability and classification of asset carrying amounts or the amount and classification of
liabilities that would have resulted if the Predecessor were deemed not to have been continuing as
a going concern. Upon emergence from Chapter11 of the Bankruptcy Code on December21, 2004, RCN adopted fresh
start accounting in accordance with SOP 90-7. Fresh start accounting required RCN to revalue its
assets and liabilities based upon their estimated fair values and to allocate its reorganization
value. Fresh start reporting changed the recorded value of RCNs tangible and intangible assets
with an associated change in expense items as compared to the historical financial statements. As a
result, the historical financial data of the Predecessor may not be entirely comparable to the
historical financial data of RCN subsequent to December21, 2004 referred to as Successor below
and may be of limited value in evaluating RCNs financial and operating prospects in the future. RCN CORPORATION

ITEM 7.
MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS The following discussion and analysis should be read together with RCNs Consolidated
Financial Statements and related notes thereto beginning on page F-1. Reference is made to
Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward Looking Statements on page 3 of this Annual Report on Form
10-K the Annual Report, which describes important factors that could cause actual results to
differ from expectations and non-historical information contained in this Annual Report. Unless stated otherwise, as in the section titled Discontinued Operations under this Item7,
all of the information contained in Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and
Results of Operations relates to continuing operations. Therefore, the results of operations from
our San Francisco and Los Angeles markets, as discussed below, are excluded for all periods covered
by this Annual Report. Overview RCN is a competitive broadband services provider, delivering all-digital and high-definition
video, high-speed internet and premium voice services primarily to Residential and Small and Medium
Business SMB customers under the brand names of RCN and RCN Business Services, respectively.
In addition, through our RCN Metro Optical Networks business unit RCN Metro, we deliver
fiber-based high-capacity data transport services to large commercial customers, primarily large
enterprises and carriers, targeting the metropolitan central business districts in our geographic
markets. We construct, operate, and manage our own networks, and our primary service areas
include: Washington, D.C., Philadelphia, Lehigh Valley PA, New York City, Boston and Chicago. Subsequent
to the Companys acquisition of NEON Communications Group, Inc.
NEON, in November2007,
management reorganized RCNs business into two key segments:
iResidential/SMB and iiRCN
Metro. There is substantial managerial, network, operational support and product overlap between
the Residential and SMB businesses and, as a result, we have historically reported these two
businesses as one segment. RCN Metro, however, is managed separately from the other two business
units, with separate network operations, engineering, and sales personnel, as well as separate
systems, processes, products, customers and financial measures. Management of the Companys two
key businesses is unified only at the most senior executive levels of the Company. Therefore,
beginning with the results of operations for 2008, the financial results of the RCN Metro business
unit are being reported as a separate segment in accordance with the requirements of SFAS 131,
Disclosures about segments of an enterprise and related information and applicable SEC
regulations. All prior period amounts in this Report have been restated to present the results as
two separate reportable segments. For financial and other information about our segments, refer to
Item8, Note 15 to our Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Annual Report. All of the Companys operations are in the United States. Our Residential/SMB segment, which
serves approximately 428,000 Residential and SMB customers, generates approximately 77% of our
consolidated revenues and the RCN Metro segment generates approximately 23%. During 2008, our
operations generated consolidated revenues of approximately $739million. Basis of reporting Following is a discussion of the key factors that have affected the companys business over
the last three fiscal years. This commentary should be read in conjunction with the companys
Consolidated Financial Statements, Selected Financial Data and the remainder of this Form 10-K. Key Transactions In November2007, we completed the acquisition of NEON, a
network transport services provider to carrier and enterprise customers in the New England and
mid-Atlantic regions. NEON had a fiber optic network that consisted of approximately 4,800 route
miles, over 230,000 fiber miles, 22 co-location facilities, and more than 200 points of presence
from Maine to Virginia. We paid a purchase price of $515 per share of NEON common stock, or total
consideration of approximately $255million. Including transaction costs, the total purchase price
for NEON was approximately $260million. We funded the transaction with a combination of proceeds
from an additional $200million term loan under our existing credit agreement, a draw of
approximately $25million under our existing $75million line of credit, and cash on hand. In March2007, we completed the sale of our San Francisco, California assets to an affiliate
of Astound Broadband LLC, a subsidiary of Wave Broadband LLC Wave. Separately, we decided to
exit the Los Angeles, California market during 2007. Accordingly, the
accompanying audited consolidated results of operations and statements of cash flows for all
periods presented in this Annual Report include the results for these two markets as discontinued
operations. There were no assets and liabilities related
to these markets on the consolidated balance sheets at December 31,
2008 and 2007. 23 Table of Contents In 2007, we completed a recapitalization initiative in which we repaid all of our then
outstanding debt, totaling approximately $199million, and paid a special cash dividend of $933
per share, totaling approximately $347million, utilizing the proceeds of a new $595million
revolving credit and term loan agreement. In March2006, we acquired the stock of Consolidated Edison Communications Holding Company,
Inc. CEC, the telecommunications subsidiary of Consolidated Edison, Inc. CEC, a competitive
local exchange carrier, offers a comprehensive suite of broadband-based communications products and
services, including business continuity and disaster recovery to commercial customers in the
greater New York metropolitan area. Total cash paid for the acquisition, including transaction
costs and post-closing adjustments, was approximately $414million. In March2006, we sold our 4893% interest in both Megacable, a cable television and
high-speed data services provider in certain portions of Mexico, and MCM, a provider of local voice
and high-speed data services in Mexico City collectively, Megacable, for net after-tax proceeds
of $300million. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates The preparation of the Consolidated Financial Statements in accordance with accounting
principles generally accepted in the United States GAAP requires management to make judgments,
estimates and assumptions regarding uncertainties that affect the reported amounts of assets and
liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities and the reported amounts of revenues
and expenses. Management uses historical experience and all available information to make these
judgments and estimates. These estimates and assumptions affect the reported amounts of assets and
liabilities at the dates of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and
expenses during the periods presented. Actual results could differ. Despite these inherent
limitations, management believes that Managements Discussion and Analysis and the accompanying
Consolidated Financial Statements and footnotes provide a meaningful and fair perspective of our
financial condition and operating results for the current period. Estimates are used when
accounting for various items, including allowances for doubtful accounts; investments; asset
impairments; programming related liabilities; revenue recognition; depreciation and amortization;
income taxes; exit and restructuring costs; and legal and other contingencies. Estimates and
assumptions are also used when determining the allocation of the purchase price in a business
combination to the fair value of the assets and liabilities and determining related useful lives. Refer to Note 2 to our Consolidated Financial Statements for a more complete discussion of all
of the Companys significant accounting policies. Results of Operations The comparability of our results of operations for the year ended December31, 2008 with
earlier periods is significantly impacted by the acquisition of NEON in November2007, the sale of
our San Francisco, California assets in March2007, and the subsequent exit of our operations in
the Los Angeles, California market during 2007. The accompanying consolidated results of
operations and statements of cash flows for all periods presented in this Annual Report include the
results for the two California markets as discontinued operations and the assets and liabilities
related to these markets were classified as held for sale on the consolidated balance sheets. NEON
results are included in our consolidated results subsequent to the closing date of November13,
2007. To provide better comparisons of operating results in light of the NEON transaction, the
discussion below provides certain pro forma amounts, in addition to actual results, when comparing
the year ended December31, 2008 to the year ended December31, 2007. Pro forma basis means that
the results are discussed as if NEON was owned throughout the periods presented including the
impact of adjustments made to eliminate certain deferred revenue amortization and transaction
related costs from historical NEON results. The Consolidated Financial Statements include the accounts of RCN and its consolidated
subsidiaries. All intercompany transactions and balances among consolidated entities have been
eliminated. The financial information presented in the table below comprises the audited consolidated
financial information for the years ended December31, 2008, 2007, and 2006. 24 Table of Contents RCN CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES

Consolidated Operating Results Consolidated Revenues Consolidated revenue increased $1031million, or 162%, for the year ended December31, 2008
compared to the year ended December31, 2007 largely due to the acquisition of NEON. In 2007, the
Company recorded a $44million benefit related to a reciprocal compensation agreement. On a pro
forma basis, and excluding the $44million benefit, consolidated revenue increased $432million,
or 62%, for the year ended December31, 2008, as compared to the same period in 2007, primarily
due to an increase in the number of customers in the Residential/SMB segment and higher transport
revenues in the RCN Metro segment. Consolidated revenue increased $506million, or 86% for the year ended December31, 2007
compared to the year ended December31, 2006 primarily due to an increase in APRC and average
number of customers, as well as the acquisitions of CEC in March2006 and NEON in November2007. Consolidated Direct Expenses Consolidated direct expenses increased $394million, or 176% for the year ended December31,
2008 compared to the same period in 2007 primarily due to the acquisition of NEON. On a pro forma
basis, consolidated direct expenses increased $142million, or 57%, for the year ended December
31, 2008 compared to the same period in 2007, as a result of an increase in customers and revenue
for both the Residential/SMB and RCN Metro segments, as well as an increase in the average
programming cost per subscriber in the Residential/SMB segment. Consolidated direct expenses increased $234million, or 116%, for the year ended December
31, 2007 compared to the year ended December31, 2006. The increase was primarily due to the
incremental expenses associated with NEON and CEC of approximately $115million as well as an
increase in programming costs of approximately $80million. The increase in direct expenses was
also attributable to the impact of vendor settlements with providers of our voice and data network
services which totaled $22million and $68million for the years ended December31, 2007 and
2006, respectively. Higher franchise fees, which includes the impact of $15million incurred in
2007 as a result of an audit of prior years, also contributed to the increase in direct expenses. 25 Table of Contents Consolidated Selling, General and Administrative Expenses Consolidated selling, general and administrative expenses SGA increased $57million, or
20%, for the year ended December31, 2008 compared to the same period in 2007, primarily due to
the acquisition of NEON, partially offset by a decrease in stock-based compensation expense of
$199million. On a pro forma basis, and excluding stock-based compensation, SGA increased by $12
million, or 04%, for the year ended December31, 2008 compared to the same period in 2007,
reflecting increases in bad debt expense, property taxes and legal costs, partially offset by a
decline in certain general and administrative expenses, primarily due to the integration and
synergies achieved through the NEON acquisition. Consolidated SGA increased $120million, or 43%, for the year ended December31, 2007
compared to the year ended December31, 2006. The increase was primarily due to an increase in
stock-based compensation of $150million and the acquisitions of NEON and CEC. Excluding the
impact of stock-based compensation and the acquisitions of NEON and CEC, SGA decreased
approximately $103million for the year ended December31, 2007, reflecting a decrease in general
and administrative expenses offset by increases in sales and marketing expenses. Also included in
SGA is $11million of termination pay related to the retirement of the Executive Chairman of the
RCN Board of Directors in December2007. Segment Operating Results To measure the performance of our operating segments, we use operating income before
depreciation and amortization, stock-based compensation, exit costs and restructuring charges. This
measure eliminates the significant level of non-cash depreciation and amortization expense that
results from the capital-intensive nature of our businesses and from intangible assets recognized
in business combinations, as well as non-cash stock-based compensation and other special items such
as exit costs and other restructuring charges. We use this measure to evaluate our consolidated
operating performance and the performance of our operating segments, and to allocate resources and
capital. It is also a significant performance measure in our annual incentive compensation
programs. We believe that this measure is useful to investors because it is one of the bases for
comparing our operating performance with that of other companies in our industries, although our
measure may not be directly comparable to similar measures used by other companies. Because we use
this metric to measure our segment profit or loss, we reconcile it to operating income, the most
directly comparable financial measure calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP, in the
business segment Note 15 to our Consolidated Financial Statements. You should not consider this
measure a substitute for operating income loss, net income loss, net cash provided by operating
activities, or other measures of performance or liquidity we have reported in accordance with GAAP. Residential / SMB Segment Operating Results

Residential / SMB Revenues Residential/SMB revenue increased $217million, or 40%, for the year ended December31, 2008
compared to the year ended December31, 2007. Excluding a $44million benefit related to a
reciprocal compensation agreement recognized in 2007, Residential/SMB revenue increased $261
million, or 48%, during the year ended December31, 2008 as compared to the same period in 2007.
The increase is primarily due to an increase in the average number of customers and average revenue
per customer ARPC. Customers increased by approximately 12,000, or 29%, from December31,
2007 to December31, 2008 primarily due to increased sales opportunities generated through
investments in new and rebuilt homes, and increased focus on sales and marketing to SMB customers.
Total revenue generating units RGUs grew by approximately 18,000, or 20%, from December31,
2007 to December31, 2008, driven primarily by overall customer increases, with data RGU growth
outpacing video RGU growth. Voice RGUs declined consistent with industry trends. ARPC increased
from $109 for the year ended December31, 2007 to $110 for the year ended December31, 2008, due
primarily to growth in average revenue per video RGU and increased high-speed data penetration,
partially offset by declines in average revenue per voice and data RGU. The increase in average
revenue per video RGU was driven mainly by our annual video rate increase, which partially
mitigates the impact of annual increases in programming costs, as well as increased customer
purchases of value added products and services such as our digital set-top, high-definition HD
and digital video recorder DVR boxes, digital programming tier and premium channels. Our
digital video penetration rate rose to 87% of video customers in the fourth quarter of 2008 from
69% in the fourth quarter of 2007, as we neared the completion of Project Analog Crush. The
decrease in average revenue per voice RGU was due to overall market pricing trends, where voice
prices have consistently decreased over the past several years. The decrease in average revenue
per data RGU was primarily due to an increase in the percentage of data RGUs representing
lower-speed data plans, a trend which has increased since RCN introduced these plans last year.

RGUs are all video, high-speed data, and voice connections provided to residential households
and SMB customers. Dial-up Internet and long distance voice services are not included. Additional
telephone lines are each counted as an RGU, but additional room outlets for video service are not
counted. For bulk arrangements in residential multiple dwelling units MDUs, including
dormitories, the number of RGUs is based on the number of video, high-speed data and voice
connections provided and paid for in that MDU. Commercial structures such as hotels and offices are
counted as one RGU regardless of how many units are in the structure. Delinquent accounts are
generally disconnected and no longer counted as RGUs after a set period of time in accordance with
our credit and disconnection policies. RGUs may include customers receiving some services for free
or at a reduced rate in connection with promotional offers or bulk arrangements. RGUs provided free
of charge under courtesy account arrangements are not counted, but additional services paid for are
counted. 27 Table of Contents   
2
A Customer is a residential household or SMB that has at least one paid video, high-speed
data or local voice connection. Customers with only dial-up Internet or long distance voice service
are not included. For bulk arrangements in residential MDUs, including dormitories, each unit or
outlet for which service is provided and separately paid for is counted as a Customer. Commercial
structures such as hotels and offices are counted as one Customer regardless of how many units are
in the structure. Delinquent accounts are generally disconnected and no longer counted as Customers
after a set period of time in accordance with our credit and disconnection policies.   3
ARPC is total revenue for a given monthly period excluding Dial-up Internet, reciprocal
compensation and certain commercial revenue divided by the average number of Customers for the
period. This definition of ARPC may not be similar to ARPC measures of other companies.   4
In connection with our transition to segment reporting, effective January1, 2008, we have
reclassified certain customers, RGUs and revenue related to our RCN Metro business unit, such that
they are no longer included in our reported Residential and SMB metrics. The impact on customers
and RGUs is de minimis, and the impact on ARPC would be to reduce historical reported amounts by
approximately $1. Therefore, this change will only be reflected for periods after January1, 2008,
and historical results will remain as previously presented. Residential/SMB revenue increased $211million, or 40% for the year ended December31, 2007
compared to the year ended December31, 2006 primarily due to an increase in the number of
customers as well as higher ARPC. Excluding a $44million benefit related to a reciprocal
compensation agreement recognized in 2007, revenue increased $167million, or 32%, during the
year ended December31, 2007 as compared to the same period in 2006. Total customers increased by
approximately 10,000 in 2007, or 25%, driven primarily by investments in new and rebuilt homes, as
well as improved sales and marketing execution. ARPC increased $2, from $107 for the year ended
December31, 2006 to $109 for the year ended December31, 2007, driven primarily by video price
increases and higher cable modem penetration, partially offset by continued declines in voice
penetration and average revenue per voice RGU, as customers have continued to migrate to lower
priced voice plans or alternative solutions such as wireless. Residential / SMB Direct Expenses Direct expenses increased $93million, or 49%, for the year ended December31, 2008 compared
to the year ended December31, 2007. Direct expenses for the year ended December31, 2008 and
2007, include a net benefit of $19million and $22million, respectively, as a result of
favorable settlements with our voice and data network providers. Direct expenses for the year ended
December31, 2007 also include a charge of approximately $15million in franchise fees identified
during an audit. During the year ended December31, 2008 and 2007, direct expenses include a net
benefit in programming expense of $14million and $14million, respectively, due to more
favorable claims experience with programming audits. On a pro forma basis and excluding these
benefits, consolidated direct expenses increased $105million,
or 54%, for the year ended
December31, 2008 as compared to the same period in 2007, due to increases in customers and
revenue, as well as an increase in the average programming cost per subscriber and higher average
video RGUs. Direct expenses increased $122million, or 69%, for the year ended December31, 2007
compared to the year ended December31, 2006 primarily due to an increase in programming costs. The
increase in direct expenses was also attributable to the impact of vendor settlements with
providers of our voice and data network services of $22million and $68million for the years
ended December31, 2007 and 2006, respectively. Higher franchise fees, which includes the impact
of $15million incurred in 2007 as a result of an audit of prior years, also contributed to the
increase in direct expenses. Residential / SMB Selling, General and Administrative Expenses SGA decreased by $154million, or 62%, for the year ended December31, 2008 as compared to
the same period in 2007. Excluding stock-based compensation expense, SGA increased $24million,
or 11%, for the year ended December31, 2008 as compared to the same period in 2007. For the year
ended December31, 2008, the increase in SGA expenses primarily reflects an increase in bad debt
expense, legal costs and property taxes, partially offset by reductions in facilities, customer
care and other general and administrative expenses. SGA increased $48million, or 20% for the year ended December31, 2007 compared to the year
ended December31, 2006. The increase was primarily due to an increase in stock-based compensation
of $118million. Excluding stock-based compensation expense, SGA decreased $69million, or 30 for the year ended December31, 2007 as compared to the same period in 2006. The most significant
contributor to the decline in SGA was the decrease in general and administrative expenses
primarily driven by reductions in property taxes, legal and litigation related costs, and insurance
related costs. Offsetting the decline in general and administrative expenses were increases in
sales and marketing expenses, due to our increased focus on customer retention, increased
commissions paid as a result of the growth in sales and additional small business sales and
marketing resources. 28 Table of Contents RCN Metro Optical Networks Operating Results

Certain prior period revenue amounts have been reclassified to conform with the current
presentation. RCN Metro Revenues RCN Metro revenue increased $815million, or 907%, for the year ended December31, 2008 as
compared to the same period in 2007, primarily due to the acquisition of NEON. On a pro forma
basis, revenue increased $172million, or 111%, for the year ended December31, 2008 as compared
to the same period in 2007, due primarily to growth in transport services to our carrier and
enterprise customers. RCN Metro had approximately 800 customers as of December31, 2008. The top
20% of these customers have monthly revenue in excess of $10,000 per customer, generating
approximately 90% of RCN Metros total revenue, and the top 4% of these customers have monthly
revenue in excess of $100,000 per customer, representing multiple locations and services purchased
by each customer, and generating approximately 60% of RCN Metros total revenue. From a customer
segment perspective, RCN Metro generates approximately one third of its revenue from
telecommunications carriers, one quarter each from national wireless providers and financial
services enterprise customers, and the remainder from other enterprise customers. 29 Table of Contents While RCN Metros revenue is somewhat concentrated within certain industries and customers, we
attempt to mitigate any potential risk by performing detailed credit analyses on new customers and
by aggressively managing outstanding accounts receivable balances and
customer payments. In addition, the nature of our core product set, which is high-bandwidth,
high-availability, low latency, diverse transport, often supports mission critical applications
e.g., trading operations, voice/data traffic aggregation, core network connectivity, etc. for our
customers, which positions us well relative to other suppliers. Commercial revenue increased $295million, or 489%, for the year ended December31, 2007 as
compared to the year ended December31, 2006. On a pro forma basis, excluding $101million in
revenue related to the NEON acquisition in November2007, the increase in commercial revenue was
$187million, of which approximately half was due to the inclusion of a full year of CECs revenue
in 2007. The remaining increase in commercial revenue was primarily due to continued growth in
transport services to our enterprise and carrier customers. RCN Metro Direct Expenses Direct expenses increased $302million, or 870%, for the year ended December31, 2008 as
compared to the same period in 2007, primarily due to the acquisition of NEON. On a pro forma
basis, direct expenses increased $49million, or 82%, for the year ended December31, 2008,
largely due to added costs associated with the increase in revenue, including leased circuits,
building access, rights-of-way and co-location costs. Direct expenses increased $112million, or 474%, for the year ended December31, 2007
compared to the year ended December31, 2006. The increase was primarily due to the incremental
expenses associated with NEON and CEC of approximately $115million. The remaining increase in
direct costs was primarily due to growth in revenues. RCN Metro Selling, General and Administrative Expenses SGA increased $211million, or 533%, for the year ended December31, 2008 as compared to
the same period in 2007. On a pro forma basis and excluding stock-based compensation, SGA
decreased $13million, or 22%, for the year ended December31, 2008 as compared to the same
period in 2007, primarily as a result of cost synergies realized through employee and other cost
reductions enabled by the integration of NEON, partially offset by increases in sales and marketing
expenses. SGA increased $71million, or 220% for the year ended December31, 2007 compared to the
year ended December31, 2006. The increase was primarily due to an increase in stock-based
compensation of $33million and the acquisition of NEON and CEC. Excluding the impact of
stock-based compensation and the acquisitions of NEON and CEC, SGA decreased approximately $22
million for the year ended December31, 2007 reflecting reductions in bad debt expense, property
taxes and sales and marketing expenses, partially offset by increases in other general and
administrative expenses. Consolidated Stock-Based Compensation Total non-cash stock-based compensation expense recognized for the year ended December31,
2008 was $133million, a decrease of $199million, or 598%, compared to the year ended December
31, 2007. The decrease in stock-based compensation expense was primarily due to a reduction in the
amount of expense recognized as a result of the modification made in 2007 in connection with the
payment of the special cash dividend discussed below, as well as grants made in 2005, which
became fully vested at the end of 2007. These reductions were partially offset by additional
expense incurred related to option and restricted stock unit grants made during 2008. Total non-cash stock-based compensation expense recognized for the year ended December31,
2007 was $332million, an increase of $150million, or 828%, over the year ended December31,
2006, primarily due to the incremental expense of $99million recognized as a result of the
modification made in connection with the payment of the special cash dividend and additional option
and restricted stock grants made during 2007. We expect to recognize approximately $65million, $41million and $11million in
compensation expense based on outstanding grants under the Stock Plan in the upcoming years ending
December31, 2009, 2010 and 2011, respectively. Consolidated Depreciation and Amortization Depreciation expense increased $43million, or 25%, to $1788million for the year ended
December31, 2008 compared to the same period in 2007, reflecting additional expense of
approximately $195million associated with NEON, and approximately $153million from additional
assets placed into service since December31, 2007, offset by a decline of approximately $305
million due to fixed assets that have become fully depreciated since December31, 2007. Amortization expense decreased $08million, or 39%, to $199million for the year ended
December31, 2008 compared to the same period in 2007. During the year ended December31, 2008,
the valuation of the tangible and intangible assets acquired in the NEON transaction was completed
by management and the value assigned to customer
relationships and internally developed software was reduced by $94
million and increased by $02 million, respectively see Note 3 and
Note 6 to our Consolidated Financial Statements. As a result, a cumulative reduction
to amortization expense was recognized in the year ended
December31, 2008 totaling $10million.
Excluding this adjustment, amortization would have increased by
$10million due to the intangible
assets acquired in the NEON acquisition. 30 Table of Contents Depreciation expense increased $02million, or 01%, to $1745million for the year ended
December31, 2007 compared to the same period in 2006. Amortization expense increased $20
million, or 107%, to $207million for the year ended December31, 2007 compared to the year ended
December31, 2006. The increase in depreciation and amortization expense was primarily due to the
acquisitions of NEON and CEC. Consolidated Exit Costs and Restructuring Charges During the year ended December31, 2008, the Company recorded total exit costs and
restructuring charges of $23million primarily consisting of employee termination benefits
associated with a reduction in force and a voluntary separation program in connection with plans to
reduce operating expenses. Total exit costs and restructuring charges were $82million in the year ended December31,
2007, consisting primarily of exit costs, totaling $79million as a result of our exiting or
terminating property leases in Pennsylvania, New Jersey and New York and restructuring charges
totaling $34million, which were primarily related to the outsourcing of our customer care
operations. These charges were partially offset by a $31million settlement with 202 Centre
Street Realty LLC for damages incurred relating to space that was exited in the year ended December
31, 2002, net of legal fees incurred. At the time the property was exited, the abandoned property,
plant and equipment was recorded in exit costs and restructuring charges and, therefore, the
portion of the settlement relating to these costs was recorded in exit costs and restructuring
charges during the year ended December31, 2007. During the year ended December31, 2006, total exit costs and restructuring charges were $67
million, which consisted of exit costs totaling $44million primarily due to vacating facilities
in Chicago, IL, Boston, MA and Manhattan, NY, and retention and severance expense totaling $23
million due to various restructurings during 2006. Consolidated Other Income Expense Items Consolidated Investment Income Investment income decreased $65million, or 694%, to $29million for the year ended
December31, 2008 compared to the same period in 2007. This decrease was primarily due to
decreased yields from the Companys short-term investments as well as a lower weighted average cash
and short-term investment balance. Investment income increased $34million, or 575%, to $94million for the year ended
December31, 2007 compared to the year ended December31, 2006. This increase was primarily due to
higher yields from the Companys short-term investments. Consolidated Interest Expense Interest expense increased by $188million, or 545%, to $533million for the year ended
December31, 2008 compared to the same period in 2007. The increase in interest expense was due
primarily to the increase in our weighted average debt balance, offset slightly by a reduction in
our weighted average interest rate. Interest expense increased by $99million, or 399%, to $345million for the year ended
December31, 2007 compared to the year ended December31, 2006 primarily due to the increase in our
weighted average debt balance, offset slightly by a reduction in our weighted average interest
rate. Outstanding debt at December31, 2008 was $7426million compared to $7449million at
December31, 2007. The weighted average interest rate, including the effect of the swap agreements
was 66% and 75% for the years ended December31, 2008 and 2007, respectively. Consolidated Gain on Sale of Investment in Unconsolidated Entity In the first quarter of 2006, we recorded a gain of $1254million on the sale of our 4893%
interest in Megacable. Consolidated Loss on Sale of Assets During the years ended December31, 2008, 2007 and 2006, the net losses on the sale of assets
of $02million, $08million and $21million, respectively, resulted primarily from sales of
converter boxes and other customer premise equipment. 31 Table of Contents Consolidated Loss on the Early Extinguishment of Debt In connection with the repayment of our Former First-Lien Credit Agreement see Note 9 to our
Consolidated Financial Statements and successful tender offer and consent solicitation for our
Second-Lien Convertible Notes, we recognized a loss on extinguishment of debt of $638million
during the year ended December31, 2007, consisting of ithe fair value of all new warrants
issued, totaling $384million, iithe cash paid in excess of par value $133 per $1,000
principal amount, totaling $166million, and iiithe write-off of deferred financing costs and
professional fees, totaling $88million. During the year ended December31, 2006, we recognized a loss on extinguishment of debt of
$193million in connection with the repayment of our then existing First-Lien Credit Agreement and
Third-Lien Term Loan. The losses recognized consisted of early payment penalties of $65million
and the write-off of deferred financing costs of $128million. Other Income Expense, Net Other income expense, net primarily includes penalties and late fees. Discontinued Operations On March13, 2007, we completed the sale of our San Francisco, California market for cash
consideration of approximately $45million and recorded an after-tax gain on this transaction of
$159million. During the third quarter of 2007, we also exited the Los Angeles, California
market. The revenues and expenses from each of these properties, along with associated income
taxes, have been removed from continuing operations and reclassified into a single line item on the
Consolidated Statements of Operations as Income from discontinued operations, net in each period
presented. Liquidity and Capital Resources

Subject to the risks outlined in our Cautionary Statements Regarding Forward-Looking
Statements, we expect to fund our ongoing investing and mandatory financing activities, excluding
the final maturity of our First Lien Credit Facility in 2014, with cash on hand and cash flows from
operating activities. If our operating performance differs significantly from our forecasts, we may
be required to reduce our operating expenses and curtail capital spending, and we may not remain in
compliance with our debt covenants. Operating Activities Net cash provided by operating activities was $1400million for the year ended December31,
2008, reflecting a net loss of $707million and a use of working capital of $169million, offset
by $2276million in non-cash operating items. The use of cash in working capital was primarily
due to an overall increase in accounts receivable, due to timing of advanced billings and customer
payments, partially offset by the timing of vendor payments. Net cash provided by operating
activities was $1092million for the year ended December31, 2007, reflecting a net loss of $1520
million and a use of working capital of $278million, offset by $2885million in non-cash
operating items. The use of cash in working capital was primarily due to an overall increase in
accounts receivable, resulting from timing of advanced billings and customer payments, as well as a
decrease in accrued expenses During the years ended December31, 2008 and 2007, we made cash payments for interest totaling
$512million and $387million, respectively. The increase in interest payments was a result of
our recapitalization initiative and an additional $225million in borrowings under our existing
senior secured credit facility to fund the NEON acquisition. We anticipate that our cash paid for
interest will decrease slightly in the year ended December31, 2009 due to a lower weighted average
interest rate based on forecasts which project that LIBOR will be lower in 2009 compared to 2008. Investing Activities Net cash used in investing activities was $1085million in the year ended December31, 2008,
primarily from $1433million in additions to property, plant and equipment, offset by $44million
in proceeds from the sale of discontinued operations and other assets, a $74million decrease in
restricted investments, and a $230million decrease in short-term investments. Net cash used in
investing activities was $3157million in the year ended December31, 2007, primarily due to our
$2618million NEON acquisition and $1155million in additions to property, plant and equipment,
offset by $469million in proceeds from the sale of discontinued operations and other assets and a
$123million decrease in short-term investments. In our Residential/SMB segment, additions to
property, plant and equipment totaled $1129million for the year ended December31, 2008, as
compared to $949million for the same period in 2007. The increase was due primarily to purchases
of customer premise equipment and network enhancements associated with our analog crush
initiative, including assets placed into service during the year as well as an increase in assets
held in inventory at year end, ahead of our push to complete the initiative by early February,
2009. In our RCN Metro segment, additions to property, plant and equipment totaled $304million
for the year ended December31, 2008, as compared to $206million for the same period in 2007.
The increase was due primarily to the acquisition of NEON, and to a lesser extent due to an
increase in assets held in inventory at year end, to be deployed during the first half of 2009. In
addition, the year-over-year increase for both segments was driven in part by the timing of
payments. With the analog crush project now complete, additions to property, plant and equipment
are expected to decline by approximately $20-25million in 2009 on a consolidated basis, and we
expect to fund these investments with cash flow from continuing operations as well as cash on hand. 32 Table of Contents Financing Activities Net cash used in financing activities was $123million for the year ended December31, 2008,
primarily consisting of the purchase of common stock of $87million consisting of $77million in
common share repurchases and $10million of treasury shares resulting from restricted share
vestings, repayment of long-term debt and capital lease obligations of $73million and dividend payments of $16million, offset
by $50million in proceeds from a draw under our revolving credit facility. Net cash provided by
financing activities was $1620million for the year ended December31, 2007, driven primarily by
net proceeds of $7311million from the new First-Lien Credit Agreement and $58million in
proceeds from stock option exercises, offset by $3484million used for our special cash dividend
payment, $2195million in long-term debt and capital lease repayments and $70million in treasury stock purchases.

Interest payments are based on interest rates in effect at December31, 2008 and include
payments on our interest rate swap agreements.   2
Purchase obligations consist of agreements to purchase goods and services that are
enforceable and legally binding on us and that specify all significant terms, including
fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased, price provisions and timing. Our purchase
obligations principally consist of contracts with customer premise equipment manufacturers,
telecommunications providers, and other contracts entered into in the normal course of
business. Amounts reflected as accounts payable and accrued expenses in the consolidated
balance sheets at December31, 2008 are excluded from the table above. Off Balance Sheet Arrangements We do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements that are reasonably likely to have a current
or future effect on our financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures
or capital resources. Description of Outstanding Debt As of December31, 2008, our total outstanding debt was approximately $7426million,
including $29million of capital leases. The following is a description of our debt and the
significant terms contained in the related agreements. 33 Table of Contents First-Lien Credit Agreement The Companys credit agreement with Deutsche Bank, as Administrative Agent, and certain
syndicated lenders First-Lien Credit Agreement provides for term loans to the Company in the
aggregate principal amount of $720million, and a $75million revolving line of credit, all of
which can be used as collateral for letters of credit. Approximately $439million of the
revolving line of credit is currently utilized for outstanding letters of credit relating to our
surety bonds, real estate lease obligations, right-of-way obligations, and license and permit
obligations. In November2007, $25million of the revolving line of credit was drawn to purchase
NEON, and an additional $5million was drawn in November2008. As of December31, 2008, we had
$11million of available borrowing capacity under the revolving line of credit. The obligations
of the Company under the First-Lien Credit Agreement are guaranteed by all of its operating
subsidiaries and are secured by substantially all of the Companys assets. The term loan bears interest at the Administrative Agents prime lending rate plus an
applicable margin or at the Eurodollar rate plus an applicable margin, based on the type of
borrowing elected by the Company. The effective rate on outstanding debt at December31, 2008 and
December31, 2007 was 55% and 721%, respectively, including the effect of the interest rate swaps
discussed in Note 10 to our Consolidated Financial Statements. The First-Lien Credit Agreement requires the Company to maintain a Secured Leverage Ratio not
to exceed 450:1 through December30, 2009. On December31, 2009, the maximum permitted Secured
Leverage Ratio declines to 400:1, then declines to 350:1 on December31, 2010, 325:1 on December
31, 2011, and 300:1 on December31, 2012 where it remains until maturity in May2014. The
First-Lien Credit Agreement also contains certain covenants that, among other things, limit the
ability of the Company and its subsidiaries to incur indebtedness, create liens on their assets,
make particular types of investments or other restricted payments, engage in transactions with
affiliates, acquire assets, utilize proceeds from asset sales for purposes other than debt
reduction except for limited exceptions for reinvestment in the business, merge or consolidate or
sell substantially all of the Companys assets. The Company is in compliance with all covenants under the First-Lien Credit Agreement as of
the date of this filing. Letters of Credit The Company had outstanding letters of credit in an aggregate face amount of $439million as
of December31, 2008. These letters of credit utilize approximately 59% of the Companys $75
million revolving line of credit as collateral. Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements See Note 2, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, to our Consolidated Financial
Statements for a full description of recently issued accounting pronouncements including the date
of adoption and effects on results of operations and financial condition. Inflation Historically, the Companys results of operations and financial condition have not been
significantly affected by inflation. Subject to normal competitive conditions, the Company
generally has been able to pass along rising costs through increased selling prices. We do not
believe that our business is impacted by inflation to a significantly different extent than the
general economy in the United States. ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK As of December31, 2008, we held $409million of short-term investments and $228million of
cash and cash equivalents, primarily consisting of investment grade U.S. Treasury bills, commercial
paper, government backed obligations, and money market deposits. Our primary interest rate risk on
short-term investments and cash and cash equivalents results from changes in short-term less than
six months interest rates. However, this risk is largely offset by the fact that interest on our
bank credit facility borrowings is variable and is reset over periods of no more than six months
unless agreed to by each lender. During 2007, the Company entered into three interest rate swap agreements with an initial
notional amount of $345million to partially mitigate the variability of cash flows due to changes
in the Eurodollar rate, specifically related to interest payments on its term loans under the
First-Lien Credit Agreement. The interest rate swap agreements have a seven year term with an
amortizing notional amount which adjusts down on the dates payments are due on the underlying term
loans. Under the terms of the swap agreements, on specified dates, the Company makes payments
calculated using a fixed rate of 5319% plus the applicable margin, and receives payments equal to
3-month LIBOR. These interest rate swap agreements qualify for hedge accounting using the short-cut
method because the swap terms match the critical terms of the hedged debt. Accordingly, these
agreements had no net effect on the Companys results of operations for the year ended December31,
2008. As of December31, 2008 and 2007, the estimated fair values of these swap agreements were
liabilities of $545million and $198million, respectively, and the notional amount was $3392
million and $3431million, respectively. 34 Table of Contents At December31, 2008, the interest rate for the term loans issued pursuant to our First-Lien
Credit Agreement was Eurodollar plus 225% 375% at December31, 2008, and current borrowings
totaled $7097million. The effective interest rate was 551%, including the
effect of the interest rate swap agreements discussed in Note 10 to the Consolidated Financial
Statements. The interest rate for the revolving credit line under our First-Lien Credit Agreement
was Eurodollar plus 200% 350% at December31, 2008, and current borrowings totaled $300
million. Assuming the current level of borrowings under the First-Lien Credit Agreement and the
effect of the swap agreements, an increase or decrease in LIBOR of 10% would result in an increase
or decrease in annual interest expense of approximately $06million. See Note 2 to our Consolidated Financial Statements for discussions of our accounting policies
for derivative financial instruments and counterparty credit risk. Item1 Business
