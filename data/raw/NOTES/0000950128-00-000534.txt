REPORT OF INDEPENDENT ACCOUNTANTS
To the Board of Directors and Stockholders
of FreeMarkets, Inc. and Subsidiaries In our opinion, the accompanying consolidated balance sheets and the related
consolidated statements of operations, stockholders' equity and cash flows
present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of FreeMarkets,
Inc. and Subsidiaries the Company as of December 31, 1999 and 1998 and the
results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in
the period ended December 31, 1999, in conformity with accounting principles
generally accepted in the United States. These financial statements are the
responsibility of the Company management; our responsibility is to express an
opinion on these financial statements based on our audits. We conducted our
audits of these statements in accordance with auditing standards generally
accepted in the United States, which require that we plan and perform the audit
to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free
of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence
supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing
the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, and
evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our
audits provide a reasonable basis for the opinion expressed above. s/ PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP

NOTE 2. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
PRINCIPLES OF CONSOLIDATION
The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company
and its wholly-owned subsidiaries: FreeMarkets OnLine SA/NV, which is based in
Brussels, Belgium, and FreeMarkets Investment Company, Inc., which is based in
Wilmington, Delaware. All material intercompany transactions have been
eliminated in consolidation.
CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS
The Company considers all unrestricted, highly liquid investments with a
maturity of three months or less at the time of purchase to be cash equivalents.
SHORT-TERM INVESTMENTS
As of December 31, 1999, short-term investments primarily consisted of
commercial paper and corporate bonds. The Company classifies its short-term
investments as available for sale. Such investments are recorded at fair value
based on quoted market prices, with unrealized gains and losses, which are
considered to be temporary, recorded as accumulated other comprehensive income
or loss until realized. Realized gains and losses are recorded based on the
specific identification method.
Short-term investments at December 31, 1999 consisted of the following                          AMORTIZED    FAIR    UNREALIZED
COST     VALUE   GAIN LOSS
Commercial  $24,580,197  $24,610,100  $ 29,903
Corporate   8,188,233   8,167,684   20,549
262,421    262,421                                                             $33,030,851  $33,040,205  $ 9,354
Investment income included in other income was $816,000 in 1999, $93,000 in
1998 and $23,000 in 1997.
FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS
The carrying values of cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable and
accounts payable approximate fair market value because of the short-term
maturity of these financial instruments. The carrying value of long-term debt
approximates fair value because the interest rates on these obligations are
comparable to the interest rates that could have been obtained at the date of
the balance sheet. The Company short-term

FREEMARKETS, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS--CONTINUED
NOTE 2. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES, CONTINUED:
investments are recorded at fair market value based on quoted market prices.
Management believes the financial risks associated with all of these financial
instruments are minimal.
PROPERTY AND EQUIPMENT
Property and equipment are recorded at cost and depreciated on the
straight-line method over their estimated useful lives. Repairs and maintenance
expenditures, which are not considered improvements and do not extend the useful
life of the property and equipment, are expensed as incurred. The cost and
related accumulated depreciation applicable to property and equipment no longer
in service are eliminated from the accounts and any gain or loss is included in
operations.
OTHER ASSETS
Other assets consist principally of capitalized patent and trademark costs
and internally developed software costs, both of which are being amortized using
the straight-line method over seventeen and three years, respectively. Qualified
internally developed software costs for external use are capitalized subsequent
to the determination of technological feasibility; this capitalization continues
until the product becomes available for general release in accordance with
Statement of Financial Accounting Standard SFAS No. 86, Accounting for the
Costs of Computer Software to be Sold, Leased or Otherwise Marketed. Qualified
internally developed software costs for internal use are capitalized subsequent
to both the preliminary project stage and when management has committed to
funding, in accordance with Statement of Position 98-1, Accounting for the
Costs of Computer Software Developed or Obtained for Internal Use. The carrying
value of patent and trademark costs was $371,000 and $87,000 at December 31,
1999 and 1998, respectively. The carrying value of all internally developed
software costs was $427,000 and $24,000 at December 31, 1999 and 1998,
respectively. Amortization expense related to these items was $41,000 in 1999 49,000 in 1998 and $48,000 in 1997.
IMPAIRMENT OF LONG-LIVED ASSETS
The carrying values of long-lived assets, which include property and
equipment and other assets, are evaluated periodically in relation to the
operating performance and future undiscounted cash flows of the underlying
assets. Adjustments are made if the sum of expected future net cash flows is
less than carrying value.
REVENUE RECOGNITION
The Company recognizes revenue from fixed monthly fees for providing
services to clients ratably as those services are provided over the related
contract periods. In the case of contracts with performance incentive payments
based on auction volume and/or savings generated, as defined in the respective
contracts, revenue is recognized as those thresholds are achieved. Commission
revenue is recognized as the direct materials and commodities that are the
subject of the Company auctions are shipped from the winning suppliers to the
buyers in accordance with the terms of the contracts. Commission revenue was
$1,589,000 in 1999, $800,000 in 1998 and $358,000 in 1997.
REVENUE CONCENTRATION AND RELATED PARTY
Revenue concentration from United Technologies Corporation UTC, the

canceled by UTC upon notice prior to the expiration date. As further discussed
in Note 7, a subsidiary of UTC invested $20,938,000 in the Company in September
1999. Revenues from UTC were $7,006,000 and amounts due from UTC were $801,000
for the year ended December 31, 1999.
Revenue concentration from General Motors Corporation GM, the Company
second largest client, was 15% in 1999 and 19% in 1998. GM notified the Company
in January 2000 that it will cancel its contract effective April 2000. GM is not
required to pay any termination fee for terminating its agreement.
COST OF REVENUES
Cost of revenues consists primarily of the expenses related to staffing and
operation of the Company market making service organization and market
operations centers. Staffing costs include a proportional allocation of overhead
costs.
RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT COSTS
Research and development costs are expensed as incurred, and include costs
to develop, enhance and manage the Company proprietary technology.
ADVERTISING COSTS
Advertising costs are expensed at the time the advertisement is first aired
or the promotion is held. Advertising expenses were $6,538,000 in 1999, $162,000
in 1998 and $110,000 in 1997.
START-UP COSTS
Start-up costs are expensed as incurred, and include costs to establish new
locations, operations or subsidiaries.
STOCK-BASED EXPENSE
The Company accounts for the grant of stock options to employees in
accordance with SFAS No. 123, Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation. SFAS
No. 123 gives companies the option to adopt the fair value method for expense
recognition of employee stock options or to continue to account for employee
stock options using the intrinsic value method, as outlined under Accounting
Principles Board APB Opinion No. 25, Accounting for Stock Issued to
Employees. The Company has elected to continue to apply the intrinsic value
method to account for employee stock options and discloses the pro forma effect
as if the fair value method had been applied in Note 8. The Company records
unearned stock-based compensation for stock options granted at exercise prices
less than fair value. Such unearned stock-based compensation is amortized on an
accelerated basis over the vesting period of each individual award in accordance
with Financial Accounting Standards Board FASB Interpretation No. 28.
PENNSYLVANIA OPPORTUNITY GRANT
During 1998, the Company received a $150,000 Opportunity Grant the PA
Grant from the Department of Community and Economic Development of the
Commonwealth of Pennsylvania. The PA Grant provided for working capital funds to
assist the Company during a period of accelerated growth, and was earned based
upon the achievement of certain job creation requirements. The PA Grant is
included in other income in the consolidated statements of operations. If the
Company were to leave the City of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania prior to November
2002, the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania may require the Company to

NOTE 2. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES, CONTINUED:
refund a portion of the PA Grant; however, the Company considers the likelihood
of its relocation to be remote.
INCOME TAXES
Deferred income taxes are recorded using the liability method. Under this
method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the
differences between the financial statement and tax bases of assets and
liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect in the years in which the
differences are expected to reverse. Valuation allowances are established when
necessary to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount expected to be realized.
INTERNATIONAL OPERATIONS
The Company began operating a subsidiary in Brussels, Belgium in late 1998.
The subsidiary operating loss was $2,929,000 and its revenues were immaterial
for the year ended December 31, 1999.
The local currency is the functional currency for the Company operations
outside of the United States. Assets and liabilities are translated using the
exchange rate at the balance sheet date. Revenues, expenses, gains and losses
are translated at the exchange rate on the date those elements are recognized.
Foreign currency translation adjustments included in other comprehensive loss
were $120,000 in 1999.
EARNINGS PER SHARE
The Company computes earnings per share in accordance with SFAS No. 128,
Earnings per Share. Under the provisions of SFAS No. 128, basic earnings per
share is computed by dividing the net loss income for the period by the
weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the period. Diluted
earnings per share is computed by dividing the net loss income for the period
by the weighted average number of common and potentially dilutive common shares
outstanding during the period. Potentially dilutive common shares consist of the
common shares issuable upon the exercise of stock options and warrants using
the treasury stock method and upon the conversion of convertible preferred
stock using

the if-converted method. Potentially dilutive common shares are excluded from
the calculation if their effect is antidilutive.
The computation of earnings per share is as follows                            YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31,

COMPREHENSIVE INCOME OR LOSS
Other comprehensive loss includes the net effect of foreign currency
translation adjustments and unrealized gains on short-term investments.
Including net loss income from the consolidated statements of operations,
comprehensive loss was $21,932,000 and $1,061,000 in 1999 and 1997,
respectively, and comprehensive income was $234,000 in 1998.
USE OF ESTIMATES
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally
accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and
assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the
disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial
statements, as well as the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the
reporting periods. Actual results could differ from those estimates.
SEGMENT REPORTING
Operating segments are defined as components of an enterprise about which
separate financial information is available that is evaluated regularly by the
chief operating decision maker in deciding how to allocate resources and in
assessing performance. The Company operates in one segment, business-to-business
electronic commerce. The Company markets its products in the United States and
in foreign countries through its sales personnel and its subsidiaries.
Revenues are attributed to countries based on the location of the Company
clients. For 1999, 1998 and 1997, over 90% of the Company revenues and assets
were derived from its operations within the United States.
RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENT
In June 1998, the FASB issued SFAS No. 133, Accounting for Derivative
Instruments and Hedging Activities. SFAS No. 133, which is effective, as
amended, for all quarters in fiscal years beginning after June 15, 2000,
establishes accounting and reporting standards for derivative financial
instruments and hedging activities related to those instruments, as well as
other hedging activities. As the Company does not currently engage in derivative
or hedging activities, the adoption of this standard is not expected to have a
significant impact on the Company consolidated financial statements.

$3,277,716  $413,018
A In February 1998, the Company entered into a Line of Credit Agreement the
Line of Credit, which provided for borrowings of up to $750,000. The
Line of Credit accrued interest at the lender prime rate plus 10%. A
non-refundable commitment fee equal to 10% per annum of the average daily
unused portion of the Line of Credit was payable quarterly. As of December
31, 1998, there was $300,000 outstanding under the Line of Credit, which
has been classified as long-term debt due to the February 1999 refinancing
under the new facility discussed below.
B In February 1999, the Company settled all outstanding amounts under the
Line of Credit and terminated this agreement. At this time, the Company
entered into a Revolving Promissory Note the Revolver and an Equipment
Term Note the Equipment Term Note, with a new lender, both under the
terms of a Loan and Security Agreement the Loan and Security Agreement.
The Revolver provided for borrowings of up to $2,000,000, with interest
accruing at the lender prime rate plus 075% 925% at December 31,
1999.
The Equipment Term Note provided for total borrowings of up to $2,000,000
that were drawn from February through August 1999. Monthly interest-only
payments were due and payable on any outstanding advances during that time
period. In September 1999, the advances under the Equipment Term Note
converted to a note payable with 36 equal monthly principal and interest
installments, which are due and payable through August 2002. The Equipment
Term Note bears interest at the lender prime rate plus 10%.
C In September 1999, the Company Loan and Security Agreement was amended
the Amended Loan and Security Agreement to increase the available
borrowings under the Revolver from $2,000,000 to $5,000,000 and extend the
expiration date to September 2000. The interest rate on borrowings will
remain at the lender prime rate plus 075%. The amendment also provides
for two additional equipment term notes Equipment Term Note #2 in
addition to the $2,000,000 original Equipment Term Note. These notes
provide for total borrowings of up to $3,000,000 that may be drawn from
September 1999 through October 2000. Monthly interest-only payments are due
and payable on any outstanding advances during that time period. In April
and October 2000, these notes automatically

convert to notes payable with 36 equal monthly principal and interest
installments. These notes bear interest at the lender prime rate plus
10%.
The Amended Loan and Security Agreement contains restrictive covenants,
including a limitation on incurring additional indebtedness and paying
dividends. The Company is also required to satisfy minimum tangible net
worth and current and debt service ratios each month, as defined. The
Company has pledged substantially all of its tangible assets as collateral
for the Amended Loan and Security Agreement.
D In March 1998, the Company entered into a $144,000 loan with the City of
Pittsburgh Urban Redevelopment Authority the URA Loan, with interest
accruing at 68%. Proceeds from the URA Loan were required to be used for
local office space expansion. The URA Loan was repaid in February 1999 with
proceeds from the Equipment Term Note.
Interest expense was $176,000 in 1999, $28,000 in 1998 and $2,000 in 1997.
The weighted average interest rate was 67% in 1999, 69% in 1998 and 37%
in 1997.
Scheduled maturities of debt for each of the years ending December 31 are
as follows

NOTE 5. COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES
The Company leases office space and equipment under operating leases
expiring through 2008. In October 1998, the Company entered into a new Office
Lease Agreement the Lease, as amended in March and June 1999, that
significantly expands the Company office space within the City of Pittsburgh,
Pennsylvania. The Lease, which provides for additional expansion within the same
building, expires in May 2004.
Operating lease rental expense amounted to $960,000 in 1999, $280,000 in
1998 and $141,000 in 1997. The following is a schedule of future minimum lease
payments under all operating leases through December 31 of each of the following
years

asserted or unasserted, which arise in the ordinary course of business. While
the outcome of these claims cannot be predicted with certainty, management does
not believe that the outcome of any of these legal matters will have a material
adverse effect on the Company consolidated results of operations or
consolidated financial position.

NOTE 6. INCOME TAXES
The Company had no income tax provision in 1999 and 1997 since the Company
had a net taxable loss in each of those periods. For 1998, the Company net
taxable income was eliminated through the use of net operating loss
carryforwards of approximately $502,000. The tax benefit resulting from the use
of these net operating losses was approximately $200,000.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities consisted of the following                                  DECEMBER 31,
1999      1998

Net deferred tax   9,742,000   1,337,000
Less valuation   9,742,000  1,337,000
$    --  $                                        In assessing the realizability of net deferred tax assets, management
considers whether it is more likely than not that some portion of the net
deferred tax assets will not be realized. The ultimate realization of net
deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income
during the periods in which temporary differences representing net future
deductible amounts become deductible. Management has established a full
valuation allowance against the net deferred tax assets at December 31, 1998 and
December 31, 1999 since the realization of these assets in future periods is
uncertain.
As of December 31, 1999, the Company had available federal and state net
operating loss carryforwards of approximately $20,506,000. These net operating
loss carryforwards may be used to offset future federal and state income taxes
through 2019 and 2009, respectively. As a result of the Series A-1 convertible
preferred stock offering in May 1996 and concurrent ownership change, Section
382 of the Internal Revenue Code limits the federal net operating losses
incurred prior to May 1996, which amounted to $1,298,000, available to the
Company to $247,000 per year. Any unused annual limitation may be carried
forward to future years for the balance of the federal net operating loss
carryforward period. In addition, the Company has research and experimentation
credit carryforwards available to offset future federal tax liabilities through
2019.

STOCK SPLITS
In January 1998, the Company Board of Directors declared a 200-for-1
stock split in the form of a stock dividend for the then-outstanding shares of
common stock and preferred stock. In June 1999, the Company Board of Directors
declared a 3-for-1 stock split in the form of a stock dividend for the
then-outstanding shares of common stock and preferred stock.
The Company has presented each split as a separate issuance of shares
occurring at the time of the split. Accordingly, share amounts presented in the
consolidated balance sheets and statements of stockholders' equity reflect the
actual shares outstanding for each period presented prior to the stock splits.
All references to the number of shares and per share amounts elsewhere in the
consolidated financial statements and related notes have been restated to
reflect both stock splits.
PREFERRED STOCK
In December 1996, the Company commenced an offering of 2,347,200 shares of
Series B convertible preferred stock Series B at $54 per share, of which
1,057,800 shares were issued in 1996 and 1,289,400 shares were issued in 1997.
Total proceeds from the offering, which was completed in July 1997, were
$1,117,000, net of offering costs of $153,000.
In October 1997, the Company exercised its right to call 3,157,200 warrants
that were issued pursuant an offering of Series A-1 convertible preferred stock
Series A-1 in May 1996. In addition, the Company commenced an offering to
sell an additional 1,860,000 shares of Series A-2 convertible preferred stock
Series A-2 at $54 per share. The warrant call and the offering were
completed in December 1997, resulting in total proceeds of $2,447,000, net of
offering costs of $271,000.

using the Black-Scholes pricing model. UTC exercised the Series D warrants in
September 1999, resulting in total proceeds of $3,000 and a $4,503,000 transfer
from stock purchase warrants to additional capital.
As discussed in Note 1, all of the Company outstanding convertible
preferred stock automatically converted into 16,051,438 shares of common stock
in connection with the IPO. Additionally, the Company Board of Directors has
the authority, without further action by the stockholders, to issue up to
5,000,000 shares of preferred stock in one or more series and to designate the
rights, preferences, privileges and restrictions of each series.
COMMON STOCK
In 1997, employees purchased 531,000 shares of common stock at $54 per
share under a qualified stock purchase plan the 1996 Purchase Plan,

warrants at an exercise price of $54 per share to the placement agent as
compensation for services rendered in connection with the Series A-1, A-2 and B
offerings. These warrants expire seven years from the date of issuance.
The Series A-1 warrants and placement agent warrants were valued using the
Black-Scholes pricing model. The portion of the proceeds received from the
Series A-1, A-2 and B preferred stock offerings representing the value assigned
to the warrants, as well as the Series D warrants discussed above, are reflected
as stock purchase warrants in the stockholders' equity section of the
accompanying balance sheets. At the time of exercise, the Company transfers the
value assigned to the warrants to additional capital.
In March 1999, the placement agent exercised 2,409,000 warrants, resulting

NOTE 8. EMPLOYEE BENEFIT PLANS
401K SAVINGS PLAN
In January 1999, the Company adopted a savings plan the Savings Plan
that qualifies as a deferred salary arrangement under Section 401k of the
Internal Revenue Code. Under the Savings Plan, eligible employees may contribute
a certain percentage of their pre-tax earnings up to the annual limit set by the
Internal Revenue Service. The Company is not required to contribute to the

for issuance, subject to increases as provided in the 1999 Purchase Plan. The
1999 Purchase Plan is intended to qualify under Section 423 of the Internal
Revenue Code. Under the 1999 Purchase Plan, eligible employees may purchase
common stock each year in an amount not to exceed 20% of the employee annual
cash compensation. The purchase price per share will be 85% of the lowest fair
value at certain dates defined in the 1999 Purchase Plan. The 1999 Purchase Plan
became effective in December 1999.
STOCK OPTION PLANS
Prior to March 1998, the Company maintained a stock incentive plan the
1996 Option Plan, which provided for the issuance of stock options and stock
appreciation rights to employees. Under the 1996 Option Plan, options were
granted at prices determined by the Board of Directors. The options granted are
exercisable in accordance with a vesting schedule, not to exceed 10 years. No
further stock options may be granted under the 1996 Option Plan.
In March 1998, the Company adopted the 1998 Stock Option Plan the 1998
Option Plan. All available options in the 1996 Option Plan were transferred
into the 1998 Option Plan. All options outstanding under the 1996 Option Plan as
of the termination date continue in effect under their original terms. The 1998
Option Plan provides for the issuance of stock options to employees, directors,
consultants and advisors, which are granted at prices determined by the Board of
Directors. The options granted are exercisable in accordance with a vesting
schedule, not to exceed 10 years. Options held by certain executives immediately
vested 30% in connection with the IPO.
In June 1999, the Company adopted an Amended and Restated Stock Incentive
Plan the Stock Incentive Plan. The Stock Incentive Plan amended the 1998
Option Plan to increase the amount of shares reserved for the future issuance of
stock options and add certain change-of-control provisions, as well as make
other minor modifications. As of December 31, 1999, 15,450,000 stock options
were authorized for issuance, of which 3,045,900 remained available for future
issuance.

SECURITIES CLASS ACTION COMPLAINTS
Ten securities fraud class action complaints have been filed against the
Company and three executive officers in the federal court in Pittsburgh. The
complaints allege that the Company and the other defendants violated Sections
10b and 20a of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 because they allegedly
knew that General Motors would terminate its contract by the first quarter of
2000 and allegedly concealed this information.
By order dated February 29, 2000, the court consolidated all of the cases
into a single proceeding. That order also established a timetable for the filing
of: motions to appoint lead plaintiffs and lead counsel, an amended consolidated
complaint and the Company response to the amended consolidated complaint.
The Company and the individual defendants believe that the claims asserted
against them misstate the facts and are completely without merit, and they
intend to vigorously defend the litigation.
ACQUISITION
In March 2000, the Company signed a definitive agreement to acquire
iMark.com, a privately-held Internet marketplace for surplus equipment and
inventory based in Austin, Texas. Under the terms of the agreement, 1,750,000
shares of the Company common stock and options to acquire the common stock
will be exchanged for all outstanding shares, options and warrants in iMark.com.
The acquisition will be accounted for as a purchase and is expected to close by
the end of March 2000.
