Item8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.The information required by this item is set forth in our Consolidated Financial Statements contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Specific financial statements can be found at the pages listed below:WESCO International, Inc.PAGEReport of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm30Consolidated Balance Sheets as of December31, 2012 and 201131Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income for the years ended December31, 2012, 2011 and 201032Consolidated Statements of Stockholders Equity for the years ended December31, 2012, 2011 and 201033Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows for the years ended December31, 2012, 2011 and 201034Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements3529Table of ContentsReport of Independent Registered Public Accounting FirmTo the Board of Directors and Shareholders of WESCO International, Inc.,In our opinion, the accompanying consolidated balance sheets and the related consolidated statements of comprehensive income, stockholders equity and cash flows present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of WESCO International, Inc. and its subsidiaries at December31, 2012 and December31, 2011, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December31, 2012 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. In addition, in our opinion, the financial statement schedule listed in the index appearing under a2 presents fairly, in all material respects, the information set forth therein when read in conjunction with the related consolidated financial statements. Also in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December31, 2012, based on criteria established in Internal Control Integrated Frameworkissued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission COSO. The Companys management is responsible for these financial statements and financial statement schedule, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in Managements Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting appearing under Item9A. Our responsibility is to express opinions on these financial statements, on the financial statement schedule, and on the Companys internal control over financial reporting based on our integrated audits. We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board United States. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audits of the financial statements included examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, and evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.A companys internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A companys internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that i pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; iiprovide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and iiiprovide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the companys assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.As described in Management Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting, management has excluded EECOL Electric Corporation EECOL and Conney Safety Products Conney from its assessment of internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2012 because they were acquired by the Company in a purchase business combination during 2012. We have also excluded EECOL and Conney from our audit of internal control over financial reporting. EECOL and Conney are wholly-owned subsidiaries whose total assets represent $14 billion and $1448 million, respectively, and total revenues of $241 million and $390 million, respectively, of the related consolidated financial statement amounts as of and for the year ended December 31, 2012./s/ PricewaterhouseCoopers LLPPittsburgh, PennsylvaniaFebruary27, 2013 30Table of ContentsWESCO INTERNATIONAL, INC.

AND SUBSIDIARIESNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS1. ORGANIZATIONWESCO International, Inc. WESCO International and its subsidiaries collectively, WESCO, headquartered in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, is a full-line distributor of electrical, industrial and communications maintenance, repair and operating MRO and original equipment manufactures OEM products, construction materials, and advanced supply chain management and logistics services used primarily in the industrial, construction, utility and commercial, institutional and government markets. We serve over 65,000active customers globally, through approximately 475full service branches and ninedistribution centers located primarily in the United States, Canada and Mexico, with operations in 15additional countries2. ACCOUNTING POLICIESBasis of ConsolidationThe consolidated financial statements include the accounts of WESCO International and all of its subsidiaries. All significant intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.Use of EstimatesThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying disclosures. Although these estimates are based on managements best knowledge of current events and actions WESCO may undertake in the future, actual results may ultimately differ from the estimates.Revenue RecognitionRevenues are recognized for product sales when title, ownership and risk of loss pass to the customer or for services when the service is rendered. In the case of stock sales and special orders, a sale occurs at the time of shipment from WESCO distribution point, as the terms of WESCOs sales are predominantly FOB shipping point. In cases where WESCO processes customer orders but ships directly from its suppliers, revenue is recognized once product is shipped and title has passed. In all cases, revenue is recognized once the sales price to the customer is fixed or is determinable and WESCO has reasonable assurance as to the collectability. In certain customer arrangements, WESCO provides services such as inventory management. WESCO may perform some or all of the following services for customers: determine inventory stocking levels; establish inventory reorder points; launch purchase orders; receive material; put away material; and pick material for order fulfillment. WESCO recognizes revenue for services rendered during the period based upon a previously negotiated fee arrangement. WESCO also sells inventory to these customers and recognizes revenue at the time title and risk of loss transfers to the customer. The amount of revenue attributed to these services totaled $176 million, $108 million, and $111 millionin 2012, 2011and 2010, respectively.Selling, General and Administrative ExpensesWESCO includes warehousing, purchasing, branch operations, information services, and marketing and selling expenses in this category, as well as other types of general and administrative costs.Supplier Volume RebatesWESCO receives volume rebates from certain suppliers based on contractual arrangements with such suppliers. Volume rebates are included within other accounts receivable on the balance sheet, and represent the estimated amounts due to WESCO under the rebate provisions of the various supplier contracts. The corresponding rebate income is recorded as a reduction of cost of goods sold. The appropriate level of such income is derived from the level of actual purchases made by WESCO from suppliers. Receivables under the supplier rebate program were $687 millionat December31, 2012and $385 millionat December 31, 2011. Supplier volume rebate rates have historically ranged between approximately 08%and 13%of sales depending on market conditions. In 2012, the rebate rate was 13%.Shipping and Handling Costs and FeesWESCO records the costs and fees associated with transporting its products to customers as a component of selling, general and administrative expenses. These costs totaled $499 million, $509 millionand $424 millionin 2012, 2011and 2010, respectively.Cash EquivalentsCash equivalents are defined as highly liquid investments with original maturities of 90days or less when purchased35Table of ContentsAsset SecuritizationWESCO maintains control of the receivables transferred pursuant to its accounts receivable securitization program the Receivables Facility; therefore the transfers do not qualify for sale treatment. As a result, the transferred receivables remain on the balance sheet, and WESCO recognizes the related secured borrowing. The expenses associated with the Receivables Facility are reported as interest expense in the statement of income.Allowance for Doubtful AccountsWESCO maintains allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of its customers to make required payments. WESCO has a systematic procedure using estimates based on historical data and reasonable assumptions of collectability made at the local branch level and on a consolidated corporate basis to calculate the allowance for doubtful accounts. If the financial condition of WESCOs customers were to deteriorate, resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments, additional allowances may be required. The allowance for doubtful accounts was $172 millionat December31, 2012and $216 millionat December 31, 2011. The total amount recorded as selling, general and administrative expense related to bad debts was $11 million, $66 millionand $64 millionfor 2012, 2011and 2010,  primarily consist of merchandise purchased for resale and are stated at the lower of cost or market. Cost is determined principally under the average cost method. WESCO makes provisions for obsolete or slow-moving inventories as necessary to reflect reduction in inventory value. WESCO writes down its inventory to its net realizable value based on internal factors derived from historical analysis of actual losses. Looking back, WESCO identifies items at risk of becoming obsolete, which are defined as excess of 36 months supply relative to demand or movement. WESCO then analyzes the ultimate disposition of previously identified excess inventory items, such as sold, returned to supplier, or scrapped. This item by item analysis allows WESCO to develop an estimate of the historical likelihood that an item identified as being in excess supply ultimately becomes obsolete. WESCO applies the estimate to inventory items currently in excess of 36 months supply, and reduces its inventory carrying value by the derived amount. Reserves for excess and obsolete inventories were $167 millionand $146 millionat December31, 2012and 2011, respectively. The total expense related to excess and obsolete inventories, included in cost of goods sold, was $114 million, $55 millionand $75 millionfor 2012, 2011and 2010, respectively. WESCO absorbs into the cost of inventory the general and administrative expenses related to inventory such as purchasing, receiving and storage and at December31, 2012and 2011, $622 millionand $476 million, respectively, of these costs were included in ending inventory.Other AssetsWESCO amortizes deferred financing fees over the term of the various debt instruments. Deferred financing fees in the amount of $178 millionwere incurred during the year ending December31, 2012. As of December31, 2012and 2011, the amount of other assets related to unamortized deferred financing fees was $264 millionand $129 million, respectively.Property, Buildings and EquipmentProperty, buildings and equipment are recorded at cost. Depreciation expense is determined using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets. Leasehold improvements are amortized over either their respective lease terms or their estimated lives, whichever is shorter. Estimated useful lives range from fiveto fortyyears for leasehold improvements and buildings and threeto tenyears for furniture, fixtures and equipment.Capitalized computer software costs are amortized using the straight-line method over the estimated useful life, typically threeto fiveyears, and are reported at the lower of unamortized cost.Expenditures for new facilities and improvements that extend the useful life of an asset are capitalized. Ordinary repairs and maintenance are expensed as incurred. When property is retired or otherwise disposed of, the cost and the related accumulated depreciation are removed from the accounts and any related gains or losses are recorded and reported as selling, general and administrative expenses.WESCO assesses its long-lived assets for impairment by periodically reviewing operating performance and respective utilization of real and tangible assets. Upon closure of any branch, asset usefulness and remaining life are evaluated and charges are taken as appropriate. Of WESCOs $2107 millionnet book value of property, plant and equipment as of December31, 2012, $1368 millionconsists of land, buildings and leasehold improvements and are geographically dispersed among WESCOs 475branches and ninedistribution centers, mitigating the risk of impairment. Approximately $285 millionof assets consist of computer equipment and capitalized software and are evaluated for use and serviceability relative to carrying value. The remaining fixed assets, mainly of furniture and fixtures, warehousing equipment and transportation equipment, are similarly evaluated for serviceability and use.Goodwill and Indefinite Life Intangible Assets36Table of ContentsGoodwill and indefinite life intangible assets are tested for impairment annually during the fourth quarter using information available at the end of September, or more frequently if events or circumstances occur indicating that their carrying value may not be recoverable. The evaluation of impairment involves comparing the current fair value of goodwill and indefinite life intangible assets to the recorded value. WESCO estimates the fair value of goodwill using a combination of discounted cash flow analyses and market multiples. Assumptions used for these fair value techniques are based on a combination of historical results, current forecasts, market data and recent economic events. WESCO evaluates the recoverability of indefinite life intangible assets using a discounted cash flow analysis based on projected financial information. The determination of fair value involves significant judgment and management applies its best judgment when assessing the reasonableness of financial projections. At December31, 2012and 2011, goodwill and indefinite life trademarks totaled $1,8829 millionand $1,0550 million, respectively. No impairment losses were identified in 2012as a result of this review. However, two trademarks valued at $181 millionare sensitive to a further decline in financial performance. WESCO is taking actions to improve its future financial performance; however, WESCO cannot predict whether or not there will be certain events that could adversely affect the reported value of these trademarks. Definite Lived Intangible AssetsIntangible assets are amortized over 4to 20years. A portion of intangible assets related to certain customer relationships are amortized using an accelerated method whereas all other intangible assets subject to amortization use a straight-line method which reflects the pattern in which the economic benefits of the respective assets are consumed or otherwise used. Intangible assets are tested for impairment if events or circumstances occur indicating that the respective asset might be impaired.Insurance ProgramsWESCO uses commercial insurance for auto, workers compensation, casualty and health claims as a risk-reduction strategy to minimize catastrophic losses. The Companys strategy involves large deductibles where WESCO must pay all costs up to the deductible amount. WESCO estimates the reserve based on historical incident rates and costs. The assumptions included in developing this accrual include the period of time from incurrence of a claim until the claim is paid by the insurance provider. The total liability related to the insurance programs was $113 millionat December31, 2012and $97 millionat December 31, 2011.Income TaxesIncome taxes are accounted for under the liability method in accordance with income tax accounting guidance. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on differences between the financial reporting and tax basis of assets and liabilities and are measured using the enacted tax rates and laws that will be in effect when the differences are expected to reverse. Valuation allowances, if any, are provided when it is more likely than not that a portion or all of a deferred tax asset may not be realized.WESCO accounts for uncertainty in income taxes using a recognition threshold and measurement attribute prescribed by income tax accounting guidance. WESCO frequently reviews tax issues and positions taken on tax returns to determine the need and amount of contingency reserves necessary to cover any probable audit adjustments. WESCO recognizes interest related to unrecognized tax benefits as part of interest expense. Penalties are recognized as part of income tax expense.Convertible DebenturesWESCO separately accounts for the liability and equity components of its convertible debentures in a manner that reflects its non-convertible debt borrowing rate. WESCO estimates its non-convertible debt borrowing rate through a combination of discussions with its financial institutions and review of relevant market data. The discounts to the convertible note balances are amortized to interest expense, using the effective interest method, over the implicit life of the Debentures.Foreign CurrencyThe local currency is the functional currency for the majority of WESCOs operations outside the United States. Assets and liabilities of these operations are translated to U.S. dollars at the exchange rate in effect at the end of each period. Income statement accounts are translated at the average exchange rate prevailing during the period. Translation adjustments arising from the use of differing exchange rates from period to period are included as a component of other comprehensive income within stockholders equity. Gains and losses from foreign currency transactions are included in net income for the period.Defined Benefit Pension PlanIn connection with the December 14, 2012 acquisition of EECOL, the Company assumed a contributory defined benefit plan covering all Canadian employees of EECOL. The plan provides retirement benefits based upon earnings and credited service, and participants contribute 2%or 4%of their earnings to the plan depending on their employment level. The Company also assumed EECOL Supplemental Executive Retirement Plan SERP which provides additional pension benefits to certain executives based on earnings, credited service, and executive service. 37Table of ContentsLiabilities and expenses for pension benefits are determined using actuarial methodologies and incorporate significant assumptions, including the interest rate used to discount the future estimated cash flows, the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets, and several assumptions relating to the employee workforce salary increases, retirement age, and mortality.The interest rate used to discount future estimated cash flows is determined using a high quality corporate bonds yield curve model developed with the assistance of an external actuary. The cash flows of the plans' projected benefit obligations are discounted using a single equivalent rate derived from yields on high quality corporate bonds. The yield curve model parallels the plans' projected cash flows. The discount rate used to determine benefit obligations for the Canadian pension was 45%in 2012. The impact on the liabilities of a change in the discount rate of one quarter percent would be approximately $51 millionand either a charge or credit of $03 millionto after-tax earnings in the following year.The expected long-term rate of return on plan assets is applied to the fair market-related value of plan assets. Stock-Based CompensationWESCOs stock-based employee compensation plans are comprised of stock options, stock-settled stock appreciation rights, restricted stock units, and performance-based awards. Compensation cost for all stock-based awards is measured at fair value on the date of grant, and compensation cost is recognized, net of estimated forfeitures, over the service period for awards expected to vest. The fair value of stock options and stock-settled appreciation rights is determined using the Black-Scholes valuation model. Expected volatilities are based on historical volatility of WESCOs common stock. The expected life of stock options and stock-settled appreciation rights is estimated using historical data pertaining to option exercises and employee terminations. The risk-free rate is based on the U.S. Treasury yields in effect at the time of grant. The forfeiture assumption is based on WESCOs historical employee behavior that is reviewed on an annual basis. The fair value of restricted stock units is determined by the grant-date closing price of WESCOs common stock. Performance-based awards are valued using a Monte Carlo simulation model. The probability of meeting market criteria is considered when calculating the estimated fair market value on the date of grant. These awards are accounted for as awards with market conditions, which are recognized over the service period, regardless of whether the market conditions are achieved and the awards ultimately vest. No dividends are assumed for stock based awards.Treasury StockCommon stock purchased for treasury is recorded at cost. At the date of subsequent reissue, the treasury stock account is reduced by the cost of such stock, with cost determined on a weighted average basis.Fair Value of Financial InstrumentsThe Companys financial instruments consist of cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, accounts payable and other accrued liabilities, and outstanding indebtedness. The estimated fair value of the Companys outstanding indebtedness described in Note 7 at December31, 2012and 2011was $2,4237 millionand $1,1789 million, respectively. The aggregate fair value of the senior notes and debentures was approximately $1,7045 millionand $8509 millionat December31, 2012and 2011, respectively. The fair values of these fixed rate facilities are estimated based upon market price quotes. The fair values of the mortgage facility, the Term Loan, the accounts receivable securitization facility the Receivables Facility and the revolving credit facility the Revolving Credit Facility, approximated carrying values. The fair values for these facilities are based upon market price quotes and market comparisons available for instruments with similar terms and maturities. For all remaining WESCO financial instruments, carrying values are considered to approximate fair value due to their short maturities.Environmental ExpendituresWESCO has facilities and operations that distribute certain products that must comply with environmental regulations and laws. Expenditures for current operations are expensed or capitalized, as appropriate. Expenditures relating to existing conditions caused by past operations, and that do not contribute to future revenue, are expensed. Liabilities are recorded when remedial efforts are probable and the costs can be reasonably estimated. ReclassificationCertain prior period balances within the financial statements have been reclassified to conform with current year presentation.Recent Accounting PronouncementsIn June 2011, the Financial Accounting Standards Board the FASB issued new disclosure guidance related to the presentation of the statement of comprehensive income. This guidance provides an entity the option to present the total of comprehensive income, the components of net income and the components of other comprehensive income either in a single continuous statement of comprehensive income or in two separate but consecutive statements; the option to report other comprehensive income and its components in the statement of changes in stockholders' equity was eliminated. This accounting 38Table of Contentsstandard is effective for periods beginning on or after December 15, 2011. WESCO has elected the option to present the components of net income and the components of comprehensive income in a single continuous statement of comprehensive income.In July 2012, the Financial Accounting Standards Board the FASB issued updated guidance on the periodic testing of indefinite-lived intangible assets, other than goodwill, for impairment. This updated guidance will allow companies the option to first access qualitative factors to determine if it is more-likely-than-not that an indefinite-lived intangible asset might be impaired and whether it is necessary to perform the quantitative impairment test required under current accounting standards. This guidance is effective for annual and interim impairment tests performed for fiscal years beginning after September 15, 2012. WESCO will adopt this guidance in 2013. Adoption of this guidance is not expected to have a material impact on WESCO financial position, results of operations or cash flows.Other pronouncements issued by the FASB or other authoritative accounting standards groups with future effective dates are either not applicable or are not expected to be significant to WESCOs financial position, results of operations or cash flows3.

WESCOs largest supplier accounted for approximately 12%of WESCO purchases in 2012, 10%of purchases in 2011, and 12%of purchases in 2010, and therefore, WESCO could potentially incur risk due to supplier concentration. Based upon WESCOs broad customer base, the Company has concluded that it has no material credit risk as a result of customer concentration5. ACQUISITIONSThe following table sets forth the consideration paid for acquisitions:Year Ended December 3120122011In thousandsDetails of acquisitions:Fair value of assets acquired$1,609,785$54,663Fair value of liabilities  acquisition paymentsCash paid for  cash flow disclosure related to acquisitions:Cash paid for  cash acquired32,300Cash paid for acquisitions, net of cash  of EECOL Electric CorporationOn December14, 2012, WESCO International completed its acquisition of EECOL Electric Corporation EECOL. WESCO paid at closing a cash purchase price of approximately $11 billion, of which $508 millionwas placed in escrow to address post-closing purchase price adjustments and potential indemnification claims. The remaining escrow will be distributed to the sellers in June 2014. To fund the purchase price paid at closing, WESCO and its subsidiaries borrowed $851 millionunder new term loans and $264 millionunder the Revolving Credit Facility. With the acquisition of EECOL, WESCO obtained a 60%ownership in a joint venture. This entity has been consolidated. The noncontrolling interest incurred a gain of less than $01 millionin 2012.EECOL is a full-line distributor of electrical equipment, products and services with 57locations across Canada and 20in South America. EECOL has a warehouse-based business focused on serving industrial, oil, gas, mining, utility, and commercial and residential construction customers. The preliminary purchase price was allocated to the respective assets and liabilities based upon their estimated fair values as of the acquisition date. The fair value of the intangible assets was estimated by management and the allocation resulted in intangible assets of $3004 millionand goodwill of $6704 millionwhich is not deductible for tax purposes.

Deutsch completed a transaction with respect to WESCOs LADD operations, which resulted in a joint venture in which Deutsch owned a 60%interest and WESCO owned a 40%interest. WESCO accounted for its investment in the joint venture using the equity method of accounting. Accordingly, earnings from the joint venture were recorded as other income in the consolidated statement of income. Deutsch was entitled, but not obliged, to acquire the remaining 40%after January1, 2010. Deutsch paid to WESCO aggregate consideration of approximately $750 million, consisting of $600 millionin cash plus a $150 millionpromissory note for its 60%interest in the joint venture.On January15, 2010, WESCO received $18 millionin accrued interest related to the promissory note for the period from January2, 2008 to January2, 2010.

The amendment extended the maturity date for the payment of principal and interest to the earlier of athe closing date of Deutschs option to acquire the remaining 40%joint venture interest or bthe maturity date of Deutschs credit facility or mezzanine financing facility. Interest accrued at a rate of 85%compounded annually. Management believed this rate was commensurate with a market rate of interest; therefore, no reserve or allowance was recorded against the promissory note.On April30, 2010, Deutsch notified WESCO it would exercise its option to purchase the remaining 40%of the LADD joint venture. The option price for Deutsch to acquire the remaining 40%of the joint venture was determined based upon a multiple of trailing earnings, with a minimum purchase price of $400 millionand maximum purchase price of $500 million. The investment in the LADD joint venture at March31, 2010 was $434 million, and the estimated option exercise price was $400 million. As a result, WESCO recorded a pre-tax impairment loss of $34 millionto selling, general and administrative expenses during the first quarter of 2010. On June7, 2010, WESCO completed the sale of its 40%interest in the LADD joint venture and recorded an additional impairment charge of $04 millionto selling, general and administrative expenses. WESCO received $400 millionfor its 40%interest plus $150 millionfor the outstanding promissory note and $05 millionfor accrued interest10.

Management believes that these earnings will be indefinitely reinvested in foreign jurisdiction; accordingly, WESCO has not provided for U.S. federal income taxes related to these earnings.The following table sets forth deferred tax assets and liabilities:December 3120122011In   of intangible  debt interest105,87193,736Employee benefits40,48530,454Tax loss  deferred  of December31, 2012and 2011, WESCO had state tax benefits derived from net operating loss carryforwards of approximately $67 million$44 million, net of federal income tax and $63 million$40 million, net of federal income tax, respectively. In addition, WESCO had tax benefits from net operating losses resulting from the recapitalization of its Canadian 50Table of Contentsoperations of $189 millionand $202 million, respectively. The amounts will begin expiring in 2013 and 2027, respectively. Utilization of WESCOs state net operating loss carryforwards is subject to annual limitations imposed by state statute. Such annual limitations could result in the expiration of the net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards before utilization. Management anticipates utilizing the net operating losses prior to the expiration of statutes of limitations; accordingly, WESCO has not recorded a valuation allowance.WESCO analyzes its filing positions for all open tax years in all jurisdictions. The Company is currently under examination in several tax jurisdictions, both within the United States and outside the United States, and remains subject to examination until the statute of limitations expires for the respective tax jurisdictions. The following summary sets forth the tax years that remain open in the Companys major tax jurisdictions:United States Federal2000 and forward *United States States2007 and forwardCanada2003 and forward* Open by waiver of statute only.The following table sets forth the reconciliation of gross unrecognized tax benefits:December 31,201220112010In thousandsBeginning balance January 1$20,878$3,394$8,085Additions based on tax positions related to the current year9292651,439Additions for tax positions of prior  for acquired tax positions1,825Reductions for tax positions of prior  in statute of  balance December  2011, additions for tax positions of prior years primarily relate to transfer pricing issues between the United Statesand Canada, which are under review by the Canadian Competent Authority. A corresponding deferred tax asset in the amount of $231 millionexcluding interest has been recorded for the position in the United States.The total amount of unrecognized tax benefits were $211 million, $209 millionand $34 millionas of December31, 2012, 2011and 2010, respectively. If these tax benefits were recognized in the consolidated financial statements, the portion of these amounts that would reduce the Companys tax provision would be $212 million, $197 million, and $19 millionrespectively. The amount in 2012 would be offset by the corresponding deferred tax asset discussed above.During the next twelve months, it is reasonably possible that the amount of unrecognized tax benefits will decrease by as much as $147 million$122 millionof which will be offset by the reversal of a deferred tax asset due to certain issues being settled by the resolution of federal, state and/or foreign tax examinations and/or the expiration of statutes of limitations. Management does not expect this decrease to have an impact on the effective tax rate.WESCO records interest related to uncertain tax positions as a part of interest expense in the consolidated statement of income. Any penalties are recognized as part of income tax expense. Penalties recorded to income tax expense were immaterial for 2012, 2011and 2010. As of December31, 2012and 2011, WESCO had an accrued liability of $80 millionand $114 million, respectively, for interest related to uncertain tax positions. During 2012 accrued interest decreased by $34 millionprimarily as a result of a favorable Internal Revenue Service appeals settlement in the first quarter related to the years 2000 to 200611. EARNINGS PER SHAREBasic earnings per share are computed by dividing net income by the weighted average common shares outstanding during the periods. Diluted earnings per share are computed by dividing net income by the weighted average common shares and common share equivalents outstanding during the periods. The dilutive effect of common share equivalents is considered in the 51Table of Contentsdiluted earnings per share computation using the treasury stock method, which includes consideration of stock-based compensation.The following table sets forth the details of basic and diluted earnings per share:Year Ended December 31201220112010In thousands, except per share dataNet  average common shares outstanding used in computing basic earnings per share43,67743,22042,499Common shares issuable upon exercise of dilutive stock options1,1471,179840Common shares issuable from contingently convertible debentures see below for basis of  average common shares outstanding and common share equivalents used in computing diluted earnings per  per share attributable to WESCO International,  of December31, 2012, 2011and 2010, the computation of diluted earnings per share attributable to WESCO International, Inc. excluded stock-settled stock appreciation rights of approximately 09 million, 12 millionand 24 millionat weighted average exercise prices of $6417per share, $6248per share and $4673per share, respectively. These amounts were excluded because their effect would have been antidilutive.Because of WESCOs obligation to settle the par value of the 2029 Debentures in cash, WESCO is not required to include any shares underlying the 2029 Debentures in its diluted weighted average shares outstanding until the average stock price per share for the period exceeds the conversion price of the 2029 Debentures. At such time, only the number of shares that would be issuable under the treasury stock method of accounting for share dilution will be included, which is based upon the amount by which the average stock price exceeds the conversion price. The conversion price of the 2029 Debentures is $2887. Share dilution is limited to a maximum of 11,949,205shares for the 2029 Debentures. For the periods ended December31, 2012, 2011, and 2010, the effect of the 2029 Debentures on diluted earnings per share attributable to WESCO International, Inc. was a decrease of $056, $047, and $016, respectively12. EMPLOYEE BENEFIT PLANSDefined Contribution PlansA majority of WESCOs employees are covered by defined contribution retirement savings plans for their service rendered subsequent to WESCOs formation. WESCO also offers a deferred compensation plan for select individuals. For U.S. participants, WESCO will make contributions in an amount equal to 50%of the participants total monthly contributions up to a maximum of 6%of eligible compensation. For Canadian participants, WESCO will make contributions in an amount ranging from 1%to 7%of the participants eligible compensation based on years of continuous service. In addition, employer contributions may be made at the discretion of the Board of Directors. Discretionary employer contributions charges of $186 million, $162 million, and $142 millionwere incurred in 2012, 2011, and 2010, respectively. For the years ended December31, 2012, 2011 and 2010, WESCO incurred charges of $318 million, $276 million, and $253 million, respectively, for all such plans. Contributions are made in cash to employee retirement savings plan accounts. Employees then have the option to transfer balances allocated to their accounts into any of the available investment options, including WESCO common stock.Defined Benefit PlansIn connection with the December 14, 2012 acquisition of EECOL discussed in Note 5, the Company assumed a contributory defined benefit plan covering all employees of EECOL. The plan provides retirement benefits based on earnings and credited service, and participants may contribute 2% of their earnings to the plan. Participants become 100% vested after two years of continuous service. 52Table of ContentsThe Company also assumed EECOL Supplemental Executive Retirement Plan SERP which provides additional pension benefits to certain executives based on earnings, credited service, and executive service. Participants in the plan are vested after two years of continuous service and may contribute 4% of their earnings to the plan.The following tables present the changes in benefit obligations, plan assets and funded status for the pension plans and the components of net periodic pension cost.Year ended December 31, 2012 In thousandsAccumulated Benefit Obligation ABO at December 31$80,252Change in Projected Benefit Obligation PBOPBO at beginning of year$Effect of acquisition102,829Service cost158Interest cost217Participant contributions85Actuarial loss gain, including assumption changes277Benefits paid100PBO at end of year$103,466Change in Fair Value of Plan AssetsPlan assets at beginning of year$Effect of acquisition60,297Actual return on plan assets870Employee contributions85Company contributions298Benefits paid100Plan assets at end of year$61,450Funded status$42,016Amounts recognized in the balance sheetCurrent liabilities$201Non-current liabilities41,815Net pension liability at end of year$42,016Amounts recognized in Accumulated Other Comprehensive Loss Before TaxNet actuarial loss gain$414Prior service costTotal recognized in accumulated other comprehensive loss$41453Table of ContentsYear ended December 31, 2012 In thousandsNet Periodic Pension CostService cost$158Interest cost217Expected return on plan assets177Total net periodic pension cost$198Other Changes in Plan Assets and Projected Benefit Obligation Recognized in Other Comprehensive EarningsNet actuarial loss gain$416Total recognized in other comprehensive earnings$416Total recognized in net periodic pension cost and other comprehensive earnings$218Actuarial assumptions used to determine benefit obligations at December 31, 2012 are as follows:Pension PlanSERPDiscount rate45%45%Average salary increases40%40%Actuarial assumptions used to determine net periodic pension cost for the year ended December 31, 2012 are as follows:Pension PlanSERPDiscount rate45%45%Expected return on long-term assets63%n/aRate of compensation increase40%40%The following benefit payments, which reflect expected future service, are expected to be paid:Years ending December 31 In  Company expects to contribute approximately $39 millionto the plans in 2013.The Company pension plan weighted asset allocations as of December 31, 2012 by asset category are as follows:Asset CategoryEquity securities577%Debt securities423%1000%The Plan long-term overall objective is to maintain benefits at their current level without affecting the cost of maintaining the plan, assuming that the demographic make-up of the group of members remains the same. 54Table of ContentsThe primary investment objective, in support of the overall objective, is to earn the highest rate of return possible for the Plan, while keeping risk at acceptable levels. The long-term return objective of the Plan is to achieve a minimum annualized rate of return in excess of the actuarial requirements. This translates into a required return of 35% percent above inflation, net of investment management fees. The return objective is consistent with the overall investment risk level that the Plan assumes in order to meet the pension obligations of the Plan. To achieve this long term investment objective, the Plan has adopted an asset mix that has a combination of equity and fixed income investments. Risk is controlled by investing in a well-diversified portfolio of asset classes. To meet this objective, a benchmark portfolio is established based on the expected returns for each asset class available. The investment of the Plan assets in accordance with the benchmark portfolio should enable the Plan to not only attain, but also exceed the minimum overall objective.The following table presents the target asset mix based on market value for each investment category within which the investment managers must invest the Plan assets. The manager is required to rebalance the asset mix back to the target on a quarterly basis.Asset CategoryTarget %Canadian equities25%U.S. equities15%Non-North American equities20%Total equities60%Fixed income bond managers40%Fair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. The fair value hierarchy distinguishes between 1 market participant assumptions developed based on market data obtained from independent sources observable inputs and 2 an entity own assumptions about market participant assumptions developed based on the best information available in the circumstances unobservable inputs. The fair value hierarchy consists of three broad levels, which gives the highest priority to unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities Level 1 and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs Level 3. The three levels of the fair value hierarchy are described below:Level 1 - Unadjusted quoted prices in active markets that are accessible at the measurement date for identical, unrestricted assets or liabilities.Level 2 - Inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly, including quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets; quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not active; inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the asset and liability e.g., interest rates; and inputs that are derived principally from or corroborated by observable market data by correlation or other means.Level 3 - Inputs that are both significant to the fair value measurement and unobservable.The following section describes the valuation methodologies used by the trustees to measure the fair value of plan assets, including an indication of the level in the fair value hierarchy in which each type of asset is generally classified.Equity Securities. These securities consist of the plan share of segregated funds that invest in the stock of publicly traded companies and are valued at the net asset value of shares held at December 31. As such, these securities are generally included in Level 2.Debt Securities.These securities consist of segregated funds that invest in publicly traded U.S and non-U.S. fixed interest obligations and government securities and are valued through consultation and evaluation with brokers in the institutional market using other observable market data. As such, these securities are generally included in Level 2. Also, these securities include cash and cash equivalents consisting of money market funds and are generally valued using quoted prices or observable market data. As such, these funds are included in Level 1.The fair value methods described above may not be indicative of net realizable value or reflective of future fair values. Additionally, while the Company believes the valuation method used by the plan trustee is appropriate and consistent with other market participants, the use of different methodologies or assumptions to determine the fair value of certain financial instruments could result in a different fair value measurement at the reporting date.The following table represents the fair value of plan assets classified under the appropriate level of fair value hierarchy:55Table of ContentsLevel 1Level 2Level 3TotalEquity    STOCK-BASED COMPENSATIONWESCO has sponsored four stock option plans: the 1999 Long-Term Incentive Plan LTIP, the 1998 Stock Option Plan, the Stock Option Plan for Branch Employees and the 1994 Stock Option Plan. The LTIP was designed to be the successor plan to all prior plans. Any shares remaining reserved for future issuance under the prior plans are available for issuance under the LTIP. The LTIP and predecessor plans are administered by the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors.An initial reserve of 6,936,000shares of common stock has been authorized for issuance under the LTIP. This reserve automatically increases by ithe number of shares of common stock covered by unexercised options granted under prior plans that are canceled or terminated after the effective date of the LTIP, and iithe number of shares of common stock surrendered by employees to pay the exercise price and/or minimum withholding taxes in connection with the exercise of stock options granted under our prior plans. As of December31, 2012, 23 millionshares of common stock were reserved under the LTIP for future equity award grants. In December2003, in a privately negotiated transaction, WESCO redeemed the net equity value of stock options originally granted in 1994 and 1995, representing approximately 29 millionshares. These shares are included in the reserve of common stock available for issuance under the LTIP.Except for the performance-based award, awards granted vest and become exercisable once criteria based on time is achieved. Performance-based awards vest based on market or performance conditions. All awards vest immediately in the event of a change in control. Each award terminates on the tenth anniversary of its grant date unless terminated sooner under certain conditions.As of December31, 2012, there was $180 millionof total unrecognized compensation expense related to non-vested stock-based compensation arrangements for all awards previously made of which approximately $115 millionis expected to be recognized in 2013, $59 millionin 2014 and $07 millionin 2015.The total intrinsic value of awards exercised during the years ended December31, 2012, 2011, and 2010was $411 million, $138 million, and $99 million, respectively. The total amount of cash received from the exercise of options was $32 million,  $04 million, and $18 million, respectively. The tax benefit associated with the exercise of stock options and stock-settled stock appreciation rights totaled $114 million, $54 million, and $31 millionin 2012, 2011, and 2010, respectively. WESCO uses the direct only method and tax law ordering approach to calculate the tax effects of stock-based compensation. The tax benefit was recorded as a credit to additional paid-in capital.The following table sets forth a summary of both stock options and stock appreciation rights and related information for the years   of  of  at end of  granted the following stock-settled stock appreciation rights at the following weighted average assumptions:56Table of  appreciation rights  free interest rate09%23%18%Expected life in years555Expected volatility50%49%49%The following table sets forth a summary of time-based restricted stock units and related information for the year ended December31,  at December 31,  at December31, 2012187,335$5228The weighted average fair value per stock-settled appreciation right granted was $2789, $2646and $1471for the years ended December31, 2012, 2011and 2010, respectively. The weighted average fair value per restricted stock unit granted was $6427, $6005and $3305for the years ended December31, 2012, 2011and 2010, respectively. WESCO recognized $151 million, $154 millionand $158 millionof non-cash stock-based compensation expense, which is included in selling, general and administrative expenses, in 2012, 2011and 2010, respectively.The following table sets forth a summary of performance-based awards for the year ended December31,  at December 31,  at December 31, 201246,500$7572The performance-based awards in the table above include 23,250shares, and the ultimate number of shares that vest will be dependent upon WESCO total stockholder return in relation to the total stockholder return of a select group of peer companies over a three-year period. These awards are valued based upon a Monte Carlo simulation model. The probability of meeting the market criteria was considered when calculating the estimated fair market value on the date of grant. These awards were accounted for as awards with market conditions, which are recognized over the service period, regardless of whether the market conditions are achieved and the awards ultimately vest.The fair value of the performance shares based on total stockholder return granted during the year ended December 31, 2012 were estimated using the following weighted-average assumptions:57Table of ContentsWeighted Average AssumptionsGrant date share price$6433WESCO expected volatility4197%Peer group median volatility3340%Risk-free interest  of the remaining 23,250shares of performance-based awards in the table above will be dependent upon the three-year average growth rate of WESCO net income. These awards are valued based upon the grant-date closing price of WESCO common stock. These awards were accounted for as awards with performance conditions, accordingly stock-based compensation expense is recognized over the performance period and considers the probability that the performance targets will be achieved.  14. COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIESFuture minimum rental payments required under operating leases, primarily for real property that have noncancelable lease terms in excess of one year as of December31, 2012, are as follows:In  expense for the years ended December31, 2012, 2011and 2010was $500 million, $480 millionand $454 million, respectively.From time to time, a number of lawsuits and claims have been or may be asserted against WESCO relating to the conduct of its business, including routine litigation relating to commercial and employment matters. The outcomes of litigation cannot be predicted with certainty, and some lawsuits may be determined adversely to WESCO. However, management does not believe that the ultimate outcome is likely to have a material adverse effect on WESCOs financial condition or liquidity, although the resolution in any fiscal quarter of one or more of these matters may have a material adverse effect on WESCOs results of operations for that period.As initially reported in our 2008 Annual Report on Form 10-K, WESCO International, Inc. the Company, through its wholly owned subsidiary, WESCO Distribution, Inc., is a defendant in a lawsuit filed in a state court in Indiana in which a customer, ArcelorMittal Indiana Harbor, Inc. AIH, alleges that the Company sold defective products to AIH in 2004 that were supplied to the Company by others. The lawsuit sought monetary damages in the amount of approximately $50 million. On February14, 2013, the jury returned a verdict in favor of AIH and awarded damages in the amount of approximately $36 million. Judgment was entered on the jury verdict on February14, 2013. The Company disputes this outcome and intends to appeal the judgment. The judgment amount may increase or decrease based on the outcome of various post-trial proceedings, which cannot be predicted with certainty. The Company has also submitted the claims to its insurance carriers. 15.

Based on this evaluation, our principal executive officer and our principal financial officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of the end of the period covered by this report.Managements Report on Internal Control Over Financial ReportingOur management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as such term is defined in Exchange Act Rule13a-15f. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting 65Table of Contentsmay not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
