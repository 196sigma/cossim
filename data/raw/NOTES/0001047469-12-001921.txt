Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm    
To
the Board of Directors and Stockholders of
California Water Service Group
San Jose, California 
We
have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of California Water Service Group and subsidiaries the Company as of December31, 2011 and 2010, and the related
consolidated statements of income, common stockholders' equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December31, 2011. We also have audited the Company internal
control over financial reporting as of December31, 2011, based on criteria established in Internal
ControlIntegrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. The
Company management is responsible for these financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control
over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to
express an opinion on these financial statements and an opinion on the Company internal control over financial reporting based on our audits. 
We
conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board United States. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to
obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material
respects. Our audits of the financial statements included examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles
used and significant estimates made by management, and evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an
understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control
based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our
opinions. 
A
company internal control over financial reporting is a process designed by, or under the supervision of, the company principal executive and principal financial officers, or
persons performing similar functions, and effected by the company board of directors, management, and other personnel to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting
and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company internal control over financial reporting includes those
policies and procedures that 1pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company;
2provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that
receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and 3provide reasonable assurance regarding
prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. Because
of the inherent limitations of internal control over financial reporting, including the possibility of collusion or improper management override of controls, material
misstatements due to error or fraud may not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. Also, projections of any evaluation of the effectiveness of the internal control over financial reporting to
future periods are subject to the risk that the controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

except share data     1 ORGANIZATION AND OPERATIONS  California Water Service Group Company is a holding company that provides water utility and other related services in California, Washington, New Mexico, and Hawaii through its
wholly-owned subsidiaries. California Water Service Company Cal Water, Washington Water Service Company Washington Water, New Mexico Water Service Company New Mexico Water, and Hawaii Water
Service Company,Inc. Hawaii Water provide regulated utility services under the rules and regulations of their respective state regulatory commissions jointly referred to as the
Commissions. CWS Utility Services and HWS Utility ServicesLLC provide non-regulated water utility and utility-related services. 
The
Company operates in one reportable segment, providing water and related utility services.  Basis of Presentation  The consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United
States of America GAAP and include the Company accounts and those of its wholly owned subsidiaries. All intercompany transactions have been eliminated from the consolidated financial statements. In
the opinion of management, the consolidated financial statements reflect all adjustments that are necessary to provide a fair presentation of the results for the periods covered. 
The
preparation of the Company consolidated financial statements in accordance with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of
assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the consolidated balance sheet dates and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses for the periods presented. These
include, but are not limited to, estimates and assumptions used in determining the Company regulatory asset and liability balances based upon probability assessments of regulatory recovery, revenues
earned but not yet billed, asset retirement obligations, allowance for doubtful accounts, pension and other employee benefit plan liabilities, and income tax-related assets and
liabilities. Actual results could differ from these estimates. 
Effective
on June8, 2011, the Company Certificate of Incorporation was amended to increase the number of authorized shares of the Company common stock from 25,000,000 shares
to 68,000,000 shares in connection with a 2 for 1 stock split effected as a dividend. As a result, the number of authorized shares under the equity incentive plan authorized shares also increased to
2,000,000 shares of common stock. The common stock par value of $001 was not changed. The increased number of authorized shares and 2 for 1 stock split effective June10, 2011 are
retroactively applied to these financial statements resulting in an increase in the number of shares outstanding. 
2 SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES  Revenue  Revenue generally includes monthly cycle customer billings for regulated water and wastewater services at rates authorized by
regulatory commissions plus an estimate for water used between the customer last meter reading and the end of the accounting period and billings to certain non-regulated customers at
rates authorized by contract with government agencies.

2 SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES Continued 
The
Company regulated water and waste water revenue requirements are authorized by the Commissions in the states in which we operate. The revenue requirements are intended to provide
the Company a reasonable opportunity to recover its operating costs and earn a return on investments. For
metered customers, Cal Water recognizes revenue from rates which are designed and authorized by the California Public Utilities Commission CPUC. Under the Water Revenue Adjustment
Mechanism WRAM, Cal Water records the adopted level of volumetric revenues, which would include recovery of cost of service and a return on investments, as established by the CPUC for metered
accounts adopted volumetric revenues. In addition to volumetric-based revenues, the revenue requirements approved by the CPUC include service charges, flat rate charges, and other items not subject
to the WRAM. The
adopted volumetric revenue considers the seasonality of consumption of water based upon historical averages. The variance between adopted volumetric revenues and actual billed volumetric revenues for
metered accounts is recorded as a component of revenue with an offsetting entry to a regulatory asset or liability balancing account tracked individually for each Cal Water district subject to
certain criteria under the accounting for regulated operations being met. The variance amount may be positive or negative and represents amounts that will be billed or refunded to customers in the
future. 
Cost-recovery
rates are designed to permit full recovery of certain costs allowed to be recovered by the Commissions. Cost-recovery rates such as the Modified
Cost Balancing Account MCBA provides for recovery of adopted expense levels for purchased water, purchased power and pump taxes, as established by the CPUC. In addition, cost-recovery
rates include recovery of cost related to water conservation programs and certain other operation expenses adopted by the CPUC. Variances which include the effects of changes in both rate and volume
for the MCBA between adopted and actual costs are recorded as a component of revenue, as the amount of such variances will be recovered from or refunded to our customers at a later date. There is no
markup for return or profit for cost-recovery expenses and are generally recognized when expenses are incurred. 
The
balances in the WRAM and MCBA assets and liabilities accounts will fluctuate on a monthly basis depending upon the variance between adopted and actual results. The recovery or refund
of the WRAM is netted against the MCBA over- or under-recovery for the corresponding district and is interest bearing at the current 90day commercial paper rate. When the net
amount for any district achieves a pre-determined level at the end of any calendar year i.e.,at least 25percent over- or under-recovery of the authorized
revenue requirement, Cal Water files with the CPUC to refund or collect the balance in the accounts. Account balances less than those levels may be refunded or collected in Cal Water general rate
case proceedings or aggregated with future calendar year balances for comparison with the recovery level. Cal Water excluded net WRAM and MCBA operating revenue of $12,864, associated costs of
$10,492, and the related $2,372 of net operating income before income taxes as of December31, 2011, due to the net receivable balance estimated to be collected more than 24months. The
net WRAM and MCBA revenue and associated costs were determined using forecasts of rate payer consumption trends in future reporting periods and the timing of when the CPUC will authorize Cal Water
filings to recover the undercollected balances. The deferred revenue and associated cost amounts will be recorded in future periods as the collection becomes within twenty-four months of
the respective reporting period.

Flat
rate customers are billed in advance at the beginning of the service period. The revenue is prorated so that the portion of revenue applicable to the current period is included in
that period revenue, with the balance recorded as unearned revenue on the balance sheet and recognized as revenue when earned in the subsequent accounting period. Our unearned revenue liability was
$1,871 and $1,569 as of December31, 2011 and 2010, respectively. This liability is included in other accrued liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets.  Allowance for Doubtful Accounts  The Company provides an allowance for doubtful accounts receivable. The allowance is based upon specific identified accounts plus an
estimate of uncollectible accounts based upon historical percentages. The balance of customer receivables is net of the allowance for doubtful accounts at December31, 2011 and 2010 of $669 and
$804, respectively. 
The
activities in the allowance for doubtful accounts are as follows: 
2011 
2010 
2009  Beginning Balance 804 847 1,210 Provision for uncollectible accounts 1,250 1,500 1,462 Net write off of uncollectible accounts 1,385 1,543 1,825 Ending Balance 669 804 847 
Non-Regulated Revenue  Revenues from non-regulated operations and maintenance agreements are recognized when services have been rendered to
companies or municipalities under such agreements. For construction and design services, revenue is generally recognized on the completed contract method, as most projects are completed in less than
three months. Other non-regulated revenue is recognized when title has transferred to the buyer, or ratably over the term of the lease.

2 SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES Continued  Utility Plant  Utility plant is carried at original cost when first constructed or purchased, or at fair value when acquired through acquisition. When
depreciable plant is retired, the cost is eliminated from utility plant accounts and such costs are charged against accumulated depreciation. Maintenance of utility plant is charged to operating
expenses as incurred. Maintenance projects are not accrued for in advance. Interest is capitalized on plant expenditures during the construction period and amounted to $2,741 in 2011, $1,563 in 2010,
and $3,081 in 2009. 
Intangible
assets acquired as part of water systems purchased are recorded at fair value. All other intangibles have been recorded at cost and are amortized over their useful life. The
following table represents depreciable plant and equipment as of December31: 
2011 
2010  Equipment 382,195 321,958 Transmission and distribution plant 1,287,010 1,263,895 Office buildings and other structures 138,364 109,222 Total 1,807,569 1,695,075 
Depreciation
of utility plant for financial statement purposes is computed on a straight-line basis over the assets' estimated useful lives including cost of removal of
certain assets as follows: 
Useful Lives  Equipment
5 to 50years Transmission and distribution plant
40 to 65years Office Buildings and other structures
50years 
The
provision for depreciation expressed as a percentage of the aggregate depreciable asset balances was 30% in 2011, 28% in 2010, and 28% 2009. For income tax purposes, as
applicable, the Company computes depreciation using the accelerated methods allowed by the respective taxing authorities.  Asset Retirement Obligation  The Company has a legal obligation to retire wells in accordance with Department of Public Health regulations. In addition, upon
decommission of a wastewater plant or lift station certain wastewater infrastructure would need to be retired in accordance with Department of Public Health regulations. The Company has collected
retirement obligation costs from ratepayers through depreciation expense. As of December31, 2011 and 2010 the retirement obligation is estimated to be $14,049 and $10,582, respectively. The
change only impacted the consolidated balance sheet.

2 SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES Continued  Cash Equivalents  Cash equivalents include highly liquid investments with remaining maturities of three months or less at the time of acquisition.  Restricted Cash  In 2011 restricted cash includes $3million of Cal Water and a third party cash deposits for a capital project. It also includes
$12million of proceeds collected through a surcharge on certain customers' bills plus interest earned on the proceeds and is used to service California Safe Drinking Water Bond obligations.
All restricted cash is included in prepaid expenses. At December31, 2011 and 2010, restricted cash was $4,225 and $1,183, respectively.  Regulatory Assets and Liabilities  Regulatory assets and liabilities were comprised of the following as of December31: 
2011 
2010  Regulatory Assets Pension and retiree group health 213,819 145,451 Income tax temporary differences 34,664 30,934 Other accrued benefits 31,453 29,919 Net WRAM and MCBA long-term accounts receivable 30,268 16,786 Asset retirement obligations, net 9,694 6,487 Total Regulatory Assets 319,898 229,577 Regulatory Liabilities Future tax benefits due ratepayers 16,978 15,253 Conservation program 4,328 Pension balancing account 1,936 Other liabilities 4,795 1,826 Total Regulatory Liabilities 28,037 17,079 
Short-term
regulatory assets and liabilities are excluded from the above table. The short-term regulatory assets for 2011 and 2010 were $21,680 and $14,784,
respectively. The short-term regulatory assets were primarily net WRAM/MCBA receivable balances. The short-term portion of regulatory liabilities for 2011 and 2010 were $2,655
and $3,025, respectively. 
The
Company operates extensively in a regulated business, and as such is subject to the accounting standards for regulated utilities. Utility companies defer costs and credits on the
balance sheet as regulatory assets and liabilities when it is probable that those costs and credits will be recognized in the ratemaking process in a period different from the period in which they
would have been reflected in income by an unregulated company. Regulatory assets other than WRAM represent deferral of costs that will be recovered in the future and do not include a return. In
determining the probability of costs

2 SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES Continued 
being
recognized in other periods, the Company considers regulatory rules and decisions, past practices, and other facts or circumstances that would indicate if recovery is probable. In the event that
a portion of the Company operations were no longer subject to the accounting standards for regulated utilities, the Company would be required to write off related regulatory assets and liabilities.
If a commission determined that a portion of the Company assets were not recoverable in customer rates, the Company would be required to determine if the Company had suffered an asset impairment
that would require a write-down in the assets' valuation. 
The
Company qualified, defined-benefit, non-contributory pension plan and other postretirement plan benefit Retire Group Health regulatory asset is the amount the Company
expects to recover from ratepayers in the future for these plans at the end of the calendar year, which also includes amounts that otherwise would be recorded to accumulated other comprehensive loss
in the Consolidated Balance Sheet. 
The
income tax temporary differences relate primarily to the difference between book and federal income tax depreciation on utility plant that was placed in service before the regulatory
Commissions adopted normalization for rate making purposes. Previously, the tax benefit of tax depreciation was passed on to customers flow-through. For state income tax purposes, the
Commission continues to use the flow-through method. As such timing differences reverse, the Company will be able to include the impact of such differences in customer rates. These federal
tax differences will continue to reverse over the remaining book lives of the related assets. 
Other
accrued benefits are accrued benefits for vacation, self-insured workers' compensation, and directors' retirement benefits. The net WRAM and MCBA long-term
accounts receivable is the undercollected portion of recorded revenues that are expected to be collected from ratepayers within 24months. The asset retirement obligations is recorded net of
depreciation which has been recorded and recognized through the regulatory process over the remaining useful life of the related asset. 
The
future tax benefits regulatory liability are future benefits to ratepayers for tax deductions that will be allowed in the future. Regulatory liabilities also reflect timing
differences provided at higher than the current tax rate, which will flow-through to future ratepayers. The conservation program regulatory liability is for cost recovery in rates that
exceeded incurred costs and is refundable to ratepayers as of December31, 2011.  Impairment of Long-Lived Assets, Intangibles and Goodwill  The Company regularly reviews its long-lived assets, intangible assets and goodwill for impairment annually or when events
or changes in business circumstances have occurred that indicate the carrying amount of such assets may not be fully realizable. Potential impairment of assets held for use is determined by comparing
the carrying amount of an asset to the future undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by the asset. If assets are considered to be impaired, the impairment to be recognized is measured as the
amount by which the carrying value of the asset exceeds its fair value. In the 2010 Hawaii Water GRC for the Ka'anapali Water District, construction costs of $320 were removed from rate base and
expensed as a non-regulated expense during 2011 and in the Cal Water

GRC settlement, construction costs of $634 were removed from rate base and expensed to non-regulated expense during 2010. Goodwill
is measured as the excess of the cost of an acquisition over the sum of the amounts assigned to identifiable assets acquired less liabilities assumed. Goodwill and other
identifiable intangible assets are accounted for in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. Goodwill is not amortized but instead is reviewed annually at
November30thfor impairment or more frequently if impairment indicators arise. 
The
impairment test is performed at the reporting unit level using a two-step, fair-value based approach. The first step determines the fair value of the
reporting unit and compares it to the reporting unit carrying value. If the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, a second step is performed to measure the amount of
impairment loss, if any. The second step allocates the fair value of the reporting unit to the Company tangible and intangible assets and liabilities. This derives an implied fair value for the
reporting unit goodwill. If the carrying amount of the reporting unit goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of that goodwill, an impairment loss is recognized equal to the excess. 
The
recorded goodwill balance as of December31, 2011 and 2010, relate to the Hawaii Water Service Company reporting unit. Based on our annual goodwill impairment test, no
impairment was recorded in 2011 or 2010.  Long-Term Debt Premium, Discount and Expense  The discount and issuance expense on long-term debt is amortized over the original lives of the related debt on a
straight-line basis which approximates the effective interest method. Premiums paid on the early redemption of certain debt and the unamortized original issuance discount and expense are
amortized over the life of new debt issued in conjunction with the early redemption. Amortization expense included in interest expense was $1,082, $979, and $970 for 2011, 2010, and 2009,
respectively.  Advances for Construction  Advances for Construction consist of payments received from developers for installation of water production and distribution facilities
to serve new developments. Advances are excluded from rate base for rate setting purposes. Annual refunds are made to developers without interest. Advances of $185,902, and $185,332 at
December31, 2011, and 2010, respectively, will be refunded primarily over a 40-year period in equal annual amounts. In addition, other Advances for Construction totaling $1,376 and
$1,567 at December31, 2011, and 2010, respectively, are
refundable based upon customer connections. Estimated refunds of advances for each succeeding year 2012 through 2016 are approximately $7,011, $6,914, $6,908, $6,850, $6,847 and $152,748 thereafter.  Contributions in Aid of Construction  Contributions in Aid of Construction represent payments received from developers, primarily for fire protection purposes, which are not
subject to refunds. Facilities funded by contributions are

included
in utility plant, but excluded from rate base. Depreciation related to assets acquired from contributions is charged to the Contributions in Aid of Construction account.  Income Taxes  The Company accounts for income taxes using the asset and liability method. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the
future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases. Measurement of the deferred tax
assets and liabilities is at enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax
assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in the period that includes the enactment date. 
Historically
the Commissions have allowed revenue requirements for the tax effects of temporary differences recognized, which have previously been flowed through to customers. The
Commissions have granted the Company rate increases to reflect the normalization of the tax benefits of the federal accelerated methods and available Investment Tax Credits ITC for all assets placed
in service after 1980. ITCs are deferred and amortized over the lives of the related properties for book purposes. 
Advances
for Construction and Contributions in Aid of Construction received from developers subsequent to 1986 were taxable for federal income tax purposes and subsequent to 1991 were
subject
to California income tax. In 1996, the federal tax law, and in 1997, the California tax law, changed and only deposits for new services were taxable. In late 2000, federal regulations were further
modified to exclude contributions of fire services from taxable income. The
accounting standards for accounting for uncertainty in income taxes also requires the inclusion of interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions as a component of income
taxes. See note10 Income Taxes.  Workers' Compensation, General Liability and Other Claims  For workers' compensation, the Company estimates the liability associated with claims submitted and claims not yet submitted based on
historical data. Expenses for workers compensation insurance are included in rates on a pay-as-you-go basis. Therefore, a corresponding regulatory asset has been
recorded. For general liability claims and other claims, the Company estimates the cost incurred but not yet paid using historical information.  Collective Bargaining Agreements  As of December31, 2011, the Company had 1,132 employees, including 703 non-supervisory employees who are
represented by the Utility Workers Union of America, AFL-CIO, except certain engineering and laboratory employees who are represented by the International Federation of Professional and
Technical Engineers, AFL-CIO. The union agreements expire at the end of 2014.

2 SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES Continued  Earnings Per Share  The computations of basic and diluted earnings per share are noted below. Basic earnings per share are computed by dividing net income
available to common stockholders by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the period. Diluted earnings per share reflect the potential dilution that could occur if securities
or other contracts were exercised or converted into common stock. Restricted Stock Awards RSAs are included in the common shares outstanding because the shares have all the same voting and dividend
rights as issued and unrestricted common stock. 
At
December31, 2010 and 2009, there were 65,000 and 125,500, respectively, common stock options outstanding. All remaining common stock options were exercised during 2011. The
Company did not grant any Stock Appreciation Rights SAR in 2011 and 2010. SARs outstanding were 361,356 shares as of December31, 2011, 2010, and 2009. 
All

6 COMMON STOCKHOLDERS' EQUITY  As of December31, 2011 and 2010, 41,817,032 shares and 41,666,606 shares, respectively, of common stock were issued and outstanding.  Dividend Reinvestment and Stock Repurchase Plan  The Company has a Dividend Reinvestment and Stock Purchase Plan DRIP Plan. Under the DRIP Plan, stockholders may reinvest dividends
to purchase additional Company common stock without commission fees. The Plan also allows existing stockholders and other interested investors to purchase Company common stock through the transfer
agent up to certain limits. The Company transfer agent operates the DRIP Plan and purchases shares on the open market to provide shares for the Plan.  7 SHORT-TERM BORROWINGS  On June29, 2011, the Company and Cal Water entered into Syndicated Credit Agreements, which provide for unsecured revolving credit facilities of up to an initial aggregate amount
of $400 million. The Syndicated Credit Facilities amend, expand, and replace the Company and its subsidiaries' existing credit facilities originally entered into on October27, 2009. The new
credit facilities extended the terms until June29, 2016, increased the Company and Cal Water unsecured revolving lines of credit, and lowered interest rates and fees. The Company and
subsidiaries which it designates may borrow up to $100 million under the Company revolving credit facility. Cal Water may borrow up to $300 million under its revolving credit facility; however, all
borrowings need to be repaid within twelve months unless otherwise authorized by the CPUC. The proceeds from the revolving credit facilities may be used for working capital purposes, including the
short-term financing of capital projects. The base loan rate may vary from LIBOR plus 725 basis points to LIBOR plus 95 basis points, depending on the Company total capitalization
ratio. Likewise, the unused commitment fee may vary from 8 basis points to 125 basis points based on the same ratio. 
Both
short-term unsecured credit agreements contain affirmative and negative covenants and events of default customary for credit facilities of this type including, among
other things, limitations and prohibitions relating to additional indebtedness, liens, mergers, and asset sales. Also, these unsecured credit agreements contain financial covenants governing the
Company and its subsidiaries' consolidated total capitalization ratio and interest coverage ratio. As of December31, 2011, the Company and Cal Water have met all borrowing covenants for both
credit agreements. 
As
of December31, 2011 and December31, 2010, the outstanding borrowings on the Company lines of credit were $471 million and $238 million, respectively, and there were
no borrowings on the Cal Water lines of credit for both periods.

The
Company filed an application for a change in accounting method Section481 adjustment with the State of California to change its plant-in-service
state tax depreciation method from the double-declining method to the straight line method at the respective assets mid-life. The Company application was approved by the State of
California during the first quarter of 2011. California uses the flow-through method of accounting for income tax depreciation. As a result, the Company reduced its income tax obligation
$16 million, net of federal income taxes in 2011. Income tax expense was

computed
by applying the current federal 35% tax rate to pretax book income differs from the amount shown in the Consolidated Statements of Income. The difference is reconciled in the table below:

Included
in Other in the above table is the recognition of the flow-through accounting for Federal depreciation expense on assets acquired prior to 1982 and retirement costs
of such assets. For assets acquired prior to 1982, the benefit of excess tax depreciation was previously passed through to the ratepayers. The tax benefit is now reversing and a higher tax expense is
being recognized and is included in customer rates. Offsetting the flow-through depreciation in 2011, 2010, and 2009 was the impact of cost to remove pre-1982 assets. Also
included is the federal income tax deduction from qualified U.S. production activities, which started in 2006. Qualified production activities include production of potable water, but exclude the
transmission and distribution of the potable water. The impact of the deduction is being reported in the year in which the deduction is claimed on the Company tax return. The qualified U.S.
production activities deduction QPAD is limited to the lesser of 9% of taxable income, or 50% of taxable gross wages in 2011, the lesser of 9% of taxable income, or 50% of taxable gross wages in
2010, and 6% of taxable income, or 50% of taxable wages in 2009. The QPAD lowered the income tax provision by $490, $420, and $560 in 2011, 2010, and 2009, respectively. The
Tax Relief, Unemployment Insurance Reauthorization and Job Creation Act of 2010 will provide the Company with additional federal income tax deductions for assets placed in service
after September8, 2010 and before December31, 2011. As of December31, 2011 and 2010 the deferred income tax liability for bonus depreciation was $10,500 and $6,601,
respectively.

The
current portion of our deferred income tax liability is $10,535 and $4,722 for years 2011 and 2010, respectively, which includes prepaid expenses and billed WRAM/MCBA surcharge,
expected to reverse in the following 12months. 
A
valuation allowance was not required at December31, 2011 and 2010. Based on historical taxable income and future taxable income projections over the period in which the
deferred assets are deductible, management believes it is more likely than not that the Company will realize the benefits of the deductible differences. 
The
following table reconciles the changes in unrecognized tax benefits gross:

2011  Balance at beginning of year 2,040 Additions for tax positions taken during prior year Additions for tax positions taken during current year Reductions for tax positions taken during a prior year Lapse of statute of limitations Balance at end of year 2,040 
As
of December31, 2011 and 2010, the total amount of net unrecognized tax benefits was $2,040 none of which, if recognized, would affect the Company effective tax rate. The
Company accrues interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits in its provision for income taxes. The total amount of penalties and interest was $114 as of December31, 2011 and
2010. For 2009, there were no balances or activities in unrecognized tax benefits. Additionally, the Company does not expect a material change in its unrecognized tax benefits within the next
12months.

years of 2008, 2009, 2010, and 2011 are subject to examination by the federal and state taxing authorities, respectively. The California Franchise Tax Board FTB is auditing the
Company 2008 and 2009 California income tax returns. It is uncertain when the FTB will complete its audit. The Company believes that the final resolution of the FTB audit will not have a material
impact on its financial condition or results of operations. The Company is not under audit by any other jurisdiction. 
11 EMPLOYEE BENEFIT PLANS  Savings Plan  The Company sponsors a 401k qualified, defined contribution savings plan that allows participants to contribute up to 20% of
pre-tax compensation. Effective January1, 2010, the Company matches seventy-five cents for each dollar contributed by the employee up to a maximum Company match of 60%
of base salary. In the prior year, the Company matched fifty cents for each dollar contributed up to a maximum Company match of 40% of base salary. Company contributions were $3,499, $3,232, and
$1,953, for the years 2011, 2010, and 2009, respectively.  Pension Plans  The Company provides a qualified, defined-benefit, non-contributory pension plan for substantially all employees. The
accumulated benefit obligations of the pension plan are $266,496 and $196,184 as of December31, 2011 and 2010, respectively. The fair value of pension plan assets was $155,749 and $139,034 as
of December31, 2011 and 2010, respectively. 
Prior
to 2010, pension payment obligations were generally funded by the purchase of an annuity from a life insurance company. In 2010, the pension plan trust paid monthly benefits to
retirees, rather than the purchase of an annuity. Payments are expected to be made in each year from 2012 to 2016 are
$3,558, $4,753, $5,938, $7,139, and $8,496, respectively. The aggregate benefits expected to be paid in the five years 2017 through 2021 are $65,205. The expected benefit payments are based upon the
same assumptions used to measure the Company benefit obligation at December31, 2011, and include estimated future employee service. The
Company also maintains an unfunded, non-qualified, supplemental executive retirement plan. The unfunded supplemental executive retirement plan accumulated benefit
obligations were $26,060 and $21,767 as of December31, 2011 and 2010, respectively. Benefit payments under the supplemental executive retirement plan are paid currently and are included in the
preceding paragraph. 
The
costs of the pension and retirement plans are charged to expense and utility plant. The Company makes annual contributions to fund the amounts accrued for pension cost.  Other Postretirement Plan  The Company provides substantially all active, permanent employees with medical, dental, and vision benefits through a
self-insured plan. Employees retiring at or after age 58, along with their spouses and dependents, continue participation in the plan by payment of a premium. Plan assets are invested in
mutual funds, short-term money market instruments and commercial paper based upon the same asset mix as the pension plan. Retired employees are also provided with a five thousand dollar
life insurance benefit.

The
Company records the costs of postretirement benefits other than pension PBOP during the employees' years of active service. Postretirement benefit expense recorded in 2011, 2010,
and 2009, was $6,291, $4,782, and $4,926, respectively. Prior to 2006, the Company recorded a regulatory asset for the difference between the Company-funded amount and the net periodic benefit cost.
The remaining net periodic benefit cost was $9,790 at December31, 2006, and is being recovered through future customer rates and is recorded as a regulatory asset. The expected benefit
payments, net of retiree premiums and Medicare partD subsidies, for the years from 2012 to 2016 are $1,280, $1,484, $1,684, $1,887, and $2,052, respectively. The Medicare PartD
subsidies for the years from 2012 to 2016 are $213, $242, $276, $313, and $355.  Benefit Plan Assets  The Company actively manages pensions and PBOP trust Plan assets. The Company investment objectives
are Maximize the return on the assets of the Plan, commensurate with the risk that the Company deem appropriate to, meet the
obligations of the Plan, minimize the volatility of the pension expense, and account for contingencies; 
Generate a rate of return for the total portfolio that equals or exceeds the actuarial investment rate assumption; 
Additionally, the rate of return of the total fund shall be measured periodically against a special index comprised of 35%
of the Standard Poor Index, 15% of the Russell 2000 Index, 10% of the MSCI EAFE Index, and 40% of the Lehman Aggregate Bond Index. The special index is consistent with the rate of return
objective and indicates the Company long-term asset allocation objective. The
Company applies a risk management framework for managing the risks associated with employee benefit plan trust assets. The guiding principles of this risk management framework are
the clear articulation of roles and responsibilities, appropriate delegation of authority, and proper accountability and documentation. Trust investment policies and investment manager guidelines
include provisions to ensure prudent diversification, manage risk through appropriate use of physical direct asset holdings and derivative securities, and identify permitted and prohibited
investments. 
The
Company target asset allocation percentages for major categories of the pension plan are reflected in the table below:

The
fixed income category includes money market funds, short-term bond funds, and cash. The majority of fixed income investments range in maturities from less than one to
five years.

The
Company target allocation percentages for the PBOP trust is similar to the pension plan except for an increased allocation of 18% in fixed income investments with the difference
allocated to domestic equity investments. 
We
use the following criteria to select investment funds Fund past performance; 
Fund meets criteria of Employee Retirements Income Security Act ERISA; 
Timeliness and completeness of fund communications and reporting to investors; 
Stability of fund management company; 
Fund management fees; and 
Administrative costs incurred by the Plan. The
fair value measurements standard establishes a framework for measuring fair value. That framework provides a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs to valuation techniques
used to measure fair value. The hierarchy gives the highest priority to unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities level1 measurements and the lowest
priority to unobservable inputs level3 measurements. The three levels of the fair value hierarchy under the standard are described below: Level1Inputs to the valuation methodology are unadjusted quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities in active
markets that the Plan has the ability to access. 
Level2Inputs to the valuation methodology include: Quoted market prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets;  
Quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in inactive markets;  
Inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the asset or liability; and  
Inputs that are derived principally from or corroborated by observable market data by correlation or other means. If
the asset or liability has a specified contractual term, the level2 input must be observable for substantially the full term of the asset or liability. Level3Inputs to the valuation methodology are unobservable and significant to the fair value measurement. 81

The
long-term rate of return assumption is the expected rate of return on a balanced portfolio invested roughly 60% in equities and 40% in fixed income securities. Returns on
equity
investments were estimated based on estimates of dividend yield and real earnings added to a 3% long-term inflation rate. For the pension and other benefit plans, the assumed returns were
933% for domestic equities and 96% for foreign equities. Returns on fixed-income investments were projected based on investment maturities and credit spreads added to a 3% long-term
inflation rate. For the pension and other benefit plans, the assumed returns were 510% for fixed income investments and 341% for short-term cash investments. The average return for the pension and
other benefit plans for the last five and ten years was 21% and 341%, respectively. The company is using a long-term rate or return of 700% for the pension plan and 625% for the other
benefit plan, which is between the 25thand 75th percentile of expected results. The discount rate was derived from the Citigroup Pension Discount Curve using the expected payouts for the plan.

The
health care cost trend rate assumption has a significant effect on the amounts reported. For 2011 measurement purposes, the Company assumed a 95% annual rate of increase in the per
capita cost of covered benefits with the rate decreasing to 64% by 2016, then gradually grading down to 50% over the next 50years. A one-percentage point change in assumed health
care cost trends is estimated to have the following effect:

The
Company intends to make annual contributions to the plans up to the amount deductible for tax purposes. The Company estimates in 2012 that the annual contribution to the pension
plans will be $36,518 and the annual contribution to the other postretirement plan will be $8,751.

12 STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION PLANS  The Company has two stockholder-approved stock-based compensation plans.  Long-term Incentive Plan  The long-term incentive plan was replaced on April27, 2005, by a stockholder-approved equity incentive plan. The
Long-Term Incentive Plan allowed granting of nonqualified stock options. There will be no future grants made under the Long-term Incentive Plan. The Company had accounted for
options using the intrinsic value method. Options were granted at an exercise price that was not less than the per share common stock market price on the date of grant. The options vested at a 25%
rate on their anniversary date over their first four years and are exercisable over a ten-year period. At December31, 2011, all the options under the Long-term
Incentive Plan were exercised. No options were granted under the Long-term Incentive Plan in 2011, 2010, or 2009. The
following table summarizes the awards made under the Long-Term Incentive Plan:

Equity Incentive Plan  Under the Equity Incentive Plan, which was approved by stockholders on April27, 2005, the Company is authorized to issue awards
of up to 2,000,000 shares of common stock. In 2011 and 2010, the Company granted RSAs of 85,426 and 77,956 shares, respectively, of common stock both to employees and to directors of the Company. In
2011, no RSAs were cancelled and 2,754 RSAs were cancelled in 2010. Employee awards vest ratably over 48months, while independent director awards vest at the end of 12months. The
shares were valued at the weighted average price of $1744 and $1774 per share, respectively based upon the fair market value of the Company common stock on the date of grant. In 2011, no new Stock
Appreciation Rights SARs were granted to employees. 
The
Company did not apply a forfeiture rate in the expense computation relating to SARs and RSAs issued to employees as they vest monthly and, as a result, the expense is recorded for
actual number vested during the period. For outside directors, the Company did not apply a forfeiture rate in the expense computation relating to RSAs, as the Company expects 100% to vest at the end
of 12months. 
The
SARs vest ratably over 48months and expire at the end of 10years. Upon exercise of a SAR, the appreciation is payable in common shares of the Company. The assumptions
utilized to determine the grant-date fair value of the SARs in 2009 was an expected dividend yield of 307%, expected

12 STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION PLANS Continued volatility
of 2210%, a risk-free interest rate of 284%, and an expected holding period of 675years. As of December31, 2011, there were 361,356 shares outstanding of
which 310,768 shares were exercisable at a weighted average fair value of $370. 
The
Company has recorded compensation expense for the RSAs and SARs of $1,300 and $1,077 in 2011 and 2010, respectively. The unrecognized future compensation expense for the RSAs and
SARs at December31, 2011 is $1,719. 
13 FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS  For those financial instruments for which it is practicable to estimate a fair value, the following methods and assumptions were used. For cash equivalents, accounts receivable and
accounts payable, the carrying amount approximates the fair value because of the short-term maturity of the instruments. The fair value of the Company long-term debt was
estimated at $625,202 and $536,623 as of December31, 2011 and 2010, respectively, using the published quoted market price, if available, or the discounted cash flow analysis, based on the
current rates available to the Company for debt of similar maturities and credit risk. The carrying value of the long-term debt was $481,632 and $479,181 as of December31, 2011 and
2010, respectively. The fair value of advances for construction contracts was estimated at $69,952 as of December31, 2011, and $75,602 as of December31, 2010, based on broker quotes.
The carrying value of the advances for construction contracts was $187,278 and $186,899 as of December31, 2011 and 2010, respectively. 
14 COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES  Commitments  The Company leases offices, equipment and other facilities, two water systems from cities, and has long-term commitments to

2010, and $986 in 2009. The system lease is a 15-year lease with the City of Commerce. The lease includes an annual lease payment of $845 per year plus a cost savings sharing arrangement. The
Company has a long-term contract with the Santa Clara Valley Water District that requires the Company to purchase minimum annual water quantities. Purchases are priced at
the districts

then-current
wholesale water rate. The Company operates to purchase sufficient water to equal or exceed the minimum quantities under the contract. The total paid to Santa Clara Valley Water District
was $5,524 in 2011, $5,306 in 2010, and $5,420 in 2009. 
The
Company also has a water supply contract with Stockton East Water District SEWD that requires a fixed, annual payment and does not vary during the year with the quantity of water
delivered by the district. Because of the fixed price arrangement, the Company operates to receive as much water as possible from SEWD in order to minimize the cost of operating Company-owned wells
used to supplement SEWD deliveries. The total paid under the contract was $6,658 in 2011, $6,159 in 2010, and $5,505 in 2009. Pricing under the contract varies annually. 
Estimated
annual contractual obligations in the table above are based on the same payment levels as 2011. Future increased costs by SEWD are expected to be offset by a decline in the
allocation of costs to the Company, as other customers of SEWD are expected to receive a larger allocation based upon growth of their service areas. 
On
September21, 2005, the Company entered into an agreement with Kern County Water Agency Agency to obtain treated water for the Company operations. The term of the agreement
is to January1, 2035, or until the repayment of the Agency bonds described hereafter occurs. Under the terms of the agreement, the Company is obligated to purchase approximately 17,500
acre feet of
treated water in 2012 and an incrementally higher volume of water for each subsequent year until 2017, when the Company is obligated to purchase 20,500 acre feet of treated water per year. The Company
is obligated to pay the Capital Facilities Charge and the Treated Water Charge regardless of whether it can use the water in its operation, and is obligated for these charges even if the Agency cannot
produce an adequate amount to supply the 20,500 acre feet in the year. This agreement supersedes a prior agreement with Kern County Water Agency for the supply of 11,500 acre feet of water per year.
Total annual expense in 2011 was $6,129, $5,454 in 2010, and $5,514 in 2009. 
Three
other parties, including the City of Bakersfield, are also obligated to purchase a total of 32,500 acre feet per year under separate agreements with the Agency. Further, the Agency
has the right to proportionally reduce the water supply provided to all of the participants if it cannot produce adequate supplies. The participation of all parties in the transaction for expansion of
the Agency facilities, including the Water Purification Plant, purchase of the water, and payment of interest and principal on the bonds being issued by the Agency to finance the transaction is
required as a condition to the obligation of the Agency to proceed with expansion of the Agency facilities. If any of the other parties does not use its allocation, that party is obligated to pay
its contracted amount. 
The
Agency has issued bonds to fund the project and uses the payments of the Capital Facilities Charges by the Company and the other contracted parties to meet the Agency obligations
to pay interest and repay principal on the bonds. If any of the parties were to default on making payments of the Capital Facilities Charge, then the other parties are obligated to pay for the
defaulting party share on a pro-rata basis. If there is a payment default by a party and the remaining parties have to make payments, they are also entitled to a pro-rata
share of the defaulting party water allocation.

The
Company expects to use all its entitled water in its operations every year. In addition, if the Company were to pay for and receive additional amounts of water due to a default of
another participating party; the Company believes it could use this additional water in its operations without incurring substantial incremental cost increases. If additional treated water is
available, all parties have an option to purchase this additional treated water, subject to the Agency right to allocate the water among the parties. 
The
total obligation of all parties, excluding the Company, is approximately $824million to the Agency. Based on the credit worthiness of the other participants, which are
government entities, it is believed to be highly unlikely that the Company would be required to assume any other parties' obligations under the contract due to their default. In the event of default
by a party, the Company would receive entitlement to the additional water for assuming any obligation. 
Once
the project is complete, the Company is obligated to pay a Capital Facilities Charge and charges related to treated water that together total $6,993 annually, which equates to $341
dollars per acre foot. Annual payments of $3,600 for the Capital Facilities Charge began when the Agency issued bonds to fund the project. Total treated water charge for 2011 was $2,436. Once the
entire expansion project is completed the full annual payments will be $6,993 which will continue through the term of the agreement. As treated water is being delivered, the Company is also obligated
for its portion of the operating costs; that portion is currently estimated to be $7 dollars per acre foot. The actual amount will vary due to variations from reimbursable operating cost estimates,
inflation, and other changes in the cost structure. The Company overall estimated cost of $341 dollars per acre foot is less than the estimated cost of procuring untreated water assuming water
rights could be obtained and then providing treatment. 
There
are three capital leases, the most significant was the City of Hawthorne water system. In October 2011, we entered into a new 15-year capital lease agreement to operate
the City of Hawthorne water system. The system, which is located near the Hermosa-Redondo district, serves about half of Hawthorne population. The agreement required us to make an
up-front $8,100 lease deposit to the city that is being amortized over the lease term. Additionally, annual lease payments of $940 are made to the city and shall be increased or decreased
each year on July1, by the same percentage that the rates charged to customers served by the water system increased or decreased, exclusive of pass-through increases or decreases
in the cost of water, power, and city-imposed fees, compared to the rates in effect on July1 of the prior year, provided, that in no event will the annual lease payment be less
than $940. Under the lease we are responsible for all aspects of system operation and capital improvements, although title to the system and system improvements reside with the city. In exchange, we
receive all revenue from the water system, which was $7,506, $7,547, and $6,111 in 2011, 2010, and 2009, respectively. At the end of the lease, the city is required to reimburse us for the unamortized
value of capital improvements made during the term of the lease. The annual payments were $537 in 2011, and $116 in 2010 and 2009, respectively.

14 COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES Continued  Contingencies 
Groundwater Contamination  The Company has undertaken litigation against third parties to recover past and future costs related to ground water contamination in
our service areas. The cost of litigation is expensed as incurred and any settlement is first offset against such costs. The Commission general policy require all proceeds from contamination
litigation to be used first to pay transactional expenses, then to make ratepayers whole for water treatment costs to comply with the Commission water quality standards. The Commission allows for a
risk-based consideration of contamination proceeds which exceed the costs of the remediation described above and may result in some sharing of proceeds with the shareholder, determined on
a case by case basis. The Commission has authorized various memorandum accounts that allow the Company to track significant litigation costs to request recovery of these costs in future filings and
uses of proceeds to comply with Commission general policy.  Other Legal Matters  From time to time, the Company is involved in various disputes and litigation matters that arise in the ordinary course of business.
The status of each significant matter is reviewed and assessed for potential financial exposure. If the potential loss from any claim or legal proceeding is considered probable and the amount of the
range of loss can be estimated, a liability is accrued for the estimated loss in accordance with the accounting standards for contingencies. Legal proceedings are subject to uncertainties, and the
outcomes are difficult to predict. Because of such uncertainties, accruals are based on the best information available at the time. While the outcome of these disputes and litigation matters cannot be
predicted with any certainty, management does not believe when taking into account existing reserves the ultimate resolution of these matters will materially affect the Company financial position,
results of operations, or cash flows.

Management Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures    
We maintain disclosure controls and procedures as defined in Rules13a-15e and 15d -15e under the
Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our reports filed or submitted under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as
amended, is recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the time periods specified in the Securities and Exchange Commission rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and
communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow for timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 
In
designing and evaluating the disclosure controls and procedures, management, including the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, recognized that any controls and
procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives, and management is required to apply its judgment in evaluating
the cost-benefit relationship of possible controls and procedures. Accordingly, our disclosure controls and procedures have been designed to provide reasonable assurance of achieving their
objectives. 
Our
management, with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer, evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as of
December31, 2011. Based on that evaluation, we concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective at the reasonable assurance level. 
There
was no change in our internal control over financial reporting during the quarter ended December31, 2011, that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to
materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. 
Management Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting

Rule13a-15f and 15d-15f under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. Management assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial
reporting as of December31, 2011. In making this assessment, management used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring

financial reporting is effective based on these criteria. Our independent registered public accounting firm, Deloitte ToucheLLP, has audited the effectiveness of our internal control
