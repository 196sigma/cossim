REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM  To the Stockholders and Board of Directors of Omega Protein Corporation:  We have completed integrated audits of Omega Protein Corporations 2005 and 2004 consolidated financial statements and
of its internal control over financial reporting as of December31, 2005 and an audit of its 2003 consolidated financial statements in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board United States. Our opinions,
based on our audits, are presented below.  Consolidated financial
statements and financial statement schedule  In our
opinion, the consolidated financial statements listed in the indexappearing in a1 present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Omega Protein Corporation and its subsidiaries at December31, 2005 and
2004, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December31, 2005, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. In addition, in our
opinion, the financial statement schedule listed in the index appearing in a1 presents fairly, in all material respects, the information set forth therein when read in conjunction with the related consolidated financial statements.
These financial statements and financial statement schedule are the responsibility of the Companys management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements and financial statement schedule based on our audits. We
conducted our audits of these statements in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board United States. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the
financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit of financial statements includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and
significant estimates made by management, and evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.  Internal control over financial reporting  Also, in our opinion, managements assessment, included in Managements Report on Internal Control Over
Financial Reporting appearing under item 9A, that the Company maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of December31, 2005 based on criteria established in Internal ControlIntegrated Framework issued
by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission COSO is fairly stated, in all material respects, based on those criteria. Furthermore, in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective
internal control over financial reporting as of December31, 2005, based on criteria established in Internal ControlIntegrated Framework issued by the COSO. The Companys management is responsible for maintaining effective
internal control over financial reporting and for their assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting. Our responsibility is to express opinions on managements assessment andon the effectiveness of the
Companys internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We conducted our audit of internal control over financial reporting in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board United States. Those
standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. An audit of internal control over financial reporting
includes obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, evaluating managements assessment, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control, and performing such other procedures as we
consider necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinions.  A companys internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial
reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A companys internal control over financial reporting 
37 Index to Financial Statements
includes those policies and procedures that ipertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the
transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; iiprovide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles,
and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and iiiprovide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized
acquisition, use, or disposition of the companys assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.  Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any
evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.  PRICEWATERHOUSECOOPERS LLP  New Orleans, Louisiana March10, 2006

OMEGA PROTEIN CORPORATION  NOTES
TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  NOTE
1.SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES SUMMARY OF OPERATIONS AND BASIS OF PRESENTATION  Business Description  Omega Protein Corporation Omega or the Company produces and markets a variety of products produced
from menhaden a herring-like species of fish found in commercial quantities in the U.S. coastal waters of the Atlantic Ocean and Gulf of Mexico, including regular grade and value-added specialty fish meals, crude and refined fish oils and fish
solubles. The Companys fish meal products are primarily used as a protein ingredient in animal feed for swine, cattle, aquaculture and household pets. Fish oil is utilized for animal and aquaculture feeds, industrial applications, as well as
for additives to human food products and dietary supplements. The Companys fish solubles are sold primarily to livestock feed manufacturers, aquaculture feed manufacturers and for use as an organic fertilizer.  Consolidation  The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Omega and its wholly owned subsidiaries. All significant
intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.  Financial Statement Preparation  The
preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and
disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the Companys financial statements and the accompanying notes and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual amounts, when available, could
differ from those estimates and those differences could have a material affect on the financial statements.  The Company has reclassified certain amounts previously reported to conform with the presentation at December31, 2005.  Hurricane Losses  On August29, 2005, the Companys Moss Point, Mississippi fish processing facility and adjacent shipyard were
severely damaged by Hurricane Katrina. On September25, 2005, the Companys Cameron, Louisiana and Abbeville, Louisiana fish processing facilities were also severely damaged by Hurricane Rita. Each of these facilities was non-operational
immediately after these weather events. Operations at the Moss Point fish processing facility, the Abbeville fish processing facility and the shipyard were re-established in mid-October, 2005, but at reduced processing capabilities. The Company is
currently rebuilding its Cameron, Louisiana facility and expects it to be fully operational by mid 2006.  The direct impact of the two hurricanes upon the Company was a loss of physical inventories and physical damage to the plants. The interruption of
processing capabilities caused the Company to address the impact of abnormal downtime of its processing facilities, which resulted in the immediate recognition of costs which would ordinarily have been captured as inventory costs. The amounts of
these losses are more fully described in Notes 2, 3, 5 and 12.  The Company maintains insurance coverage for a variety of these damages, most notably property, inventory and vessel insurance. The nature and extent of the insurance coverage varies by line of policy and the Company has recorded insurance
recoveries as accounts receivable based on estimates. The Company anticipates 
43 Index to Financial Statements OMEGA PROTEIN CORPORATION  NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTSContinued 
that further recoveries could be available, but such additional recoveries will require further analysis and discussions with the Companys insurance
carriers. Such recoveries, if any, would be recognized in future periods once they are deemed probable. The Company does not maintain business interruption insurance in any material amounts.  Revenue Recognition  The Company derives revenue principally from the sales of a variety of protein and oil products derived from menhaden. The
Company recognizes revenue for the sale of its products when title and rewards of ownership to its products are transferred to the customer.  Cash and Cash Equivalents  The Company considers cash in banks and short-term investments with original maturities of three months or less as cash and cash equivalents. 
Allowances for Doubtful Accounts  The Company maintains allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses
resulting from the inability of the Companys customers to make required payments. The Company considers the following factors when determining if collection is reasonably assured: customer credit worthiness, past transaction history with the
customer, and changes in customer payment terms. If the Company has no previous experience with the customer, the Company typically obtains reports from credit organizations to ensure that the customer has a history of paying its creditors. The
Company may also request financial information, including financial statements or other documents e.g., bank statements, or may obtain a letter of credit from the customer to ensure that the customer has the means of making payment. If the
financial condition of the Companys customers were to deteriorate, adversely affecting their ability to make payments, additional allowances would be required.  Inventories  Inventory is stated at the lower of cost or market. The Companys fishing season runs from mid-April to the first of November in the Gulf of Mexico
and from the beginning of May into December in the Atlantic. Government regulations generally preclude the Company from fishing during the off-seasons.  The Companys inventory cost system considers all costs associated with an annual fish catch and its processing, both variable and fixed, including
both costs incurred during the off-season and during the fishing season. The Companys costing system allocates cost to inventory quantities on a per unit basis as calculated by a formula that considers total estimated inventoriable costs for a
fishing season including off-season costs to total estimated fish catch and the relative fair market value of the individual products produced. The Company adjusts the cost of sales, off-season costs and inventory balances at the end of each
quarter based on revised estimates of total inventoriable costs and fish catch. The Companys lower-of-cost-or-market-value analyses at year-end and at interim periods compare the total estimated per unit production cost of the Companys
expected production to the projected per unit market prices of the products. The impairment analyses involve estimates of, among other things, future fish catches and related costs, and expected commodity prices for the fish products as well as
projected purchase commitments from customers. These estimates, which management believes are reasonable and supportable, involve estimates of future activities and events which are inherently imprecise and from which actual results may differ
materially. 
44 Index to Financial Statements OMEGA PROTEIN CORPORATION  NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTSContinued 
Any costs incurred during abnormal downtime related to activity at the Companys plants are
charged to expense as incurred.  During the off-seasons, in
connection with the upcoming fishing seasons, the Company incurs costs i.e., plant and vessel related labor, utilities, rent, repairs, and depreciation that are directly related to the Companys infrastructure. These costs accumulate in
inventory and are applied as elements of the cost of production of the Companys products throughout the fishing season ratably based on the Companys monthly fish catch and the expected total fish catch for the season.  Insurance  The Company carries insurance for certain losses relating to its vessels and Jones Act liabilities for employees aboard its
vessels. The Company provides reserves for those portions of the Annual Aggregate Deductible for which the Company remains responsible by using an estimation process that considers Company-specific and industry data as well as managements
experience, assumptions and consultation with counsel, as these reserves include estimated settlement costs. Managements current estimated range of liabilities related to such cases is based on claims for which management can estimate the
amount and range of loss. For those claims where there may be a range of loss, the Company has recorded an estimated liability inside that range, based on managements experience, assumptions and consultation with counsel. The process of
estimating and establishing reserves for these claims is inherently uncertain and the actual ultimate net cost of a claim may vary materially from the estimated amount reserved. There is some degree of inherent variability in assessing the ultimate
amount of losses associated with these claims due to the extended period of time that transpires between when the claim might occur and the full settlement of such claims. This variability is generally greater for Jones Act claims by vessel
employees. The Company continually evaluates loss estimates associated with claims and losses as additional information becomes available and revises its estimates. Although management believes estimated reserves related to these claims are
adequately recorded, it is possible that actual results could significantly differ from the recorded reserves, which could materially impact the Companys results of operations, financial position and cash flow.  The Company is primarily self-insured for health insurance. The Company
purchases individual stop loss coverage with a large deductible. As a result, the Company is primarily self-insured for claims and associated costs up to the amount of the deductible, with claims in excess of the deductible amount being covered by
insurance. Expected claims estimates are based on health care trend rates and historical claims data; actual claims may differ from those estimates. The Company evaluates its claims experience related to this coverage with information obtained from
its risk management consultants.  Assumptions used in preparing
these insurance estimates are based on factors such as claims settlement patterns, claim development trends, claim frequency and severity patterns, inflationary trends and data reasonableness. Together these factors will generally affect the
analysis and determination of the best estimate of the projected ultimate claim losses. The results of these evaluations are used to both analyze and adjust the Companys insurance loss reserves.  Advertising Costs  The costs of advertising are expensed as incurred in accordance with Statement of Position 93-7 Reporting on
Advertising Costs.  Research and Development  Costs incurred in research and development activities are expensed as
incurred. 
45 Index to Financial Statements OMEGA PROTEIN CORPORATION  NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTSContinued 
Accounting for the Impairment of Long-Lived Assets  The Company evaluates at each balance sheet date for continued
appropriateness of the carrying value of its long-lived assets including its long-term receivables and property, plant and equipment in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards SFAS No144, Accounting for
the Impairment or Disposals of Long-Lived Assets. The Company reviews long-lived assets for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of any such assets or grouping of assets may not be recoverable.
The Company has grouped certain assets together primarily marine vessels for impairment testing on a fleet basis. If indicators of impairment are present, management evaluates the undiscounted cash flows estimated to be generated by those assets
or grouping of assets compared to the carrying amount of those items. The net carrying value of assets or grouping of assets not recoverable is reduced to fair value. The Company considers continued operating losses, or significant and long-term
changes in business conditions, to be its primary indicators of potential impairment.  Income Taxes  The Company utilizes the
liability method to account for income taxes. This method requires the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of existing temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax reporting
basis of assets and liabilities, and operating loss and tax credits carryforwards for tax purposes. The Company records a valuation allowance to reduce the deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized. The Company
believes that the deferred tax recorded as of December31, 2005 is realizable through future reversals of existing taxable temporary differences and future taxable income. If the Company were to subsequently determine that we would be able to
realize deferred tax assets in the future in excess of the net recorded amount, an adjustment to deferred tax assets would increase earnings for the period in which such determination was made. The Company will continue to assess the adequacy of the
valuation allowance on a quarterly basis. Any changes to the estimated valuation allowance could be material to the consolidated financial condition and results of operations.  Property, Equipment and Depreciation  Property and equipment additions are recorded at cost. Depreciation of property and equipment is computed by the straight-line method at rates expected to
amortize the cost of property and equipment, net of salvage value, over their estimated useful lives. Estimated useful lives, determined at the date of acquisition, of new assets acquired are based primarily on the review of existing property and
equipment. Estimated useful lives are as follows:  UsefulLivesyears
Fishing vessels and fish processing plants
15-20
Machinery, equipment, furniture and fixtures and other
3-10
Replacements and major
improvements are capitalized and amortized over a period of 5 to 15 years; maintenance and repairs are charged to expense as incurred. Upon sale or retirement, the costs and related accumulated depreciation are eliminated from the accounts. Any
resulting gains or losses are included in the statement of operations. The Company capitalizes interest as part of the acquisition cost of a qualifying asset. 
Interest is capitalized only during the period of time required to complete and prepare the asset for its intended use. For the years ended
December31, 2005 and 2004, the Company capitalized approximately $180,000 and $323,000, respectively, of interest. 
46 Index to Financial Statements OMEGA PROTEIN CORPORATION  NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTSContinued 
Pension Plans  Annual costs of pension plans are determined actuarially based on SFAS No87, Employers Accounting for Pensions. The
Companys policy is to fund U.S. pension plans at amounts not less than the minimum requirements of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 and generally for obligations under its foreign plans to deposit funds with trustees under
insurance policies. The Company applies the disclosure requirement of revised SFAS No132, Employers Disclosures about Pensions and Other Postretirement Benefits for its pensions and other postretirement benefit plans.
In 2002, the Board of Directors authorized a plan to freeze
the Companys pension plan in accordance with ERISA rules and regulations so that new employees, hired after July31, 2002, will not be eligible to participate in the pension plan and further benefits will no longer accrue for existing
participants. The freezing of the pension plan had the effect of vesting all existing participants in their pension benefits in the plan.  Comprehensive loss  Comprehensive loss is defined as change in equity of a business enterprise during a period from transactions and other events and circumstances from
non-owner sources, including foreign currency translation adjustments and minimum pension liability adjustments. The Company presents comprehensive loss in its consolidated statements of stockholders equity. The change in equity for minimum
pension liability adjustment results from an increase in the minimum pension liability and an increase in prepaid pension cost presented net of tax.  The components of other comprehensive loss included in shareholders equity are as follows:  Years EndedDecember31 2005 2004 in thousands Cumulative Translation Adjustments 30 43 Minimum Pension Liability Adjustments, net of tax 7,588 6,750 Accumulated Other Comprehensive Loss 7,618 6,793  Foreign Currency Translation
The Companys Mexican operations use the local
currency as the functional currency. Assets and liabilities of those operations are translated into U.S. dollars using period-end exchange rates; income and expenses are translated using the average exchange rates for the reporting period.
Translation adjustments are deferred in accumulated other comprehensive income loss, a separate component of stockholders equity.  Concentrations of Credit Risk  Financial instruments that potentially subject the Company to concentrations of credit risk consist principally of cash and trade accounts receivable. The
Companys customer base generally remains consistent from year to year. The Company performs ongoing credit evaluations of its customers and generally does not require material collateral. The Company maintains reserves for potential credit
losses and such losses have historically been within managements expectations.  At December31, 2005 and 2004, the Company had cash deposits concentrated primarily in one major bank. In addition, the Company had Certificates of Deposit and commercial quality grade investments A2P2 rated or
better with companies and financial institutions. As a result of the foregoing, the Company believes that credit risk in such investments is minimal. 
47 Index to Financial Statements OMEGA PROTEIN CORPORATION  NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTSContinued 
Earnings per Share 
Basic earnings per common share EPS was computed by dividing net earnings by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the
reporting period. Diluted EPS reflects the dilution that could occur if securities or contracts to issue common stock were exercised or converted into common stock or resulted in the issuance of common stock that then shared in the earnings of the
Company. Diluted earnings per common share was computed by dividing net earnings by the sum of the weighted average number of common shares outstanding plus the number of additional common shares that would have been outstanding if the dilutive
potential common shares in this case, exercise of the Companys employee stock options had been issued during each period as discussed in Note 7.  Recently Issued Accounting Standards  In November 2004, the Financial Accounting Standards Boards FASB issued SFAS No151, Inventory Costs. The statement amends
Accounting Research Bulletin ARB No43, Inventory Pricing, to clarify the accounting for abnormal amounts of idle facility expense, freight, handling costs, and wasted material. ARB No43 previously stated that
these costs must be so abnormal as to require treatment as current-period charges, SFAS No151 requires that those items be recognized as current-period charges regardless of whether they meet the criterion of so
abnormal. In addition, this statement requires that allocation of fixed production overhead to the costs of conversion be based on the normal capacity of the production facilities. The statement is effective for inventory costs incurred during
fiscal years beginning after June15, 2005, with earlier application permitted for fiscal years beginning after the issue date of the statement. The adoption of SFAS No151 is not expected to have any impact on the Companys current
financial condition or results of operations.  In December
2004, the FASB issued SFAS No153, Exchanges of Nonmonetary AssetsAn Amendment of APB Opinion No29. APB Opinion No29, Accounting for Nonmonetary Transactions, is based on the opinion that exchanges
of nonmonetary assets should be measured based on the fair value of the assets exchanged. SFAS No153 amends Opinion No29 to eliminate the exception for nonmonetary exchanges of similar productive assets and replaces it with a general
exception for exchanges on nonmonetary assets whose results are not expected to significantly change the future cash flows of the entity. SFAS No153 is effective for the Company beginning fiscal 2006. The adoption of SFAS No153 is not
expected to have a material impact on the Companys current financial condition, results of operations or cash flow.  In December 2004, the FASB revised its SFAS No123 SFAS No123R, Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation. The
revision establishes standards for the accounting of transactions in which an entity exchanges its equity instruments for goods or services, particularly transactions in which an entity obtains employee services in share-based payment transactions.
The revised statement requires a public entity to measure the cost of employee services received in exchange for an award of equity instruments based on the grant-date fair value of the award. The cost is to be recognized over the period during
which the employee is required to provide service in exchange for the award. Changes in fair value during the requisite service period are to be recognized as compensation cost over that period. In addition, the revised statement amends SFAS
No95, Statement of Cash Flows, to require that excess tax benefits be reported as a financing cash flow rather than as a reduction of taxes paid. The provisions of the revised statement are effective for financial statements
issued for the annual reporting period beginning after June15, 2005, with early adoption encouraged. Based on the options not vested as of December31, 2005, the adoption of SFAS No123R is not expected to have a material impact on
the Companys current financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. See the Stock-Based Compensation section of this note for the estimated impact of this statement on our consolidated results.  In March 2005, the SEC issued Staff Accounting Bulletin SAB
No107 regarding the Staffs interpretation of SFAS No123R. This interpretation provides the Staffs views regarding interactions between 
48 Index to Financial Statements OMEGA PROTEIN CORPORATION  NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTSContinued 
SFAS No123R and certain SEC rules and regulations and provides interpretations of the valuation of share-based payments for public companies. The
interpretive guidance is intended to assist companies in applying the provisions of SFAS No123R and investors and users of the financial statements in analyzing the information provided. We will follow the guidance prescribed in SAB
No107 in connection with our adoption of SFAS No123R.  In March 2005, the FASB issued Interpretation FIN No47, Accounting for Conditional Asset Retirement Obligationsan Interpretation of FASB Statement No143. This interpretation clarifies the timing
of liability recognition for legal obligations associated with an asset retirement when the timing and or method of settling the obligation are conditional on a future event that may or may not be within the control of the entity. FIN No47
is effective no later than the end of fiscal years ending after December15, 2005. The adoption of FIN No47 did not have a material impact on the Companys financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.  In May 2005, the FASB issued SFAS No154, Accounting Changes and
Error CorrectionsA replacement of APB Opinion No20 and FASB Statement No30 SFAS 154. SFAS 154 replaces APB Opinion No20, Accounting Changes, and SFAS No3, Reporting Accounting
Changes in Interim Financial Statements, and changes the requirements for the accounting for, and reporting of, a change in accounting principles. This statement applies to all voluntary changes in accounting principles and changes required by
an accounting pronouncement in the unusual instance that the pronouncement does not include specific transition provisions. Under previous guidance, changes in accounting principle were recognized as a cumulative affect in the net income of the
period of the change. SFAS 154 requires retrospective application of changes in accounting principle, limited to the direct effects of the change, to prior periods financial statements, unless it is impracticable to determine either the
period-specific effects or the cumulative effect of the change. Additionally, this Statement requires that a change in depreciation, amortization or depletion method for long-lived, nonfinancial assets be accounted for as a change in accounting
estimate affected by a change in accounting principle and that correction of errors in previously issued financial statements should be termed a restatement. The provisions in SFAS 154 are effective for accounting changes and correction
of errors made in fiscal years beginning after December15, 2005, which is effective with our first quarter of our fiscal 2006. We intend to adopt the disclosure requirements upon the effective date of the pronouncement. We do not believe that
the adoption of this pronouncement will have a material effect on our consolidated financial position, result of operations or cash flows.  Stock-Based Compensation  At December31, 2005, the Company had a stock-based employee compensation plan, which is described in more detail in Note 11. The Company accounts
for this plan under the recognition and measurement principles of Accounting Principles Board APB Opinion No25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees and has adopted the disclosure-only provisions of SFAS
No123, Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation and SFAS No148, Accounting for Stock-Based CompensationTransition and Disclosurean Amendment of FASB Statement No123. No compensation cost
related to stock options is reflected in net earnings, as all options granted under this plan had an exercise price equal to or greater than the fair value of the underlying common stock on the grant date. The FASB issued SFAS No123R in
December 2004, which is effective for the Company in the first quarter of fiscal year 2006. The following table illustrates the effect on net earnings and net earnings per share if the Company had applied the fair value recognition provisions of
SFAS No123 to stock-based employee compensation.  On
May5, 2005, the Company accelerated the vesting of all unvested, out-of-the-money, explicit service period stock options granted under the Companys 2000 Long-Term Incentive Plan. The purpose of accelerating vesting was to eliminate
future compensation expense that the Company would otherwise recognize in its 
49 Index to Financial Statements OMEGA PROTEIN CORPORATION  NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTSContinued 
Statement of Operations with respect to these accelerated stock options upon the adoption by the Company of SFAS No123R. A stock option was considered
out-of-the-money if the stock option exercise price was greater than $604 which was the closing price of the Companys common stock on the New York Stock Exchange on May5, 2005. As a result of this action, stock options to
purchase 390,000 shares of the Companys common stock became immediately exercisable. The vesting created a modification of stock options; however, there was no impact on the fair value of the options. The weighted average exercise price of all
the accelerated stock options was $998.  For purposes of pro
forma disclosures, the estimated fair value of stock options is assumed to be amortized to expense over the stock options vesting periods. The pro forma effects of recognizing compensation expense under the fair value method on net income
loss and net earnings loss per common share for the years ended December31, 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively, were as follows in thousands, except per share amounts:  2005 2004 2003 Net income loss, as reported 7,186 3,202 5,798 Add: Stock-based employee compensation expense included in reported net income, net of related tax benefits Deduct: Stock-based employee compensation expense determined under the fair value based method for all awards, net of related tax

The Company carries insurance for certain losses relating to its vessels and Jones Act liability for
employees aboard its vessels collectively, Vessel Claims Insurance. The typical Vessel Claims Insurance policy contains an annual aggregate deductible AAD for which the Company remains responsible, while the insurance
carrier is responsible for all applicable amounts which exceed the AAD. It is the Companys policy to accrue current amounts due and record amounts paid out on each claim. Once payments exceed the AAD, the Company records an insurance
receivable for a given policy year, net of allowance for doubtful accounts. As of December31, 2005 and 2004, the allowance for doubtful insurance receivable accounts was $20 million.  NOTE 5.PROPERTY AND EQUIPMENT  Property and equipment as of December31, 2005 and 2004 are summarized

52 Index to Financial Statements OMEGA PROTEIN CORPORATION  NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTSContinued 
certain of the Companys fishing vessels and mortgages on the Companys Reedville, Virginia and Abbeville, Louisiana plants. Loans are now
available under similar terms pursuant to the Title XI program without intervening lenders.  In September 2004, the United States Department of Commerce Fisheries Finance Program the FFP approved the Companys financing application in an amount not to exceed $14 million the Approval
Letter. Borrowings under the Approval Letter are to be used to finance and/or refinance approximately 73% of the actual depreciable cost of the Companys future fishing vessels refurbishments and capital expenditures relating to
shore-side fishing assets, for a term not to exceed 15 years from inception at interest rates determined by the U.S. Treasury. Final approval for all such future projects requires individual approval through the Secretary of Commerce, National
Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, and National Marine Fisheries Service National Marine Fisheries Service. Borrowings under the FFP are required to be evidenced by secured agreements, undertakings, and other documents of
whatsoever nature deemed by the National Marine Fisheries Service sole discretion, as necessary to accomplish the intent and purpose of the Approval Letter. The Company is required to comply with customary National Marine Fisheries Service covenants
as well as certain special covenants. In December 2004, the Company submitted a $49 million financing request against the $14 million approval, and subsequently amended that request to include the entire $14 million. The Company closed on the $14
million FFP loan on October17, 2005. On December1, 2005, pursuant to the Title XI program, the United States Department of Commerce approved another financing application made by the Company in the amount of $164 million.  On December20, 2000 the Company entered into a $20 million revolving
credit agreement with Bank of America, N.A. the Credit Facility. Borrowings under this facility may be used for working capital and capital expenditures. The Credit Facility was amended on October11, 2005, to increase the amount
of Title XI loans that the Company is permitted to borrow from $25 million to $31 million. The Credit Facility was further amended on November16, 2005, to among other things, extend the term of the Credit Facility from December20, 2006
to October31, 2007, decrease the maximum borrowing availability tied to the Companys eligible inventory from $12 million to $10 million, add a covenant that the Company may not generate a net loss for any two consecutive quarters,
increase the Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio to be less than 125 to 1, as measured on a quarterly basis using the consolidated results of the four fiscal quarter period ending with the applicable reporting period and reduce both the unused commitment
fee and interest rates. A commitment fee of 375 basis points per annum is payable quarterly on the actual daily amount of the availability under the Credit Facility. The applicable interest rate will be adjusted up or down prospectively on a
quarterly basis from LIBOR plus 200% to LIBOR plus 250% or at the Companys option, Prime minus 050% to Prime plus 000%, depending upon the Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio being greater than 25 times to less than or equal to 15 times,
respectively. The Credit Facility is collateralized by all of the Companys trade receivables, inventory and equipment. In addition, the Credit Facility does not allow for the payment of cash dividends or stock repurchases.  As of December31, 2005, the Company was out of compliance with the
Minimum Net Income covenant in the Credit Facility due to its reporting of net losses for two consecutive quarters third and fourth quarters of 2005. The Company notified the lender of the covenant non-compliance and received a waiver from the
lender.  As of December31, 2005, the Company was out of
compliance with the Ratio of Earnings to Fixed Charges covenant in the Credit Facility. The Company notified the lender of the covenant non-compliance and received a waiver from the lender.  As of December31, 2005, the Company had no borrowings outstanding under
the Credit Facility. At December31, 2005 and 2004, the Company had outstanding letters of credit under the Credit Facility totaling approximately $80 million and $27 million, respectively, issued in support of workers compensation
insurance programs in 2005 and 2004 and to purchase fish meal from a third party in 2005.

The American Jobs Creation Act of 2004 the Act
provides a deduction for income from qualified domestic production activities, which will be phased in from 2005 through 2010. In return, the Act also provides for a two-year phase-out of the existing extra-territorial income exclusion ETI for
foreign sales that was viewed to be inconsistent with international trade protocols by the European Union.  Under the guidance in FASB Staff Position No. FAS 109-1, Application of FASB Statement No109, Accounting for Income Taxes, to the Tax
Deduction on Qualified Production Activities Provided by the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004, the deduction will be treated as a special deduction as described in FASB Statement No109. As such, the special deduction has no
effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities existing at the enactment date. Rather, the impact of this deduction will be reported in the period in which the deduction is claimed on our tax return.  The Company has sufficient net operating loss carryforwards NOLs that will
fully offset near term future taxable income. Because of the NOL carryforward the Company will not be entitled to the special deduction because the deduction is based on taxable income after taking into account NOLs. Therefore, the Companys
near term effective tax rate will not reflect any benefit for the special deduction.

on employee contributions and compensation. The Company suspended its matching contributions to the Plan for 2001. In 2002, the Board of Directors authorized
the reinstatement of the Companys matching cash contribution to the Plan, effective January1, 2002, at levels previously in place prior to the suspension of the match in 2001. The Companys matching contributions to the Plan were
approximately $715,000, $660,000 and $553,000 during 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively.  NOTE 11.PENSION AND STOCK OPTION PLANS  Pension Plan  The Company has a pension plan
covering substantially all employees. Plan benefits are generally based on an employees years of service and compensation level. The plan has adopted an excess benefit formula integrated with covered compensation. Participants are 100% vested
in the accrued benefit after five years of service.  In 2002,
the Board of Directors authorized a plan to freeze the Companys pension plan in accordance with ERISA rules and regulations so that new employees, after July31, 2002, will not be eligible to participate in the pension plan and further
benefits will no longer accrue for existing participants. The freezing of the pension plan had the affect of vesting all existing participants in their pension benefits in the plan.  Unrecognized transition assets of $52 million were amortized over 15 years. The Companys pension plan is subject to
the additional minimum liability requirements of SFAS No87, which requires the recognition of an additional pension liability in the amount of Omegas unfunded accumulated benefit obligation in excess of accrued pension cost with an
equal amount to be recognized net of the associated tax benefits in accumulated other comprehensive loss. Based upon plan actuarial and asset information, the Company computed an additional pension liability of $115 million and $102 million in
2005 and 2004, respectively. Amounts listed as minimum pension liability adjustments under the caption Comprehensive Loss Income on the Consolidated Statements of Stockholders Equity of $08 million, $09 million and $28
million for 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively, represent the change, net of tax, in the portion of the additional pension liability recorded under Accumulated Other Comprehensive Loss on the Consolidated Balance Sheet.  The Companys funding policy is to make contributions as required by
applicable regulations. The Company uses a December31 measurement date for its pension plan. The accumulated benefit obligation for the pension plan was $270 and $261 million at December31, 2005 and 2004, respectively. The unrecognized
net loss of $115 million at December31, 2005 is expected to be reduced by future Company contributions to the plan, future returns on plan assets and through decreases in future net pension credits.

The Company, in consultations with its actuarial firm, employs a building block approach in
determining the assumed long-term rate of return for plan assets. The Company reviews historical market data and long-term historical relationships between equities and fixed income in accordance with the widely-accepted capital market principle
that assets with higher volatility generally generate greater returns over the long run. The Company also evaluates current market factors such as inflation and interest rates before it determines long-term capital market assumptions. After taking
into account diversification of asset classes and the need to periodically re-balance asset classes, the Company establishes the assumed long-term portfolio rate of return by a building block approach. The Company also reviews peer data and
historical returns to check its long-term rate of return for reasonability and appropriateness.  A change in the assumed discount rate creates a deferred actuarial gain or loss. Generally, when the assumed discount rate decreases compared to the prior
measurement date, a deferred actuarial loss is created. When the assumed discount rate increases compared to the prior measurement date, a deferred actuarial gain is created. Actuarial gains and losses also are created when actual results differ
from assumptions. The net of the deferred gains and losses are amortized to pension expense over the average service life of the remaining plan participants, when it exceeds certain thresholds defined in SFAS No. 87. This approach to amortization of
gains and losses has the effect of reducing the volatility of pension expense attributable to investment returns and liability experience. Over time, it is not expected to reduce or increase the pension expense relative to an approach that
immediately recognizes losses and gains.  As a result of the
annual review of assumptions, the Companys expected return on plan assets remained consistent at 85% and the discount rate decreased from 575% to 550%. The Company uses the Citigroup Pension Liability Index as a proxy for determining the
discount rate applied to its pension plans, with a slight downward adjustment of 005%. The use of the Citigroup Pension Liability Index as a proxy is considered to be proper because of the comparability of the Companys pension plans
expected future cash flows to the expected future cash flows of the Citigroup Pension Liability Index.  Years EndedDecember31 Assumptions

Expected Contributions during 2006
The Company expects to make contributions of $26 million
to the pension plan in 2006.  Stock Option Plans  On January26, 1998, the 1998 Long-Term Incentive Plan of the Company
the 1998 Incentive Plan was approved by the Companys Board. The 1998 Incentive Plan provides for the grant of any or all of the following types of awards: stock options, stock appreciation rights, stock awards and cash awards.
These options generally vest ratably over three years from the date of grant and expire ten years from the date of grant.  On January26, 1998, the Non-Management Director Stock Option Plan the Directors Plan was approved by the Board. The Directors Plan
provides that the initial Chairman of the Board be granted options to purchase 568,200 shares of the Common Stock and each other initial non-employee director of the Company will be granted options to purchase 14,200 shares of Common Stock at a
price determined by the Board.  On June27, 2000, the 1998
Incentive Plan and the Director Plan were amended and restated in their entirety and renamed the 2000 Long-Term Incentive Plan 2000 Incentive Plan, and the 2000 Incentive Plan was 
60 Index to Financial Statements OMEGA PROTEIN CORPORATION  NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTSContinued 
approved by the Companys stockholders. Under the 2000 Incentive Plan, the Company is authorized to issue shares of Common Stock pursuant to
Awards granted in various forms, including incentive stock options intended to qualify under Section422 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, non-qualified stock options, and other similar stock-based Awards. The
substantive changes from the 1998 Incentive Plan and the Directors Plan in the amendment and restatement of the 2000 Incentive Plan were athe 2000 Incentive Plan allows annual option grant awards of 10,000 shares to each non-employee
Director and bthe 2000 Incentive Plan allows for the aggregate number of option shares available for issuance under the plan to equal 25% of the number of shares of common stock outstanding at any time with an absolute maximum of no more
than 15million shares available for awards at any time. Reference is made to the Companys 2000 proxy statement for a complete summary of all the differences among the three plans.  The Company granted stock options in 2003, 2004 and 2005 under the Plan and
its predecessor plans in the form of non-qualified stock options. The Company records compensation expense for employee stock options based upon their intrinsic value on the date of grant pursuant to Accounting Principles Board Opinion 25 APB 25,
Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees. Because the Company establishes the exercise price based on the fair market value of the Companys stock at the date of grant, the stock options have no intrinsic value upon grant, and
therefore no expense is recorded. Each quarter, the Company reports the potential dilutive impact of stock option in its diluted earnings per common share using the treasury-stock method. Out-of-the-money stock options i.e., the average stock price
during the period is below the strike price of the stock option are not included in diluted earnings per common share.  As required under Financial Accounting Standards Board Statement No123 FAS 123, Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation, and
Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No148 FAS 148, Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation-Transition and Disclosure, the pro forma effects of stock-based compensation on net income and earnings per common share have
been estimated at the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model based on the following assumptions:  Stock Option Plans 2005 2004 2003 Risk-free interest rate
423 37 34 Volatility
6146 582 664 Dividend yield
00 00 00 Expected life years
50 50 50
The Black-Scholes
option-pricing model was developed for use in estimating the fair value of traded options that have no restrictions and are fully transferable and negotiable in a free trading market. The Black-Scholes model does not consider the employment,
transfer or vesting restrictions that are inherent in the Companys employee stock options. Use of an option valuation model, as required by FAS 123, includes highly subjective assumptions based on long-term predictions, including the expected
stock price volatility and average life of each stock option grant. Because the Companys employee stock options have characteristics significantly different from those of freely traded options, and because changes in the subjective input
assumptions can materially affect the Companys estimate of the fair value of those stock options, in the Companys opinion, existing valuation models, including Black-Scholes, are not reliable single measures and may misstate the fair
value of the Companys employee stock options. The Black-Scholes weighted average estimated fair values of stock options granted during fiscal 2005, 2004 and 2003 were $495, $540 and $333 per share, respectively.  The effects of applying SFAS No123 in this pro forma disclosure are
not indicative of future amounts. SFAS No123 does not apply to awards prior to 1995, and the Company anticipates making awards in the future under its stock-based compensation plans.

The Company has adopted the disclosure-only provisions of SFAS No123, Accounting for
Stock-Based Compensation, and continues to apply APB Opinion No25 and related interpretations in accounting for its stock-based compensation plans. The following table is a summary of the Companys stock options outstanding as of
December31, 2005, 2004 and 2003, and the changes that occurred during fiscal years 2005, 2004 and 2003.  NumberofOptions WeightedAverageExercise Price in thousands

NOTE 12.HURRICANE LOSSES  On August29, 2005, the Companys Moss Point, Mississippi fish
processing facility and adjacent shipyard were severely damaged by Hurricane Katrina. On September24, 2005, the Companys Cameron, Louisiana and the Abbeville, Louisiana fish processing facilities were also severely damaged by Hurricane
Rita. Each of these facilities was non-operational immediately after these weather related events. For the year ended December31, 2005, the following amounts have been recognized in the Companys statement of operations:  Damaged fish meal inventory 2,496,000 Write-off of other materials and supplies 1,648,000 Write-off of unallocated inventory cost pool 12,978,000 Involuntary conversion of property and equipment 8,324,000 Idle plant costs recognized as period expense 1,038,000 Clean-up costs incurred 1,259,000 Estimated insurance recoveries 12,000,000 Estimated damages in excess of insurance recoveries 15,743,000  A substantial portion
of the amounts listed above are based upon estimates and assumptions. Actual amounts, when available, could differ materially from those estimates and changes to those estimates could have a material affect on the Companys future financial
statements.  Not included in the amounts listed in the above
table are the replacement capital costs of property and equipment, which did not have any book basis and were destroyed in the hurricanes, and the costs of clean up incurred subsequent to December31, 2005.  NOTE 13.CERTAIN TRANSACTIONS
AND ARRANGEMENTS BETWEEN THE COMPANY AND ZAPATA  In the
past, the Company has provided to Zapata the Companys current majority stockholder payroll, pension and certain administrative services billed at their approximate cost. In 2005, all of these services had been discontinued. During 2005,
2004, and 2003, fees for these services totaled $0, $11,600 and $122,400, respectively. The cost of such services was based on the estimated percentage of time that employees spend working on Zapatas matters as a percent of total time worked.
As of December31, 2005, Zapatas outstanding balance under this agreement to the Company was $105,000.  Upon completion of the Companys initial public offering in 1998, the Company and Zapata entered into certain agreements that included the Sublease,
Registration Rights, Tax Indemnity and Administrative Services Agreements. The Sublease Agreement provides for the Company to lease its principal corporate offices in Houston, Texas from Zapata and provides the Company with the ability to utilize
telephone equipment worth approximately $21,000 for no additional charge. In May 2003, the Company directly assumed Zapatas obligations under the Sublease Agreement with the third party landlord and terminated the Sublease Agreement with
Zapata. The lease obligations assumed by the Company were identical to its sublease obligations to Zapata, and the transaction had no material effect on the Company. The Registration Rights Agreement sets forth the rights and responsibilities of
each party concerning certain registration filings and provides for the sharing of fees and expenses related to such filings. The Tax Indemnity Agreement requires the Company to be responsible for federal, state and local income taxes from its
operations. The Administrative Services Agreement allows the Company to provide certain administrative services to Zapata at the Companys estimated cost.

Rental expense for
operating leases was $489,000, $442,000, and $375,000 in 2005, 2004, and 2003, respectively.  Litigation  The Company
is defending various claims and litigation arising from its operations which arise in the ordinary course of the Companys business. In the opinion of management, and based on advice of legal counsel, it is believed that any existing litigation
involving the Company will not materially affect its financial condition, cash flows or future results of operations.  Insurance  The Company carries insurance with coverages and coverage limits that it believes to be appropriate for the business. Although there can be no assurance
that such insurance is sufficient to protect the Company against all contingencies, management believes that its insurance protection is reasonable in view of the nature and scope of the Companys operations. Should the Companys insurers
become insolvent, the Company is responsible for payment of all outstanding claims associated with the insurers policies.  Environmental Matters  The Company is subject to various possible claims and lawsuits regarding environmental matters. Management believes that costs, if any, related to these
matters will not have a material adverse effect on the results of operations, cash flows or financial position of the Company.  Indemnification  The Companys Articles of Incorporation and By-Laws limit the liability of the Companys officers and directors to the fullest extent permitted
by Nevada law. Nevada provides that directors of Nevada corporations 
64 Index to Financial Statements OMEGA PROTEIN CORPORATION  NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTSContinued 
may be relieved of monetary liabilities for breach of their fiduciary duties as directors, except under certain circumstances, including iacts or
omissions which involve intentional misconduct, fraud or a knowing violation of law of iithe willful or grossly negligent payment of unlawful distributions.  The Companys Articles of Incorporation and By-Laws generally require the Company to indemnify its directors and
officers to the fullest extent permitted by Nevada law. The Companys Articles of Incorporation and By-Laws also require the Company to advance expenses to its directors and its officers to the fullest extent permitted by Nevada law upon
reciept of an undertaking by or on behalf of such director or officer to repay such amount if it should be ultimately determined that they are not entitled to indemnification by the Company. The Company also has entered into indemnification
agreements with all of its directors and certain of its officers which provides for the indemnification and advancement of expenses by the Company. The Company also maintains director and officer liability insurance with respect to liabilities
arising out of certain matters, including matters arising under the securities laws. This insurance is subject to limitations, conditions and deductibles set forth in the respective insurance policy.  Purchase Obligation  As of December31, 2005, the Company had two letters of credit relating to a fish meal purchase commitment totaling
approximately $5,056,000. Additionally, the Company had a separate fish meal purchase commitment totaling approximately $2,618,000.  NOTE 15.INDUSTRY SEGMENT AND GEOGRAPHIC INFORMATION  The Company operates within one industry segment, menhaden fishing, for the production and sale of fish meal, fish solubles
and fish oil. Export sales of fish oil and fish meal were approximately $32 million, $39 million, and $46 million in 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. Such sales were made primarily to Mexican, Asian and Canadian markets. In 2005, 2004 and 2003,
sales to one customer were approximately $85 million, $88 million, and $108 million, respectively. This customer differed from year to year.

16.DISCLOSURES ABOUT FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS  The following disclosures of the estimated fair value of financial instruments are made in accordance with the requirements of SFAS No107, Disclosure About Fair Value of Financial Instruments. The estimated
fair value amounts have been determined by the Company using available market information and appropriate valuation methodologies and are described in the following paragraphs. 
65 Index to Financial Statements OMEGA PROTEIN CORPORATION  NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTSContinued 
Fair value estimates are subject to certain inherent limitations. Estimates of fair value are made at
a specific point in time, based on relevant market information and information about the financial instrument. The estimated fair values of financial instruments presented below are not necessarily indicative of amounts the Company might realize in
actual market transactions. Estimates of fair value are subjective in nature and involve uncertainties and matters of significant judgment and, therefore, cannot be determined with precision. Changes in assumptions could significantly affect the
estimates.  The carrying amounts of cash and cash equivalents,
accounts receivables, accounts payable, and accrued expenses approximate fair value because of the short maturity of these items. The carrying amounts of notes payable outstanding under the Companys credit facility approximate fair value
because the interest rates on these instruments change with market interest rates. At December31, 2005, the Company had no borrowings under the credit facility.  The carrying values and respective fair market values of the Companys long-term debt are presented below. The fair
value of the Companys long-term debt is estimated based on the quoted market prices available to the Company for issuance of similar debt with similar terms at year end 2005.  YearsEndedDecember31 2005

Revenues, gross profit, operating income loss, and net income loss are rounded to thousands each quarter. Therefore, the sum of the quarterly amounts may not equal the annual
amounts reported.  2
Earnings per share are computed independently for each quarter and the full year based upon respective average shares outstanding. Therefore, the sum of the quarterly earnings per
share amounts may not equal the annual amounts reported.  The Companys menhaden harvesting and processing business is seasonal in nature. The Company generally has higher sales during the menhaden harvesting season which includes the second and third quarter of each year due to increased
product availability, but prices during the fishing season tend to be lower than during the off-season. As a result, the Companys quarterly operating results have fluctuated in the past and may fluctuate in the future. In addition, from time
to time the Companys defers sales of inventory based on worldwide prices for competing products that affect prices for the Companys products which may affect comparable period comparisons.

Item 1B.Unresolved Staff Comments.
None.  Item 3.Controls and Procedures 
a Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures  As of the end of the period covered by this report, the Company conducted an
evaluation of the effectiveness of its disclosure controls and procedures, as that phrase is defined in Rule 13a-15e and 15d-15e under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. The evaluation was carried out under the supervision and with
the participation of management, including the Companys Chief Executive Office CEO and Chief Financial Officer CFO.  Based on and as of the date of that evaluation, the Companys CEO and CFO have concluded that ithe Companys disclosure controls and
procedures are designed to ensure that information required to be discussed by the Company in the reports that the Company files or submits to the Securities and Exchange Commission SEC under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, is
recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SECs rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to the Companys management, including the CEO and CFO, as appropriate
to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure, and iithat the Companys disclosure controls and procedures are effective.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, there can be no assurance that the Companys disclosure controls and procedures will detect or uncover all failures of
persons within the Company and its consolidated subsidiaries to disclose material information otherwise required to be set forth in the Companys periodic reports. There are inherent limitations to the effectiveness of any system of disclosure
controls and procedures, including the possibility of human error and the circumvention or overriding of the controls and procedures. Accordingly, even effective disclosure controls and procedures can only provide reasonable, not absolute, assurance
of achieving their control objectives.  b Managements
Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting  Management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, and for performing an assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting as of December31, 2005.
Internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted
accounting principles. The Companys system of internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that ipertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the
transactions and dispositions of the assets of the Company; iiprovide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles,
and that receipts and expenditures of the Company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the Company; and iiiprovide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized
acquisition, use, or disposition of the Companys assets that could have a material affect on the financial statements.  Management performed an assessment of the effectiveness of the Companys internal control over financial reporting as of December31, 2005 based
upon criteria in a report entitled Internal ControlIntegrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission COSO. Based on that assessment and those criteria, management
determined that the Companys internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December31, 2005, based on the criteria in the Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by COSO.  Managements assessment of the effectiveness of the Companys
internal control over financial reporting as of December31, 2005 has been audited by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in their report which appears herein. See Item8. Financial
Statements and Supplementary Data.
