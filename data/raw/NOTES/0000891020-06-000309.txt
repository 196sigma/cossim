The accompanying notes are an integral part of these financial
statements. 30The
Greenbrier Companies 2006 Annual Report Table of Contents Notes to Consolidated Financial
Statements Note1- Nature of
Operations The Greenbrier Companies, Inc. and Subsidiaries Greenbrier or
the Company currently operates in two primary business
segments: manufacturing and leasing services. The two
business segments are operationally integrated. With operations
in the United States, Canada, Mexico and Europe, the
manufacturing segment produces double-stack intermodal railcars,
conventional railcars, tank cars, marine vessels and performs
railcar repair, refurbishment and maintenance activities. The
Company also produces rail castings through an unconsolidated
joint venture and also manufactures new freight cars through the
use of unaffiliated subcontractors. The leasing
services segment owns approximately 9,000railcars and
provides management services for approximately
135,000railcars for railroads, shippers and other leasing
and transportation companies. Note2- Summary of
Significant Accounting Policies Principles of consolidation- The financial
statements include the accounts of the Company and its
majority-owned subsidiaries. All significant intercompany
transactions and balances are eliminated upon consolidation.
Investments in and long-term advances to joint ventures in which
the Company has a 50% or less ownership interest are accounted
for by the equity method and included in other assets. Unclassified Balance Sheet- The balance sheets of
the Company are presented in an unclassified format as a result
of significant leasing activities for which the current or
noncurrent distinction is not relevant. In addition, the
activities of the leasing services and manufacturing
segments are so intertwined that in the opinion of management,
any attempt to separate the respective balance sheet categories
would not be meaningful and may lead to the development of
misleading conclusions by the reader. Foreign currency translation- Operations outside
the United States prepare financial statements in currencies
other than the United States dollar. Revenues and expenses are
translated at average exchange rates for the year, while assets
and liabilities are translated at year-end exchange rates.
Translation adjustments are accumulated as a separate component
of stockholders equity in other comprehensive income
loss, net of tax. Cash and cash equivalents- Cash is temporarily
invested primarily in bankers acceptances, United States
Treasury bills, commercial paper and money market funds. All
highly-liquid investments with a maturity of three months or
less at the date of acquisition are considered cash equivalents. Accounts Receivable- Accounts receivable are stated
net of allowance for doubtful accounts of $31million and
$25million as of August31, 2006 and 2005. Inventories- Inventories are valued at the lower of
cost first-in,
first-out or average cost or market.
Work-in-process
includes material, labor and overhead. Railcars held for sale- Railcars held for sale
consist of new railcars in transit to delivery point or on lease
with the intent to sell and used railcars that will either be
sold or refurbished, placed on lease and then sold. Equipment on operating leases- Equipment on
operating leases is stated at cost. Depreciation to estimated
salvage value is provided on the straight-line method over the
estimated useful lives of up to thirty-five years. Property, plant and equipment- Property, plant and
equipment is stated at cost. Depreciation is provided on the
straight-line method over estimated useful lives which are as
follows   
Depreciable Life   
Buildings and improvements
10-25years
Machinery equipment
3-15years
Other
3-7years
Intangible assets- Loan fees are capitalized and
amortized as interest expense over the life of the related
borrowings. Goodwill is not significant and is included in other
assets. Goodwill is tested for impairment at least annually and
more frequently if material changes in events or circumstances
arise. Impairment would result in a write-down to fair market
value as necessary. Impairment of long-lived assets- When changes in
circumstances indicate the carrying amount of certain long-lived
assets may not be recoverable, the assets will be evaluated for
impairment. If the forecast The Greenbrier Companies 2006
Annual
Report31 Table of Contents undiscounted future cash flows are less than the carrying amount
of the assets, an impairment charge to reduce the carrying value
of the assets to fair value will be recognized in the current
period. Maintenance obligations- The Company is responsible
for maintenance on a portion of the managed and owned lease
fleet under the terms of maintenance obligations defined in the
underlying lease or management agreement. The estimated
liability is based on maintenance histories for each type and
age of railcar. The liability, included in accounts payable and
accrued liabilities, is reviewed periodically and updated based
on maintenance trends and known future repair or refurbishment
requirements. Warranty accruals- Warranty accruals are estimated
and charged to operations to cover a defined warranty period.
The estimated warranty cost is based on history of warranty
claims for each particular product type. For new product types
without a warranty history, preliminary estimates are based on
historical information for similar product types. The warranty
accruals, included in accounts payable and accrued liabilities,
are reviewed periodically and updated based on warranty trends. Contingent rental assistance- The Company has
entered into contingent rental assistance agreements on certain
railcars, subject to leases, that have been sold to third
parties. These agreements guarantee the purchasers a minimum
lease rental, subject to a maximum defined rental assistance
amount, over remaining periods that range from one to six years.
A liability is established when management believes that it is
probable that a rental shortfall will occur and the amount can
be estimated. All existing rental assistance agreements were
entered into prior to December31, 2002. Any future
contracts would use the guidance required by Financial
Accounting Standards Board FASBInterpretation
FIN45. Income taxes- The liability method is used to
account for income taxes. Deferred income taxes are provided for
the temporary effects of differences between assets and
liabilities recognized for financial statement and income tax
reporting purposes. Valuation allowances reduce deferred tax
assets to an amount that will more likely than not be realized.
The Company also provides for income tax contingencies when
management considers them probable of occurring and reasonably
estimable. Accumulated other comprehensive income loss
-Accumulated other comprehensive income loss represents
net earnings loss plus all other changes in net assets from
non-owner sources. Revenue recognition- Revenue is recognized when
persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, delivery has
occurred or services have been rendered, the price is fixed or
determinable and collectibility is reasonably assured. Railcars are generally manufactured, repaired or refurbished
under firm orders from third parties. Revenue is recognized when
railcars are completed, accepted by an unaffiliated customer and
contractual contingencies removed. Marine revenues are either
recognized on the percentage of completion method during the
construction period or on the completed contract method based on
the terms of the contract. Direct finance lease revenue is
recognized over the lease term in a manner that produces a
constant rate of return on the net investment in the lease.
Operating lease revenue is recognized as earned under the lease
terms. Certain leases are operated under car hire arrangements
whereby revenue is earned based on utilization, car hire rates
and terms specified in the lease agreement. Car hire revenue is
reported from a third party source two months in arrears;
however, such revenue is accrued in the month earned based on
estimates of use from historical activity and is adjusted to
actual as reported. Such adjustments historically have not been
significant from the estimate. Research and development- Research and development
costs are expensed as incurred. Research and development costs
incurred for new product development during 2006, 2005 and 2004
were $22million, $19million and $30million. 32The
Greenbrier Companies 2006 Annual Report Table of Contents Forward exchange contracts- Foreign operations give
rise to risks from changes in foreign currency exchange rates.
Forward exchange contracts with established financial
institutions are utilized to hedge a portion of such risk.
Realized and unrealized gains and losses are deferred in other
accumulated comprehensive income loss and recognized in
earnings concurrent with the hedged transaction or when the
occurrence of the hedged transaction is no longer considered
probable. Even though forward exchange contracts are entered
into to mitigate the impact of currency fluctuations, certain
exposure remains which may affect operating results. Interest rate instruments- Interest rate swap
agreements are utilized to reduce the impact of changes in
interest rates on certain debt. The net cash amounts paid or
received under the agreements are accrued and recognized as an
adjustment to interest expense. Net earnings per share- Basic earnings per common
share EPS excludes the potential dilution that would occur if
additional shares were issued upon exercise of outstanding stock
options, while diluted EPS takes this potential dilution into
account using the treasury stock method. Stock-based compensation- Prior to the adoption of
SFAS123R on September1, 2005, compensation expense
for employee stock options was measured using the method
prescribed by APB Opinion No25, Accounting for Stock
Issued to Employees. In accordance with APB Opinion
No25, Greenbrier did not recognize compensation expense
for employee stock options because options were only granted
with an exercise price equal to the fair value of the stock on
the effective date of grant. If the Company had elected to
recognize compensation expense using a fair value approach, the
pro forma net earnings and earnings per share would have been as

Compensation expense was determined using the
Black-Scholes-Merton option-pricing model which was developed to
estimate value of independently traded options.
Greenbriers options are not independently traded. All stock options were vested prior to September1, 2005
and accordingly no compensation expense was recognized for stock
options for the year ended August31, 2006. The value, at the date of grant, of stock awarded under
restricted stock grants is amortized as compensation expense
over the vesting period of two to five years. Compensation
expense recognized related to restricted stock grants for 2006
and 2005 was $27million and $02million. No
restricted stock grants were awarded prior to 2005. Management estimates- The preparation of financial
statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting
principles requires judgment on the part of management to arrive
at estimates and assumptions on matters that are inherently
uncertain, including evaluating the remaining life and
recoverability of long-lived assets. These estimates may affect
the amount of assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses reported
in the financial statements and accompanying notes. Estimates
and assumptions are periodically evaluated and may be adjusted
in future periods. Actual results could differ from these
estimates. Reclassifications- Certain reclassifications have
been made to prior years Consolidated Financial Statements
to conform with the 2006 presentation. The Greenbrier Companies 2006
Annual
Report33 Table of Contents Initial Adoption of Accounting Policies- On
September1, 2005, the Company adopted Statement of
Financial Accounting Standards SFASNo123R,
Share Based Payment. This statement requires all entities
to recognize compensation expense in an amount equal to the fair
value of share-based payments stock options and restricted
stock granted to employees. The implementation did not have a
material effect on the Companys Consolidated Financial
Statements as all stock options were vested prior to
August31, 2005. Restricted stock grants are currently
being recorded as compensation expense over the vesting period,
consistent with prior periods. Prospective Accounting Changes- In May 2005, the
Financial Accounting Standards Board FASBissued
SFASNo154, Accounting Changes and Error
Corrections which replaces Accounting Principles Board
APBOpinion No20, Accounting Changes and
SFASNo3, Reporting Accounting Changes in Interim
Financial Statements. This statement requires retrospective
application, unless impracticable, for changes in accounting
principles in the absence of transition requirements specific to
newly adopted accounting principles. This statement is effective
for any accounting changes and corrections of errors made by the
Company beginning September1, 2006. In July 2006, the FASB issued FASB interpretation
FINNo48, Accounting for Uncertainties in
Income Tax- an Interpretation of FASB Statement
No109. This interpretation clarifies the accounting
for uncertainties in income taxes. It prescribes a recognition
and measurement threshold for financial statement disclosure of
tax positions taken or expected to be taken on a tax return.
This interpretation is effective for the Company for the fiscal
year beginning September1, 2007. Management has not yet
determined the impact on the Consolidated Financial Statements. Note3-
Acquisitions In September 1998 Greenbrier entered into a joint venture with
Bombardier Transportation Bombardier to build railroad freight
cars at a portion of Bombardiers existing manufacturing
facility in Sahagun, Mexico. Each party held a 50%
non-controlling interest in the joint venture. In December 2004,
Greenbrier acquired Bombardiers interest and will pay
Bombardier a purchase price of $90million over five years
and as a result of the allocation of the purchase price among
assets and liabilities, recorded $13million in goodwill.
Greenbrier leases a portion of the plant from Bombardier and has
entered into a service agreement under which Bombardier provides
labor and other services. These operations, previously accounted
for under the equity method, were consolidated for financial
reporting purposes beginning in December 2004. The following unaudited pro forma financial information for the
years ended August31, 2005 and 2004 was prepared as if the
transaction to acquire Bombardiers equity in the Mexican
operations had occurred at the beginning of each period

The unaudited pro forma financial information is not necessarily
indicative of what actual results would have been had the
transaction occurred at the beginning of each period presented. In December 2005, all of the Canadian subsidiary shares subject
to mandatory redemption of $37million were redeemed for
$53million. The redemption resulted in a
$09million decrease in accumulated other comprehensive
income and interest expense of $07million. 34The
Greenbrier Companies 2006 Annual Report Table of Contents Note4- Discontinued
Operations In August 2004, the Company reached a settlement agreement on
litigation initiated in 1998 by the former shareholders of
InterAmerican Logistics, Inc. InterAmerican which was acquired
in 1996 as part of the Companys transportation logistics
segment. The litigation alleged that Greenbrier violated the
agreements pursuant to which it acquired ownership of
InterAmerican. A plan to dispose of the transportation logistics
segment, which included InterAmerican, was adopted in 1997 and
completed in 1998 and accordingly, results of operations for
InterAmerican were reclassified to discontinued operations at
that time. Upon final disposition in 1998, the balance of the
liability for loss on discontinued operations remained pending
resolution of this litigation. In August 2004, the litigation
was settled resulting in the recognition of a $13million
pre-tax gain on discontinued operations $07million, net
of tax as a result of reversal of substantially all of the
remaining contingent liability. A small accrual remained to
cover additional expenses. In 2006, the remaining liability of
$01million net of tax was reversed as all expenses had
been paid. Note5- Special
Charges The results of operations for the year ended August31,
2005 include special charges of $29million for debt
prepayment penalties and costs associated with settlement of
interest rate swap agreements on $557million in notes
payable that were refinanced through a $1750million
senior unsecured note offering. The results of operations for the year ended August31,
2004 include special charges totaling $12million which
consist of a $75million write-off of the remaining
balance of European designs and patents partially offset by a
$63million reduction of purchase price liabilities
associated with the settlement of arbitration on the acquisition
of European designs and patents. Note6-

fee to each owner, of which 50% of the fee earned by Greenbrier
was eliminated upon consolidation. Note11- Revolving
Notes All amounts originating in foreign currency have been translated
at the August31, 2006 exchange rate for the following
discussion. Credit facilities aggregated $1799million as
of August31, 2006. Available borrowings are based on
defined levels of inventory, receivables, leased equipment and
property, plant and equipment, as well as total debt to
consolidated capitalization, tangible net worth and interest
coverage ratios which at August31, 2006 levels would
provide for maximum borrowing of $1484million of which
$224million is outstanding. A $1250million
revolving line of credit is available through June 2010 to
provide working capital and interim financing of equipment for
the United States and Mexican operations. A $272million
line of credit is available through June 2010 for working
capital for Canadian manufacturing operations. Lines of credit
totaling $277million are available principally through
June 2008 for working capital for the European manufacturing
operation. Advances bear interest at variable rates that depend
on the type of borrowing and the defined ratio of debt to total 36The
Greenbrier Companies 2006 Annual Report Table of Contents capitalization. At August31, 2006, there were no
borrowings outstanding under the North American credit
facilities. The European manufacturing credit lines had
$224million outstanding at interest rates of 51% and
52%.

On November21, 2005, the Company issued, at par, through a
private placement, $600million aggregate principal amount
of
83/8%senior
unsecured notes due 2015. In January 2006, Greenbrier filed a
registration statement with respect to an offer to exchange
these senior unsecured notes for a new issue of identical notes
registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission. In March
2006, the exchange for the registered notes was completed. The
transaction is an additional offering under the indenture
entered into in connection with the Companys sale of
$1750million of senior unsecured notes in May 2005. The
$2350million combined senior unsecured notes the Notes
have identical terms. Payment on the Notes is guaranteed by
substantially all of the Companys domestic subsidiaries.
Interest is paid in arrears on May15thand
November15thof each year. The Greenbrier Companies 2006
Annual
Report37 Table of Contents On May22, 2006, the Company issued, at par, through a
private placement, $1000million aggregate principal
amount of 2375%convertible senior notes due 2026.
Interest will be paid semi-annually in arrears commencing
November15, 2006. Greenbrier also will pay contingent
interest on the notes in certain circumstances commencing with
the six month period beginning May15, 2013. In July 2006,
Greenbrier filed a registration statement with respect to an
offer to exchange these convertible senior notes for a new issue
of identical notes registered with the Securities and Exchange
Commission. In August 2006, the exchange for the registered
notes was completed. Payment on the convertible notes is
guaranteed by substantially all of the Companys domestic
subsidiaries. The convertible senior notes will be convertible upon the
occurrence of specified events into cash and shares, if any, of
Greenbriers common stock at an initial conversion rate of
208125shares per $1,000 principal amount of the notes
which is equal to an initial conversion price of
$4805per share. The initial conversion rate is subject
to adjustment upon the occurrence of certain events, as defined.
On or after May15, 2013, Greenbrier may redeem all or a
portion of the notes at a redemption price equal to 100% of the
principal amount of the notes plus accrued and unpaid interest. On May15, 2013, May15, 2016 and May15, 2021
and in the event of certain fundamental changes, holders may
require the Company to repurchase all or a portion of their
notes at a price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the
notes plus accrued and unpaid interest. Term loans are due in varying installments through August 2017
and are generally collateralized by certain property, plant and
equipment. As of August31, 2006, the effective interest
rates on the term loans ranged from 44% to 84%. The revolving and operating lines of credit, along with notes
payable, contain covenants with respect to the Company and
various subsidiaries, the most restrictive of which, among other
things, limit the ability to: incur additional indebtedness or
guarantees; pay dividends; enter into sale leaseback
transactions; create liens; sell assets; engage in transactions
with affiliates; enter into mergers, consolidations or sales of
substantially all the Companys assets; and enter into new
lines of business. The covenants also require certain minimum
levels of tangible net worth, maximum ratios of debt to equity
or total capitalization and minimum levels of interest coverage. Interest rate swap agreements are utilized to reduce the impact
of changes in interest rates on certain term loans. At
August31, 2006, such agreements had a notional amount of
$134million and mature between June 2007 and March 2011. Principal payments on the notes payable are as follows

Note15- Subordinated
Debt Subordinated notes, amounting to $21million and
$86million at August31, 2006 and 2005, were issued
to the seller of railcars purchased from 1990 to 1997 as part of
an agreement described in Note25. The notes bear interest
at 90%, with the principal due ten years from the date of
issuance of the notes, and are subordinated to all other
liabilities of a subsidiary. The agreement includes an option
that, under certain conditions, provides for the seller to
repurchase the railcars for the original acquisition cost to the
Company at the date the underlying subordinated notes are due.
The Company has received notice from the seller that the
purchase options will be exercised, and amounts due under the
subordinated notes will be retired from the repurchase proceeds
during the next year. Note16- Derivative
Instruments Foreign operations give rise to market risks from changes in
foreign currency exchange rates. Foreign currency forward
exchange contracts with established financial institutions are
utilized to hedge a portion of that risk. Interest rate swap
agreements are utilized to reduce the impact of changes in
interest rates on certain debt. The Companys foreign
currency forward exchange contracts and interest rate swap
agreements are designated as cash flow hedges, and therefore the
unrealized gains and losses are recorded in accumulated other
comprehensive loss. 38The
Greenbrier Companies 2006 Annual Report Table of Contents At August31, 2006 exchange rates, forward exchange
contracts for the sale of United States dollars aggregated
$280million, sale of Pound Sterling aggregated
$52million and purchase of Euro aggregated
$10million. Adjusting these contracts to the fair value
of these cash flow hedges at August31, 2006 resulted in an
unrealized pre-tax gain of $06million that was recorded
in the line item accumulated other comprehensive loss. As these
contracts mature at various dates through December 2006, any
such gain or loss remaining will be recognized in manufacturing
revenue along with the related transactions. In the event that
the underlying sales transaction does not occur or does not
occur in the period designated at the inception of the hedge,
the amount classified in accumulated other comprehensive income
loss would be reclassified to the current years results
of operations. At August31, 2006 exchange rates, interest rate swap
agreements had a notional amount of $134million and
mature between June 2007 and March 2011. The fair value of these
cash flow hedges at August31, 2006 resulted in an
unrealized pre-tax loss of $06million. The loss is
included in accumulated other comprehensive loss and the fair
value of the contracts is included in accounts payable and
accrued liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. As
interest expense on the underlying debt is recognized, amounts
corresponding to the interest rate swaps are reclassified from
accumulated other comprehensive income loss and charged or
credited to interest expense. At August31, 2006 interest
rates, approximately $01million would be reclassified to
interest expense in the next 12months. Note17-
Stockholders Equity On May11, 2005, the Company issued 5,175,000shares
of its common stock at a price of $2650per share, less
underwriting commissions, discounts and expenses. Proceeds were
used to purchase 3,504,167shares from the estate of Alan
James, former member of the board of directors, and
1,837,500shares from William Furman, President and Chief
Executive Officer. A stock incentive plan was adopted July1, 1994 the 1994
Plan that provides for granting compensatory and
non-compensatory options to employees and others. No further
grants will be awarded under this plan. On April6, 1999, the Company adopted the Stock Incentive
Plan 2000 the 2000 Plan, under which
1,000,000shares of common stock were made available for
issuance with respect to options granted to employees,
non-employee directors and consultants of the Company. The 2000
Plan authorized the grant of incentive stock options,
non-statutory stock options, and restricted stock awards, or any
combination of the foregoing. Under the 2000 Plan, the exercise
price for incentive stock options could not be less than the
market value of the Companys common stock at the time the
option is granted. Grants for 2,500shares remain available
under this plan. In 2005, vesting was accelerated on all
outstanding options on this plan in an effort to reduce
administrative expenses associated with the implementation of
FASB123R as the remaining unvested portion of options was
immaterial and no further options were expected to be issued. If
the vesting of the options had not been accelerated, the impact
to the Companys Statement of Operations would be an
additional expense of $01million in 2006 with an
after-tax impact of $0004per share. The effect would be
minimal for periods after 2006. In January 2005, the stockholders approved the 2005 Stock
Incentive Plan. The plan provides for the grant of incentive
stock options, nonstatutory stock options, restricted shares,
stock units and stock appreciation rights. The maximum aggregate
number of the Companys common shares available for
issuance under the plan is 1,300,000. During 2006 and 2005, the
Company awarded restricted stock grants totaling 70,820 and
353,864shares under the 2005 Stock Incentive Plan. The following table summarizes stock option transactions for

Party Transactions James-Furman Company Partnership. Alan James,
former member of the Board of Directors, and William Furman,
President and Chief Executive Officer of the Company were
partners in a general partnership, James Furman
Company the Partnership, that, among other things, engaged in
the ownership, leasing and marketing of railcars and programs
for refurbishing and marketing of used railcars. As a result of
Mr.James death, the Partnership was dissolved as of
January28, 2005. In 1989, the Company entered into
presently existing agreements with the Partnership pursuant to
which the Company manages and maintains railcars owned by the
Partnership in exchange for a fixed monthly fee that is no less
favorable to the Company than the fee the Company could obtain
for similar services rendered to unrelated parties. The
maintenance and management fees paid to the Company under such
agreements for the years ended August31, 2006, 2005 and
2004 aggregated $01million per year. In addition, the
Partnership paid the Company fees of $01million in each
of the years ended August31, 2006, 2005 and 2004 for
administrative and other services. The management and
maintenance agreements presently in effect between the Company
and the Partnership provide that in remarketing railcars owned
by the Partnership and the Company, as well as by unaffiliated
lessors, the Company will, subject to the business requirements
of prospective lessees and railroad regulatory requirements,
grant priority to that equipment which has been off-lease and
available for the longest period of time. Such agreements also
provide that the Partnership will grant to the Company a right
of first refusal with respect to any opportunity originated by
the Partnership in which the Company may be interested involving
the manufacture, purchase, sale, lease, management, refurbishing
or repair of railcars. The right of first refusal provides that
prior to undertaking any such transaction the Partnership must
offer the opportunity to the Company and must provide the
disinterested, independent members of the Board of Directors a
period of not less than 30days in which to determine
whether the Company desires to pursue the opportunity. The right
of first refusal in favor of the Company continues for a period
of 12months after the date that both of Messrs.James
and Furman cease to be officers or directors of the Company. The
disposition of the partnership assets is still in process. Upon
completion of the asset disposition, all agreements between the
Company and the Partnership will be discontinued. Indebtedness of Management-Since the
beginning of the Companys last fiscal year, only one
director or executive officer of the Company has been indebted
to the Company for an amount in excess of $60thousand. The
President of the Companys manufacturing operations has a
promissory note payable upon demand with a balance of
$01million as of August31, 2006. The largest amount
outstanding during the year ended August31, 2006 under
this note was $02million. The note, secured by a mortgage
on the officers residence, does not bear interest and has
not been amended since its issuance in 1994. Policy-Greenbriers policy is that all
proposed transactions by the Company with directors, officers,
five percent stockholders and their affiliates be entered into
only if such transactions are on terms no less favorable to
Greenbrier than could be obtained from unaffiliated parties, are
reasonably expected to benefit the Company and are approved by a
majority 40The
Greenbrier Companies 2006 Annual Report Table of Contents of the disinterested, independent members of the Companys
Board of Directors. Purchases from unconsolidated
subsidiaries-The Company purchased railcars
totaling $10million for the three months ended
November30, 2004 and $318million for the year ended
August31, 2004 from a 50%-owned joint venture for
subsequent sale or for its own lease fleet. As a result of the
acquisition of the Companys joint venture partners
interest the financial results of the entity were consolidated
beginning on December1, 2004. Note20- Employee
Benefit Plans Defined contribution plans are available to substantially all
United States employees. Contributions are based on a percentage
of employee contributions and amounted to $13million 12million and $12million for the years ended
August31, 2006, 2005 and 2004. Defined benefit pension plans are provided for Canadian
employees covered by collective bargaining agreements. The plans
provide pension benefits based on years of credited service.
Contributions to the plan are actuarially determined and are
intended to fund the net periodic pension cost. Expenses
resulting from contributions to the plans were
$25million, $21million and $19million for
the years ended August31, 2006, 2005 and 2004. Nonqualified deferred benefit plans exist for certain employees.
Expenses resulting from contributions to the plans were
$18million, $16million and $16million for
the years ended August31, 2006, 2005 and 2004. Note21- Income

United States income taxes have not been provided for
approximately $178million of cumulative undistributed
earnings of several non-United States subsidiaries as Greenbrier
plans to reinvest these earnings indefinitely in operations
outside the United States. At August31, 2005, no income tax benefit was recognized
for certain net deferred tax assets due to the uncertainty of
their realization in future years. However, due to the earnings
in 2006 and the level of probable earnings in 2007, the
realization of certain deferred tax assets is more likely than
not and as such $37million was recognized. 42The

Note25- Commitments
and Contingencies In 1990, an agreement was entered into for the purchase and
refurbishment of over 10,000 used railcars between 1990 and
1997. The agreement provides that, under certain conditions, the
seller will receive a percentage of defined earnings of a
subsidiary, and further defines the period when such payments
are to be made. Such amounts are referred to as participation,
are accrued when earned and charged to leasing
services cost of revenue. Unpaid amounts are included in
participation in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Participation
expense was $17million, $16million and
$17million in 2006, 2005 and 2004. Payment of
participation was $121million in 2006 and is estimated to
be $93million in 2007, $36million in 2008 03million in 2009, $01million in 2010 and
$02million thereafter. Environmental studies have been conducted of the Companys
owned and leased properties that indicate additional
investigation and some remediation on certain properties may be
necessary. The Companys Portland, Oregon manufacturing
facility is located adjacent to the Willamette River. The United
States Environmental Protection Agency EPAhas classified
portions of the river bed, including the portion fronting
Greenbriers facility, as a federal National Priority
List or Superfund site due to sediment
contamination the Portland Harbor Site. Greenbrier and more
than 60 other parties have received a General Notice
of potential liability from the EPA relating to the Portland
Harbor Site. The letter advised the Company that they may be
liable for the costs of investigation and remediation which
liability may be joint and several with other potentially
responsible parties as well as for natural resource damages
resulting from releases of hazardous substances to the site. At
this time, ten private and public entities, including the
Company 44The
Greenbrier Companies 2006 Annual Report Table of Contents have signed an Administrative Order on Consent to perform a
remedial investigation/feasibility study of the Portland Harbor
Site under EPA oversight, and four additional entities have not
signed such consent, but are nevertheless contributing money to
the effort. The study is expected to be completed in 2009. In
May 2006, the EPA notified several additional entities,
including other federal agencies that it is prepared to issue
unilateral orders compelling additional participation in the
remedial investigation. In addition, the Company has entered
into a Voluntary Clean-Up Agreement with the Oregon Department
of Environmental Quality in which the Company agreed to conduct
an investigation of whether, and to what extent, past or present
operations at the Portland property may have released hazardous
substances to the environment. The Company is also conducting
groundwater remediation relating to a historical spill on the
property which antedates our ownership. Because these environmental investigations are still underway,
the Company is unable to determine the amount of ultimate
liability relating to these matters. Based on the results of the
pending investigations and future assessments of natural
resource damages, Greenbrier may be required to incur costs
associated with additional phases of investigation or remedial
action, and may be liable for damages to natural resources. In
addition, the Company may be required to perform periodic
maintenance dredging in order to continue to launch vessels from
its launch ways in Portland, Oregon, on the Willamette River,
and the rivers classification as a Superfund site could
result in some limitations on future dredging and launch
activities. Any of these matters could adversely affect the
Companys business and results of operations, or the value
of its Portland property. From time to time, Greenbrier is involved as a defendant in
litigation in the ordinary course of business, the outcome of
which cannot be predicted with certainty. The most significant
litigation is as follows On April20, 2004, BC Rail Partnership initiated litigation
against the Company in the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia,
alleging breach of contract and negligent manufacture and design
of railcars which were involved in a 1999 derailment. No trial
date has been set. On November3, 2004, and November4, 2004, in the
District Court of Tarrant County, Texas, and in the District
Court of Lancaster County, Nebraska, respectively, litigation
was initiated against the Company by Burlington Northern
SantaFe Railway BNSF. BNSF alleges the failure of a
supplier-provided component part on a railcar manufactured by
Greenbrier in 1988, resulted in a derailment and a chemical
spill. On June24, 2006, the District Court of Tarrant
County, Texas, entered an order granting the Companys
motion for summary judgment as to all claims. On August7,
2006, BNSF gave notice of appeal. Greenbrier and a customer, SEB Finans AB SEB, have raised
performance concerns related to a component that the Company
installed on 372 railcar units with an aggregate sales value of
approximately $200million produced under a contract with
SEB. On December9, 2005, SEB filed a Statement of Claim in
an arbitration proceeding in Stockholm, Sweden, against
Greenbrier alleging that the cars are defective and cannot be
used for their intended purpose. SEB seeks damages in an
undisclosed amount and in addition late delivery penalties in
the amount of 11million Euros. In a Statement of Defense
and Counterclaim filed with the Arbitral Tribunal on
February1, 2006, Greenbrier denied that there were defects
in the railcar units delivered for which Greenbrier is liable
and filed Counterclaims against SEB in total amounting to
approximately $110million plus interest representing
payments in default under the contract. Greenbrier believes that
applicable law provides an opportunity to remedy the performance
issues and that an engineering solution is likely. The component
supplier has filed for the United Kingdom equivalent of
bankruptcy protection. Accordingly, Greenbriers recourse
against the supplier may be of limited or no value. Arbitration
hearings tentatively scheduled for early November have been
rescheduled to May 2007 by mutual agreement. The parties
continue to discuss alternative resolutions of the dispute. Management intends to vigorously defend its position in each of
the open foregoing cases and believes that any ultimate
liability resulting from the above litigation will not
materially affect the Companys Consolidated Financial
Statements. The Company is involved as a defendant in other litigation
initiated in the ordinary course of business. While the ultimate
outcome of such legal proceedings cannot be determined at this
time, management believes that the resolution of these actions
will not have a material adverse effect on the Companys
Consolidated Financial Statements. The Greenbrier Companies 2006
Annual
Report45 Table of Contents On April20, 2005, the Company entered into an employment
agreement with Mr.Furman, President and Chief Executive
Officer. The employment agreement provides that Greenbrier pay
Mr.Furman a base salary of $550,000per year subject
to increase by the compensation committee of the board of
directors, an annual performance based cash bonus up to 150% of
his base salary, and an annual retirement benefit of $407,000
commencing in November 2004 and continuing until Mr.Furman
reaches age70. Either party may terminate the employment
agreement at any time upon written notice. The employment
agreement contains a two year noncompete clause limiting
Mr.Furmans activities with competing businesses upon
termination. In the event of his termination following a change
in control, Mr.Furman will be entitled to a lump sum
severance amount equal to three times his base salary and
average bonus, accrued salary and vacation, and continuation for
three years of specified employee benefits. The Company has entered into contingent rental assistance
agreements, aggregating $118million, on certain railcars
subject to leases that have been sold to third parties. These
agreements guarantee the purchasers a minimum lease rental,
subject to a maximum defined rental assistance amount, over
remaining periods that range from one to six years. A liability
is established and revenue is reduced in the period during which
a determination can be made that it is probable that a rental
shortfall will occur and the amount can be estimated. For the
years ended August31, 2006, 2005 and 2004 no accruals were
made to cover estimated obligations as the existing liability
was adequate. There is no liability accrued at August31,
2006. All of these agreements were entered into prior to
December31, 2002 and have not been modified since. The
accounting for any future rental assistance agreements will
comply with the guidance required by FASB Interpretation
FIN45 which pertains to contracts entered into or
modified subsequent to December31, 2002. A portion of leasing services revenue is derived from
car hire which is a fee that a railroad pays for the
use of railcars owned by other railroads or third parties. Car
hire earned by a railcar is usually made up of hourly and
mileage components. Until 1992, the Interstate Commerce
Commission directly regulated car hire rates by prescribing a
formula for calculating these rates. Government regulation of
car hire rates continues but the system of prescribed rates has
been superseded by a system known as deprescription. A ten-year
period used to phase in this new system ended on January1,
2003. Deprescription is a system whereby railcar owners and
users have the right to negotiate car hire rates. If the railcar
owner and railcar user cannot come to an agreement on a car hire
rate then either party has the right to call for arbitration. In
arbitration either the owners or users rate is
selected and that rate becomes effective for a one-year period.
There is some risk that car hire rates could be negotiated or
arbitrated to lower levels in the future. This could reduce
future car hire revenue for the Company which amounted to
$253million, $253million and $272million in
2006, 2005 and 2004. In accordance with customary business practices in Europe, the
Company has $146million in bank and third party
performance, advance payment and warranty guarantee facilities,
all of which have been utilized as of August31, 2006. To
date no amounts have been drawn under these performance, advance
payment and warranty guarantee facilities. At August31, 2006, an unconsolidated subsidiary had
$83million of third party debt, for which the Company has
guaranteed 33% or approximately $28million. In the event
that there is a change in control or insolvency by any of the
three 33% investors that have guaranteed the debt, the remaining
investors share of the guarantee will increase
proportionately. The Company has outstanding letters of credit aggregating
$21million associated with material purchases and payroll. Greenbrier has jointly committed with Babcock Brown
Rail Management, LLC to purchase new rail-cars from unaffiliated
manufacturers to be leased to third party customers.
Greenbriers remaining portion of this commitment is
approximately $307million. All purchases are expected to
be completed by the end of December 2006. 46The

The carrying amount of cash and cash equivalents, accounts and
notes receivable, revolving notes, accounts payable and accrued
liabilities, foreign currency forward contracts and interest
rate swaps is a reasonable estimate of fair value of these
financial instruments. Estimated rates currently available to
the Company for debt with similar terms and remaining maturities
are used to estimate the fair value of notes payable and
subordinated debt. The fair value of deferred participation is
estimated by discounting the estimated future cash payments
using the Companys estimated incremental borrowing rate. Note27- Guarantor/

A wholly owned Mexican subsidiary is shown as non-guarantor
subsidiary in the current years presentation. In the prior
years presentation such financial information was
consolidated as part of its U.S.parent which is a
guarantor subsidiary. Amounts for 2005, therefore have been
reclassified to conform to the current years presentation.
The net equity investment in the Mexican subsidiary is now shown
an investment in the Mexican subsidiary in other assets category
instead of the individual asset and liability categories. The Greenbrier Companies 2006

The Greenbrier Companies 2006
Annual
Report55 Table of Contents Note28- Subsequent
Event Unaudited On September11, 2006, the Company purchased substantially
all of the operating assets of Rail Car America RCA, its
American Hydraulics division and the assets of its wholly owned
subsidiary, Brandon Corp. RCA is a leading provider of
intermodal and conventional railcar repair services in North
America, operating from four repair facilities throughout the
United States. RCA also reconditions and repairs
end-of-railcar
cushioning units through its American Hydraulics division and
operates a switching railroad in Nebraska through Brandon Corp.
The purchase price of the acquisition was approximately
$340million in cash. RCA currently generates nearly
$400million in annual revenue with a workforce
approaching 400employees. In October 2006, the Company formed a joint venture with Grupo
Industrial Monclova GIMSAto build new railroad freight
cars for the North American marketplace at GIMSAs existing
manufacturing facility, located in Monclova, Mexico. The initial
investment will be less than $100million for one
production line and each party will maintain a 50% interest in
the joint venture. Production is expected to commence in the
second calendar quarter of 2007. In October 2006, the Company entered into a definitive agreement
to acquire the stock of Meridian Rail Holdings, Corp. for
$2275million in cash, plus or minus working capital
adjustments. Meridian is a leading supplier of wheel maintenance
services to the North American freight car industry. Operating
out of six facilities, Meridian supplies replacement wheel sets
and axles to approximately 170freight car maintenance
locations where worn or damaged wheels, axles, or bearings are
replaced. Meridian also operates a coupler reconditioning
facility and performs railcar repair at one of its wheel
services facilities. The acquisition is expected to close in
November 2006, subject to customary closing conditions. Greenbrier has entered into a commitment to increase our
revolving line of credit in the U.S. and Canada to an aggregate
of $2750million. The amended five year facility will
replace our existing facility aggregating $1500million
and will be used to support the Meridian acquisition, provide
working capital and interim financing of equipment for United
States and Mexican operations. It is expected to close on or
before the closing of the Meridian acquisition. 56The

Greenbrier Companies 2006 Annual Report Table of Contents Report of Independent Registered
Public Accounting Firm Board of Directors and Stockholders The Greenbrier Companies, Inc. We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of
The Greenbrier Companies, Inc. and subsidiaries the
Company as of August31, 2006 and 2005, and
the related consolidated statements of operations,
stockholders equity and comprehensive income loss, and
cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended
August31, 2006. These financial statements are the
responsibility of the Companys management. Our
responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial
statements based on our audits. We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the
Public Company Accounting Oversight Board United States. Those
standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are
free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a
test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in
the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the
accounting principles used and significant estimates made by
management, as well as evaluating the overall financial
statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a
reasonable basis for our opinion. In our opinion, such consolidated financial statements present
fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of The
Greenbrier Companies, Inc. and subsidiaries as of
August31, 2006 and 2005, and the results of their
operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in
the period ended August31, 2006, in conformity with
accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of
America. We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the
Public Company Accounting Oversight Board United States, the
effectiveness of the Companys internal control over
financial reporting as of August31, 2006, based on the
criteria established in Internal Control Integrated
Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring
Organizations of the Treadway Commission and our report dated
November1, 2006, expressed an unqualified opinion on
managements assessment of the effectiveness of the
Companys internal control over financial reporting. Deloitte Touche LLP Portland, Oregon November1, 2006 Item1.

CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures Our management has evaluated, under the supervision and with the
participation of our President and Chief Executive Officer and
Chief Financial Officer, the effectiveness of our disclosure
controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by
this report pursuant to
Rule13a-15b
under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 the Exchange Act.
Based on that evaluation, our President and Chief Executive
Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that, as of
the end of the period covered by this report, our disclosure
controls and procedures were effective in ensuring that
information required to be disclosed in our Exchange Act reports
is 1recorded, processed, summarized and reported in a
timely manner, and 2accumulated and communicated to our
management, including our President and Chief Executive Officer
and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate to allow timely
decisions regarding required disclosure. Changes In Internal Controls There has been no change in our internal control over financial
reporting that occurred during our last fiscal quarter that has
materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially
affect, our internal control over financial reporting. Managements Report on
Internal Control over Financial Reporting Management of the Greenbrier Companies, Inc. together with its
consolidated subsidiaries the Company, is responsible for
establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over
financial reporting. The Companys internal control over
financial reporting is a process designed under the supervision
of the Companys principal executive and principal
financial officers to provide reasonable assurance regarding the
reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of the
Companys financial statements for external reporting
purposes in accordance with accounting principles generally
accepted in the United States of America. As of the end of the Companys 2006 fiscal year, management
conducted an assessment of the effectiveness of the
Companys internal control over financial reporting based
on the framework established in Internal Control
Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring
Organizations of the Treadway Commission COSO. Based on this
assessment, management has determined that the Companys
internal control over financial reporting as of August31,
2006 is effective. Managements assessment of the effectiveness of the
Companys internal control over financial reporting as of
August31, 2006 has been audited by Deloitte
Touche LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, as
stated in their report appearing herein. Inherent Limitations on Effectiveness of Controls The Companys management, including the Chief Executive
Officer and Chief Financial Officer, does not expect that our
disclosure controls and procedures or our internal control over
financial reporting will prevent or detect all error and all
fraud. A control system, no matter how well designed and
operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance
that the control systems objectives will be met. The
design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are
resource constraints, and the benefits of controls must be
considered relative to their costs. Further, because of the
inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of
controls can provide absolute assurance that misstatements due
to error or fraud will not occur or that all control issues and
instances of fraud, if any, within the Company have been
detected. These inherent limitations include the realities that
judgments in decision-making can be faulty and that breakdowns
can occur because of simple error or mistake. Controls can also
be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons, by
collusion of two or more people, or by management override of
the controls. The design of any system of controls is based in
part on certain assumptions about the likelihood of future
events, and there can be no assurance that any design will
succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future
conditions. Projections of any evaluation of controls
effectiveness to future periods are subject to risks. Over time,
controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions
or deterioration in the degree of compliance with policies or
procedures. 60The
Greenbrier Companies 2006 Annual Report Table of Contents Report of Independent Registered
Public Accounting Firm Board of Directors and Stockholders The Greenbrier Companies, Inc. We have audited managements assessment, included in the
accompanying Managements Report on Internal Control
over Financial Reporting, that The Greenbrier Companies,
Inc. and subsidiaries the Company maintained
effective internal control over financial reporting as of
August31, 2006, based on the criteria established in
Internal Control Integrated Framework issued by the
Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway
Commission. The Companys management is responsible for
maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting
and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control
over financial reporting. Our responsibility is to express an
opinion on managements assessment and an opinion on the
effectiveness of the Companys internal control over
financial reporting based on our audit. We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the
Public Company Accounting Oversight Board United States. Those
standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control
over financial reporting was maintained in all material
respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of
internal control over financial reporting, evaluating
managements assessment, testing and evaluating the design
and operating effectiveness of internal control, and performing
such other procedures as we considered necessary in the
circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable
basis for our opinions. A companys internal control over
financial reporting is a process designed by, or under the
supervision of, the companys principal executive and
principal financial officers, or persons performing similar
functions, and effected by the companys board of
directors, management, and other personnel to provide reasonable
assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and
the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in
accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A
companys internal control over financial reporting
includes those policies and procedures that 1pertain to
the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail,
accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions
of the assets of the company; 2provide reasonable
assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit
preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally
accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and
expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance
with authorizations of management and directors of the company;
and 3provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention
or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or
disposition of the companys assets that could have a
material effect on the financial statements. Because of the inherent limitations of internal control over
financial reporting, including the possibility of collusion or
improper management override of controls, material misstatements
due to error or fraud may not be prevented or detected on a
timely basis. Also, projections of any evaluation of the
effectiveness of the internal control over financial reporting
to future periods are subject to the risk that the controls may
become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the
degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may
deteriorate. In our opinion, managements assessment that the Company
maintained effective internal control over financial reporting
as of August31, 2006, is fairly stated, in all material
respects, based on the criteria established in Internal
Control Integrated Framework issued by the Committee
of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Also in
our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects,
effective internal control over financial reporting as of
August31, 2006, based on the criteria established in
Internal Control Integrated Framework issued by the
Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the
Public Company Accounting Oversight Board United States, the
consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended
August31, 2006, of the Company and our report dated
November1, 2006, expressed an unqualified opinion on those
financial statements. Portland, Oregon November1, 2006 The Greenbrier Companies 2006
