Financial Statements and Supplementary
Data Our consolidated financial statements as of
December31, 2003, and for each of the fiscal years in the
three-year period ended December31, 2003, together with
related notes and the report of Deloitte Touche LLP
are set forth on the following pages. 33 Table of Contents INDEPENDENT AUDITORS REPORT To the Stockholders and Board of Directors of The Dial Corporation We have audited the accompanying consolidated
balance sheets of The Dial Corporation and subsidiaries the
Company as of December31, 2003, and 2002, and
the related consolidated statements of operations and
comprehensive income loss, cash flows and stockholders
equity for each of the three years in the period ended
December31, 2003. These financial statements are the
responsibility of the Companys management. Our
responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial
statements based on our audits. We conducted our audits in accordance with
auditing standards generally accepted in the United States of
America. Those standards require that we plan and perform the
audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial
statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes
examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and
disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes
assessing the accounting principles used and significant
estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall
financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits
provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. In our opinion, such consolidated financial
statements present fairly, in all material respects, the
financial position of The Dial Corporation and subsidiaries as
of December31, 2003, and 2002, and the results of their
operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in
the period ended December31, 2003, in conformity with
accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of
America. As discussed in Note2 to the consolidated
financial statements, the Company changed its method of
accounting for goodwill and other intangible assets with
indefinite lives as required by Statement of Financial
Accounting Standards No142, Goodwill and Other
Intangible Assets, which was effective January1,
2002.

STATEMENTS   
Note1.
Nature of Business We manufacture and sell consumer products. We
market our products primarily under such well-known household
brand names as Dial soaps,
Purex detergents,
Renuzit air fresheners and
Armour canned meats. These products are sold
to consumers primarily though supermarkets, mass merchandisers,
drug stores, membership club stores and other outlets.
Approximately 95% of our business is in the United States. On December14, 2003, we entered into an
Agreement and Plan of Merger, by and among Henkel KGaA, a
Kommanditgesellschaft auf Aktien a partnership limited by
shares organized under the laws of the Federal Republic of
Germany Henkel and Henkel Merger Corporation, a
Delaware corporation and a wholly-owned subsidiary of Henkel
Merger Sub and us the Merger
Agreement. Pursuant to the Merger Agreement, Henkel will
acquire us through a merger of Merger Sub with and into us, with
Dial surviving as a wholly-owned subsidiary of Henkel the
Merger. Upon the consummation of the Merger, each
outstanding share of our common stock will be converted into the
right to receive $2875 in cash. The completion of the Merger is
subject to the satisfaction or waiver of several conditions,
including approval of the Merger by our stockholders and other
customary conditions to the closing. Subject to the satisfaction
or waiver of these conditions, we expect to complete the Merger
in March 2004. A special stockholder meeting to approve the
Merger Agreement is scheduled for March24, 2004.
Stockholders of record as of the close of business on
February17, 2004 are entitled to be present and vote at
this special meeting. In 2003, we completed the sale of our Argentina
business and in 2001 we completed the sale of our Specialty
Personal Care SPC business. The accompanying
financial statements have been prepared to reflect our
historical financial position and results of operations and cash
flows as adjusted for the reclassification of these businesses
as discontinued operations. Historical results of operations,
the loss on the related sales, and the subsequent adjustments to
the losses on disposal are reported as discontinued operations
in the accompanying consolidated financial statements.   
Note2.
Significant Accounting Policies Principles of
Consolidation. The accompanying
consolidated financial statements include the accounts of The
Dial Corporation and all majority-owned subsidiaries. Prior to
our assumption of Henkels interest in Dial/ Henkel
LLCs operations in the second quarter of 2002, we
accounted for our investment in the Dial/ Henkel LLC joint
venture and our prior investment in the Dial/ Henkel Mexico
joint venture under the equity method of accounting.
Intercompany transactions and profits have been eliminated in
consolidation. Use of Estimates.
The preparation of our financial statements requires us to make
estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of
assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses. We routinely
evaluate our estimates, including those related to customer
programs and incentives, product returns, bad debts, income
taxes, pension and other post-retirement benefits, long-lived
assets, inventories, restructurings, self insurance primarily
workers compensation, environmental matters, exit cost
reserves related to discontinued operations and contingencies
and litigation. We base our estimates on historical experience
and on various other assumptions that are believed to be
reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form
the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of
assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other
sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under
different assumptions and conditions. Revenue Recognition.
Sales are recorded when the risk of loss and title to the
product transfers to the purchaser. Sales are recorded net of
allowances for cash discounts, estimated sales returns, trade
promotions and other sales incentives. Major Customers.
Wal-Mart, including its affiliate Sams Club, was our
largest customer, accounting for 28%, 28%, and 25% of net sales
in 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively. The loss of or a
substantial decrease in the volume of purchases by Wal-Mart or
any of our other top customers could harm our sales and
profitability. 39 Table of Contents Net sales to the food and mass channels
represented 772%, 787%, and 790% of our domestic sales in
2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively. Marketing and Research and Development
Costs. All expenditures for marketing
and research and development are charged against earnings in the
period incurred and are reported in the statement of
consolidated operations under the caption Selling,
general and administrative expenses. Our total
research and development expenditures were approximately
$190million, $162million and $143million in
2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively. Marketing costs include the
costs of advertising and various consumer-related marketing
programs. Cash and Cash
Equivalents. We consider all highly
liquid investments with original maturities of three months or
less from the date of purchase to be cash equivalents. Restricted Cash. In
connection with the announcement of our pending Merger
Agreement, we funded a benefit protection trust with
$423million, which has been recorded as restricted cash
on our balance sheet. The arrangements covered by the trust
include our employee compensation agreements, including change
in control agreements, employment agreements, supplemental
pension plans, separation pay plans and annual incentive and
sales incentive plans. These assets will be used solely to
satisfy our obligations to our employees under these plans or,
in the event of our bankruptcy or insolvency, the claims of our
creditors. Inventories.
Inventories are stated at the lower of cost first in, first out
and average cost methods or market. Long-Lived Assets with Definite
Lives. In accordance with Financial
Accounting Standards Board FASB Statement of
Financial Accounting Standards SFAS No144,
Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived
Assets, we evaluate the recoverability of property and
equipment and intangibles held for use with definite lives
comparing the carrying amount of the asset or group of assets
against the estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected to
result from the use of the asset or group of assets and their
eventual disposition. If the undiscounted cash flows are less
than the carrying value of the asset or group of assets being
evaluated, an impairment loss is recorded. The loss is measured
as the difference between the fair value and carrying value of
the asset or group of assets being evaluated. Assets to be
disposed of are reported at the lower of the carrying amount or
the fair value less cost to sell. The estimated fair value is
based on the best information available under the circumstances,
including prices for similar assets or the results of valuation
techniques. Property and
Equipment. Property and equipment are
stated at cost, net of accumulated depreciation. Depreciation is
provided principally by use of the straight-line method at
annual rates as follows   
Buildings
2% to 5%
Machinery and other equipment
5% to 33%
Leasehold improvements
Lesser of lease term or useful life
Goodwill and
Intangibles. Prior to 2002, goodwill
that arose prior to November 1970 was not amortized, but other
goodwill and intangibles with indefinite lives were amortized
over useful lives ranging from 10 to 40years. Effective
January1, 2002, all goodwill and other intangibles with
indefinite lives ceased to be amortized in accordance with
SFASNo142, Goodwill and Other Intangible
Assets. Intangible assets with indefinite lives are
analyzed for impairment, on at least an annual basis, as
required by applicable guidance. Other intangible assets with definite lives,
including trademarks, patents and customer lists, are amortized
on a straight-line basis over useful lives ranging from 10 to
40years. Intangible assets with definite lives are
analyzed for impairment, as required by SFASNo144. In June 2001, the FASB issued
SFASNo142, Goodwill and Other Intangible
Assets. Under the provisions of SFASNo142,
goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives are no
longer amortized but are subject to annual impairment tests.
SFASNo142 also established a new method of testing
goodwill for impairment. We adopted SFASNo142
effective January1, 2002 and ceased the amortization of
goodwill and intangibles with indefinite lives. Amortization
expense of these items was $73million $005per
diluted 40 Table of Contents share in 2001. In addition, we recorded an
impairment charge on our Argentina intangible assets from the
change in accounting principle in the first quarter of 2002. The
amount of this charge was $433million after tax
$440million pre-tax and is included within the
Cumulative effect of the change in accounting principle
line on the statement of consolidated operations and
comprehensive income/loss. Net Income/Loss Per Common
Share. Basic net income/loss per
common share is computed by dividing net income/loss by the
weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the
year before giving effect to stock options considered to be
dilutive common stock equivalents. Diluted net income/loss per
common share is computed by dividing net income/loss by the
weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the
year after giving effect to stock options considered to be
dilutive common stock equivalents. Shares held by the Employee
Equity Trust are not considered outstanding for net
income/loss per share calculations until the shares are
released from the Trust and transferred to an employee or
transferred on behalf of an employee. In accordance with
SFASNo128, Earnings per share, the same
number of potential common shares used in calculating the
diluted earnings per share for income from continuing operations
is used in calculating all other reported diluted earnings per
share amounts. At December31, 2003, there were
108,120,795shares of common stock issued and there were
97,132,811shares outstanding, including shares held by the
Employee Equity Trust. At December31, 2003, and
December31, 2002, a total of 1,872,786 and 2,365,901,
respectively, of the issued shares were held by the Employee
Equity Trust. At December31, 2003, and December31,
2002, a total of 10,987,984 and 10,910,433shares of common
stock, respectively, were held in treasury. In addition to common stock, we are authorized to
issue 10,000,000shares of preferred stock, par value of
$001per share, none of which has been issued. Comprehensive
Income. Components of comprehensive
income are reported in the financial statements in the period in
which they are recognized. The components of comprehensive
income included in our statement of consolidated operations and
comprehensive income/loss are net income/loss, foreign
currency translation adjustments and additional minimum pension
liability adjustments. Stock Options. We
have two stock-based employee compensation plans, which are
described in more detail in Note14. We account for these
plans under the recognition and measurement provisions of
Accounting Principles Board APB Opinion
No25, Accounting for Stock Issued to
Employees, and related interpretations. We have adopted
the disclosure-only provisions of SFASNo. 123,
Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation, as amended
by SFASNo148, Accounting for Stock-Based
Compensation Transition and Disclosure.
Accordingly, no compensation cost has been recognized, as all
options under the stock-based compensation plans had an exercise
price equal to or greater than the fair market value of the
underlying common stock at the date of grant. Awards under our
plans vest over periods ranging from immediate vesting to five
years, depending upon the type of award. The following table
illustrates the effect on net income/loss and earnings/loss
per share if the fair value based method had been applied to all
outstanding and unvested awards in each period presented, using
the Black-Scholes valuation model.

41 Table of Contents Derivative Financial
Instruments. SFASNo133,
Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging
Activities, requires that all derivative financial
instruments that qualify for hedge accounting, such as interest
rate swap contracts and forward purchase contracts, are
recognized in the financial statements and measured at fair
value regardless of the purpose or intent for holding them.
Changes in the fair value of derivative financial instruments
are either recognized in income or stockholders equity as
a component of comprehensive income/loss, depending on
whether the derivative is being used to hedge changes in fair
value or cash flows. Our use of financial instruments is limited to
purposes other than trading and includes the management of
interest rate risk. The financial impacts of these hedging
instruments are offset in part or in whole by corresponding
changes in the underlying exposures being hedged. We may use
financial instruments for the management of foreign currency,
commodity expense or other risks in the future. Reclassifications.
Certain reclassifications of prior years amounts have been
made to conform to the current year presentation.   
New Accounting Pronouncements In December 2003, the FASB issued
SFASNo132 revised 2003, Employers
Disclosures about Pensions and Other Postretirement
Benefits. The provisions of this revised statement retain
the existing disclosure requirements of the original guidance in
SFASNo132 and contain additional requirements for
both annual and interim reporting. This revision also amends the
disclosure requirements under APB Opinion No28,
Interim Financial Reporting. The revised statement
is effective for fiscal years ending and interim periods
beginning after December15, 2003. We have adopted the
additional annual disclosure requirements as noted above. In May 2003, the FASB issued
SFASNo150, Accounting for Certain Financial
Instruments with Characteristics of both Liabilities and
Equity. This Statement requires, among other things, the
classification of certain financial instruments, previously
classified within the equity section of the balance sheet, to be
included in liabilities. This Statement is effective for
financial instruments entered into or modified after
May31, 2003 and June15, 2003 for all other
instruments. The adoption of this Statement had no impact on our
financial position or results of operations. In April 2003, the FASB issued
SFASNo149, Amendment of Statement
No133 on Derivative Instruments and Hedging
Activities. This Statement amended and refined certain
characteristics of derivative instruments and hedges. The
adoption of this Statement had no impact on our financial
position or results of operations. In January 2003, the FASB issued Interpretation
FIN No46, Consolidation of Variable
Interest Entities An Interpretation of Accounting
Research Bulletin ARB No51. This
interpretation was subsequently revised by FIN46 Revised
2003 in December 2003. This revised interpretation states that
consolidation of variable interest entities will be required by
the primary beneficiary if the entities do not effectively
disperse risks among the parties involved. The requirements are
effective for fiscal years ending after December15, 2003
for special-purpose entities and for all other types of entities
for periods ending after March31, 2004. We have no
variable interest entities and do not believe that FIN
No46R will impact our future financial results. In December 2002, the FASB issued
SFASNo148, Accounting for Stock-Based
Compensation Transition and Disclosure. This
Statement amends SFASNo123 to provide alternative
methods of transition for a voluntary change to the fair value
method of accounting for stock-based employee compensation.
SFASNo148 also amends the disclosure requirements
relating to stock options under SFASNo123 and APB
Opinion No28, Interim Financial Reporting. We
have adopted and applied the disclosure-only provisions of
SFASNo148 for 2003, and have elected to defer the
voluntary adoption of the fair value method of accounting for
stock-based employee compensation until it is required by the
FASB. In November 2002, the FASB issued FASB
Interpretation No45, Guarantors Accounting
and Disclosure Requirements for Guarantees, Including Indirect
Guarantees of Indebtedness of Others. This 42 Table of Contents Interpretation clarifies that a guarantor is
required to recognize a liability for the fair value of the
obligation undertaken in issuing a guarantee and requires
certain related disclosures. The adoption of this Statement had
no impact on our financial statements. In June 2002, the FASB issued
SFASNo146, Accounting for Costs Associated
with Exit or Disposal Activities. SFASNo146
supersedes guidance established in the FASBs Emerging
Issues Task Force EITF Issue No94-3
regarding certain exit and disposal costs. The provisions of
this Statement are effective for exit or disposal activities
that are initiated after December31, 2002. The adoption of
this Statement had no impact on our financial statements. In April 2002, the FASB issued
SFASNo145, Rescission of Statements 4, 44,
and 64, Amendment of SFASNo13 and Technical
Corrections. This statement rescinds SFASNo4
that required all gains and losses from the extinguishment of
debt to be aggregated and, if material, classified as an
extraordinary item. Gains and losses from the extinguishment of
debt will no longer be considered extraordinary.
SFASNo145 is effective for fiscal years beginning
after May15, 2002. The adoption of this Statement had no
impact on our financial statements.   
Note3.
Special Items   
2003 Special Items Pre-Tax charge
of $91million In the fourth quarter of 2003, we decided to
transfer production of our translucent soap manufacturing
operations in Guatemala to our plant in Aurora, Illinois. We
expect to complete this move during the third quarter of 2004.
We are currently seeking a buyer for our operations in
Guatemala. As a result of this decision, we recorded an
impairment charge of $74million and income tax expense of
$22million during the fourth quarter to write down the
book value of those assets, primarily property and equipment, to
the estimated net realizable value of $20million. As of
December31, 2003, our consolidated balance sheet included
$18million in current assets, $07million in
non-current assets and $05million in current liabilities
related to our Guatemala facility. We have classified these
assets and liabilities on the consolidated balance sheet as held
for sale. Additionally in the fourth quarter of 2003, we
recorded a $17million pre-tax charge $17million
after tax primarily for legal expenses incurred in connection
with the pending acquisition by Henkel. See Note1 in this
Form10-K for further details regarding this acquisition.   
2002 Special Items Pre-Tax Gain of
$38million We recorded a net gain of $17million
$09million after-tax associated with the sale of our
Mexico manufacturing facility and the reversal of special item
reserves established in 2001 and 2000 which were deemed no
longer necessary. This was offset in part by a writedown of the
carrying value of our Guatemala manufacturing facility. In
addition, we recorded a $21million gain
$20million after tax associated with the previously
dissolved joint ventures for the reversal of reserves that were
no longer required.   
2001 Special Items Pre-Tax Charge
of $88million On August30, 2001, we announced a special
charge to consolidate manufacturing facilities in the United
States and Argentina. In addition, in the third quarter of 2001
we incurred a special charge in connection with the closure of
our Mexico manufacturing facility. Excluding the
$20million Argentina portion of the charge, which has
been reclassified to discontinued operations, we recorded
charges of $98million $83million after-tax
during 2001. During 2001, we also recorded a $10million
pre-tax gain $05million after-tax for the reversal of
special item reserves established in 2000, which were deemed no
longer necessary. The net charges of $88 million $78 million
after tax recorded against Operating Income in 2001 consist of
$84 million for manufacturing asset sales and writedowns,
discontinued product inventories and other exit activities, as
well as $03 million for selling, general and administrative
expenses related to asset writedowns, severance and other exit
costs. 43 Table of Contents We recorded employee separation charges related
to severance packages for 64 manufacturing employees in the
United States and 69 manufacturing and 33 general, selling and
administrative employees in Mexico. The predominately
involuntary packages were based on salary levels and past
service and were recorded upon acceptance of the package. We wrote down the carrying value of the Compton,
California and Mexico manufacturing plants by approximately
$19million. As a result of the closure of our Mexico
manufacturing facility, some inventory, primarily raw material,
became unusable. Accordingly, a charge was recorded for the
difference between cost and net realizable value. We expensed the $28million cumulative
currency translation adjustment related to our Mexico
operations, which was previously recorded as a charge to other
comprehensive income/loss in stockholders equity.   
Note4.
Discontinued Operations Argentina
Operations. On June30, 2003, we
completed the sale of our discontinued Argentina business to an
entity designated by Southern Cross Group, a private equity
investor in Argentina. The transaction was structured as the
sale of assets of Dial Argentina, S.A., which includes the stock
of its two subsidiaries, Sulfargen, S.A. and The Dial
Corporation SanJuan, S.A. In December 2002, we recorded an
after-tax loss of $624million on the pending sale and
classified our Argentina business as a discontinued operation.
This primarily non-cash loss includes the reversal of
$928million in currency translation adjustments that had
previously been recorded as a reduction of equity and an accrual
for estimated exit and closing costs. This transaction also
resulted in current tax benefits of approximately
$61million, which were utilized during 2003. During 2002,
we recorded $36million in net income $68million
pre-tax from operation of our discontinued Argentina business. Completion of the sale in 2003 resulted in higher
cash proceeds and lower projected exit and closing costs than
originally anticipated. Accordingly, in the second quarter of
2003, we recognized a $21million after-tax
$34million pre-tax reduction in the previously recorded
loss on the disposal of our discontinued Argentina business.
Assets and liabilities of the discontinued Argentina business
included in our consolidated financial statements as of
December31, 2002 were as follows

In the first quarter of 2002, we also recorded an
after-tax impairment charge of $433million for the
Argentina business as a result of adopting SFASNo. 142,
Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, which
established a new method of testing goodwill for impairment. The
impairment was calculated using a discounted cash flow model and
was recorded in our Statement of Consolidated Operations and
Comprehensive Income/loss as a Cumulative effect of the
change in accounting principle and, therefore, is not
included in operating income. The tax rates on the loss on disposal and the
impairment charge in 2002 were 494% and 45%, respectively.
These rates differ from the federal statutory rate in that no
tax benefit was provided on the impairment charge related to
nondeductible goodwill, which becomes fully deductible on the
disposal of Dial Argentina. The combined tax rate for these
related items was 369%. Specialty Personal
Care. On August28, 2001, we
completed the sale of our SPC business. Businesses included in
the sale segment consisted of a variety of skin, hair, bath,
body and foot care products sold under the Freeman and Sarah
Michaels brand names. The sale was in line with our strategy to
fix or jettison under-performing businesses. As a result of the
sale, we recorded an after-tax loss of $1984million
related to the write-off of assets and to record an accrual for
estimated exit costs. Proceeds from the sale were primarily used
to repay debt. As a result of this transaction, we sold the
stock of our wholly-owned subsidiary, Sarah Michaels, Inc., and
the inventories, fixed assets and intangibles of the business,
but retained the related receivables and liabilities arising on
or prior to closing. As consideration for the sale, we received
aggregate purchase price consideration of $120million,
which consisted of $80million in cash and two
subordinated promissory notes in the amount of $20million
each. On December31, 2001, the $40million in
promissory notes had not been recorded by us because of
uncertainties regarding the realizability of such amounts. In
the first quarter of 2002, we entered into an agreement with the
buyer of this business to resolve disputes that arose in
connection with the sale. Under the terms of that agreement, we
received full payment on one of these notes, forgave the other
note and agreed to bear the cost of some disputed expenses. In
the first quarter of 2002, we recorded the $20million
$13million after-tax received as a reduction of the
loss previously recognized on the sale of the business. In the
fourth quarter of 2002, we further reduced the loss previously
recorded on the disposal of the business by $40million
$25million after-tax as a result of reversing certain
exit cost accruals because of lower than expected costs
associated with exiting the discontinued operation. At
December31, 2003, we still have approximately
$130million of accruals related to the discontinued
business, primarily for future operating lease payments. Our loss on the sale included a current tax
benefit of approximately $400million, which was realized
in 2001 and 2002. The loss on the sale is primarily comprised of
the write-off of goodwill and inventories. In addition, the sale
resulted in approximately $523million in capital losses
for which no tax benefits were provided. In the second quarter
of 2003, we utilized $07million of these capital losses.
We will realize additional tax benefits on these capital losses
only to the extent that we generate capital gains before
December31, 2006. The consolidated financial statements included in
this Form10-K have been prepared to reflect our historical
financial position and results of operations and cash flows as
adjusted for the reclassification of the 45 Table of Contents SPC business as a discontinued operation. The
historical results of operations of the business up to its date
of disposition and the estimated loss on the sale are reported
as a discontinued operation in the consolidated financial
statements.   
Note5.
Dial/ Henkel Joint Ventures In April 1999, we formed Dial/ Henkel LLC, a
joint venture with Henkel. Dial and Henkel each owned 50% of
this joint venture. This joint venture was formed to develop and
market a range of enhanced laundry products in North America. In
1999, this joint venture acquired the Custom Cleaner home
dry cleaning business and launched Purex Advanced laundry
detergent. In the third quarter of 2000, the Dial/ Henkel
LLC joint venture discontinued the operations of Purex
Advanced Laundry detergent and in the third quarter of 2001,
discontinued the Custom Cleaner home dry cleaning
business. In the second quarter of 2002, Henkel received
certain intellectual property rights related to the former
Custom Cleaner business in exchange for its interest in
Dial/ Henkel LLC, which did not operate during 2002. We
accounted for our investments in this joint venture under the
equity method of accounting. During 2002, we recorded a
$21million gain related to lower than expected costs of
the joint venture associated with exiting the discontinued
Custom Cleaner business. During 2001, we recorded a
$30million gain from lower than expected marketing costs
of the Custom Cleaner and Purex Advanced
businesses and lower than expected costs of exiting the joint
venture.

In connection with the implementation of

ceased amortizing our intangible assets with indefinite lives.
Amortization expense, net of tax, was approximately
$51$73million pre-taxmillion in 2001, or
$005per diluted share. Accordingly, net loss and net loss
per diluted share, excluding this amortization expense, would
have been $1272million or $138per diluted share in
2001. For the year ended December31, 2003 amortization of
intangibles with definite lives was $02million and is not
expected to materially change in the near future. Effective January1, 2002, we recorded a
$433million after-tax impairment $440million
pre-tax to intangibles as a result of implementing
SFASNo. 142. See Note4 for further discussion of
this impairment charge.

We have outstanding $250million of
70%Senior Notes due 2006, which were issued in 2001. The
Indenture governing these Senior Notes imposes restrictions with
respect to, among other things, our ability to place liens on
certain properties and enter into certain sale and leaseback
transactions. In addition, the Indenture governing these Senior
Notes requires us to purchase from the holders of the Senior
Notes, upon the exercise of such purchase right by each holder,
all or any part of their Senior Notes at a purchase price equal
to 101% of the principal amount of the Senior Notes plus
interest, upon the occurrence of either ia change of
control of Dial that is followed by a rating decline or
iia significant asset sale yielding gross proceeds to us
of $500million or more in the aggregate that is followed
by a rating decline. A rating decline is deemed to
have occurred if, no later than 90days after the public
notice of either the occurrence or intention to effect a change
of control or significant asset sale, either of the rating
agencies assigns a rating to the Senior Notes that is lower than
Baa3, in the case of a rating by Moodys, or BBB-, in the
case of a rating by Standard Poors. We also have outstanding $200million of
65%Senior Notes due 2008, which were issued in 1998. The
Indenture governing these Senior Notes also imposes restrictions
with respect to, among other things, our ability to place liens
on certain properties and enter into certain sale and leaseback
transactions. Credit ratings for our Senior Notes were assigned
by Standard and Poors at BBB-, by Fitchs at BBB and
by Moodys at Baa3. The events of default under the Indentures
governing both of our Senior Notes include the following   
failure to pay principal or interest when due
failure to comply with covenants
commencing any proceeding for bankruptcy,
insolvency or reorganization
48 Table of Contents   
default under any other indebtedness for borrowed
money having an aggregate principal amount outstanding of at
least $50million, which default results in such
indebtedness being declared due and payable prior to its
maturity date
At December31, 2003, we were in compliance
with all covenants under our $250million of
70%Senior Notes due 2006 and our $200million of
65%Senior Notes due 2008. In January 2003, we entered into two interest
rate swap contracts that effectively changed the interest rate
on a portion of our Senior Notes from fixed to variable. We
designated the swaps as fair value hedges. Accordingly, the fair
value of the swaps was recorded as an asset and the carrying
value of the underlying debt was increased by an equal amount in
accordance with SFASNo133. The $200million
notional value of the interest rate swaps, which expire in
September 2008, effectively converted approximately 45% of our
total debt to variable interest rate debt. Under the interest
rate swaps, we pay a variable rate of interest based on the
6-month LIBOR plus 278basis points and receive a fixed
interest rate of 65%. Variable interest rates are paid and
reset semi-annually. The swaps expose us to the risk of changes
in the LIBOR based interest rates. Each 50basis point
change in the swaps floating rate would change pre-tax
interest expense by $1million. In 2001, we entered into two interest rate swap
contracts that effectively converted our $250million
70%Senior Notes due in 2006 to floating rate debt. We
designated the swaps as fair value hedges. In 2002, the swaps
were terminated resulting in a net gain of $134million.
The gain is recorded with total reported debt and is being
amortized as a reduction of interest expense over the remaining
term of the $250million 70%Senior Notes due in
2006. The amortization of the gain effectively reduces the
interest rate on these notes to 56% annually. During the first quarter of 2003, we renewed the
$100million short-term commitment portion of our
$200million revolving credit facility until March 2004.
The remaining $100million long-term portion of our credit
facility, due in March 2005, has remained unchanged. The credit
facility requires us to pay commitment fees to the lenders.
Borrowings under the facility bear interest at our option, at
the banks prime rate or LIBOR plus a credit spread that
ranges from 0475% to 1125% depending on our current credit
rating. The commitment fees paid for the facility also vary
depending on our debt ratings. As of December31, 2003,
there were no amounts outstanding under our credit facility. Due
to our pending acquisition by Henkel, we do not expect to renew
the $1000million of commitments that expire in March 2004. Under our credit facility, we are required to
maintain minimum net worth of $100million plus 50% of net
income if positive earned from the date of the facility. For
purposes of calculating our minimum net worth, we exclude
foreign currency translation gains or losses, gains or losses
relating to any sale or other disposition of our Argentina
business and the Armour food business and the $433million
after-tax impairment charge taken in the first quarter of 2002
for Argentina. We also are limited to a maximum ratio of funded
debt to earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and
amortization EBITDAof 30 to 10. At December31,
2003, we were in compliance with this requirement as our funded
debt to EBITDA ratio was 161 to 10. Our credit facility also
limits our ability to incur additional unsecured indebtedness,
sell, lease or transfer assets, enter into sale and leaseback
transactions, place liens on properties and complete certain
acquisitions without our lenders consent. The events of default under this
$200million credit facility include the following   
failure to pay principal or interest when due
failure to comply with covenants, representations
and warranties under the credit agreement
default in the payment of, or failure to comply
with covenants relating to, other indebtedness with a principal
amount outstanding of at least $15million
default under any material contract which results
in liabilities or damages in excess of $25million
commencing any proceeding for bankruptcy,
insolvency or reorganization
entry of a final, non-appealable judgment in
excess of $25million
49 Table of Contents   
a change in control of Dial
As a result of our pending acquisition by Henkel,
we were not in compliance with the change in control covenant
under our $200million credit facility at December31,
2003. We have entered into a temporary waiver agreement with our
lenders until April30, 2004 with respect to this event of
default. Interest expense incurred in 2003, 2002 and 2001
was, in thousands, $25,676, $29,922 and $36,797, respectively.

SFASNo109, Accounting for
Income Taxes requires that a valuation allowance be
established when it is more likely than not that all or a
portion of a deferred tax asset will not be realized. Changes in
the valuation allowance from period to period are included in
the tax provision in the period of change. In determining
whether a valuation allowance is required, we take into account
all evidence with regard to utilization of the deferred tax
asset including our past earnings history, expected future
earnings, the character and jurisdiction of such earnings,
unsettled circumstances that, if unfavorably resolved, would
adversely affect utilization of a deferred tax asset, carryback
and carryforward periods, and tax strategies that could
potentially enhance the likelihood of realization of a deferred
tax asset. At December31, 2002, we had a full
valuation allowance for $194million of deferred tax
assets related to a $523million capital loss from the
sale of the Specialty Personal Care business. In 2003, we
utilized $07million of that capital loss. The remaining
$516million capital loss can only be utilized to offset
future net capital gains, and will expire on December31,
2006. As of December31, 2003, we continue to maintain a
full valuation allowance against the remaining $191 of
potential future tax benefits relating to the capital loss
carryforward, and we will to continue to maintain a full
valuation allowance on those potential future tax benefits until
it is more likely than not that the capital losses will be
utilized. U.S. Income tax is not provided when foreign
earnings are indefinitely reinvested in accordance with
Accounting Principles Board Opinion No23,
Accounting for Income Taxes, Special Areas. We
determine whether our foreign subsidiaries have invested or will
invest a significant portion of their undistributed earnings
indefinitely. We reassess our determination on a periodic basis.
Changes to our determination may be warranted based on our
experience as well as plans regarding future international
operations, and expected tax remittances. Changes in the
determination from period to period are included in our tax
provision in the period of change. As a result of the net asset
impairment on our Guatemalan manufacturing facility and
managements decision to transfer operations to the United
States, we determined that the accumulated earnings of those
operations were no longer indefinitely reinvested. As of
December31, 2003 and December31, 2002 we had not
provided for any U.S. taxes on approximately $10million
and $140million, respectively, of undistributed earnings
from our non-U.S. subsidiaries since these earnings are
indefinitely reinvested. Note 13.Pension
and Other Benefits Pension Plans.
Trusteed, noncontributory pension
plans cover substantially all employees, with benefit levels
supplemented in most cases by defined matching contributions to
employees 401k plans. We amended the pension plan to
calculate benefits using an age and pay-based credit formula,
beginning January1, 2001. Under the former plan, defined
benefits were based primarily on final average salary and years
of service. The accrued pension benefit under the former plan
was frozen as of December31, 2000, and 51 Table of Contents will grow to reflect increases in employees
base pay. Funding policies provide that payments to defined
benefit pension trusts shall be at least equal to the minimum
funding required by applicable regulations. The following tables provide information on the

At December31, 2003 and 2002, the equity
securities of the plans included 84,367 shares of common stock
of the Company, valued at $24million 1% of total plan
assets and $17million 1% of total plan assets,
respectively. Our investment strategy is designed to provide
funding for the full satisfaction of our pension plan benefit
liabilities, while at the same time minimizing our contributions
to the Pension Trust. The investment strategy is the product of
an analysis that considers the following factors: the expected
investment returns of various asset classes, the expected
volatility of those asset classes, the funded status of our
pension plans, the timing and amount of future pension benefit
payments, and economic variables such as interest rates,
inflation, etc. that could impact any of these items. We have determined, with the assistance of a
pension investment consultant and an actuarial consultant, that
75% to 80% of the pension trust assets can be invested in asset
classes with higher expected returns and higher expected
volatility such as domestic and international equities and
private equity partnerships. The equity portion of the Pension
Trust investment portfolio is designed to produce higher total
investment returns over the long term, meeting longer-term
pension benefit obligations while minimizing our required
contributions. The remaining 20% to 25% of the pension assets
are invested in asset classes such as U.S. fixed income
securities that have a lower expected return, but lower expected
volatility as well. The fixed income portfolio is designed to
provide more stable returns so that the pension trust has
satisfactory funding and liquidity to meet projected pension
benefit payments over the next five to eight years. Defined Contribution
Plans. We maintain two 401k defined
contribution plans whereby employees can contribute up to 21% of
their total pay. We contribute to these plans throughout the
year. For the years ended December31, 2003, 2002, and
2001, defined contribution plan expense was, in thousands 5,844, $6,128 and $5,613, respectively. Multi-Employer Pension
Plans. We participate in one
multi-employer pension plan. For the years ended
December31, 2003, 2002, and 2001, our related costs were,
in thousands, $1,639, $1,612 and $1,713, respectively. Post-Retirement Benefits Other Than
Pensions We have defined benefit post-retirement plans
that provide medical and life insurance for eligible employees,
retirees and dependents. In addition, we retained the
obligations for such benefits for eligible retirees of Armour
and Company sold in 1983. On December8, 2003, the President signed
into law the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement and
Modernization Act of 2003, which provides a prescription drug
benefit under Medicare, as well as a federal subsidy to sponsors
of retiree health care benefit plans. In accordance with the
related FASB Staff Position No106-1, we have elected to
defer recognition of this legislation until specific accounting
guidance is available. Accordingly, our accumulated post
retirement benefit obligations and post retirement benefit 54 Table of Contents expense do not reflect the impact of this
legislation. The issuance of specific authoritative guidance on
accounting for the federal subsidy by the FASB is currently
pending, and when issued, could require changes to previously
reported information. We accrue post-retirement benefits other than
pensions during the years that the eligible employees provide
services. The status of the plans is as follows as of

Note 14.Stock
Options On August15, 1996, we were spun-off from
our former parent. Options granted between 1990 and 1996 to
certain officers and employees to acquire our common stock were
granted under our former parents stock option plans. These
options have been adjusted for stock splits and the spin-off.
These options were granted at the market prices on the dates of
grant, became exercisable 50% after one year and 100% after two
years and expire after 10years. No additional options will
be granted under these plans. We adopted The Dial Corporation Stock Incentive
Plan in 1996 1996 Plan, which is administered by
the Executive Compensation Committee of our Board of Directors.
Under the 1996 Plan, the aggregate number of shares of common
and preferred stock covered by awards to any one individual
cannot exceed 1,000,000 shares for any three-year period and no
more than 9,600,000 shares are cumulatively available for
options intended to qualify as incentive stock
options under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 as amended
the Code. In 2003, the Plan was amended such that
the maximum number of shares of stock that may be made the
subject of awards granted under the Plan shall be 5million
shares, plus the number of shares subject to outstanding awards
under the Plan as of June27, 2003. The term of the options
is 10years for options granted in 2002 and prior. For
options granted subsequent to 2002, the term of the options is
7years. The Plan provides that options are generally to be
granted at the market price on the date of grant; however, the
Executive Compensation Committee may grant options at less than
such market price. The 1996 Plan also 56 Table of Contents authorizes the issuance of stock appreciation
rights and restricted stock. During the year ended
December31, 2003, 50,000 shares of restricted stock were
awarded. Under the 1996 Plan, options to purchase
3,147,249 shares were granted at the market price on the dates
of grant during 2003. These options, which are all classified as
non-qualified options, become one-third exercisable
after one year, two-thirds exercisable after two years, and 100%
exercisable after three years. The options expire after
10years. During 2003, options to purchase 78,400 shares
were also granted to non-employee members of the Board of
Directors at the market price on the date of grant. The options
issued are 50% exercisable after one year and 100% after two
years. The options expire after 10years. A summary of the status of our stock option plans
as of December31, 2003, and changes during the fiscal

No25 and related interpretations in accounting for our
stock option plans. We have adopted the disclosure-only
provisions of SFAS No123, Accounting for
Stock-Based Compensation, as amended by SFAS No148.
Accordingly, no compensation cost has been recognized for the
stock option plans. Had compensation cost for our stock option
plans been determined based on the fair value at the grant date
consistent with the provisions of SFAS No123 and the
amendment of SFAS No148, our net income/loss and net
income/loss per share would have been reduced to the pro forma
amounts indicated below. Average assumptions used in determining the
estimated fair value of stock options under the Black-Scholes
valuation model, and the estimated fair values are as follows.

We adopted the Dial Corporation Employee Stock
Purchase Plan ESPP in 2000. Under this plan, up to
650,000 shares of common stock may be purchased by eligible Dial
employees through payroll deductions of up to 15% of their
eligible compensation, not to exceed $25,000. The purchase price
is equal to the lesser of a85% of the fair market value
of the stock on first day of the offering period or b85%
of the fair market value of the stock on the last day of the
offering period. During 2003, employees purchased approximately 58 Table of Contents 50,840 shares under this Plan. Due to the pending
Merger with Henkel, employees are not presently permitted to
purchase shares under the ESPP. Note
15.Leases Certain sales offices, warehouses and
administration offices and equipment are leased. These leases
expire in periods ranging generally from one to five years, and
some provide for renewal options ranging from one to eight
years. Leases that expire are generally renewed or replaced by
similar leases, depending on business needs at that time. Net
rent paid in 2003, 2002 and 2001 totaled, in thousands, $11,020 12,186, $13,032, respectively. At December31, 2003, our future minimum
rental payments and anticipated rental income with respect to
non-cancelable operating subleases with terms in excess of one
year were as follows, in thousands

Future anticipated rental income is the result of
sub-lease agreements on non-cancelable leases that we hold. The
total rental obligations related to these sub-leases for 2004,
2005 and 2006 in thousands, are $2,501, $1,878, and $1,221,
respectively. We have accrued for the difference between the
lease obligations and the expected sub-lease income related to
our discontinued operations and closed plants, where applicable. Note
16.Financial Instruments with
Off-Balance-Sheet Risk and Fair Value of Financial
Instruments   
Financial Instruments with
Off-Balance-Sheet Risk Our use of financial instruments is limited to
purposes other than trading and primarily includes management of
interest and commodity expense. We may use financial instruments
for the management of interest rate risk or other risks in the
future.   
Interest Rate Risk Management At December31, 2003, we had
$4472million in long-term debt outstanding, comprised of
$200million $1990million net of issue discount of
65% Senior Notes due 2008, and $250million $2482
million net of issue discount of 70% Senior Notes due 2006.
Our Senior Notes have fixed interest rates to maturity. In January 2003, we entered into two interest
rate swap contracts that effectively changed the interest rate
on a portion of our Senior Notes from fixed to variable. The
total notional value of the interest rate swaps that expire in
September 2008 is $200million, effectively converting 45%
of our total debt to variable interest rate debt. Under the
terms of the swaps, we pay a variable rate of interest based on
the 6-month LIBOR plus 278 basis points and receive a fixed
interest rate of 65%. Variable interest rates are paid and
reset semi-annually, in March and September. The six-month LIBOR
rate on September15, 2003 was 118%. The swaps expose us
to the risk of changes in LIBOR based interest rates. Each 50
basis point change in the swaps floating rate would change
our pre-tax interest expense by $1million. At the time of the issuance of the
$250million 7% Senior Notes due 2006, we entered into two
interest rate swaps, which together were designated as fair
value hedges of that issue. The interest rate swaps had a total
notional amount of $250million. In August of 2002, the
interest rate swaps were terminated resulting in a net gain of
$134million. The gain on the termination of the swaps was
deferred and is classified as a part of long-term debt. This
deferred gain is being amortized over the remaining term of the
$250million 7% Senior Notes as a reduction of interest
expense. The amortization of the gain on the terminated swaps
effectively reduces the fixed rate of the $250million 7%
Senior Notes to approximately 56% annually. We are currently investing our accumulated cash
balance in a variety of short-term investment vehicles with low
principal risk. The weighted average yield on the invested cash
at December31, 2003 was 128%. 59 Table of Contents Each 50 basis point change in the yield on the
invested cash would result in an approximate $15 million change
in the Other expenses, net line on our income statement.   
Foreign Currency We are currently exposed to risks from
fluctuations in the U.S. Dollar/ Canadian Dollar foreign
currency exchange rate. At December31, 2003, one U.S.
Dollar was worth 13 Canadian Dollars. For the year ended
December31, 2003, the U.S. Dollar/ Canadian Dollar
exchange rate fluctuated between 1:16 and 1:13. If there were
a 10% change in the exchange rates for the U.S. Dollar to the
Canadian Dollar from those at December31, 2003, the
foreign currency gain or loss would be immaterial.   
Employee Benefit Plan Expense We offer our directors and management deferred
compensation plans. In 2003, participants could defer a portion
of their compensation into a combination of Dial stock units or
various cash accounts. For deferrals made into stock units,
deferred compensation due to participants is included on the
balance sheet in stockholders equity under the caption
Unearned employee benefits with no
recognition of any investment gains or losses. The deferred
funds are placed in a Rabbi Trust using shares of Dial common
stock. The trust is also included on the balance sheet in
stockholders equity under the caption Unearned
employee benefits. For deferrals into cash accounts, deferred
compensation due to participants and any accumulated investment
gains or losses is included on the balance sheet as a liability
under the captions Post-retirement and other employee
benefits and Other liabilities. We
place the deferred funds in a Rabbi Trust, which purchases life
insurance policies on the participants lives, with Dial as
the beneficiary. The policies have a cash surrender value that
accrues tax-free earnings largely based on the performance of
the SP 500. The cash surrender value asset and any
accumulated investment gains or losses are included on the
balance sheet as an asset under the caption Pension and
other assets. Participants in the deferred compensation plans
are not presently able to defer any portion of their
compensation into Dial stock units, due to the pending Merger
with Henkel. However, they will continue to be able to defer
into cash accounts.   
Fair Value of Financial
Instruments The carrying values of cash and cash equivalents,
receivables, accounts payable and short-term bank borrowings
approximate fair values due to the short-term maturities of
these instruments. The fair value of our Senior Notes is
estimated based upon quoted market prices. The fair value of the
Senior Notes was $4922million at December31, 2003. Note 17.Segments
of an Enterprise We are organized into two business segments:
iDomestic Branded and ii International and Other. The
segments were identified based on the economic characteristics,
types of products sold, the customer base and method of
distribution. Effective January1, 2002, we began to
include the International operating segment in the International
and Other business segment due to its immaterial size. Prior to
January1, 2002, we included sales of industrial chemicals,
which includes soap pellets and chemicals, principally glycerin
and fatty acids that are by-products of the soap making process,
in the International and Other business segment. Effective
January1, 2002, we began to include industrial chemicals
in the Personal Care operating segment within the Domestic
Branded business segment. Prior to the fourth quarter of 2001,
we included discontinued product activity in the International
and Other business segment. In the fourth quarter of 2001, we
began to include discontinued activity in the business segment
that launched the product. The historical segment information
has been restated to reflect the changes. In the third quarter of 2003, we completed the
sale of our Argentina business and on August28, 2001 we
disposed of our SPC segment. The segment information has been
restated to reflect historical segment 60 Table of Contents information as adjusted for the reclassification
of the Argentina Business and Specialty Personal Care segment as
discontinued operations. The Domestic Branded business segment consists of
four aggregated operating segments that manufacture and market
non-durable consumer packaged goods through grocery store, drug
store and mass merchandiser retail outlets. It is comprised of
the Personal Care, Laundry Care, Air Fresheners and Food
Products operating segments. Our subsidiary, ISC International,
Ltd., a manufacturer of translucent soaps, is included in the
Personal Care operating segment. The following table sets forth

Our International and Other business segment
includes our commercial markets and international businesses.
Our international operations are focused in Canada, Puerto Rico
and exports to Asia and Latin America. During 2003, 2002 and
2001, approximately 84%, 82% and 72%, respectively, of our
international sales came from these markets. In total,
international sales represent 52%, 44% and 46% of sales in
2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively. Our commercial markets
business sells our products, both branded and non-branded,
through the commercial channel to hotels, hospitals, schools and
other institutional customers. Information as to our operations in different
business segments is set forth below. The calculation of
operating income/loss for each segment includes an allocation
of certain general and administrative expenses based on each
segments share of consolidated net sales. The accounting
policies of the business segments are the same as those
described in the summary of significant accounting policies

Note19.Litigation
and Claims On December16, 2003, Mr.Jeffrey
Berger C.A. No116-N filed a complaint in the Delaware
Court of Chancery, New Castle County against us, our directors
and Henkel, purporting to represent a class of all of our
stockholders except the defendants and any person, firm, trust,
corporation, or other entity related to or affiliated with any
of the defendants who are or will be threatened with injury
arising from the actions of the defendants. The complaint
alleges, among other things, that our board of directors
breached its fiduciary duties by agreeing to enter into the
Merger Agreement with Henkel on the terms provided in the Merger
Agreement. The complaint also seeks various forms of relief,
including preliminary and permanent injunctive relief to prevent
the closing of the Merger. On January12, 2004 we filed a
motion to dismiss this complaint for failure to state a claim
upon which relief may be granted and a motion to stay discovery
in the action pending decision on the motion to dismiss. We, our
directors and Henkel believe that the allegations in this
complaint are without merit and we intend to vigorously defend
against the allegations asserted in the complaint. On December16, 2003, Messrs.Jeffrey
Silverberg CV2003-023979 and Steven Rose CV2003-023974 and,
on December17, 2003, Ms.Mary Crescente
CV2003-024012, each filed separate complaints in the Arizona
Superior Court, Maricopa County against us and our directors,
each purporting to represent a class of all of our stockholders
except any person, firm, trust, corporation or other entity
related to 62 Table of Contents or affiliated with any defendant who are being
and will be harmed by the actions of the defendants. The
complaints allege, among other things, that our board of
directors breached its fiduciary duties by engaging in
self-dealing by receiving personal benefits under the terms of
the Merger Agreement with Henkel, and by potentially entering
into an unfair transaction with Henkel. On January21,
2004, we filed motions to dismiss these complaints, or, in the
alternative, to stay these actions in preference to the action
filed by Mr.Berger in the Delaware Court of Chancery. On
January26, 2004, the Arizona Superior Court consolidated
these actions. We and our directors believe the allegations in
these complaints are without merit and we intend to vigorously
defend against the allegations asserted in these complaints. On
March1, 2004, the Arizona Superior Court granted our
motion to stay the Arizona cases pending the outcome of the
Delaware cases. On January6, 2004, Ms.Susan Soder
C.A. No154-N filed a complaint in the Delaware Court of
Chancery, New Castle County against us, our directors and
Henkel, purporting to represent a class of all of our
stockholders except the defendants and any person, firm, trust,
corporation, or other entity related to or affiliated with any
of the defendants who are or will be threatened with injury
arising from the actions of the defendants. The complaint
alleges, among other things, that our board of directors
breached its fiduciary duties by agreeing to enter into the
Merger Agreement on the terms provided in the Merger Agreement.
The complaint also seeks various forms of relief, including
preliminary and permanent injunctive relief to prevent the
closing of the Merger. On January13, 2004, counsel for
Ms.Soder informed the Delaware Court of Chancery that
Ms.Soder did not intend to serve the summonses on the
defendants in this case at that time. We, our directors and
Henkel believe that the allegations in this complaint are
without merit and we intend to vigorously defend against the
allegations asserted in the complaint. As we previously disclosed, we were defending a
lawsuit filed by the U.S.Equal Employment Opportunity
Commission EEOC, which was pending in the
U.S.District Court for the Northern District of Illinois,
Eastern Division, and was entitled Equal Employment Opportunity
Commissionv. The Dial Corporation, Civil Action
No99 C 3356. The EEOC alleged that we engaged in a
pattern and practice of discrimination against a class of female
employees at our Aurora, Illinois manufacturing facility by
subjecting them to sexual harassment and not taking prompt
remedial action after these employees complained. Most of the
potential claimants allegations relate to incidences that
allegedly occurred prior to 1996. The EEOC sought injunctive
relief and unspecified compensatory and punitive damages. On
April29, 2003, we announced that we had reached a
settlement with the EEOC that involved a payment of
$10million by Dial, which will be made in the first
quarter of 2004. As is the case with many companies, we also face
exposure to actual or potential claims and lawsuits involving
our business and assets. We are currently party to a number of
lawsuits consisting of ordinary, routine litigation incidental
to our business, including general and product liability and
workers compensation claims. We believe that any
liabilities resulting from these claims, after taking into
account amounts already accrued and exclusive of any potential
insurance recovery, should not have a material adverse effect on
our financial position, cash flows or operating results. We are subject to a variety of environmental and
health and safety laws in each jurisdiction in which we operate.
These laws and regulations pertain to our present and past
operations. Although we do not anticipate that the costs to
comply with environmental laws and regulations will have a
material adverse effect on our capital expenditures, earnings or
competitive position, the emergence of unforeseen claims and
liabilities or the imposition of increasingly stringent laws,
regulations and enforcement policies could result in material,
unreserved costs in the future. Since 1980, we have received
notices or requests for information with respect to
Superfund sites under the federal Comprehensive
Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act,
including one site for which we have executed a consent decree
to settle our liability and are awaiting final court approval.
