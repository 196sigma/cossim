Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements
1. DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS   Modis  Professional  Services,  Inc.  formerly  known as  AccuStaff
Incorporated, including all subsidiaries unless the context requires otherwise,
Modis, or the Company, is an international provider of business services,
including  consulting,  training and outsourcing  services to businesses,
professional and service organizations and governmental agencies through a
branch office network of approximately 264 offices throughout the United States,
Canada, United Kingdom and continental Europe. The Company ongoing business is
organized into two divisions: the Information Technology division and the
Professional Services division, which generated 684% and 316% of the Company
fiscal 1998 revenue from continuing operations, respectively.
2.  SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES Basis of Consolidation
The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company
and its wholly owned subsidiaries. All material intercompany transactions have
been eliminated in the accompanying consolidated financial statements.
Cash and Cash Equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents include deposits in banks, government securities,
money market funds, and short-term investments with maturities, when acquired,
of 90 days or less.
Furniture, Equipment, and Leasehold Improvements
Furniture, equipment, and leasehold improvements are recorded at cost less
accumulated depreciation and amortization.  Depreciation of furniture and
equipment is computed using the straight-line method over the estimated useful
lives of the assets, ranging from 5 to 15 years. Amortization of leasehold
improvements is computed using the straight-line method over the useful life of
the asset or the term of the lease, whichever is shorter. Costs associated with
the development of the Company proprietary software package have been deferred
and are being amortized over a five-year period. Total depreciation and
amortization expense was $10,973, $4,871 and $3,055 for 1998, 1997 and 1996,
respectively. Accumulated depreciation and amortization of furniture, equipment
and leasehold improvements as of December 31, 1998 and 1997 was $40,432 and
$29,459, respectively.
Goodwill
The Company has allocated the purchase price of acquired companies
according to the fair market value of the assets acquired. Goodwill represents
the excess of the cost over the fair value of the net tangible assets acquired
through these acquisitions, including any contingent consideration paid as
discussed in Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, and is being
amortized on a straight-line basis over periods ranging from 15 to 40 years.
Management periodically reviews the potential impairment of goodwill on a
undiscounted cash flow basis to assess recoverability. If the estimated future
cash flows are projected to be less than the carrying amount, an impairment
write-down representing the carrying amount of the goodwill that exceeds the
undiscounted expected future cash flows would be recorded as a period expense.
Accumulated amortization was $51,846 and $25,714 as of December 31, 1998 and
1997, respectively. See Note 12 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for
discussion of goodwill impairment charge.
Revenue Recognition
The Company recognizes as revenue, at the time the professional services
are provided, the amounts billed to clients. In all such cases, the consultant
is the Company employee and all costs of employing the worker are the
responsibility of the Company and are included in the cost of services.
Foreign Operations
The financial position and operating results of foreign operations are
consolidated using the local currency as the functional currency. Local currency
assets and liabilities are translated at the rate of exchange to the U.S. dollar
on the balance sheet date, and the local currency revenues and expenses are
translated at average rates of exchange to the U.S. dollar during the period.
Foreign currency translation gains and losses during fiscal 1998 and 1997 were
not material and have not been segregated in the Company Statement of
Stockholders' Equity.
Stock Based Compensation
During 1995, the Financial Accounting Standards Board FASB issued SFAS
No. 123, Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation, which encourages all
companies to recognize compensation expense based on the fair value, at grant
date, of instruments issued pursuant to stock-based compensation plans. SFAS No.
123 requires the fair value of the instruments granted, which is measured
pursuant to the provisions of the statement, to be recognized as compensation
expense over the vesting period of the instrument. However, the statement also
allows companies to continue to measure compensation costs for these instruments
using the method of accounting prescribed by Accounting Principles Board Opinion
No. 25 APB No. 25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees. Companies
electing to account for stock-based  compensation plans pursuant to the
provisions of APB No. 25 must make pro forma disclosures of net income as if the
fair value method defined in SFAS No. 123 had been applied. The Company has
elected to account for stock options under the provisions of APB No. 25 and has
included the disclosures required by SFAS No. 123 in Note 9 to the Consolidated
Financial Statements.
Income Taxes
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the expected future
tax consequences of events that have been included in the financial statements
or tax returns in accordance with SFAS No. 109, Accounting for Income Taxes.
Under this method, deferred tax liabilities and assets are determined based on
the differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and the tax
basis of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect for the year
in which the differences are expected to reverse.
Net Income Per Common Share
Basic and diluted net income per common share are presented in accordance
with SFAS No. 128, Earnings per Share. Basic net income per common share is
computed by dividing net income by the weighted average number of shares
outstanding. Diluted net income per common share includes the dilutive effect of
convertible debentures and stock options.
Comprehensive Income
During 1997, the FASB issued SFAS No. 130, Reporting Comprehensive Income,
which requires that changes in comprehensive income be shown in a financial
statement that is displayed with the same prominence as other financial
statements. This statement is effective for the Company 1998 fiscal year.
Management does not believe that the Company has material other comprehensive
income that would require separate disclosure.
Pervasiveness of Estimates
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted
accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that
affect the reported amount of assets and liabilities and disclosure of
contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and
the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period.
Although management believes these estimates and assumptions are adequate,
actual results may differ from the estimates and assumptions used.
Reclassifications
Certain amounts have been reclassified in 1996 and 1997 to conform to the
1998 presentation.
Recent Accounting Pronouncements
During 1998, the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants'
Executive Committee issued Statement of Position Number 98-1 SOP 98-1,
Accounting for the Cost of Computer Software Developed or Obtained for Internal
Use. SOP 98-1 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 1998.
Management believes that the Company is substantially in compliance with this
pronouncement and that the implementation of this pronouncement will not have a
material effect on the Company consolidated financial position, results of
operations or cash flows. Implementation is planned for fiscal 1999.
During 1998, the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants'
Executive Committee issued Statement of Position Number 98-5 SOP 98-5,
Reporting on the Costs of Start-Up Activities. SOP 98-5 is effective for
fiscal years beginning after December 15, 1998. Management does not believe that
its adoption will have a material effect on the Company consolidated financial
position or results of operations. Implementation is planned for fiscal 1999.
In June 1998, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Statement of
Financial Accounting Standards SFAS No. 133, Accounting for Derivative
Instruments and for Hedging Activities. SFAS No. 133 establishes accounting and
reporting standards requiring that every derivative instrument be recorded on
the balance sheet as either an asset or liability measured at fair value. SFAS
No. 133 requires that changes in a derivative fair value be recognized
currently in earnings unless specific hedge accounting criteria are met. Special
accounting for qualifying hedges allows a derivative gains and losses to
offset related results on the hedged item in the income statement and requires
that a company formally document, designate and assess the effectiveness of
transactions that receive hedge accounting. SFAS No. 133 is effective for fiscal
years beginning after June 15, 1999, and cannot be applied retroactively. We
have not yet quantified the impacts of adopting SFAS No. 133 on our financial
statements; however, SFAS No. 133 could increase the volatility of reported
earnings and other comprehensive income once adopted.
Unaudited Pro Forma Data
The McKinley Group, Inc. McKinley and HJM Consulting, Inc. HJM, prior
to their acquisition by the Company, had elected to be treated as S Corporations
for federal and state income tax purposes. As such, the taxable income of each
company was reported to and subject to tax to its respective shareholders. The
unaudited pro forma data on the 1996 consolidated statement of income provides
approximate federal and state income taxes by applying statutory income tax
rates that would have been incurred if McKinley and HJM had been subject to tax
as a C Corporation.

In addition, the Company is obligated under various acquisition agreements
to make earn-out payments to former stockholders of aforementioned acquired
companies accounted for under the purchase method of accounting, over periods up

Prior to the sale of the Company Commercial operations and Teleservices
division, the Company had a $500 million credit facility which was syndicated to
a group of 20 banks with NationsBank, N.A. as the principal agent. This facility
was unsecured, but guaranteed by each of the Company subsidiaries. Immediately
subsequent to the sale of the Company Commercial and Teleservices divisions,
the existing facility was paid-off, and terminated. Repayment of the existing
facility totaled $477,000.
On October 30, 1998, the Company entered into a new $500 million revolving
credit facility which is syndicated to a group of 13 banks with NationsBank,
N.A. as the principal agent. The facility expires on October 21, 2003.
Outstanding amounts under the credit facility will bear interest at certain
floating rates as specified by the credit facility. The credit facility contains
certain financial and non-financial  covenants relating to the Company
operations, including maintaining certain financial ratios. Repayments of the
credit facility is guaranteed by the material subsidiaries of the Company. In
addition, approval is required by the majority of the lenders at such time that
the cash consideration of an individual acquisition exceeds 10% of consolidated
stockholders' equity of the Company. The Company incurred certain costs directly
related to securing the credit facility in the amount of approximately $788.
These costs have been capitalized and are being amortized over the life of the
credit facility.
On October 16, 1995, Career Horizons, Inc., issued $8625 million of 7%
Convertible Senior Notes Due 2002 which were assumed by the Company pursuant to
the merger with Career Horizons, Inc. Interest on the notes were paid
semiannually on May 1 and November 1 of each year. The Notes were convertible at
the option of the holder thereof, unless previously redeemed, into shares of
common stock of the Company at a conversion price of $1135 per share. The Notes
were redeemable, in whole or in part, at the option of the Company, at any time
on or after November 1, 1998, at stated redemption prices, together with accrued
interest. The Company called the Notes on October 1, 1998, to be either redeemed
or converted as of November 1, 1998. Prior to November 1, 1998, $1645 million
of Notes were redeemed by the Company at a premium of $713 million, and $698
million were converted into shares of common stock of the Company.
During the fourth quarter of fiscal 1998, the Company recognized an
extraordinary after-tax charge of $561 million as a result of the Company
early retirement of $1645 million of 7% Convertible Senior Notes Due 2002 and
the termination of the Company existing credit facility immediately subsequent
to the sale of the Company Commercial operations and Teleservices division.
The Company paid a premium of $713 million on the early extinguishment of
the 7% Senior Convertible Senior Notes and wrote off $037 million of related
unamortized debt issuance costs. Additionally, the Company wrote off $163
million of unamortized debt financing costs related to the termination of the
credit facility.

Management has determined, based on the history of prior taxable earnings and
its expectations for the future, taxable income will more likely than not be
sufficient to fully realize deferred tax assets and, accordingly, has not
reduced deferred tax assets by a valuation allowance. 8.  EMPLOYEE BENEFIT PLANS
Profit Sharing Plans
The Company has a qualified contributory profit sharing plan a 401k
plan which covers all full-time employees over age twenty-one with over 90 days
of employment and 375 hours of service. The Company made contributions of
approximately $6,060, net of forfeitures, to the profit sharing plan for fiscal
1998. No matching contributions were made by the Company to the profit sharing
plan in fiscal 1997 or 1996. The Company also has a non-qualified deferred
compensation plan for its highly compensated employees. The non-qualified
deferred  compensation  plan does not provide for any matching,  either
discretionay or formula-based, by the Company.
The Company has assumed many 401k plans of acquired subsidiaries. From
time to time, the Company merges these plans into the Company plan. Effective
January 1, 1998, a significant number of the profit sharing plans were merged
and amended to become contributory plans. Pursuant to the terms of the various
profit sharing plans, the Company will match 50% of employee contributions up to
the first 5% of total eligible compensation, as defined. Company contributions
relating to these merged plans are included in the aforementioned total.
Prior to the Company sale of its Commercial operations and Teleservices
division, as discussed in Note 16 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, the
Company had two 401k plans: the aforementioned plan covering professional and
IT employees, and one covering non-highly compensated as defined by IRS
regulations full time commercial employees over age twenty-one with at least
one year of employment and 1,000 hours of service the 'commercial plan'. In
connection with the sale, the Company transferred sponsorship of the commercial
plan to Randstad U.S., L.P. The effective date of the transfer was September 27,
1998. Company contributions relating to the commercial plan prior to the
Company sale of its commercial businesses are included in Income from
Discontinued Operations, as disclosed in Note 16 to the Consolidated Financial
Statements. 9. STOCKHOLDERS' EQUITY 
Public Offerings of Common Stock
In April 1996, the Company completed an offering for the sale of 11,790,000
shares of common stock. The Company received $304,900 from the sale of the
shares, net of underwriting discount and expenses associated with the offering.
The net proceeds were used to repay all outstanding indebtedness under the
Company credit facility, which was approximately $92,800. The remaining
proceeds have been used primarily to fund acquisitions.
The Company subsidiary, Career Horizons, Inc., prior to the date of the
merger with the Company, completed offerings in which Career issued 8,227,575
shares of common stock, adjusted for the conversion to the Company shares of
common stock, in which Career received $119,777, net of underwriting discounts
and expenses associated with the offerings. Career used a portion of the
proceeds from its initial offering to repay subordinated notes.
Stock Repurchase Plan
On October 31, 1998, the Company Board of Directors authorized the
repurchase of up to $2000 million of the Company common stock pursuant to a
share buyback program. On December 4, 1998, the Company Board of Directors
increased the authorized repurchase by an additional $1100 million, bringing
the total authorized share buyback program amount to $3100 million. As of
December 31, 1998, the Company had repurchased approximately 21,751,000 shares
under the share buyback program. Included in the shares repurchased as of
December 31, 1998 were approximately 6,150,000 shares repurchased under an
accelerated stock acquisition plan ASAP. The Company entered into the ASAP
with a certain investment bank who agreed to sell the Company shares at a
certain cost. The investment bank borrowed these shares from its customers and
was required to enter into market transactions, subject to Company approval, and
purchase shares to return to its customers. The Company, pursuant to the
agreement, agreed to compensate the investment bank for any increases in the
Company stock price that would cause the investment bank to pay an amount to
purchase the stock over the ASAP price. Conversely, the Company received a
refund in the purchase price if the Company stock price fell below the ASAP
price. Subsequent to December 31, 1998, the Company used refunded proceeds from
the ASAP to complete the program during January and February 1999, with the
repurchase of  approximately  597,000 shares,  bringing the total shares
repurchased under the program to approximately 22,348,000 shares. All of these
shares were retired upon purchase. Incentive Employee Stock Plans
Effective December 19, 1993, the Board of Directors approved the 1993 Stock
Option Plan the 1993 Plan which provides for the granting of options for the
purchase of up to an aggregate of 2,400,000 shares of common stock to key
employees.
Under the 1993 Plan, the Stock Option Committee the Committee of the Board
of Directors has the discretion to award stock options, stock appreciation
rights SARS or restricted stock options or non-qualified options and the
option price shall be established by the Committee. Incentive stock options may
be granted at an exercise price not less than 100% of the fair market value of a
share on the effective date of the grant and non-qualified options may be
granted at an exercise price not less than 50% of the fair market value of a
share on the effective date of the grant.
On August 24, 1995, the Board of Directors approved the 1995 Stock Option
Plan the 1995 Plan which provided for the granting of options up to an
aggregate of 3,000,000 shares of common stock to key employees under terms and
provisions similar to the 1993 Plan. During fiscal 1998, 1997 and 1996, the 1995
Plan was amended to provide for the granting of an additional 8,000,000,
3,000,000 and 6,000,000 shares, respectively. During fiscal 1998, the 1995 Plan
was amended to, among other things, eliminate the Company ability to issue
SARS and to amend the definition of a director to comply with Rule 16b-3 of the
Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended and with Section 162m of the
Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended.
The Company assumed the stock option plans of its subsidiaries, Career
Horizons, Inc., Actium, Inc. and Consulting Partners, Inc., upon acquisition in
accordance with terms of the respective merger agreements. At the date of
respective acquisitions, the assumed plans had 2,566,252 options outstanding. As
of December 31, 1998 and 1997 the assumed plans had 340,719 and 372,445 options
outstanding, respectively.
Non-Employee Director Stock Plan
Effective December 29, 1993, the Board of Directors of the Company approved
a stock option plan Director Plan for non-employee directors, whereby 600,000
shares of common stock have been reserved for issuance to non-employee
directors. The Director Plan allows each non-employee director to purchase
60,000 shares at an exercise price equal to the fair market value at the date of
the grant upon election to the Board. In addition, each non-employee director is
granted 20,000 options upon the anniversary date of the director initial
election date. The options become exercisable ratably over a five-year period
and expire ten years from the date of the grant. However, the options are
exercisable for a maximum of three years after the individual ceases to be a
director and if the director ceases to be a director within one year of
appointment the options are canceled. In fiscal 1997 and 1996, the Company
granted 120,000 and 80,000 options, respectively, at an average exercise price
of $2835 and $2531, respectively. During 1997, the Director plan was amended
to increase the number of shares available under the plan to 16 million shares.
In fiscal 1998, the Company granted 240,000 options at an average exercise price
of $2156.  The following table summarizes the Company Stock Option Plans                                                     Weighted

The Company adopted the disclosure-only provisions of SFAS No. 123,
Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation, issued in October 1995. As permitted
by the provisions of SFAS No. 123, the Company applies APB Opinion 25 and
related interpretations in accounting for its employee stock option plans and,
accordingly, does not recognize compensation cost. If the Company had elected to
recognize compensation cost for options granted in 1998 and 1997, based on the
fair value of the options granted at the grant date as prescribed by SFAS No.
123, net income and earnings per share would have been reduced to the pro forma

issued a restricted stock grant of 345,000 shares to the Company President and
Chief Executive Officer, which was scheduled to vest over a five year period.
The Company recorded $4,892 in deferred compensation expense which was amortized
on a straight line basis over the vesting period of the grant. In December 1998,
the Company Board of Directors removed the vesting restrictions, thus vesting
the unamortized portion of the grant in the amount of $2,686.
Stock Splits
Effective March 6, 1996, the Company Board of Directors approved a three-
for-one stock split of common stock for stockholders of record as of March 20,
1996. A total of $494 was transferred from additional contributed capital to the
stated value of common stock in connection with the stock split. The par value
of the common stock remains unchanged. All share and per share amounts have been
restated to retroactively reflect the stock split. 10. NET INCOME PER COMMON SHARE

1 The Company convertible debt did not have a dilutive effect on earnings per
share from continuing operations during fiscal 1996 and the Fourth quarter of
fiscal 1998.
Options to purchase 2,201,757 shares of common stock that were outstanding
during 1998 were not included in the computation of diluted earnings per share
as the exercise prices of these options were greater than the average market
price of the common shares. 11. CONCENTRATION OF CREDIT RISK  The Company financial instruments that are exposed to concentrations of
credit risk consist primarily of cash and trade accounts receivable. The Company
places its cash with what it believes to be high credit quality institutions. At
times such investments may be in excess of the FDIC insurance limit. The Company
routinely  assesses the financial  strength of its customers and, as a
consequence, believes that its trade accounts receivable credit risk exposure is
limited.
In connection with the Company sale of its health care operations, the
Company entered into an agreement with the purchaser of the health care assets
whereby the Company agreed to make advances to the company to fund its working
capital requirements. Any amounts extended are collateralized by the assets of
the related health care operations. As of December 31, 1998, the company had
advanced approximately $159 million under this agreement. Additionally, the
Company has $50 million in notes receivable from the purchasers of the health
care opertaions related to the initial sale.
12. RESTRUCTURING OF OPERATIONS AND IMPAIRMENT CHARGE
Restructuring and impairment charge. In December 1998, the Company Board
of Directors approved the Restructuring Plan to strengthen overall profitability
of the Company by implementing a back office integration program and branch
repositioning plan in an effort to consolidate or close branches whose financial
performance does not meet the Company expectations. Pursuant to the plan, the
Company recorded a restructuring and impairment charge of $34,759.  The
restructuring component of the plan is based, in part, on the evaluation of
objective evidence of probable obligations to be incurred by the Company or of
specifically identified assets.
The Company, formerly AccuStaff Incorporated, was formed in 1992 and grew
over the next 6 1/2 years through both acquisitions and internal growth. Prior
to the disposition of the Commercial operations and the Teleservices and Health
Care divisions in 1998, the Company was largely organized and structured from an
administrative, operations and systems capabilities standpoint as a commercial
staffing business. The Restructuring Plan focuses on meeting the needs of an
information technology and professional services company and is designed to
result in a back office environment tailored to serve these businesses. Upon
completion of the Restructuring Plan, certain back office operations will be
centralized at the Company headquarters and possibly one additional location,
and certain positions which were necessary under the previous organizational and
operational structure will be eliminated.
The Restructuring Plan calls for the consolidation or closing of 23
Professional Services division branches, certain organizational improvements and
the consolidation of 15 back office operations. This restructuring, which will
result in the elimination of approximately 290 positions, will be completed over
a 12- to 18-month period.
The major components of the restructuring and impairment charge include:1
costs to recognize severance and related benefits for the approximately 290
employees to be terminated of $7,494. The severance and related benefit accruals
are based on the Company severance plan and other contractual termination
provisions. These accruals include amounts to be paid to employees upon
termination of employment. Prior to December 31, 1998, management had approved
and committed the Company to a plan that involved the involuntary termination of
certain employees. The benefit arrangements associated with this plan were
communicated to all employees in December 1998. The plan specifically identified
the number of employees to be terminated and their job classifications. 2
costs to write down certain furniture, fixtures and computer equipment to net
realizable value at branches not performing up to the Company expectations of
$2,476,3 costs to write down goodwill associated with the acquisition of Legal
Information Technology, Inc. which was acquired in January, 1996, calculated in
accordance with SFAS 121 as described in Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial
Statements, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies - Goodwill of $9,936 4
costs to terminate leases and other exit and shutdown costs associated with the
consolidated or closed branches including closing the facilities of $8,035
million, and 5 costs to adjust accounts receivable due to the expected
increase in bad debts which results directly from the termination or change in
client relationships which results when branch and administrative employees, who
have the knowledge to effectively pursue collections are terminated of $6,818.
These costs were based upon management best estimates based upon available
information.
Since payments pursuant to the Restructuring Plan will not commence until
fiscal 1999, there were no charges recognized by the Company against the
restructuring reserve as of December 31, 1998, at which time the total
restructuring reserve amount of $24,823 which does not include the $9,936
goodwill impairment charge which was recorded against goodwill in the fouth
quarter of fiscal 1999 was included in accounts payable and accrued liabilities
Since payments pursuant to the Restructuring Plan will not commence until fiscal
1999. 13. FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS
The Company financial instruments include cash and cash equivalents and
its debt obligations. Management believes that these financial instruments bear
interest at rates which approximate prevailing market rates for instruments with
similar characteristics and, accordingly, that the carrying values for these
instruments are reasonable estimates of fair value. 14. SEGMENT REPORTING
The Company has adopted SFAS No. 131, Disclosure About Segments of an
Enterprise and Related Information, issued during 1997, which changes the way
public companies report information about segments. SFAS No. 131, which is based
on the management approach to segment reporting, includes requirements to report
selected segment information on a quarterly basis and to report certain
entity-wide disclosures about products and services, major customers, and the
material countries in which the entity holds assets and reports revenues.   The Company has two reportable segments: information technology IT and
professional services. The Company reportable segments are strategic business
units that offer different services and are managed separately as each business
unit requires different resources and marketing strategies. The IT segment
provides computer related consulting services. The professional segment provides
personnel who perform specialized services such as accounting, legal, technical,
outplacement and scientific.  See Note 16 to the Consolidated Financial
Statements for information on the discontinued operations of the Company as
these  operations are not contained within the scope of this footnote.
Discontinued operations included the Company former Commercial, Teleservices
and Health Care divisions.
The accounting policies of the segments are consistent with those described
in the summary of significant accounting policies in Note 2 to the Consolidated
Financial Statements, and all intersegment sales and transfers are eliminated.
The Company does not have a material reliance on any one customer
relationship as the Company is able to provide a breadth of services to numerous
Fortune 1000 and other leading businesses.
The Company evaluates segment performance based on revenues, gross margin
and pre-tax income from continuing operations. The Company does not allocate
income taxes or unusual items to the segments. The following table summarizes
segment and geographic information:                                           Fiscal

impairment charge of $34,759. See Note 12 to the Consolidated Financial
Statements for further discussion on the restructuring and impairment charge. 
2 During the fourth quarter of 1998, the Company recorded adjustments to
estimated costs relating to the third quarter gain on sale of net assets of
discontinued operations to reflect the final determination of transaction
related costs and income taxes. 16. DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS    Effective September 27, 1998 and March 30, 1998, the Company sold its
Commercial operations and Teleservices division, and the operations and certain
assets of its Health Care division, respectively, jointly the Commercial
Businesses. As a result, the Commercial Businesses have been reported as a
discontinued operation, and the consolidated financial statements have been
reclassified to segregate the net assets and operating results of the Commercial
Businesses. The Commercial operations and Teleservices division were sold with a
final adjusted purchase price of $8262 million in cash to Randstad U.S., L.P.
'Randstad', the U.S.  operating  company of  Ranstad  Holding  nv, an
international staffing company based in The Netherlands. The after-tax gain on
the sale was $2306 million. The operations and certain assets of the Health
Care division were sold for consideration of $80 million, consisting of $30
million in cash and $50 million in a note receivable due March 30, 2000 bearing
interest at 2% in excess of the prime rate. The after-tax gain on the sale was
$01 million
In connection with the Company sale of its health care operations, the
Company entered into an agreement with the purchaser of the health care assets
whereby the Company agreed to extend capital to the purchaser to fund its
working capital requirements. Any amounts extended are collateralized by the
accounts receivable and certain other assets of the related health care
operations. Any advances made under this agreement accrue interest at 10% per
year. As of December 31, 1998, the Company had extended approximately $159
million under this agreement.
The sale of the Commercial Businesses represents the disposal of a segment
of the Company business. Accordingly, the financial statements for the years
ended December 31, 1998, 1997 and 1996 have been reclassified to separate the
revenues, costs and expenses, assets and liabilities, and cash flows of the
Commercial Businesses sold. The net operating results of the Commercial
Businesses have been reported, net of applicable income taxes, as 'Income from
Discontinued Operations'. The net assets of the Commercial Businesses have been
reported as 'Net Assets of Discontinued Operations'; and the net cash flows of
the Commercial Businesses have been reported as 'Net Cash Used In Discontinued
Operations'.
Summarized financial information for the discontinued operations follows    For the years ended

certain net common expenses for corporate support and back office functions
totaling approximately $09 million, $12 million, and $15 million for the
years ended December 31, 1998, 1997 and 1996, respectively. Corporate support
and back office allocations are based on the ratio of the Company consolidated
revenues, operating income and assets to that of the discontinued Commercial
Business.  Additionally,  the results of discontinued  operations include
allocations of consolidated interest expense totaling $42 million, $44 million
and $04 million for fiscal 1998,1997 and 1996, respectively. Interest expense
is allocated based on the historic funding needs of the discontinued operations,
using a rate that approximates the weighted average interest rate outstanding
for the Company for each fiscal year presented. Historic funding needs include:
the purchases of property, plant and equipment, acquisitions, current income tax
liabilities and fluctuating working capital needs. The net assets of the
