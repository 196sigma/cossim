Item8, Note8, Commitments and
Contingencies Litigation based on allegations
relating to our historical stock option practices. We cannot
assure you that this current litigation will result in the same
conclusions reached by the special committee of outside
directors formed by our Board of Directors to conduct a review
of our stock option practices the Special
Committee. Furthermore, if we are subject to adverse
findings in any of these matters, we could be required to pay
damages or penalties or have other remedies imposed upon us
which could adversely affect our business, results of operations
or financial condition.   
24 Table of Contents   Anti-takeover
provisions could make it more difficult for a third party to
acquire us   Our Board of Directors has the authority to issue up to
10,000,000shares of preferred stock and to determine the
price, rights, preferences, privileges and restrictions,
including voting rights, of those shares without any further
vote or action by the shareholders. The rights of the holders of
common stock may be subject to, and may be adversely affected
by, the rights of the holders of any preferred stock that may be
issued in the future. The issuance of preferred stock may have
the effect of delaying, deferring or preventing a change of
control of our company without further action by our
shareholders and may adversely affect the voting and other
rights of the holders of common stock. Further, certain
provisions of our bylaws, including a provision limiting the
ability of shareholders to raise matters at a meeting of
shareholders without giving advance notice, may have the effect
of delaying or preventing changes in control or management of
our company, which could have an adverse effect on the market
price of our common stock. In addition, our articles of
incorporation provide for a staggered board, which may make it
more difficult for a third party to gain control of our Board of
Directors. Similarly, state anti-takeover laws in the State of
Washington related to corporate takeovers may prevent or delay a
change of control of our company.

Properties   We lease our principal administrative, sales, marketing,
research and development facilities, which are located in
Seattle, Washington and consist of approximately
190,000square feet. In April 2010, we amended and restated
the lease agreement for the three buildings that serve as our
corporate headquarters. The lease commenced in April, July and
August of 2010 for various sections of the first building; and
August 2010 for the second and third buildings. The lease for
all three buildings will expire in 2022 with an option for
renewal. In October 2006, we entered into an agreement to lease
a building adjacent to the three buildings that serve as our
corporate headquarters. This lease will expire in 2018. During
2008, we entered into two separate sublease agreements to
sublease approximately 112,500square feet of this
building. One sublease will expire in 2013. In March 2010, we
amended the second sublease, which expanded the subleased space
by approximately 11,700square feet and extended the term
of the sublease to 2018.   We believe that our existing properties are in good condition
and suitable for the conduct of our business. We also lease
office space for our product development personnel in Spokane,
Washington, SanJose, California, Lowell, Massachusetts,
Israel, and Russia and for our sales and support personnel in
Illinois, Washington D.C., New York, Hong Kong, Singapore,
China, Taiwan, Thailand, India, United Arab Emirates, Indonesia,
Malaysia, South Korea, Japan, Australia, New Zealand, Germany,
France, Belgium, Spain, Italy, Netherlands and the United
Kingdom. We believe that our future growth can be accommodated
by our current facilities or by leasing additional space if
necessary.

Legal
Proceedings   Derivative Suits.Beginning on or about
May24, 2006, several derivative actions were filed against
certain of our current and former directors and officers. These

the Federal Court Derivative Litigation. On
August2, 2007, another derivative lawsuit, Baronev.
McAdam et al. Case
No.C07-1200P
was filed in the U.S.District Court for the Western
District of Washington. The Barone lawsuit was designated a
related case to the Federal Court Derivative   
25 Table of Contents   Litigation on September4, 2007. The complaints generally
allege that certain of our current and former directors and
officers, including, in general, each of our current outside
directors other than Deborah L. Bevier, Scott Thompson and John
Chapple who joined the Board of Directors in July 2006, January
2008 and September 2010, respectively breached their fiduciary
duties to the Company by engaging in alleged wrongful conduct
concerning the manipulation of certain stock option grant dates.
We are named solely as a nominal defendant against whom the
plaintiffs seek no recovery.   On September24, 2010, the Company entered into a
Stipulation of Settlement the Stipulation in
connection with the Federal Court Derivative Litigation. On
October21, 2010, the United States District Court for the
Western District of Washington issued an order granting
preliminary approval of the settlement resolving the claims
asserted by the plaintiffs against the individual defendants. A
hearing to determine whether the Court should issue an order
finally approving the proposed settlement has been scheduled for
January6, 2011. Effectiveness of the settlement of the
Federal Court Derivative Litigation is conditioned on dismissal
of the State Court Derivative Litigation. A copy of the
Stipulation may be found under the About F5-Investor
Relations-Corporate Governance section of our website,
www.f5.com.   SEC and Department of Justice Inquiries.We
previously received notice from both the SEC and the Department
of Justice that they were conducting informal inquiries into our
historical stock option practices, and we have fully cooperated
with both agencies. In January 2010, we received notice from the
SEC that the investigation concerning our historical stock
option practices has been completed and that no enforcement
action has been recommended. We currently believe that the
Department of Justice will take no further action in connection
with its inquiry into our historical stock option practices.   We are not aware of any additional pending legal proceedings
that, individually or in the aggregate, would have a material
adverse effect on our business, operating results, or financial
condition. We may in the future be party to litigation arising
in the ordinary course of business, including claims that we
allegedly infringe upon third-party intellectual property
rights. Such claims, even if not meritorious, could result in
the expenditure of significant financial and managerial
resources.

common stock are held by brokers and other institutions on
behalf of shareholders, we are unable to estimate the total
number of beneficial holders of our common stock represented by
these record holders.   Dividend

Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
Operations   The following discussion of our financial condition and results
of operations contains forward-looking statements within the
meaning of Section21E of the Securities Exchange Act of
1934 and Section27A of the Securities Act of 1933. These
statements include, but are not limited to, statements about our
plans, objectives, expectations, strategies, intentions or other
characterizations of future events or circumstances and are
generally identified by the words expects,
anticipates, intends, plans,
believes, seeks, estimates,
and similar expressions. These forward-looking statements are
based on current information and expectations and are subject to
a number of risks and uncertainties. Our actual results could
differ materially from those expressed or implied by these
forward-looking statements. Factors that could cause or
contribute to such differences include, but are not limited to,
those discussed under Item1A. Risk Factors
herein and in other documents we file from time to time with the
Securities and Exchange Commission. We assume no obligation to
revise or update any such forward-looking statements.   Overview   We are a global provider of appliances consisting of software
and hardware and services that help companies efficiently and
securely manage the delivery, optimization and security of
application and data traffic on Internet-based networks, and to
optimize the performance and utilization of data storage
infrastructure and other network resources. We market and sell
our products primarily through multiple indirect sales channels
in the Americas primarily the United States; Europe, the
Middle East, and Africa EMEA; Japan; and the Asia Pacific
region APAC. Enterprise customers Fortune 1000 or Business
Week Global 1000companies in the technology,
telecommunications, financial services, transportation,
education, manufacturing and health care industries, along with
government customers, continue to make up the largest percentage
of our customer base.   Our management team monitors and analyzes a number of key
performance indicators in order to manage our business and
evaluate our financial and operating performance. Those
indicators include   
Revenues.The majority of our revenues are
derived from sales of our Application Delivery Networking
ADN products and related software modules; BIG-IP
Local Traffic Manager, BIG-IP Global Traffic Manager, BIG-IP
Link Controller, BIG-IP Application Security Manager, BIG-IP
Edge Gateway, BIG-IP WAN Optimization module, BIG-IP Access
Policy Manager, and WebAccelerator; FirePass SSL VPN appliance;
and our ARX file virtualization products. We also derive
revenues from the sales of   
31 Table of Contents   
services including annual maintenance contracts, training and
consulting services. We carefully monitor the sales mix of our
revenues within each reporting period. We believe customer
acceptance rates of our new products and feature enhancements
are indicators of future trends. We also consider overall
revenue concentration by customer and by geographic region as
additional indicators of current and future trends.   
Cost of revenues and gross margins.We strive
to control our cost of revenues and thereby maintain our gross
margins. Significant items impacting cost of revenues are
hardware costs paid to our contract manufacturers, third-party
software license fees, amortization of developed technology and
personnel and overhead expenses. Our margins have remained
relatively stable; however, factors such as sales price, product
mix, inventory obsolescence, returns, component price increases
and warranty costs could significantly impact our gross margins
from quarter to quarter and represent significant indicators we
monitor on a regular basis.   
Operating expenses.Operating expenses are
substantially driven by personnel and related overhead expenses.
Existing headcount and future hiring plans are the predominant
factors in analyzing and forecasting future operating expense
trends. Other significant operating expenses that we monitor
include marketing and promotions, travel, professional fees,
computer costs related to the development of new products,
facilities and depreciation expenses.   
Liquidity and cash flows.Our financial
condition remains strong with significant cash and investments
and no long term debt. The increase in cash and investments for
fiscal year 2010 was primarily due to cash provided by operating
activities of $3136million. This increase was partially
offset by $750million of cash used to repurchase
outstanding common stock under our share repurchase program in
fiscal year 2010. Going forward, we believe the primary driver
of cash flows will be net income from operations. Capital
expenditures for fiscal year 2010 were comprised primarily of
information technology infrastructure and equipment to support
the growth of our core business activities. We will continue to
evaluate possible acquisitions of, or investments in businesses,
products, or technologies that we believe are strategic, which
may require the use of cash.   
Balance sheet.We view cash, short-term and
long-term investments, deferred revenue, accounts receivable
balances and days sales outstanding as important
indicators of our financial health. Deferred revenues continued
to increase in fiscal 2010 due to growth in the amount of annual
maintenance contracts purchased on new products and maintenance
renewal contracts related to our existing product installation
base. Our days sales outstanding for the fourth quarter of
fiscal year 2010 was 40.   Critical
Accounting Policies   Our consolidated financial statements have been prepared in
accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the
United States of America. The preparation of these financial
statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that
affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and
expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and
liabilities. We base our estimates on historical experience and
on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable
under the circumstances. Actual results may differ from these
estimates under different assumptions or conditions.   We believe the following critical accounting policies affect the
more significant estimates and judgments used in the preparation
of our financial statements.   Revenue Recognition.We sell products through
distributors, resellers, and directly to end users. We recognize
product revenue upon shipment, net of estimated returns,
provided that collection is determined to be reasonably assured
and no significant performance obligations remain. In certain
regions where we do not have the ability to reasonably estimate
returns, we defer revenue on sales to our distributors until
they have received information from the channel partner
indicating that the distributor has sold the product to its
customer. Payment terms to domestic customers are generally net
30days to net 45days. Payment terms to international
customers range from net 30days to net 120days based
on normal and customary trade practices   
32 Table of Contents   in the individual markets. We offer extended payment terms to
certain customers, in which case, revenue is recognized when
payments are due.   Whenever product, training services and post-contract customer
support PCS elements are sold together, a portion
of the sales price is allocated to each element based on their
respective fair values as determined when the individual
elements are sold separately. Where fair value of certain
elements is not available, we recognize revenue on the
residual method based on the fair value of
undelivered elements. Revenues from the sale of product are
recognized when the product has been shipped and the customer is
obligated to pay for the product. When rights of return are
present and we cannot estimate returns, we recognize revenue
when such rights of return lapse. Revenues for PCS are
recognized on a straight-line basis over the service contract
term. PCS includes a limited period of telephone support
updates, repair or replacement of any failed product or
component that fails during the term of the agreement, bug fixes
and rights to upgrades, when and if available. Consulting
services are customarily billed at fixed hourly rates, plus
out-of-pocket
expenses, and revenues are recognized when the consulting has
been completed. Training revenue is recognized when the training
has been completed.   FASB ASC Topic
985-605-25,
Software, Revenue Recognition, Multiple-Element
Arrangements, ASC
985-605-25,
as amended, requires revenue earned on software arrangements
involving multiple elements to be allocated to each element
based on the relative fair values of those elements. The fair
value of an element must be based on vendor specific objective
evidence VSOE. We establish VSOE for our products,
training services, PCS and consulting services based on the
sales price charged for each element when sold separately. The
sales price is discounted from the applicable list price based
on various factors including the type of customer, volume of
sales, geographic region and program level. Our list prices are
generally not fair value as discounts may be given based on the
factors enumerated above. We believe that the fair value of our
consulting services is represented by the billable consulting
rate per hour, based on the rates we charge customers when they
purchase standalone consulting services. The price of consulting
services is not based on the type of customer, volume of sales,
geographic region or program level.   We use historical sales transactions to determine whether VSOE
can be established for each of the elements. In most instances,
VSOE of fair value is the sales price of actual standalone
unbundled transactions within the past 12month period
that are priced within a reasonable range, which we have
determined to be plus or minus 15% of the median sales price of
each respective price list.   VSOE of PCS is based on standalone sales since we do not provide
stated renewal rates to our customers. In accordance with our
PCS pricing practice supported by standalone renewal sales,
renewal contracts are priced as a percentage of the undiscounted
product list price. The PCS renewal percentages may vary,
depending on the type and length of PCS purchased. We offer
standard and premium PCS, and the term generally ranges from one
to three years. We employ a bell-shaped-curve approach in
evaluating VSOE of fair value of PCS. Under this approach, we
consider VSOE of the fair value of PCS to exist when a
substantial majority of our standalone PCS sales fall within a
narrow range of pricing.   We have established and regularly validate the VSOE of fair
value for elements in our multiple element arrangements. We
account for taxes collected from customers and remitted to
governmental authorities on a net basis and excluded from
revenues.   Reserve for Doubtful Accounts.Estimates are
used in determining our allowance for doubtful accounts and are
based upon an assessment of selected accounts and as a
percentage of our remaining accounts receivable by aging
category. In determining these percentages, we evaluate
historical write-offs, current trends in the credit quality of
our customer base, as well as changes in the credit policies. We
perform ongoing credit evaluations of our customers
financial condition and do not require any collateral. If there
is deterioration of a major customers credit worthiness or
actual defaults are higher than our historical experience, our
allowance for doubtful accounts may not be sufficient.   Reserve for Product Returns.In some
instances, product revenue from distributors is subject to
agreements allowing rights of return. Product returns are
estimated based on historical experience and are recorded at the
time revenues are recognized. Accordingly, we reduce recognized
revenue for estimated future   
33 Table of Contents   returns at the time revenue is recorded. When rights of return
are present and we cannot estimate returns, revenue is
recognized when such rights lapse. The estimates for returns are
adjusted periodically based upon changes in historical rates of
returns and other related factors. It is possible that these
estimates will change in the future or that the actual amounts
could vary from our estimates.   Accounting for Income Taxes.We utilize the
liability method of accounting for income taxes. Accordingly, we
are required to estimate our income taxes in each of the
jurisdictions in which we operate as part of the process of
preparing our consolidated financial statements. This process
involves estimating our actual current tax exposure, including
assessing the risks associated with tax audits, together with
assessing temporary differences resulting from the different
treatment of items for tax and accounting purposes. These
differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities. Due
to the evolving nature and complexity of tax rules combined with
the large number of jurisdictions in which we operate, it is
possible that our estimates of our tax liability could change in
the future, which may result in additional tax liabilities and
adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition
and cash flows.   Stock-Based Compensation.We account for
stock-based compensation using the straight-line attribution
method for recognizing compensation expense over the requisite
service period of the related award. We recognized
$708million and $561million of stock-based
compensation expense for the years ended September30, 2010
and 2009, respectively. As of September30, 2010, there was
$984million of total unrecognized stock-based
compensation cost, the majority of which will be recognized over
the next two years. Going forward, stock-based compensation
expenses may increase as we issue additional equity-based awards
to continue to attract and retain key employees.   We issue incentive awards to our employees through stock-based
compensation consisting of restricted stock units
RSUs. The value of RSUs is determined using the
fair value method, which in this case, is based on the number of
shares granted and the quoted price of our common stock on the
date of grant. No stock options were granted in fiscal years
2010, 2009 and 2008.   We recognize compensation expense for only the portion of RSUs
that are expected to vest. Therefore, we apply estimated
forfeiture rates that are derived from historical employee
termination behavior. Based on historical differences with
forfeitures of stock-based awards granted to our executive
officers and Board of Directors versus grants awarded to all
other employees, we developed separate forfeiture expectations
for these two groups. In fiscal year 2010, the estimated
forfeiture rate for grants awarded to our executive officers and
Board of Directors was approximately 3% and the estimated
forfeiture rate for grants awarded to all other employees was
approximately 10%. If the actual number of forfeitures differs
from those estimated by management, additional adjustments to
stock-based compensation expense may be required in future
periods.   We recognize compensation costs for awards with performance
conditions when we conclude it is probable that the performance
condition will be achieved. We reassess the probability of
vesting at each balance sheet date and adjust compensation costs
based on our probability assessment.   Common stock repurchase.On October22,
2008, we announced that our Board of Directors approved a
program to repurchase up to an additional $200million of
our outstanding common stock. On October26, 2010, we
announced that our Board of Directors approved a new program to
repurchase up to an additional $200million of our
outstanding common stock. As of November18, 2010, we had
repurchased and retired 4,605,827shares at an average
price of $3715 per share.   Goodwill and intangible assets.We have
goodwill and intangible assets on our balance sheet related to
acquisitions. Intangible assets are carried and reported at
acquisition cost, net of accumulated amortization subsequent to
acquisition. Intangible assets are amortized over the estimated
useful lives, which generally range from three to five years.
Intangible assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or
circumstances indicate impairment might exist. Projected
undiscounted net cash flows expected to be derived from the use
of those assets are compared to the respective net carrying
amounts to determine whether any impairment exists. Impairment,
if any, is based on the excess of the carrying amount over the
fair value of those assets.   The determination of the net carrying value of goodwill and
intangible assets and the extent to which, if any, there is
impairment are dependent on material estimates and judgments on
our part, including the useful   
34 Table of Contents   life over which the intangible assets are to be amortized, and
the estimates of the value of future net cash flows, which are
based upon further estimates of future revenues, expenses and
operating margins. We review our goodwill annually for
impairment in the second fiscal quarter, or whenever events or
changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of
goodwill may not be recoverable. The first step of the test
identifies whether potential impairment may have occurred, while
the second step of the test measures the amount of the
impairment, if any. Impairment is recognized when the carrying
amount of goodwill exceeds its fair value. In March 2010, we
completed our annual impairment test and concluded that there
was no impairment of goodwill. We have considered the
assumptions used in the test and noted that no reasonably
possible changes would reduce the fair value of the reporting
unit to such a level that would cause an impairment charge.
Additionally, we considered potential impairment indicators at
September30, 2010 and noted no indicators of impairment.   Investments.Our investments are diversified
among high-credit quality debt securities in accordance with our
investment policy. We classify our investments as
available-for-sale,
which are reported at fair market value with the related
unrealized gains and losses included in accumulated other
comprehensive income or loss in stockholders equity.
Realized gains and losses and declines in value of these
investments judged to be other than temporary are included in
other income expense. To date, we have not deemed it necessary
to record any charges related to
other-than-temporary
declines in the estimated fair values of our marketable debt
securities. However, the fair value of our investments is
subject to volatility. Declines in the fair value of our
investments judged to be other than temporary could adversely
affect our future operating results.   Our investments also include auction rate securities
ARS that are classified as
available-for-sale.
ARS are reported at fair market value with the related
unrealized gains and losses included in accumulated other
comprehensive income or loss in stockholders equity. We
believe these investments may remain illiquid for longer than
twelve months and as a result, we have classified these
investments as long-term as of September30, 2010. We used
the income approach to determine the fair value of our ARS using
a discounted cash flow analysis. The assumptions we used in
preparing the discounted cash flow model include estimates for
interest rates; estimates for discount rates using yields of
comparable traded instruments adjusted for illiquidity and other
risk factors, amount of cash flows and expected holding periods
for the ARS.   Results
of Operations   The following discussion and analysis should be read in
conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and
related notes included elsewhere in this Annual Report on
Form10-K.

350% in fiscal year 2010 from the prior year, compared to only
a slight increase in fiscal year 2009 from fiscal year 2008.
Overall revenue growth for the year ended September30,
2010 was primarily due to increased product and service revenues
as a result of our increased installed base of products and
increased demand for our core ADN products, including
application security and WAN optimization products.
International revenues represented 414%, 447% and 425% of net
revenues in fiscal years 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively. We
expect international sales will continue to represent a   
35 Table of Contents   significant portion of net revenues, although we cannot provide
assurance that international revenues as a percentage of net
revenues will remain at current levels.   Net product revenues increased 380% in fiscal year 2010 from
fiscal year 2009 and decreased 102% in fiscal year 2009 as
compared to fiscal year 2008. The increase of
$1546million in net product sales for fiscal year 2010
was primarily due to growth in the volume of product sales of
our ADN products of $1548, partially offset by a decrease in
sales of our FirePass products of $26million. In
addition, net product revenue from our ARX file virtualization
products increased $23million in fiscal year 2010. The
decrease of $464million in net product sales for fiscal
year 2009 was primarily due to a $361million reduction in
the volume of sales of our ADN products, a $54million
reduction in the sales of our ARX file virtualization products,
and a $49million reduction in the volume of sales of our
FirePass products, as compared to the prior year. Sales of our
ADN products represented 954%, 937% and 920% of total product
revenues in fiscal years 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively.   Net service revenues increased 301% in fiscal year 2010 from
fiscal year 2009 and increased 250% in fiscal year 2009 as
compared to fiscal year 2008. The increases in service revenue
were the result of increased purchases or renewals of
maintenance contracts driven by additions to our installed base
of products.   Avnet Technology Solutions, one of our worldwide distributors,
accounted for 145%, 154% and 140% of our total net revenues
in fiscal years 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively. Tech Data,
another worldwide distributor, accounted for 102% of our total
net revenues in fiscal year 2010. Ingram Micro, Inc., another
worldwide distributor, accounted for 105% of our total net
revenues in fiscal year 2008. Avnet Technology Solutions, Tech
Data and Ingram Micro, Inc. accounted for 132%, 118% and 132%
of our accounts receivable as of September30, 2010,
respectively. Avnet Technology Solutions and Ingram Micro, Inc.
accounted for 116% and 107% of our accounts receivable as of
September30, 2009, respectively. Avnet Technology
Solutions accounted for 105% of our accounts receivable as of
September30, 2008. No other distributors accounted for
more than 10% of total net revenue or receivables for fiscal
years 2010, 2009 and 2008.

product revenues consist of finished products purchased from our
contract manufacturers, manufacturing overhead, freight,
warranty, provisions for excess and obsolete inventory and
amortization expenses in connection with developed technology
from acquisitions. Product cost increased to $1138million
in fiscal year 2010 from $952million in fiscal year 2009.
The year over year increase was primarily due to the higher
volume of units shipped and an increase in warranty expense,
partially offset by a decrease in expense related to obsolete
inventory. Product cost as a percentage of related net revenue
decreased to 203% in fiscal year 2010 from 234% in fiscal year
2009 primarily due to reduced manufacturing costs and decreased
indirect product costs. In fiscal year 2009, the year over year
decrease from $1024million in fiscal year 2008 was
primarily due to a reduction in the volume of units shipped.   
36 Table of Contents   Cost of Net Service Revenues.Cost of net
service revenues consist of the salaries and related benefits of
our professional services staff, travel, facilities and
depreciation expenses. Cost of net service revenues as a
percentage of net service revenues decreased to 181% in fiscal
year 2010 from 193% in fiscal year 2009 and 236% in fiscal
year 2008 primarily due to the scalability of our existing
customer support infrastructure and increased revenue from
maintenance contracts. Professional services headcount at the
end of fiscal year 2010 increased to 421 from 330 at the end of
fiscal year 2009 and 323 at the end of fiscal year 2008. In
addition, cost of net service revenues included stock-based
compensation expense of $60million, $48million and
$40million for fiscal years 2010, 2009 and 2008,
respectively.

expenses consist of salaries, commissions and related benefits
of our sales and marketing staff, the costs of our marketing
programs, including public relations, advertising and trade
shows, travel, facilities, and depreciation expenses. Sales and
marketing expense increased 302% in fiscal year 2010 as
compared to a year over year decrease of 51% in fiscal year
2009 and a year over year increase of 351% in fiscal year 2008.
The increase in sales and marketing expense for fiscal year 2010
was primarily due to an increase in commissions and personnel
costs of $439million, compared to the prior year. The
increase in sales and marketing expense for fiscal year 2010 was
also due to an increase of $92million in marketing
promotions and initiatives aimed at promoting our brand and
creating market awareness of our technology and our products.
The fiscal year 2009 decrease over the prior year was primarily
due to cost reduction initiatives we implemented in response to
the slowing economic environment and a $69million
decrease in commissions expense corresponding to the decrease in
product revenue for fiscal year 2009, compared to the prior
year. Sales and marketing headcount at the end of fiscal 2010
increased to 856 from 696 at the end of fiscal 2009 and 716 at
the end of fiscal 2008. Sales and marketing expense included
stock-based compensation charges of $273million,
$226million and $241million for fiscal years 2010,
2009 and 2008, respectively.   Research and Development.Research and
development expenses consist of the salaries and related
benefits for our product development personnel, prototype
materials and other expenses related to the development of new
and improved products, facilities and depreciation expenses.
Research and development expense increased 141% in fiscal year
2010, compared to the prior year. The increase in research and
development expense for fiscal year 2010 was primarily due to
increased personnel costs of $71million, which is
consistent with the increase in revenue for the corresponding
period. In addition, research and development expense included a
year over year increase in computer equipment and software costs
of $38million to support the development of new and
improved products. In fiscal year 2009, research and   
37 Table of Contents   development expenses remained relatively consistent with the
prior year as compared to a year over year increase of 498% in
fiscal year 2008. The increase in research and development
expense for fiscal year 2008 was primarily due to increased
personnel costs of $197million, which is consistent with
the increased revenue for the corresponding period. Research and
development headcount at the end of fiscal 2010 increased to 509
from 430 at the end of fiscal 2009 and 460 at the end of fiscal
2008. Research and development expense included stock-based
compensation charges of $194million, $167million
and $163million for fiscal years 2010, 2009 and 2008,
respectively. We expect research and development expenses to
remain consistent as a percentage of net revenue in the
foreseeable future.   General and Administrative.General and
administrative expenses consist of the salaries, benefits and
related costs of our executive, finance, information technology,
human resource and legal personnel, third-party professional
service fees, bad debt charges, facilities and depreciation
expenses. General and administrative expense increased 240% in
fiscal year 2010, compared to the prior year. The increase in
general and administrative expense was primarily due to an
increase of $41million in personnel costs for the year
ended September30, 2010, compared to the prior year.
General and administrative expenses remained relatively
consistent in fiscal year 2009 as compared with a year over year
increase of 137% in fiscal year 2008. The increase in fiscal
year 2008 of $67million was due primarily to an increase
of $32million in stock-based compensation charges and an
increase of $35million in salary and benefit expenses.
General and administrative headcount at the end of fiscal 2010
increased to 226 from 190 at the end of fiscal 2009 and 195 at
the end of fiscal 2008. General and administrative expense
included stock-based compensation charges of $170million,
$116million and $159million for fiscal years 2010,
2009 and 2008, respectively.   Loss on Facility Exit and Sublease.During
2008, we exited a research and development facility in Bellevue,
Washington for which there was remaining operating lease
obligations through 2014. In addition, during this period we
consolidated our corporate headquarters, partially subleasing
the building located at 333 Elliott Avenue West in Seattle,
Washington for which there were remaining operating lease
obligations through 2018. As a result of the expected loss on
the facility exit and sublease agreements, we recorded a charge
of $53million in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2008.   Restructuring.Beginning in the second quarter
of fiscal 2009 we implemented a comprehensive restructuring
program as part of an overall initiative to reduce certain
operating expenses. Restructuring actions included the
consolidation of facilities, accelerated depreciation on tenant
improvements and a reduction in workforce. In the second quarter
of fiscal 2009, we recorded restructuring expenses of
$43million, which included a $21million charge for
severance and related costs and a $22million charge for
the exit of certain offices worldwide. All accrued restructuring
costs had been incurred as of September30, 2010.

38 Table of Contents   Other Income, Net.Other income, net, consists
primarily of interest income and foreign currency transaction
gains and losses. Other income, net decreased 216% in fiscal
year 2010, as compared to fiscal year 2009 and decreased 487%
in fiscal year 2009 as compared to fiscal year 2008. Interest
income was $81million, $99million and
$175million for fiscal years 2010, 2009 and 2008,
respectively. The decrease in other income, net for fiscal year
2010 as compared to fiscal year 2009 was primarily due to
decreased interest income of $18million, partially offset
by increased foreign currency transaction gains of
$10million. The decrease in interest income for fiscal
year 2010 was primarily due to a decline in interest rates for
the year. The decrease in other income, net for fiscal year 2009
as compared to fiscal year 2008 was primarily due to a decline
in interest rates for the year which decreased interest income
by $76million and decreased foreign currency transaction
gains of $15million.   Provision for Income Taxes.We recorded a
364% provision for income taxes for fiscal year 2010 compared
to 305% in fiscal year 2009 and 371% in fiscal year 2008. The
increase in the effective tax rate from fiscal year 2009 to
fiscal year 2010 is largely attributable to the expiration of
the federal research and development credit at December31,
2009 and a favorable adjustment related to equity awards in a
major foreign tax jurisdiction which was reflected in the
effective tax rate for fiscal year 2009.   At September30, 2010, we did not have a valuation
allowance on any of our deferred tax assets in any of the
jurisdictions in which we operate because we believe that the
assets are more likely than not to be realized. In making this
determination we have considered projected future taxable income
and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in
assessing the appropriateness of a valuation allowance. Our net
deferred tax assets as of fiscal year end 2010, 2009 and 2008
were $466million, $570million and
$528million, respectively. Our worldwide effective tax
rate may fluctuate based on a number of factors, including
variations in projected taxable income in our various geographic
locations in which we operate, changes in the valuation of our
net deferred tax assets, resolution of potential exposures, tax
positions taken on tax returns filed in the various geographic
locations in which we operate, and the introduction of new
accounting standards or changes in tax laws or interpretations
thereof in the various geographic locations in which we operate.
The federal credit for increasing research activities expired at
December31, 2009. If the credit is reinstated in fiscal
year 2011, the reinstatement may have a material impact on our
worldwide effective tax rate for fiscal year 2011. We have
recorded liabilities to address potential tax exposures related
to business and income tax positions we have taken that could be
challenged by taxing authorities. The ultimate resolution of
these potential exposures may be greater or less than the
liabilities recorded which could result in an adjustment to our
future tax expense.   Liquidity
and Capital Resources   We have funded our operations with our cash balances, cash

Years Ended September30   2010   2009   2008   In thousands   Liquidity and Capital Resources   Cash and cash equivalents and investments     862,066     574,422     451,272   Cash provided by operating activities   313,612   201,981   193,692   Cash used in provided by investing activities   238,223     99,109     13,710   Cash used in financing activities   16,798     70,706     181,719     Cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments and long-term
investments totaled $8621million as of September30,
2010 compared to $5744million as of September30,
2009, representing an increase of $2876million. The
increase was primarily due to cash provided by operating
activities of $3136million for fiscal year 2010, compared
to $2020million for fiscal year 2009, which was partially
offset by $750million of additional cash required for the
repurchase of outstanding common stock under our share
repurchase program in fiscal 2010. In fiscal year 2009, the
increase over the previous year was primarily due to cash
provided by operating activities of $2020million,
compared to $1937million for fiscal year 2008, which was   
39 Table of Contents   partially offset by $874million of additional cash
required for the repurchase of outstanding common stock under
our share repurchase program in fiscal 2009.   At September30, 2010, we held $160million in fair
value of tax-exempt ARS, which are variable-rate debt securities
and have a long-term maturity with the interest rates being
reset through Dutch auctions that are typically held every 7, 28
or 35days. The securities have historically traded at par
and are callable at par at the option of the issuer. Interest is
typically paid at the end of each auction period or
semi-annually. We limit our investments in ARS to securities
that carry a AAA/A- or equivalent rating from recognized
rating agencies and limit the amount of credit exposure to any
one issuer. At the time of initial investment and at the date of
this Annual Report on
Form10-K,
all of our ARS were in compliance with our investment policy.   Beginning in February 2008, auctions failed for approximately
$534million in par value of municipal ARS we held because
sell orders exceeded buy orders. When these auctions failed to
clear, higher interest rates for those securities went into
effect. However, the funds associated with these failed auctions
will not be accessible until the issuer calls the security, a
successful auction occurs, a buyer is found outside of the
auction process or the security matures.   We have no reason to believe that any of the underlying issuers
of our ARS are presently at risk of default. The underlying
assets of the municipal ARS we hold, including the securities
for which auctions have failed, are generally student loans
which are guaranteed by the U.S.government. Through
September30, 2010, we have continued to receive interest
payments on the ARS in accordance with their terms. We believe
we will be able to liquidate our investments without significant
loss primarily due to the government guarantee of the underlying
securities. However, due to uncertainty in the ARS market, we
believe certain of these
available-for-sale
investments may remain illiquid for longer than twelve months
and as a result, we have classified $190million par
value of our ARS as long-term as of September30, 2010.   In October 2008, we entered into an agreement the
Agreement with UBS whereby UBS would purchase eligible
ARS it sold to us prior to February13, 2008. Under the
terms of the Agreement, and at our discretion, UBS will purchase
eligible ARS from us at par value put option
during the period of June30, 2010 through July2,
2012. Prior to September30, 2010, UBS purchased all of the
eligible ARS we held for their par value of $344million.   Cash provided by operating activities during fiscal year 2010
was $3136million compared to $2020million in
fiscal year 2009 and $1937million in fiscal year 2008.
Cash provided by operating activities resulted primarily from
cash generated from net income, after adjusting for non-cash
charges such as stock-based compensation, depreciation and
amortization charges and changes in operating assets and
liabilities.   Cash used in investing activities was $2382million for
fiscal year 2010, compared to cash used in investing activities
of $991million for fiscal year 2009 and cash provided by
investing activities of $137million for fiscal year 2008.
The cash used in investing activities in fiscal year 2010 was
primarily the result of the purchase of investments and capital
expenditures related to maintaining our operations worldwide
partially offset by the sale and maturity of investments. The
cash used in investing activities in fiscal year 2009 was
primarily the result of the purchase of investments and capital
expenditures related to maintaining our operations worldwide
partially offset by the sale and maturity of investments. The
cash provided by investing activities in fiscal year 2008 was
primarily the result of the sale and maturity of investments
partially offset by the purchase of investments.   Cash used in financing activities was $168million for
fiscal year 2010, compared to cash used in financing activities
of $707million for fiscal year 2009 and cash used in
financing activities of $1817million for fiscal year
2008. Cash used in financing activities for fiscal 2010 included
$750million to repurchase common stock under our share
repurchase program, which was partially offset by cash received
from the exercise of employee stock options and stock purchases
under our employee stock purchase plan of $317million and
tax benefits related to share-based compensation of
$265million. Cash used in financing activities for fiscal
2009 included $874million to repurchase common stock
under our share repurchase program, which was partially offset
by the exercise of employee stock options and purchases under
our employee stock purchase plan. Cash used in financing
activities for fiscal 2008 included $200million to   
40 Table of Contents   repurchase common stock under a previous share repurchase
program, which was partially offset by the exercise of employee
stock options and purchases under our employee stock purchase
plan.   Based on our current operating and capital expenditure
forecasts, we believe that our existing cash and investment
balances, excluding ARS, together with cash generated from
operations should be sufficient to meet our operating
requirements for the foreseeable future. Our future capital
requirements will depend on many factors, including our rate of
revenue growth, the expansion of our sales and marketing
activities, the timing and extent of expansion into new
territories, the timing of introductions of new products and
enhancements of existing products, and the continuing market
acceptance of our products.   Obligations
and Commitments   The following table summarizes our contractual payment

various dates through 2022.   Purchase obligations are comprised of purchase commitments with
our contract manufacturers. The agreement with our primary
contract manufacturer allows them to procure component inventory
on our behalf based on our production forecast. We are obligated
to purchase component inventory that the contract manufacturer
procures in accordance with the forecast, unless cancellation is
given within applicable lead times.   Recent
Accounting Pronouncements   In December 2007, the FASB issued
ASC810-10,
Consolidation Overall ASC
810-10,
which establishes accounting and reporting standards for the
noncontrolling interest in a subsidiary and for the
deconsolidation of a subsidiary. We adopted
ASC810-10
in the first quarter of fiscal year 2010. The adoption of this
statement did not have any impact on our consolidated financial
position, results of operations or cash flows.   In October 2009, the FASB issued ASU
2009-13,
Multiple-Deliverable Revenue Arrangements, amendments to
FASB ASC Topic 605, Revenue Recognition ASU

and ASU
2009-14,
Certain Arrangements That Include Software Elements,

ASU 2009-13
requires entities to allocate revenue in an arrangement using
estimated selling prices of the delivered goods and services
based on a selling price hierarchy. The amendments eliminate the
residual method of revenue allocation and require revenue to be
allocated using the relative selling price method. ASU
2009-14
removes tangible products from the scope of software revenue
guidance and provides guidance on determining whether software
deliverables in an arrangement that includes a tangible product
are covered by the scope of the software revenue guidance. ASU

ASU 2009-14
should be applied on a prospective basis for revenue
arrangements entered into or materially modified in fiscal years
beginning on or after June15, 2010, with early adoption
permitted. We adopted ASU

Item7A.
Quantitative
and Qualitative Disclosure About Market Risk   Interest Rate Risk.Our cash equivalents
consist of high-quality securities, as specified in our
investment policy guidelines. The policy limits the amount of
credit exposure to any one issue or issuer to a maximum of 5% of
the total portfolio with the exception of U.S.treasury
securities, commercial paper and money market funds, which are
exempt from size limitation. The policy requires investments in
securities that mature in three years or less, with the average
maturity being no greater than one and a half years. These
securities are subject to interest rate risk and will decrease
in value if interest rates increase. A decrease of one percent
in the average interest rate would have resulted in a decrease
of approximately $48million in our interest income for
the fiscal year 2010.

equivalent rated municipal ARS was approximately
$160million. ARS are collateralized long-term debt
instruments that provide liquidity through a Dutch auction
process that resets the applicable interest rate at
pre-determined intervals, typically every 7, 28 or 35days.
Beginning in February 2008, auctions failed for approximately
$534million in par value of municipal ARS we held because
sell orders exceeded buy orders. When these auctions failed to
clear, higher interest rates for those securities went into
effect. However, the funds associated with these failed auctions
will not be accessible until the issuer calls the security, a
successful auction occurs, a buyer is found outside of the
auction process, or the security matures. The underlying assets
of the municipal ARS we hold, including the securities for which
auctions have failed, are generally student loans which are
guaranteed by the U.S.government. Based on our expected
operating cash flows and our other sources of cash, we do not
believe that any reduction in liquidity of our municipal ARS
will have a material impact on our overall ability to meet our   
42 Table of Contents   liquidity needs. We have no intent to sell, wont be
required to sell, and believe we will hold these securities
until recovery. We believe certain of these
available-for-sale
investments may remain illiquid for longer than twelve months
and as a result, we have classified $190million par
value of securities as long-term as of September30, 2010.   Foreign Currency Risk.The majority of our
sales and expenses are denominated in U.S.dollars and as a
result, we have not experienced significant foreign currency
transaction gains and losses to date. While we have conducted
some transactions in foreign currencies during the fiscal year
ended September30, 2010 and expect to continue to do so,
we do not anticipate that foreign currency transaction gains or
losses will be significant at our current level of operations.
However, as we continue to expand our operations
internationally, transaction gains or losses may become
significant in the future. We have not engaged in foreign
currency hedging to date. However, we may do so in the future.
