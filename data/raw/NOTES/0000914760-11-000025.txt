Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data. REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM Board of Directors and Stockholders
Young Innovations, Inc. We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Young Innovations, Inc. and subsidiaries as of December 31, 2010 and 2009, and the related consolidated statements of income, stockholders' equity, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2010.In connection with our audits of the consolidated financial statements, we have also audited the financial statement schedule. We also have audited Young Innovations internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2010, based on criteria established in Internal Control Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission COSO. Young Innovations management is responsible for these financial statements, the financial statement schedule, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Managements Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated financial statements and the financial statement schedule and an opinion on the company internal control over financial reporting based on our audits. We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board United States. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audits of the financial statements included examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, and evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions. A company internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that 1 pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; 2 provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and 3 provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. 24    In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Young Innovations, Inc. and subsidiaries as of December 31, 2010 and 2009, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2010 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Also, in our opinion, the related financial statement schedule, when considered in relation to the basic consolidated financial statements taken as a whole, presents fairly, in all material respects, the information set forth therein. Also in our opinion, Young Innovations, Inc. and subsidiaries maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2010, based on the criteria established in Internal Control Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission COSO. s/ Crowe Horwath LLP

March 11, 2011 25    MANAGEMENTS REPORT ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING The management of Young Innovations, Inc. is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting.The Companys internal control over financial reporting is designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.Internal control over financial reporting includes policies and procedures that pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the Company provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America provide reasonable assurance that receipts and expenditures of the Company are being made in accordance with authorization of management and directors of the Company; and provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of assets that could have a material effect on the consolidated financial statements. Internal control over financial reporting includes the controls themselves, monitoring and testing, and actions taken to correct deficiencies as identified. All internal control systems, no matter how well designed, have inherent limitations, including the possibility that controls can be circumvented or overridden, and misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected.Therefore, even those systems determined to be effective can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement preparation and presentation.Further, conditions in the Companys business change over time, and, therefore, internal control effectiveness may vary over time. The Companys management assessed the effectiveness of the Companys internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2010.In making this assessment, it used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission COSO inInternal ControlIntegrated Framework.Managements assessment included an evaluation of the design of the Companys internal control over financial reporting and testing of the operational effectiveness of its internal control over financial reporting.Based on this assessment and the foregoing criteria, management believes that, as of December 31, 2010, the Companys internal control over financial reporting is effective.The effectiveness of the Companys internal control over financial reporting as of December31, 2010 has been audited by Crowe HorwathLLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in their report, which is included in Item8 of this Report. 27    YOUNG INNOVATIONS, INC.

31    YOUNG INNOVATIONS, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
DECEMBER 31, 2010
in thousands, except per share data 1.ORGANIZATION Young Innovations, Inc. and its subsidiaries the Company develops, manufactures and markets supplies and equipment used by dentists, dental hygienists, dental assistants and consumers.The Company product offering includes disposable and metal prophylaxis prophy angles, prophy cups and brushes, dental micro-applicators, panoramic X-ray machines, moisture control products, infection control products, dental handpieces drills and related components, endodontic systems, orthodontic toothbrushes, flavored examination gloves, children toothbrushes, and children toothpastes. The Companys manufacturing and distribution facilities are located in Missouri, Illinois, California, Indiana, Wisconsin and Ireland.Export sales were approximately 18%, 17%, and 18% of total net sales for 2010, 2009, and 2008 respectively.Sales outside the U.S. are approximately 7% of total sales in each of 2010, 2009, and 2008. 2.SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES Principles of Consolidation The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Young Innovations, Inc. and its direct and indirect wholly owned subsidiaries.All significant intercompany accounts and transactions are eliminated in consolidation. Use of Estimates The preparation of the financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reported period.Actual results could differ from those estimates.Some of the more significant estimates include allowances for doubtful accounts, inventory valuation reserves, rebate accruals, warranty reserves, liabilities for potential incentive compensation and uncertain income tax positions. Cash and Cash Equivalents Cash and cash equivalents include all highly liquid investments with an initial maturity of three months or less. Inventories Inventories are stated at the lower of cost which includes material, labor and manufacturing overhead or net realizable value.Inventory values are based upon standard costs which approximate actual costs, determined by the first-in, first-out FIFO method. Property, Plant and Equipment Property, plant and equipment are stated at cost.Expenditures for repairs and maintenance are charged to expense as incurred, and additions and improvements that significantly extend the lives of assets are capitalized.Upon disposition, cost and accumulated depreciation are eliminated from the related accounts, and any gain or loss is reflected in the statements of income.The Company provides depreciation using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of respective classes of assets as follows Buildings and improvements3 to 40 years Machinery and equipment 3 to 10 years Equipment rented to others4 to 15 years 32    Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets Goodwill represents the excess of cost over fair value of net assets of businesses acquired.Goodwill and indefinite life intangible assets acquired in a purchase business combination are not amortized, but are instead tested for impairment at least annually in accordance with the provisions of ASC Topic 350.Additionally, ASC Topic 350 requires that intangible assets with estimable useful lives be amortized to their estimated residual values, and reviewed for impairment in accordance with ASC Topic 360, Property, Plant, and EquipmentIntangible assets primarily consist of trademarks, license agreements, core technology, patents and patent applications, product formulas, and supplier and customer relationships.Certain trademarks have been determined to have indefinite useful lives, and therefore the carrying value is reviewed at least annually for recoverability in accordance with the requirements of ASC Topic 350.Other intangible assets are amortized on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of the assets, generally between 5 and 40 years, and tested for impairment whenever conditions indicate that an asset may be impaired.The Company annually reviews the remaining useful lives of its finite-lived intangible assets to assess the appropriateness of their life. Impairment of Long-Lived Assets The Company assesses and measures any impairment of long-lived assets other than goodwill and indefinite life intangibles in accordance with the provisions of ASC Topic 360.If facts and circumstances suggest that a long-lived asset may be impaired, the carrying value is reviewed.If this review indicates that the carrying value of the asset will not be recovered, as determined based on projected undiscounted cash flows related to the asset over its remaining life, the carrying value of the asset is reduced to its estimated fair value.The Company has not incurred any material impairment of long-lived assets during 2010, 2009 and 2008. Fair Value of Financial Instruments Financial instruments consist principally of cash, accounts receivable, notes receivable, accounts payable and debt.The estimated fair value of these instruments approximates their carrying value.Due to the short term nature of the notes receivable, book value approximates fair value. Shipping and Handling Shipping and handling costs are included as a component of cost of sales.Shipping and handling costs billed to customers are included in sales. Revenue Recognition Revenue from the sale of products is recorded at the time title passes, generally when the products are shipped, as the Companys shipping terms are customarily FOB shipping point. The Company generally requires payment within 30 days from the date of invoice and offers cash discounts for early payment. For certain acquired businesses that offer different terms, the Company migrates these customers to the terms referred above over time. The Company offers discounts to its distributors if certain conditions are met. Customer allowances, volume discounts and rebates, and other short-term incentive programs are recorded as a reduction in reported revenues at the time of sale. The Company reduces product revenue for the estimated redemption of annual rebates on certain current product sales. Customer allowances and rebates are estimated based on historical experience and known trends. The policy with respect to sales returns generally provides that a customer may not return inventory except at the Companys option. The Company generally warrants its products against defects, and its most generous policy provides a two-year parts and labor warranty on X-ray machines. The Company owns X-ray equipment rented on a month-to-month basis to customers. The Company adopted the disclosure requirements of ASC Topic 605, Revenue Recognition that is, gross versus net presentation for tax receipts on the face of their income statements. The scope of this guidance includes any tax assessed by a governmental authority that is directly imposed on a revenue-producing transaction between a seller and a customer and may include, but is not limited to, sales, use, value added, and some excise taxes gross receipts taxes are excluded. The Company presents such taxes on a net basis. 33    Advertising Costs Advertising costs are expensed when incurred.Advertising costs were approximately, $3,645, $3,381, and $2,857, for 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively. Research and Development Costs Research and development costs are expensed when incurred and totaled $840, $797, and $796 for 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively. Interest Expense, net Interest expense, net includes interest paid related to borrowings on the Companys credit facility, as well as interest income earned on various investments and notes receivable.In 2010, 2009 and 2008, interest income totaled $119, $208, and, $367, respectively, and interest expense totaled $441, $873, and $1,699, respectively. Other Income Expense, net Other income expense, net includes foreign currency transaction gain/loss and other miscellaneous income, all of which are not directly related to the Companys primary business. Income Taxes The Company accounts for income taxes under ASC Topic 740, Income Taxes, which requires an asset and liability approach to accounting for and reporting income taxes.Deferred income taxes are provided for temporary differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and the tax basis of existing assets and liabilities using rates which are expected to apply in the period the differences are estimated to reverse. The Company follows the provisions of ASC 740, Income Taxes related to the accounting for uncertain tax provisions. Topic 740 requires the Company to maintain a liability for underpayment of income taxes and related interest and penalties, if any, for uncertain income tax positions. In considering the need for and magnitude of a liability for uncertain income tax positions, the Company must make certain estimates and assumptions regarding the amount of income tax benefit that will ultimately be realized. The ultimate resolution of an uncertain tax position may not be known for a number of years, during which time the Company may be required to adjust these provisions, in light of changing facts and circumstances. Share-Based Compensation In accordance with ASC Topic 718, Compensation- Stock Compensation, compensation cost is recognized within the financial statements at the grant date based on the awards fair value.Stock option fair value is calculated by an option pricing model, and is recognized as expense ratably over the requisite service period.The option pricing models require judgmental assumptions, including:volatility, forfeiture rates, and expected option life.The Company uses the Black-Scholes option pricing model.Compensation expense is also recognized for restricted stock over the vesting period using the fair value of our Common Stock at the date of grant. Foreign Currency Translation The translation of financial statements into U.S dollars has been performed in accordance with ASC Topic 830, Foreign Currency Matters.The local currency for all entities included in the consolidated financial statements has been designated as the functional currency.Non-U.S. dollar denominated assets and liabilities have been translated into U.S. dollars at the rate of exchange prevailing at the balance sheet date.Revenues and expenses have been translated at the weighted average of exchange rates in effect during the year.Translation adjustments are recorded in accumulated comprehensive loss income.Net currency transaction gains losses included in other income expense, net were $68, $106, and $434 for 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively. 34    Segment Information The Company operates as a single reportable operating segment. While management monitors the revenue streams of various products, the identifiable segments' operations are managed and financial performance is evaluated on a company-wide basis. Accordingly, all of the Companys products are considered by management to be aggregated in one reportable operating segment. Supplemental Cash Flow Information Cash flows from operating activities include $6,134, $5,417, and $4,375 for the payment of federal, foreign, and state income taxes and $310, $691, and $1,846 for the payment of interest related to borrowings on the Companys credit facility during 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively. 3. INVESTMENTS On February 21, 2006, the Company invested in a private equity investment fund.At December 31, 2010, the Company has an unfunded capital commitment of up to $300.As of December 31, 2010, the total capital commitment paid by the Company was $1,950.Through December 31, 2009, the Company accounted for this investment under the equity method as the Company had an ability to exercise significant influence over the fund through board membership.Effective January 2010, the Companys investment no longer qualifies for equity method accounting as the Companys delegate to the board resigned.As of January 1, 2010, the Company is accounting for its investment using the cost method.The Company no longer records equity earnings or losses as a result of this change.The Companys loss attributed to this private equity investment was included in other income expense, net and totaled $75 and $89 in 2009 and 2008 respectively. 4.MAJOR CUSTOMERS AND CREDIT CONCENTRATION The Company generates trade accounts receivable in the normal course of business.The Company grants credit to distributors and customers throughout the world and generally does not require collateral to secure the accounts receivable. The Companys credit risk is concentrated among two distributors that together accounted for 34% and 41% of accounts receivable at December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively. The percentage of net sales made to major distributors of the Companys continuing operations were as follows

127 5. NOTES RECEIVABLE The Company offers various financing options to its X-ray equipment customers, which includes notes payable to the Company.The X-ray equipment is used to secure the notes.These transactions are recorded as a sale upon the transfer of title to the purchaser, which generally occurs at the time of shipment, at an amount equal to the sales price of non-financed sales.Interest on these notes is accrued as earned and recorded as interest income. On January 16, 2008, the Company transferred a majority of its X-ray equipment loans to a third party for a cash payment of $3,519.The Company transferred $4,154 of the notes receivable portfolio for a purchase price of $4,140.Of the purchase price, $621 is subject to a recourse holdback pool that has been established with respect to the limited recourse the third party has on the loans.On May 5, 2008, the Company transferred additional X-ray equipment loans to a third party for a cash payment of $235.There is an additional $42 subject to a recourse holdback pool.As the transactions do not qualify as sales of assets under ASC Topic 860, Transfers and Servicing, the transactions have been treated as financing and the loans remain on the Companys balance sheet.As the third party receives payments on the transferred notes, the Company reduces the corresponding notes receivable and secured borrowing balances.As of December 31, 2010, the residual amount of notes receivable transferred to a third party was $655, of which $467 is classified as a short-term notes receivable and $188 as a long-term notes receivable.A corresponding long-term and short-term liability has been recorded, net of the recourse holdback pool of $136, on the Companys balance sheet. 35    Notes receivable consist of the following

Any employee of the Company or its affiliates, any consultant whom the Compensation Committee determines is significantly responsible for the Companys success and future growth and profitability, and any member of the Board of Directors, may be eligible to receive awards under the 2006 Plan.The purpose of the 2006 Plan is to: a attract and retain highly competent persons as employees, directors, and consultants of the Company; b provide additional incentives to such employees, directors, and consultants by aligning their interests with those of the Companys shareholders; and c promote the success of the business of the Company.The Compensation Committee establishes vesting schedules for each option issued under the Plan.Under the 1997 Plan, outstanding options generally vested over a period of up to four years while non-vested equity shares vested over five years.Under the 2006 Plan, outstanding options generally vest over a period of up to three years while non-vested equity shares vest over one, two, three, four and five year periods.All outstanding options expire ten years from the date of grant under the 1997 Plan and five years from the date of grant under the 2006 Plan. Under the provisions of Topic 718, share-based compensation cost is estimated at the grant date based on the awards fair-value as calculated by an option pricing model, and is recognized as expense ratably over the requisite service period. The option pricing models require judgmental assumptions including volatility, forfeiture rates, and expected option life. If any of the assumptions used in the model change significantly, share-based compensation expense may differ in the future from that recorded in the current period. 39    Stock Options
During the year ended December 31, 2010, 2009, and 2008, the Company recorded pre-tax compensation expense of $77, $222, and $241 related to the Companys stock option shares.As of December 31, 2010, there was approximately $6 of unrecognized compensation expense related to stock options, which will be recognized over the weighted-average remaining requisite service period of 012 years.The total aggregate intrinsic value of options exercised was $1,589, $769, and $378 for the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009, and 2008, respectively.Payments received upon the exercise of stock options were $1,589, $918, and $443 for the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009, and 2008, respectively.The related tax shortfall benefit realized related to these exercises and restricted stock vesting was $645, $86, and $24 for the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009, and 2008, respectively.The Company issues shares from treasury upon share option exercises. The Company granted 863 shares in 2008 with a weighted-average exercise price of $2367.The fair value of each option grant is estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option pricing model.The weighted-average estimated value of stock options granted during the year ended December 31, 2008 was $527 per share, respectively, using the following weighted-average assumptions 
2008 Dividend yield 1 068 Expected volatility 2 28 Risk-free interest rate 3 235 Expected life 4 35 1Represents cash dividends paid as a percentage of the share price on the date of grant.
2Based on historical volatility of the Companys Common Stock over the expected life of the options.
3Represents the U.S. Treasury STRIP rates over maturity periods matching the expected term of the options at thetime of grant.

Non-Vested Equity Shares
Under the 2006 Plan, non-vested equity share units and restricted stock may be awarded or sold to participants under terms and conditions established by the Compensation Committee.The Company calculates compensation cost for restricted stock grants to employees and non-employee directors by using the fair value of its Common Stock at the date of grant and the number of shares issued. This compensation cost is amortized over the applicable vesting period.During the year ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008, the Company recorded pre-tax compensation expense of $1,619, $1,465, and $1,201, respectively, related to the Companys non-vested equity shares.As of December 31, 2010, there was approximately $2,797 of unrecognized compensation cost related to non-vested equity shares which will be amortized over the weighted-average remaining requisite service period of 116 years.The Company issues share grants from treasury. 40    The following table details the status and changes in non-vested equity shares for the year ended December 31,2010

Current deferred income tax assets of $2,932 and $2,420 are included in other current assets as of December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively. 42    Applicable U.S. income and foreign withholding taxes have not been provided on approximately $100 of undistributed earnings of the Company foreign subsidiary for the year ended December 31, 2008. These earnings are considered to be permanently invested and, under certain tax laws, are not subject to taxes unless distributed as dividends, loaned to the Company or a U.S. affiliate, or if the Company sold its investment in the foreign subsidiary.Tax on such potential distributions would be partially offset by foreign tax credits. If the earnings were not considered permanently invested, approximately $29 of additional deferred income taxes would need to be provided for the year ended December 31, 2008.Earnings of the Companys foreign subsidiary subsequent to December 31, 2008 are not classified as permanently invested and have been taxed accordingly. 15.SALES OF EQUIPMENT RENTED TO OTHERS Periodically, customers who rent X-ray equipment from the Company elect to purchase the equipment.The Company recognizes revenue from the proceeds of such sales and records as cost of goods sold the net book value of the equipment.Net sales of equipment consistent with this practice were $492, $787, and $1,600 for 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively, and gross profit from these sales was $288, $461, and $868 for 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively. 16.EMPLOYEE BENEFITS The Company has defined contribution 401k plans covering substantially all full-time employees meeting service and age requirements.Contributions to the Plan can be made by an employee through deferred compensation and through a discretionary employer contribution.Compensation expense related to this plan was $471, $461, and $553 for 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively. The Company also offers certain healthcare insurance benefits for substantially all employees. 17.RELATED-PARTY TRANSACTIONS The Company paid consulting fees of $50 each year in 2009 and 2008 to a corporation, which is wholly owned by George E. Richmond, the Companys Vice Chairman and principal stockholder.On February 25, 2010, the Company terminated its consulting agreement with this corporation effective December 31, 2009. The Company has an employment agreement with George E. Richmond, the Companys Vice Chairman and principal stockholder, which paid him $50 each year in 2009 and 2008, to perform such duties as may be assigned to him by the Companys Board of Directors or Chief Executive Officer.On February 25, 2010, the Companyincreased his base salary from $50 to $100. 18.EARNINGS PER SHARE Basic earnings per share Basic EPS is computed by dividing net income by the weighted average number of shares of Common Stock outstanding and total number of shares of restricted stock during the period.Diluted earnings per share Diluted EPS include the dilutive effect of stock options if any, using the treasury stock method.The following table sets forth the computation of basic and diluted earnings per share

Full-year 2009 basic earnings per share do not equal the sum of the quarters due to rounding. 20.COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES The Company leases certain office and warehouse space, manufacturing facilities and equipment under non-cancelable operating leases.The total rental expense for all operating leases was $521, $527, and $780 for 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively.Rental commitments amount to $501 for 2011, $281 for 2012, $5 for 2013, $0 for 2014, and $0 for 2015. In certain circumstances, the Company provides recourse for loans for X-ray equipment purchases by customers. Certain banks require the Company to provide recourse to finance X-ray equipment for new dentists and other customers with credit histories which are not consistent with the banks' lending criteria. In the event that a bank requires recourse on a given loan, the Company would assume the banks security interest in the equipment securing the loan.As of December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively, approximately $0, $579, and $788 of the X-ray equipment financed with various lenders were subject to such recourse.Recourse on a given loan is generally for the life of the loan.Based on the Companys past experience with respect to these arrangements, it is the opinion of management that the fair value of the recourse provided is minimal and not material to the results of operations or financial position of the Company. The Company and its subsidiaries from time to time are parties to various legal proceedings arising in the normal course of business.Management believes that none of these proceedings, if determined adversely, would have a material adverse effect on the Companys financial position, results of operations or liquidity. The policy with respect to sales returns generally provides that a customer may not return inventory except at the Companys option, with the exception of X-ray equipment.Historically, the level of product returns has not been significant.The Company generally warrants its products against defects, and its most generous policy provides a two-year parts and labor warranty on X-ray machines.The accrual for warranty costs was $293 and $292 at December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively.The following is a rollforward of the Companys warranty accrual 44

21.SUBSEQUENT EVENTS Due to changes in enacted state tax laws during January 2011, the Company will recognize an additional tax charge in the first quarter of 2011. The impact on the financial statements is being evaluated by the Company. In January 2011, the Company recognized other income of approximately $400 related to the sale of a portion of its private equity investment fund.The Company could receive additional amounts in the future related to excess funds being released from escrow or a potential additional earn-out based on financial performance. On January 31, 2011, the Board of Directors declared a quarterly dividend of $004 per share, payable to all shareholders of record on February 15, 2010. On February 10, 2011, the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors issued 54 shares of restricted stock to certain employees. 45    Item 1. Business
