ITEM 8. FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SCHEDULES
INDEPENDENT AUDITORS' REPORT
ACT Manufacturing, Inc. We have audited the accompanying balance sheets of ACT Manufacturing, Inc. as
of December 31, 1996 and 1995, and the related statements of income,
stockholders' equity, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period
ended December 31, 1996. Our audits also included the financial statement
schedule listed in Item 14. These financial statements and financial statment
schedule are the responsibility of the Company management. Our responsibility
is to express an opinion on these financial statements and financial statement
schedule based on our audits.
We conducted our audits in accordance with generally accepted auditing
standards. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to
obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of
material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence
supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit
also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant
estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial
statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis
for our opinion.
In our opinion, such financial statements present fairly, in all material
respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 1996 and
1995, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the
three years in the period ended December 31, 1996, in conformity with generally
accepted accounting principles. Also, in our opinion, such financial statement
schedule, when considered in relation to the basic financial statements taken
as a whole, presents fairly in all material respects the information set forth
therein.

ACT MANUFACTURING, INC.
NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
1.  NATURE OF BUSINESS AND SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
NATURE OF BUSINESS - ACT Manufacturing, Inc. provides value-added, turnkey
contract manufacturing services for emerging and major original equipment
manufacturers in the commercial electronics industry. The Company
supplies these manufacturers with electronic interconnection assemblies,
including complex printed circuit board assemblies primarily utilizing
advanced surface mount technology, mechanical and molded cable and harness
assemblies and electro-mechanical subassemblies, and, more recently, the
Company has begun to emphasize total system assemblies.
STOCK SPLIT - All share and per share data have been retroactively
adjusted to reflect the 280-for-1 stock split of the Company common
stock on March 23, 1995.
USE OF ESTIMATES - The preparation of the Company financial statements
in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles necessarily
requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the
reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent
assets and liabilities at the balance sheet dates. Estimates include such
items as reserves for accounts receivable and inventory, useful lives of
other assets and property and equipment, and accrued liabilities.
FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS - Statement of Financial Accounting
Standards No. 107, Disclosures About Fair Value of Financial
Instruments, requires disclosure of the fair value of certain financial
instruments. The carrying amounts of cash, cash equivalents, accounts
receivable, accounts payable and accrued expenses approximate fair value
because of their short-term nature. The carrying amounts of the Company
debt instruments approximate fair value Note 5.
REVENUE RECOGNITION - Revenue from both product sales and assembly service
is recognized upon shipment of the product.
CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS - For the purposes of the statement of cash
flows, the Company considers all highly liquid debt instruments purchased
with a remaining maturity of three months or less to be cash equivalents.
INVENTORY - Inventory is valued at the lower of cost or market using the
first-in, first-out FIFO method.
PROPERTY AND EQUIPMENT - Purchased property and equipment is recorded at
cost. Capital lease property and equipment is recorded at the lesser of
cost or the present value of the minimum lease payments required.
Depreciation and amortization are provided using the straight-line method
over the estimated useful lives of the related assets five to seven
years and over the terms of the related leases five years.

1.  NATURE OF BUSINESS AND SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
CONTINUED
OTHER ASSETS - The present value of future payments required under a
noncompete agreement entered into in 1993 has been recorded as an
intangible asset. The total amount recorded was approximately $476,000.
The asset is being amortized over the term of the agreement ten years.
Accumulated amortization of the asset was approximately $ 31,000 in 1996,
$24,000 in 1995 and $18,000 in 1994. A corresponding liability has been
recorded see Note 5.
WARRANTY - The Company generally warrants that its hardware assemblies
will be free from defects in workmanship for 12 months and passes on to
the customer any warranties provided by component manufacturers and
material suppliers to the extent permitted. Warranty costs have not been
material to date, accordingly, no reserves have been provided for.
INCOME TAXES - In 1994 and a portion of 1995, the Company was taxed under
Subchapter S of the Internal Revenue Code. As a result, the Company was
not subject to federal income taxes, and the taxable income of the Company
was included in the stockholders' individual tax returns. The Company was
subject to income and excise taxes in accordance with the statutory
requirements of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts.
Effective immediately prior to the commencement of the Company initial
public offering, the Company S Corporation election was terminated, and
the Company has been subject to federal and state income taxes as a C
Corporation from that date forward.
The Company accounts for income taxes under Statement of Financial
Accounting Standards SFAS No. 109, Accounting for Income Taxes. This
Statement requires recognition of deferred tax liabilities and assets for
the expected future tax consequences of events that have been included in
the Company financial statements or tax returns. Deferred tax
liabilities and assets are determined based on the difference between the
financial statement carrying amounts and tax bases of existing assets and
liabilities, using enacted tax rates in effect in the years in which the
differences are expected to reverse.
STOCK BASED COMPENSATION - Effective January 1, 1996 the Company adopted
SFAS No. 123, Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation. As permitted by
SFAS 123, the Company accounts for stock option grants using the intrinsic
value method in accordance with Accounting Principles Board APB
Opinion No. 25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees. Accordingly,
the Company recognized no compensation expense for stock option grants.
NET INCOME PER COMMON SHARE - Net Income per share is based on the
weighted average number of common and dilutive common equivalent shares
common stock options outstanding.
SUPPLEMENTAL CASH FLOW INFORMATION - Selected cash payments and noncash
activities were as follows                    25
1996      1995      1994
Cash paid for interest                     $ 1,446,000   $  358,000  $ 466,000
Cash paid for income taxes                    5,713,000    1,070,000    239,000
Noncash investing and financing activities
Reduction in note receivable in exchange for services       4,546      4,403     7,500
Reduction in income taxes payable for disqualifying
common stock dispositions                   763,625     715,759          RECENTLY ISSUED FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING STANDARD - In March 1995, the
Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Statement of Financial
Accounting Standards No. 121, Accounting for the Impairment of Long-Lived
Assets and for Long-Lived Assets to Be Disposed Of SFAS 121. SFAS 121
requires that long-lived assets held and used by an entity be reviewed for
impairment whenever circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an
asset may not be recoverable. It also requires that long-lived assets to
be disposed of be reported at the lower of the carrying amount or fair
values less the cost to sell. The Company adopted SFAS 121 effective
January 1, 1996 and it did not have a material effect on the Company
financial position or results of operations.
2.  PRO FORMA INFORMATION
PRO FORMA NET INCOME AND NET INCOME PER COMMON SHARE - The pro forma
adjustments reflect what the effects on historical net income would have
been had the Company operated as a C Corporation for all periods
presented. The adjustments include a provision for state and federal
income taxes at an effective rate of approximately 40%, as if the Company
was subject to such taxes. In connection with its initial public
offering, the Company terminated its status as an S Corporation.
Pro forma net income per share is based on the weighted average number of
common and dilutive common equivalent shares common stock options
outstanding. Common equivalent shares are not included in the per share
calculations where the effect of their inclusion would be antidilutive,
except in accordance with Securities and Exchange Commission Staff
Accounting Bulletin No. 83 the Bulletin. The Bulletin required all
common shares issued and options to purchase shares of common stock
granted by the Company during the twelve-month period prior to the filing
of the initial public offering be included in the calculation as if they
were outstanding for all periods.
The pro forma weighted average number of shares outstanding has also been
adjusted to include the number of common shares 650,000 that the Company
would have needed to issue at the initial offering price $12 per common
share to fund the distribution of previously taxed but undistributed S
Corporation earnings through December 31, 1995 actual was $ 7,893,806.
The actual amount distributed was adjusted to include the taxable income of
the Company for the period from January 1, 1995 through March 29, 1995, the
date immediately preceding the closing of the offering, less any state
income tax payable by the Company with respect to such income an
additional $2,084,387 was distributed.

BANK LINE OF CREDIT - The Company has a line of credit with a consortium
of banks which provides for borrowings up to an aggregate amount of
$33,000,000, limited to a certain percentage of accounts receivable and
inventory. The line-of-credit facility is not payable on demand until
1998; therefore, the outstanding balance is classified as noncurrent.
Interest is payable monthly at the bank prime rate 825% at December
31, 1996. Borrowings are collateralized by substantially all of the
Company assets. Based upon eligible accounts receivable and inventory,
the amount available for additional borrowings as of December 31, 1996 was
approximately $4,145,025. Per agreement with its bank, the Company is
required to maintain certain levels of net worth, total debt to net worth,
debt service coverage, net profit before taxes on an absolute basis and
net profit before taxes as a percentage of sales. The facility prohibits
capital expenditures in excess of certain amounts and payment of cash
dividends on the Company capital stock. The Company is in compliance
with the financial covenants under its secured credit facility.
EQUIPMENT LEASES - As of December 31, 1996, the Company had an available
equipment lease line of $200 million under which $132 million of
commitments were outstanding.

5. LONG-TERM DEBT CONTINUED
NONCOMPETE COVENANT - In 1993, the Company entered into an agreement with
its former sole stockholder which provides for monthly payments over a
ten-year period, in return for a promise not to compete. The liability is
recorded at the present value of the required future payments at an
interest rate of 8%.
Long-term debt at December 31, 1996 is due as follows

As described in Note 1, the Company uses the intrinsic value method to
measure compensation expense associated with grants of stock options to
employees. Had the Company used the fair value method to measure
compensation, reported net income and net income per share would have been as
follows                         1996     1995
Income before income tax provision    $16,500,914  $7,163,485
Income tax provision            6,773,000  2,999,000
Net income                $ 9,727,914  $4,164,485 
Earnings per common share         $   107  $   51
The fair value of options on their grant date was measured using the
Black/Scholes option pricing model. Key assumptions used to apply this
pricing model are as follows                           1996     1995
Risk-free interest rate              64%     59%
Expected life of option grants        3 - 5 years  3 - 5 years
Expected volatility of underlying 
stock                       63%      66  It should be noted that the option pricing model used was designed to value
readily tradable stock options with relatively short lives. The options
granted to employees are not tradable and have contractual lives of up to ten
years. However, management believes that the assumptions used to value the
options and the model applied yield a reasonable estimate of the fair value
of the grants made under the circumstances.
8. EMPLOYEE BENEFITS PLAN
During 1994, the Company adopted a savings plan for its employees pursuant to
Section 401k of the Internal Revenue Code. Substantially all employees are
eligible to participate, and the plan allows a deferral ranging from a
minimum 1% to the maximum percentage of compensation permitted by law.
Company contributions to the plan are at the discretion of the Board of
Directors. Contributions to the Plan were $0 and $50,000 in 1996 and 1995,
respectively.

9.  MAJOR CUSTOMERS
The four largest customers accounted for 20%, 17%, 13% and 13    respectively of the Company net sales for 1996. In 1995, the Company
largest customer accounted for 41% of net sales for 1995. In 1994, the
Company largest customer accounted for 55% of net sales for 1994.
10.  TRANSACTIONS WITH RELATED PARTIES
The Company leases certain facilities and equipment from a realty trust
controlled by its principal stockholder under leases which expire in 2003.
These commitments are included in Note 11. The Company pays all operating
costs of the building. Total payments to the realty trust were
approximately $364,000 in 1996, and $388,000 in 1995 and 1994,
respectively.
In 1993, the Company entered into a ten-year agreement with one of its
directors for future consulting services. Payments under the agreement
were approximately $240,000 in 1996, $222,000 in 1995 and $206,000 in
1994. Future commitments under this agreement are approximately $259,000
in 1997, $280,000 in 1998, $302,000 in 1999, $326,000 in 2000, $352,000 in

and $54,000 in 1994.
11.  OPERATING LEASE COMMITMENTS
The Company leases various plant and office equipment under noncancelable
operating leases expiring through 2001. Rent expense in 1996, 1995 and
1994 was approximately $2,700,000, $1,345,000, and $1,083,000,
respectively. The future minimum rental payments under these leases over
the next five years are approximately as follows
