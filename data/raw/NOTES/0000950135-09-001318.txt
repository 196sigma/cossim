Financial
Statements and Supplementary Data   REPORT OF
INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM   To Board of Directors and Shareholders of   MKS Instruments, Inc.   In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements listed in
the index appearing under a1 present fairly, in
all material respects, the financial position of MKS
Instruments, Inc. and its subsidiaries at December31, 2008
and 2007, and the results of their operations and their cash
flows for each of the three years in the period ended
December31, 2008 in conformity with accounting principles
generally accepted in the United States of America. In addition,
in our opinion, the financial statement schedule listed in the
index appearing under a2 presents fairly, in all
material respects, the information set forth therein when read
in conjunction with the related consolidated financial
statements. Also in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all
material respects, effective internal control over financial
reporting as of December31, 2008, based on criteria
established in Internal Control Integrated
Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring
Organizations of the Treadway Commission COSO. The
Companys management is responsible for these financial
statements and financial statement schedule, for maintaining
effective internal control over financial reporting and for its
assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over
financial reporting, included in the accompanying
Managements Report on Internal Control over Financial
Reporting appearing under Item9A. Our responsibility is to
express opinions on these financial statements, on the financial
statement schedule, and on the Companys internal control
over financial reporting based on our integrated audits. We
conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the
Public Company Accounting Oversight Board United States. Those
standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are
free of material misstatement and whether effective internal
control over financial reporting was maintained in all material
respects. Our audits of the financial statements included
examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and
disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the
accounting principles used and significant estimates made by
management, and evaluating the overall financial statement
presentation. Our audit of internal control over financial
reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal
control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a
material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design
and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the
assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other
procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We
believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our
opinions.   As discussed in Note12 to the consolidated financial
statements, the Company changed the manner in which it accounts
for uncertain tax positions in2007.   A companys internal control over financial reporting is a
process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the
reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of
financial statements for external purposes in accordance with
generally accepted accounting principles. A companys
internal control over financial reporting includes those
policies and procedures that ipertain to the maintenance
of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly
reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the
company; iiprovide reasonable assurance that
transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of
financial statements in accordance with generally accepted
accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the
company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of
management and directors of the company; and iiiprovide
reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of
unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the
companys assets that could have a material effect on the
financial statements.   Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over
financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.
Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future
periods are subject to the risk that controls may become
inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree
of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.     Boston, Massachusetts   February27, 2009

Summary
of Significant Accounting Policies   Basis of
Presentation   The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of
MKS Instruments, Inc. and its wholly owned subsidiaries
collectively, the Company. All significant
intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated in
consolidation.   Use of
Estimates   The consolidated financial statements have been prepared in
accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the
United States of America. The preparation of these financial
statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions
that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and
the disclosure of contingent liabilities at the date of the
financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and
expenses during the reporting period. On an on-going basis,
management evaluates its estimates and judgments, including
those related to revenue recognition, stock-based compensation,
inventory, intangible assets, goodwill, and other long-lived
assets, in-process research and development, income taxes and
investments. Management bases its estimates and judgments on
historical experience and on various other factors that are
believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results
of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying
values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent
from other sources. Actual results may differ from these
estimates under different assumptions or conditions.   Reclassifications   The Company recorded $33million in legal costs associated
with defending and maintaining its intellectual property in
research and development expenses for the year ended
December31, 2008. These costs were previously recorded in
selling, general and administrative expenses in the amount of
$25million and $25million during the years 2007
and 2006, respectively. The 2007 and 2006 patent legal costs
have subsequently been classified as research and development
expenses.   Revenue
Recognition and Accounts Receivable Allowances   Revenue from product sales is recorded upon transfer of title
and risk of loss to the customer provided that there is evidence
of an arrangement, the sales price is fixed or determinable, and
collection of the related receivable is reasonably assured. In
most transactions, the Company has no obligations to customers
after the date products are shipped other than pursuant to
warranty obligations. In some instances, the Company provides
installation, training, support and services to customers after
the product has been shipped. For revenue arrangements with
multiple deliverables, the Company defers the fair value related
to any undelivered elements until the undelivered element is
delivered. Fair value is the price charged when the element is
sold separately. The Company provides for the estimated costs to
fulfill customer warranty obligations upon the recognition of
the related revenue. Shipping and handling fees, if any, billed
to customers are recognized as revenue. The related shipping and
handling costs are

in thousands, except share and per share data   recognized in cost of sales. Accounts receivable allowances
include sales returns and bad debt allowances. The Company
monitors and tracks the amount of product returns and reduces
revenue at the time of shipment for the estimated amount of such
future returns, based on historical experience. The Company
makes estimates evaluating its allowance for doubtful accounts.
The Company continuously monitors collections and payments from
its customers and maintains a provision for estimated credit
losses based upon its historical experience and any specific
customer collection issues that it has identified.   Research
and Development   Research and development costs are expensed as incurred and
consist mainly of compensation related expenses and project
materials. The Companys research and development efforts
include numerous projects, which generally have duration of 12
to 30months.   In-Process
Research and Development   The Company values tangible and intangible assets acquired
through its business acquisitions at fair value including
in-process research and development IPRD.
The Company determines IPRD through established valuation
techniques for various projects for the development of new
products and technologies and expenses IPRD when technical
feasibility is not reached.   Advertising
Costs   Advertising costs are expensed as incurred and were immaterial
in 2008, 2007 and 2006.   Stock-Based
Compensation   The Company accounts for share-based compensation expense in
accordance with SFAS123R, which requires the measurement
and recognition of compensation expense for all share-based
payment awards made to employees and directors based on
estimated fair values. The Company has estimated the fair value
of share-based options on the date of grant using the Black
Scholes pricing model, which is affected by the Companys
stock price as well as assumptions regarding a number of complex
and subjective variables. These variables include the
Companys expected stock price volatility over the term of
the awards, actual and projected employee option exercise
behaviors, risk free interest rate and expected dividends. The
Company is also required to estimate forfeitures at the time of
grant and revise those estimates in subsequent periods if actual
forfeitures differ from those estimates.   Management determined that blended volatility, a combination of
historical and implied volatility, is more reflective of market
conditions and a better indicator of expected volatility than
historical or implied volatility. The assumptions used in
calculating the fair value of share-based payment awards
represent managements best estimates, but these estimates
involve inherent uncertainties and the application of management
judgment. As a result, if factors change and the Company uses
different assumptions, its stock-based compensation expense
could be materially different in the future.   Net
Income Per Share   Basic earnings per share is based on the weighted average number
of common shares outstanding, and diluted earnings per share is
based on the weighted average number of common shares
outstanding and all dilutive potential common equivalent shares
outstanding. The dilutive effect of options is determined under
the treasury stock method using the average market price for the
period. Common equivalent shares are included in the per share
calculations when the effect of their inclusion would be
dilutive.

in thousands, except share and per share data   Cash and
Cash Equivalents and Investments   All highly liquid investments with a maturity date of three
months or less at the date of purchase are considered to be cash
equivalents. The appropriate classification of investments in
securities is determined at the time of purchase. Debt
securities that the Company does not have the intent and ability
to hold to maturity are classified as
available-for-sale and are carried at fair value.
Unrealized gains and losses on securities classified as
available-for-sale are included in accumulated other
comprehensive income in consolidated stockholders equity.   The Company reviews its investment portfolio on a monthly basis
to identify and evaluate individual investments that have
indications of possible impairment. The factors considered in
determining whether a loss is other-than-temporary include: the
length of time and extent to which fair market value has been
below the cost basis, the financial condition and near-term
prospects of the issuer, credit quality, and the Companys
ability to hold the investment for a period of time sufficient
to allow for any anticipated recovery in fair value.   Inventories   The Company values its inventory at the lower of cost
first-in,
first-out method or market. The Company regularly reviews
inventory quantities on hand and records a provision to write
down excess and obsolete inventory to its estimated net
realizable value, if less than cost, based primarily on its
estimated forecast of product demand.   Property,
Plant and Equipment   Property, plant and equipment are stated at cost. Equipment
acquired under capital leases is recorded at the present value
of the minimum lease payments required during the lease period.
Expenditures for major renewals and betterments that extend the
useful lives of property, plant and equipment are capitalized.
Expenditures for maintenance and repairs are charged to expense
as incurred. When assets are sold or otherwise disposed of, the
cost and related accumulated depreciation are eliminated from
the accounts and any resulting gain or loss is recognized in
earnings.   Depreciation is provided on the straight-line method over the
estimated useful lives of twenty to thirty-one and one-half
years for buildings and three to seven years for machinery and
equipment and furniture and fixtures and office equipment, which
includes ERP software. Leasehold improvements are amortized over
the shorter of the lease term or the estimated useful life of
the leased asset.   Intangible
Assets   Intangible assets resulting from the acquisitions of entities
accounted for using the purchase method of accounting are
estimated by management based on the fair value of assets
acquired. These include acquired customer lists, technology,
patents, trade name and covenants not to compete. Intangible
assets are amortized from two to eight years on a straight-line
basis which represents the estimated periods of benefit.   Goodwill   Goodwill is the amount by which the cost of acquired net assets
exceeded the fair value of those net assets on the date of
acquisition. The Company allocates goodwill to reporting units
at the time of acquisition and base that allocation on which
reporting units will benefit from the acquired assets and
liabilities. Reporting units are defined as operating segments
or one level below an operating segment, referred to as a
component. The Company has determined that its reporting units
are components of its one operating segment. The Company
assesses goodwill for impairment on an annual basis as required
under FAS142 on October 31 or more frequently when events
and circumstances occur indicating that the recorded goodwill
may be impaired. If the book value of a reporting unit exceeds
its fair value, the implied fair value of goodwill is compared
with the carrying amount of goodwill. If the carrying amount of
goodwill exceeds the implied fair value, an impairment loss is
recorded equal to that excess.

of Long-Lived Assets   The Company evaluates the recoverability of its long-lived
assets, in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting
Standards No144, Accounting for the Impairment or
Disposal of Long-Lived Assets SFAS144
whenever events and changes in circumstances indicate that the
carrying amount of an asset may not be fully recoverable. This
periodic review may result in an adjustment of estimated
depreciable lives or asset impairment. When indicators of
impairment are present, the carrying values of the asset are
evaluated in relation to their operating performance and future
undiscounted cash flows of the underlying business. If the
future undiscounted cash flows are less than their book value,
impairment exists. The impairment is measured as the difference
between the book value and the fair value of the underlying
asset. Fair values are based on estimates of market prices and
assumptions concerning the amount and timing of estimated future
cash flows and assumed discount rates, reflecting varying
degrees of perceived risk.   Foreign
Exchange   The functional currency of the majority of the Companys
foreign subsidiaries is the applicable local currency. For those
subsidiaries, assets and liabilities are translated to
U.S.dollars at year-end exchange rates. Income and expense
accounts are translated at the average exchange rates prevailing
during the year. The resulting translation adjustments are
included in accumulated other comprehensive income in
consolidated stockholders equity. Foreign exchange
transaction gains and losses, which arise from transaction
activity, are reflected in the statement of operations.   Income
Taxes   The Company records income taxes using the asset and liability
method. Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are
recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to
differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of
existing assets and liabilities and their respective income tax
bases, and operating loss and tax credit carryforwards. On a
quarterly basis, the Company evaluates both the positive and
negative evidence that bears on the realizability of net
deferred tax assets and assesses the need for valuation
allowance. The future benefit to be derived from its deferred
tax assets is dependent upon its ability to generate sufficient
future taxable income to realize the assets. The Company records
a valuation allowance to reduce its net deferred tax assets to
the amount that is more likely than not to be realized. To the
extent the Company establishes a valuation allowance, an expense
will be recorded within the provision for income taxes line on
the statement of operations. The valuation allowance at
December31, 2006 was $317,000, relating to the remaining
state tax credits acquired with the purchase of Ion. During
2007, the Company increased the valuation allowance for the
state tax loss carryforwards and state tax credits acquired in
the purchase of Yield Dynamics YDI. Thus, the
valuation allowance was $534,000 at December31, 2007.
During 2008, the Company increased the valuation allowance by
$3,303,000 for state tax credit carryforwards and $816,000 for
federal capital loss carryforwards, as the Company has
determined it is more likely than not that both of these tax
attributes will not be realized. As a result, the valuation
allowance is $4,653,000 at December31, 2008.   The Company adopted the provisions of FASB Interpretation
No48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income
Taxes FIN48 as of January1,
2007. FIN48 contains a two-step approach to recognizing
and measuring uncertain tax positions accounted for in
accordance with SFASNo109, Accounting for
Income Taxes. The first step is to evaluate the tax
position for recognition by determining if the weight of
available evidence indicates that it is more likely than not
that the position will be sustained upon audit, including
resolutions of related appeals or litigation processes, if any.
The second step is to measure the tax benefit as the largest
amount that is more than 50% likely of being realized upon
ultimate settlement. The Company reevaluates these uncertain tax
positions on a quarterly basis. This evaluation is based on
factors including, but not limited to, changes in facts or
circumstances, changes in tax law, effectively settled issues
under audit and new audit activity. Any change in these factors
could result in the recognition of a tax benefit or an
additional charge to the tax provision.

Accounting Pronouncements   In December 2007, the Financial Accounting Standards Board
FASB issued SFASNo141R,
Business Combinations SFAS141R,
which replaces SFASNo141. This revised standard
requires assets, liabilities and non-controlling interests
acquired to be measured at fair value and requires that costs
incurred to effect the acquisition be recognized separately from
the business combination. In addition, this statement expands
the scope to include all transactions and other events in which
one entity obtains control over one or more businesses. This
statement is effective for all business combinations for which
the acquisition date is on or after the beginning of the first
annual reporting period beginning on or after December15,
2008. The Company is in the process of evaluating whether the
adoption of this standard will have a material effect on its
consolidated financial statements.   In December 2007, the FASB issued SFASNo160,
Noncontrolling Interests in Consolidated Financial
Statements, an Amendment of ARB No51. This
statement establishes accounting and reporting standards for the
non-controlling interest in a subsidiary and for the
deconsolidation of a subsidiary. This statement is effective for
fiscal years beginning on or after December15, 2008. This
statement does not have a material impact on the Companys
consolidated financial statements, as it does not have any
minority interests.   In March 2008, the FASB issued SFASNo161,
Disclosures about Derivative Instruments and Hedging
Activities, an amendment of FASB Statement No133
SFAS161. This statement is intended to
improve transparency in financial reporting by requiring
enhanced disclosures of an entitys derivative instruments
and hedging activities and their effects on the entitys
financial position, financial performance, and cash flows.
SFAS161 applies to all derivative instruments within the
scope of SFAS133, Accounting for Derivative
Instruments and Hedging Activities
SFAS133. Entities with instruments subject
to SFAS161 must provide more robust qualitative
disclosures and expanded quantitative disclosures. SFAS161
is effective prospectively for financial statements issued for
fiscal years and interim periods beginning after
November15, 2008, with early application permitted. The
Company is currently evaluating the disclosure implications of
this statement.   In April 2008, the FASB issued FASB Staff Position
FSP
No142-3,
Determination of the Useful Life of Intangible
Assets
FSP142-3.
FSP142-3
amends the factors an entity should consider in developing
renewal or extension assumptions used in determining the useful
life of recognized intangible assets under FASB Statement
No142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets.
This new guidance applies prospectively to intangible assets
that are acquired individually or with a group of other assets
in business combinations and asset acquisitions.
FSP142-3
is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years
and interim periods beginning after December15, 2008.
Early adoption is prohibited. The Company is evaluating the
potential impact of the implementation of
FSP142-3
on its financial position and results of operations.

Cash and
Cash Equivalents and Investments   The Company reviews its investment portfolio on a monthly basis
to identify and evaluate individual investments that have
indications of possible impairment. The factors considered in
determining whether a loss is other-than-temporary include: the
length of time and extent to which fair market value has been
below the cost basis, the financial condition and near-term
prospects of the issuer, credit quality, and the Companys
ability to hold the investment for a period of time sufficient
to allow for any anticipated recovery in fair value. During this
review, as of December31, 2007, the Company determined
that declines in the fair value of two of its investments in
certain commercial paper were other-than-temporary. This
commercial paper was issued by two structured investment
vehicles SIVs that entered into receivership during the fourth
quarter of 2007 and failed to make payment at maturity. Due to
the mortgage-related assets held by these issuers, they were
exposed to adverse market conditions that affected the value of
their collateral and their ability to access short-term funding.
These investments were not trading on active markets, and
therefore, had no readily determinable market value. As a result
of the Companys evaluation as of December31, 2007,
it recorded a $1,457,000 impairment charge to earnings based
upon the Company receiving contemporaneous quotes from
established third-party pricing services. This resulted in a new
cost basis for the securities of $4,275,000 at December31,
2007.

Fair
Value Measurements   In February 2007, the FASB issued SFASNo159,
The Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and Financial
Liabilities Including an amendment of FASB Statement
No115, SFAS159 which is
effective for fiscal years beginning after November15,
2007. This statement permits entities to choose to measure many
financial instruments and certain other items at fair value.
This statement also establishes presentation and disclosure
requirements designed to facilitate comparisons between entities
that choose different measurement attributes for similar types
of assets and liabilities. Unrealized gains and losses on items
for which the fair value option is elected would be reported in
earnings. On January1, 2008, the Company adopted
SFAS159 and has elected not to measure any additional
financial instruments and other items at fair value.   In September 2006, the FASB issued SFASNo157,
Fair Value Measurements,
SFAS157, which is effective for fiscal years
beginning after November15, 2007. This statement defines
fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value and
expands the related disclosure requirements. This statement
applies under other accounting pronouncements that require or
permit fair value measurements. The statement indicates, among
other things, that a fair value measurement assumes that the
transaction to sell an asset or transfer a liability occurs

absence of a principal market, the most advantageous market for
the asset or liability. SFAS157 defines fair value based
upon an exit price model.   Relative to SFAS157, the FASB issued FASB Staff Positions
FSP
157-1 and
157-2.
FSP157-1
amends SFAS157 to exclude SFASNo13,

FSP157-2
delays the effective date of the application of SFAS157 to
fiscal years beginning after November15, 2008 for all
nonfinancial assets and nonfinancial liabilities that are
recognized or disclosed at fair value in the financial
statements on a nonrecurring basis.   The Company adopted SFAS157 as of January1, 2008,
with the exception of the application of the statement to
non-recurring nonfinancial assets and nonfinancial liabilities.
The adoption of SFAS157 did not have a material impact on
the consolidated financial statements. Non-recurring
nonfinancial assets and nonfinancial liabilities for which the
Company has not applied the provisions of SFAS157 include
those measured at fair value in goodwill impairment testing,
indefinite lived intangible assets measured at fair value for
impairment testing, asset retirement obligations initially
measured at fair value, and those initially measured at fair
value in a business combination.   SFAS157 also establishes a fair value hierarchy which
requires an entity to maximize the use of observable inputs and
minimize the use of unobservable inputs when measuring fair
value. The standard describes three levels of inputs that may be
used to measure fair value   	
Level 1   Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or
liabilities as of the reporting date. Active markets are those
in which transactions for the asset and liability occur in
sufficient frequency and volume to provide pricing information
on an ongoing basis. Level1 assets and liabilities include
debt and equity securities and derivative contracts that are
traded in an active exchange market.   Level 2   Observable inputs other than Level1 prices, such as quoted
prices for similar assets or liabilities; quoted prices in
markets that are not active; or other inputs that are observable
or can be corroborated by observable market data for
substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities.
Level2 assets and liabilities include debt securities with
quoted prices that are traded less frequently than
exchange-traded instruments and derivative contracts whose value
is determined using a pricing model with inputs that are
observable in the market or can be derived principally from or
corroborated by observable market data. This category generally
includes certain U.S. Government and agency mortgage-backed debt
securities, corporate debt securities, and non-exchange traded
derivative contracts.   Level 3   Unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market
activity and that are significant to the fair value of the
assets or liabilities. Level3 assets and liabilities
include financial instruments whose value is determined using
pricing models, discounted cash flow methodologies, or similar
techniques, as well as instruments for which the determination
of fair value requires significant management judgment or
estimation.   Assets and liabilities of the Company measured at fair value on
a recurring basis as of December31, 2008, are summarized
as follows

Goodwill
and Intangible Assets   The Company elected to perform its annual goodwill impairment
testing as required under SFAS142 on October 31 of each
fiscal year, or more often if events or circumstances indicate
that there may be impairment. Reporting units are defined as
operating segments or one level below an operating segment,
referred to as a component. The Company has determined that its
reporting units are components of its one operating segment. The
Company allocates goodwill to reporting units at the time of
acquisition and base that allocation on which reporting units
will benefit from the acquired assets and liabilities. The
estimated fair values of its reporting units were based on
discounted cash flow models derived from internal earnings and
external market forecasts and are compared to its recorded book
value. An excess of book value over fair value indicates that an
impairment of goodwill exists. The Company completed its annual
impairment test for 2008 and 2007 and concluded that no
impairment of goodwill existed.   The changes in the carrying amount of goodwill during the years

climate experienced during the end of the fiscal year ended
December31, 2008 was a significant event that indicated
that the carrying amount of certain long-lived asset groups
might not be recoverable. A review of future cash flows
identified asset groups within YDI which had carrying values in
excess of future cash flows. The Company reviewed the fair value
of the long-lived assets for these asset groups and determined
that intangible assets related to customer technologies,
relationships, and patents and trademarks had carrying values
that exceeded their estimated fair values. As a result, an
impairment charge of $6,069,000 was recorded. The fair value was
based on the income approach, whereby the Company used the
projected undiscounted cash flow method to determine whether
impairment exists, and then measured the impairment using
discounted cash flows.

Financial
Instruments and Risk Management   Foreign
Exchange Risk Management   The Company hedges a portion of its forecasted foreign currency
denominated intercompany sales of inventory, over a maximum
period of fifteen months, using forward exchange contracts
primarily related to Japanese, Korean and European currencies.
These derivatives are designated as cash-flow hedges, and
changes in their fair value are carried in accumulated other
comprehensive income until the hedged transaction affects
earnings. When the hedged transaction affects earnings, the
appropriate gain or loss from the derivative designated as a
hedge of the transaction is reclassified from accumulated other
comprehensive income to cost of sales. As of December31,
2008, the amount that will be reclassified from accumulated
other comprehensive income to cost of sales over the next twelve
months is $732,000. The ineffective portion of the derivatives
is recorded in cost of sales and was immaterial in 2008, 2007
and 2006.   The Company hedges certain intercompany and other payables with
forward foreign exchange contracts. Since these derivatives
hedge existing amounts that are denominated in foreign
currencies, the derivatives do not qualify for hedge accounting
under SFASNo133. The foreign exchange gain or loss
on these derivatives was a gain of $2,669,000 in 2008 and was
immaterial in 2007 and 2006.   Realized and unrealized gains and losses on forward exchange
contracts that do not qualify for hedge accounting are
recognized immediately in earnings. The cash flows resulting
from forward exchange contracts that qualify for hedge
accounting are classified in the consolidated statement of cash
flows as part of cash flows from operating activities. Cash
flows resulting from forward exchange contracts that do not
qualify for hedge accounting are classified in the consolidated
statement of cash flows as investing activities. The Company
does not hold or issue derivative financial instruments for
trading purposes.   There were forward exchange contracts with notional amounts
totaling $30,556,000 outstanding at December31, 2008 of
which $17,348,000 were outstanding to exchange Japanese yen for
U.S.dollars. There were forward exchange contracts with
notional amounts totaling $66,660,000 outstanding at

U.S.dollars. There were forward exchange contracts with
notional amounts totaling $20,324,000 outstanding at
December31, 2006 of which $14,619,000 were outstanding to
exchange Japanese yen for U.S.dollars.   Gains and losses on forward exchange contracts that qualify for
hedge accounting are classified in cost of goods sold and
totaled a loss of $1,176,000, and gains of $1,312,000 and
$1,932,000 for the years ended December31, 2008, 2007 and
2006 respectively.   The fair values of forward exchange contracts at
December31, 2008 and 2007, determined by applying period
end currency exchange rates to the notional contract amounts,
amounted to an unrealized gain of $732,000 and $43,000 for the
years ended December31, 2008 and 2007, respectively.   Foreign exchange transaction gains and losses, which arise from
transaction activity unrelated to the Companys
derivatives, are reflected in the statement of operations. These
foreign exchange transaction gains and losses were immaterial in
2008, 2007 and 2006.   Fair
Value of Financial Instruments   The fair value of the term loans, including the current portion,
approximates its carrying value given its variable rate interest
provisions. The fair value of marketable securities is based on
quoted market prices. For all other balance sheet financial
instruments, the carrying amount approximates fair value because
of the short period to maturity of these instruments.   Concentrations
of Credit Risk   The Companys significant concentrations of credit risk
consist principally of cash and cash equivalents, investments,
forward exchange contracts and trade accounts receivable. The
Company maintains cash and cash equivalents with financial
institutions including some banks with which it has borrowings.
The Company maintains investments primarily in
U.S.Treasury and government agency securities and
corporate debt securities, with minimum rating of A1-P1 or AAA.
The Company enters into forward currency contracts with high
credit-quality financial institutions in order to minimize
credit risk exposure. The Companys customers are primarily
concentrated in the semiconductor industry, and a limited number
of customers account for a significant portion of the
Companys revenues. The Company regularly monitors the
creditworthiness of its customers and believes it has adequately
provided for potential credit loss exposures. Credit is extended
for all customers based primarily on financial condition and
collateral is not required.

in thousands, except share and per share data   At December31, 2008, as a result of the acquisition of
Yield Dynamics in 2007, the Company has a federal net operating
loss carryforward of $7,170,000 and a federal general business
credit carryforward of $810,000. The Companys intention is
to carryforward both these tax attributes, subject to the
limitations of the Internal Revenue Code. The loss and credit
carryforwards expire at various dates through 2027.   At December31, 2006, as a result of the acquisition of Ion
Systems, Inc., the Company had a federal net operating loss
carryforward of $1,216,000 and a federal general business credit
carryforward of $71,000. The Company carried both of these tax
attributes to previous Ion tax years and recovered $497,000 of
previously paid taxes.   Although the Company believes that its tax positions are
consistent with applicable U.S.federal, state and
international laws, certain tax reserves are maintained at
December31, 2008 should these positions be challenged by
the applicable tax authority and additional tax assessed on
audit.   The Company has adopted FASB Interpretation 48, Accounting for
Uncertainty in Income Taxes FIN48, as of
January1, 2007. A reconciliation of the beginning and
ending amount of gross unrecognized tax benefits is as follows   	
2008   2007   Balance at beginning of year     16,123     11,637   Increases for prior years   49   1,264   Increases for the current year   1,680   3,240   Reductions related to settlements with taxing authorities   1,533        Reductions related to expiration of statute of limitations   1,641     18     Balance at end of year     14,678     16,123   At December31, 2008, if these benefits were recognized in
a future period, the timing of which is not estimable, the net
unrecognized tax benefit of approximately $11,784,000, excluding
penalties and interest, would impact the Companys
effective tax rate.   MKS and its subsidiaries are subject to U.S.federal income
tax as well as the income tax of multiple state and foreign
jurisdictions. The Company has concluded all U.S.federal
income tax matters for years through 2002. While the
U.S2004 federal tax year is closed, the 2003 federal tax
year remains open to the extent of the loss carryforward to
2005. As of December31, 2008 and currently, we are under a
federal audit for the 2005 and 2006 tax years, as well as other
ongoing audits in various other tax jurisdictions for various
years.   Over the next 12months it is reasonably possible that the
Company may recognize $8,000,000 to $8,500,000 of previously
unrecognized tax benefits related to various federal, state and
foreign tax positions as a result of the conclusion of various
audits and the expiration of the statute of limitations. The
following tax years, in the major tax jurisdictions noted, are
open for assessment or refund: U.S.Federal: 2003, 2005 to
2007, Germany: 2001 to 2007, Korea: 2006 to 2007, Japan: 2001 to
2007 and the United Kingdom: 2006 and 2007.   The Company accrues interest and penalties, if applicable, for
any uncertain tax positions. Any interest and penalty expense is
a component of income tax expense. At December31, 2008 and
at December31, 2007, the Company had $1,730,000 and
$1,500,000, respectively, accrued for interest on unrecognized
tax benefits.   On a quarterly basis, the Company evaluates both positive and
negative evidence that bears on the realizability of net
deferred tax assets and assesses the need for a valuation
allowance. The future benefit to be derived from its deferred
tax assets is dependent upon its ability to generate sufficient
future taxable income to realize the assets. During the year
ended December31, 2008, the Company increased its
valuation allowance by $3,303,000 for state tax credit
carryforwards and $816,000 for federal capital loss
carryforwards, as the Company has determined it is more likely
than not that the deferred tax assets related to these
attributes will not be realized. In addition, the

in thousands, except share and per share data   Company recorded a benefit to income tax expense of $3,067,000,
due to discrete reserve releases primarily related to the close
of statute of limitations.   For the year ended December31, 2007, the Company amended
prior federal tax returns to reflect revised estimates for
qualifying research and development costs that allowed the
company to claim additional research tax credits. As a result of
this claim, the Company recorded a benefit to income tax expense
of $1,800,000.   During the year ended December31, 2006, the Company
received a notification letter from the Israeli Ministry of
Industry Trade and Labor MITL indicating that its
Israeli operations were in compliance with requirements relating
to the tax holiday granted to its manufacturing operations in
Israel in 2001. This tax holiday is anticipated to expire in
2011 and is subject to meeting continued investment, employment
and other requirements under the guidelines of the MITL. This
tax holiday resulted in income tax savings of $217,000,
$3,393,000 and $5,125,000 for the years ended December31,
2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively.   Additionally, for the year ended December31, 2006, the
Company recorded the impact of both a change in German tax rules
allowing interest deductions on certain loans and adjustments
relating to transfer pricing. As a result of these items the
Company recorded additional income tax benefits of $1,565,000
for the year ended December31, 2006. The net reduction in
the valuation allowance for the year ended December31,
2006 resulted from the utilization of tax credit carryovers of
$2,706,000 and the expiration of credits of $474,000 on a merged
subsidiary.   Through December31, 2008, the Company has not provided
deferred income taxes on the undistributed earnings of its
foreign subsidiaries because such earnings were intended to be
permanently reinvested outside the U.S.Determination of
the potential deferred income tax liability on these
undistributed earnings is not practicable because such
liability, if any, is dependent on circumstances existing if and
when remittance occurs. At December31, 2008, the Company
had $237,209,000 of undistributed earnings in its foreign
subsidiaries.

Net
Income Per Share   Basic earnings per share is based on the weighted average number
of common shares outstanding, and diluted earnings per share is
based on the weighted average number of common shares
outstanding and all dilutive potential common equivalent shares
outstanding. The dilutive effect of options is determined under
the treasury stock method using the average market price for the
period. Common equivalent shares are included in the per share

Stock-Based
Compensation   As of January1, 2006, the Company adopted SFAS123R
using the modified prospective method. SFAS123R requires
companies to recognize compensation cost for all stock-based
awards based upon the grant-date fair value of those awards and
to recognize the expense over the requisite service period for
awards expected to vest. Using the modified prospective method
of adopting SFAS123R, MKS began recognizing compensation
expense for equity-based awards granted after January1,
2006 plus unvested awards granted prior to January1, 2006.
Under this method of implementation, prior periods were not
restated. The Company elected to adopt the alternative
transition method for calculating the tax effects of
equity-based compensation. The alternative transition method
included simplified methods to establish the beginning balance
of the additional paid-in capital pool APIC pool related to
the tax effects of employee stock-based compensation, and to
determine the subsequent impact on the APIC pool and
consolidated statement of cash flows of the tax effects of
employee equity-based compensation awards that were outstanding
upon the implementation of SFAS123R. Subsequent to the
initial adoption of SFAS123R, the Company calculates
potential windfall or shortfall tax benefits under the treasury
stock method by excluding the impact of pro forma deferred tax
assets.   The Company recognized the full impact of its share-based
payment plans in the consolidated statements of operations for
the years ended December31, 2008, 2007 and 2006 under
SFAS123R. As of December31, 2008, the Company
capitalized $471,000 of such cost on its consolidated balance
sheet. As of December31, 2007, the Company capitalized
$570,000 of such cost on its consolidated balance sheet. The

Assumptions   In connection with the adoption of SFAS123R, the Company
reassessed its valuation technique and related assumptions. The
Company determines the fair value of restricted stock based on
the number of shares granted and the closing market price of the
Companys common stock on the date of the award, and
estimates the fair value of stock options and employee stock
purchase rights using the Black-Scholes valuation model. Such
values are recognized as expense on a straight-line basis over
the requisite service periods, net of estimated forfeitures. The
estimation of stock-based awards that will ultimately vest
requires significant judgment. The Company considers many
factors when estimating expected forfeitures, including types of
awards and historical experience. Actual results, and future
changes in estimates, may differ substantially from the
Companys current estimates.   There were no options granted during the years ended
December31, 2008 and 2007. The weighted average grant date
fair value of options granted during the year ended
December31, 2006, as determined under SFAS123R, was
$1200 per share. The total intrinsic value of options exercised
during the years ended December31, 2008, 2007 and 2006 was
approximately $3,802,000, $16,462,000 and $14,252,000,
respectively. The fair values of options at

for 2006; the expected life represents the weighted average
period of time that options granted are expected to be
outstanding giving consideration to vesting schedules and the
Companys historical exercise patterns; and the risk-free
interest rate is based on the U.S.Treasury yield curve in
effect at the time of grant for periods corresponding with the
expected life of the option.   The fair value of stock options and restricted stock awards that
vested during the year ended December31, 2008, 2007 and
2006 was approximately $2,387,000, $4,876,000 and $8,111,000,
respectively. As of December31, 2008, the unrecognized
compensation cost related to non-vested stock options and the
unrecognized compensation cost related to restricted stock was
approximately $183,000 and $18,276,000, respectively, and will
be recognized over an estimated weighted average amortization
period of 09years and 18years, respectively.

Employee
Benefit Plans   The Company has a 401k profit-sharing plan for
U.S.employees meeting certain requirements in which
eligible employees may contribute between 1% and 50% of their
annual compensation to this plan, and, with respect to employees
who are age50 and older, certain specified additional
amounts, limited by an annual maximum amount determined by the
IRS. The Company, at its discretion, may provide a matching
contribution which will generally match up to the first 2% of
each participants compensation, plus 25% of the next 4% of
compensation. At the discretion of the board of directors, the
Company may also make additional contributions for the benefit
of all eligible employees. The Companys contributions were
$2,755,000, $2,516,000 and $2,385,000 for 2008, 2007 and 2006,
respectively.   The Company maintains a bonus plan which provides cash awards to
key employees, at the discretion of the compensation committee
of the board of directors, based upon operating results and
employee performance. The bonus expense was $0 in 2008,
$3,713,000 in 2007 and was $10,300,000 in 2006.   The Company provides supplemental retirement benefits for
certain of its officers and executive officers. The total cost
of these benefits was $2,054,000, $1,867,000 and $1,853,000 for
the years ended December31, 2008

Acquisitions   On November7, 2007, the Company acquired Yield Dynamics,
Inc. YDI, a provider of yield management
technology located in Sunnyvale, California. YDIs data and
yield management software, along with MKS portfolio of
sensors that control critical processes, data collection and
integration hardware, and real-time fault detection and
classification software, provides a comprehensive offering for
generating, collecting and analyzing process sensor data and
correlating the data to wafers, chambers and tools across the
semiconductor fab as well as other thin film manufacturing
processes. The purchase price consisted of $23,659,000 in cash,
net of $651,000 in cash acquired and $363,000 in acquisition
related costs. The purchase agreement includes contingent
payments of up to $10,000,000 based upon achieving specific
annual and cumulative revenue targets between 2008 and 2010.   The following table summarizes the estimated fair value of the

exceeded the estimated fair values of tangible and intangible
assets, which was allocated to goodwill. The Company believes
that the amount of goodwill relative to identifiable intangible
assets relates to several factors including: 1being a
provider of yield management software technology which will be
increasingly important to solution providers for semiconductor
and other industrial customers and 2enhanced ability to
combine YDIs software products with MKS multivariate
software and traditional hardware products.   On January3, 2006, the Company completed its acquisition
of Ion Systems, Inc. Ion, a leading provider of
electrostatic management solutions located in Alameda,
California, pursuant to an Agreement and Plan of Merger dated
November25, 2005. Ions ionization technology
monitors electrostatic charge to reduce process contamination
and improve yields, which complements the Companys process
monitoring and control technologies. The aggregate purchase
price consisted of $68,073,000 in cash, net of $5,056,000 in
cash acquired, and $807,000 in acquisition related costs.

Commitments
and Contingencies   The Company filed suit against Celerity, Inc. in federal
district court in Texas on September8, 2008 for
infringement of two of MKS patents relating to the
Companys PiMFC technology. The complaint was amended on
September9, 2008 to include a claim of infringement for
one additional related MKS patent, which had issued earlier that
day. MKS dismissed the suit without prejudice on
February6, 2009.   The Company is also subject to various other legal proceedings
and claims, which have arisen in the ordinary course of
business. In the opinion of management, the ultimate disposition
of these matters will not have a material adverse effect on the
results of operations, financial condition or cash flows.   The Company leases certain of its facilities and machinery and
equipment under capital and operating leases expiring in various
years through 2013 and thereafter. Generally, the facility
leases require the Company to pay maintenance, insurance and
real estate taxes. Rental expense under operating leases totaled
$9,952,000, $8,257,000 and $7,443,000, for the years ended
December31, 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively.   Minimum lease payments under operating and capital leases are as
follows

purchase commitments for certain inventory components and other
equipment and services used in its normal operations. The
majority of these purchase commitments covered by these
arrangements are for periods of less than one year and aggregate
to approximately $81,000,000. Additionally, the Company has
engaged a third party to provide certain computer equipment, IT
network services and IT support. This contract is for a period
of approximately six years beginning in September 2004 and has a
significant penalty for early termination. The obligation at
December31, 2008 of approximately $14,857,000, excluding
capital lease and interest payments of $1,329,000, will be paid
over the term of the arrangement. Average annual payments are
expected to be approximately $7,429,000.   To the extent permitted by Massachusetts law, the Companys
Restated Articles of Organization, as amended, require the
Company to indemnify any of its current or former officers or
directors or any person who has served or is serving in any
capacity with respect to any of the Companys employee
benefit plans. Because no claim for indemnification has been
pursued by any person covered by the relevant provisions of the
Companys Restated Articles of Organization, the Company
believes that the estimated exposure for these indemnification
obligations is currently minimal. Accordingly, the Company has
no liabilities recorded for these requirements as of
December31,2008.

in thousands, except share and per share data   The Company also enters into agreements in the ordinary course
of business which include indemnification provisions. Pursuant
to these agreements, the Company indemnifies, holds harmless and
agrees to reimburse the indemnified party, generally its
customers, for losses suffered or incurred by the indemnified
party in connection with certain patent or other intellectual
property infringement claims, and, in some instances, other
claims, by any third party with respect to the Companys
products. The term of these indemnification obligations is
generally perpetual after execution of the agreement. The
maximum potential amount of future payments the Company could be
required to make under these indemnification agreements is, in
some instances, not contractually limited. The Company has never
incurred costs to defend lawsuits or settle claims related to
these indemnification obligations. As a result, the Company
believes the estimated fair value of these obligations is
minimal. Accordingly, the Company has no liabilities recorded
for these obligations as of December31, 2008.   When, as part of an acquisition, the Company acquires all of the
stock or all of the assets and liabilities of another company,
the Company assumes liability for certain events or occurrences
that took place prior to the date of acquisition. The maximum
potential amount of future payments the Company could be
required to make for such obligations is undeterminable at this
time. Other than obligations recorded as liabilities at the time
of the acquisitions, historically the Company has not made
significant payments for these indemnifications. Accordingly, no
liabilities have been recorded for these obligations.   In conjunction with certain asset sales, the Company may provide
routine indemnifications whose terms range in duration and often
are not explicitly defined. Where appropriate, an obligation for
such indemnifications is recorded as a liability. Because the
amounts of liability under these types of indemnifications are
not explicitly stated, the overall maximum amount of the
obligation under such indemnifications cannot be reasonably
estimated. Other than obligations recorded as liabilities at the
time of the asset sale, historically the Company has not made
significant payments for these indemnifications.

Related
Party Transactions   The Vice President and General Manager of the Companys
Vacuum Products Group is the general partner of two real estate
entities the Aspen Entities. The Company leased
from the Aspen Entities certain facilities occupied by the
Companys Vacuum Products Group in Boulder, Colorado until
the Aspen Entities sold those facilities to a third party on
March30, 2007. The Company paid the Aspen Entities $0,

termination with respect to approximately 10% of its workforce.
This decision was based on the overall economic slowdown,
particularly in the semiconductor capital equipment industry. As
a result, the Company expects to incur approximately $2,500,000
in cash expenditures for severance and related costs, which the
Company expects to record in the quarter ending March31,
2009.

Controls
and Procedures   Evaluation
of Disclosure Controls and Procedures   Our management, with the participation of our Chief Executive
Officer and Chief Financial Officer, evaluated the effectiveness
of our disclosure controls and procedures as of
December31, 2008. The term disclosure controls and
procedures, as defined in
Rules13a-15e
and
15d-15e
under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended the
Exchange Act, means controls and other procedures
of a company that are designed to ensure that information
required to be disclosed by a company in the reports that it
files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed,
summarized and reported, within the time periods specified in
the SECs rules and forms. Disclosure controls and
procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures
designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by
a company in the reports that it files or submits under the
Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to the
companys management, including its principal executive and
principal financial officers, as appropriate to allow timely
decisions regarding required disclosure. Management recognizes
that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed
and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving
their objectives and management necessarily applies its judgment
in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible controls
and procedures. Based on the evaluation of our disclosure
controls and procedures as of December31, 2008, our Chief
Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that, as
of such date, our disclosure controls and procedures were
effective at the reasonable assurance level to ensure that
information required to be disclosed by us in reports that we
file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed,
summarized and reported within the time periods specified in
Securities and Exchange Commission rules and forms and is
accumulated and communicated to our management, including our
Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer as
appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required
disclosure.   Managements
Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting   Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining
adequate internal control over financial reporting. Internal
control over financial reporting is defined in
Rules13a-15f
and
15d-15f
promulgated under the Securities Exchange Act as a process
designed by, or under the supervision of, the Companys
Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer and effected
by the Companys Board of Directors, management and other
personnel, to provide reasonable assurance regarding the
reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of
financial statements for external purposes in accordance with
generally accepted accounting principles and includes those
policies and procedures that   
Pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail
accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions
of the assets of the Company   
Provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as
necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in
accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and
that receipts and expenditures of the Company are being made
only in accordance with authorizations of management and
directors of the Company;and   
Provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely
detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of the
Companys assets that could have a material effect on the
financial statements.   Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over
financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.
Projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods
are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate
because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of
compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.   Our management assessed the effectiveness of our internal
control over financial reporting as of December31, 2008.
In making this assessment, our management used the criteria set
forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the
Treadway Commission COSO in Internal Control
Integrated Framework.   
71 Table of Contents   Based on our assessment, management concluded that, as of
December31, 2008, our internal control over financial
reporting was effective based on those criteria.   Our internal controls over financial reporting as of
December31, 2008 have been audited by
PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, an independent registered public
accounting firm, as stated in their attestation report which
appears on page37.   Changes
in Internal Control over Financial Reporting   There was no change in our internal control over financial
reporting as defined in
Rules13a-15f
and
15d-15f
under the Exchange Act during our fourth fiscal quarter that
has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially
affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
