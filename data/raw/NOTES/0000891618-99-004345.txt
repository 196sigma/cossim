statements of operations, of cash flows and of stockholders' equity deficit
present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of
Pharmacyclics, Inc. a development stage company at June 30, 1999 and 1998, and
the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in
the period ended June 30, 1999, and for the period from inception April 1991
through June 30, 1999 in conformity with generally accepted accounting
principles. These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company
management; our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial
statements based on our audits. We conducted our audits of these statements in
accordance with generally accepted auditing standards which require that we plan
and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial

PHARMACYCLICS, INC.
A DEVELOPMENT STAGE COMPANY
NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
NOTE 1 -- THE COMPANY AND SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES     Description of the Company
Pharmacyclics, Inc. was incorporated in Delaware in 1991 and commenced
operations during 1992 to develop and market pharmaceutical products to improve
upon current therapeutic approaches to the treatment of cancer, atherosclerosis
and retinal disease. Since inception, the company has been in the development
stage, principally involved in research and development and other business
planning activities, with no commercial revenues from product sales. Successful
future operations depend upon the company ability to develop, to obtain
regulatory approval for and to commercialize its products. The company expects
that additional funds will be required to complete the development of its
products and to fund operating losses that are expected to be incurred in the
next several years. The company operates in one business segment.
Management use of estimates and assumptions
The preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally
accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and
assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the
date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and
expenses during the reported period. Actual results could differ from those
estimates.
Basic and diluted net loss per share
Basic earnings per share is computed using the weighted average number
of common shares outstanding during the period. Diluted earnings per share is
computed using the weighted average number of common and potential common shares
outstanding during the period. Potential common shares consist of the
incremental common shares issuable upon conversion of outstanding convertible
preferred stock using the if-converted method and shares issuable upon the
exercise of stock options and warrants using the treasury stock method.
Potential common shares have been excluded from the computation of dilutive
earnings per share because their effect is anti-dilutive.
Cash equivalents and investments
All highly liquid investments purchased with maturity at the date of
purchase of three months or less are considered to be cash equivalents. The
company has classified its investments as available-for-sale. For all periods
presented, the cost of investments approximates their fair market value. Gains
and losses on securities sold are recorded based on the specific identification
method and are included in the results of operations.                    42

Long-term investments.. $ 5,067    $33,736
At June 30, 1999 the company long-term investments were scheduled to
mature at various dates through February 2001.
Concentration of credit risk
Financial instruments that potentially subject the company to credit
risk consist principally of cash, cash equivalents and investments. The company
places its cash, cash equivalents and investments with high-credit quality
financial institutions and invests in debt instruments of financial
institutions, corporations and government entities with strong credit ratings.
Management of the company believes they have established guidelines relative to
diversification and maturities that maintain safety and liquidity.
Property and equipment
Property and equipment are stated at cost. Depreciation is computed
using the straight-line method over the shorter of the estimated useful lives of
the assets, generally four to eight years, or the lease term of the respective
assets, if applicable. Amortization of leasehold improvements is computed using
the straight-line method over the shorter of their estimated useful lives or
lease terms.
Long-lived assets
The company identifies and records impairment losses on long-lived
assets when events and circumstances indicate that the assets might be impaired.
No significant impairment losses have been recorded to date with respect to the
company long-lived assets, which consist primarily of property and equipment
and leasehold improvements.
Revenue recognition
License fees are recognized as revenue when earned, as evidenced by
achievement of the specified milestones and the absence of any on-going
performance obligation. Contract and grant revenues are recognized as earned,
primarily based on costs incurred to total estimated costs at completion,
pursuant to the terms of each agreement. License, contract and grant revenues
are not subject to repayment. Any amounts received in advance of performance are
recorded as deferred revenue.
Research and development
Research and development costs are expensed as incurred and include
costs associated with contract research performed pursuant to collaborative
agreements. Research and development costs consist of direct and indirect
internal costs related to specific projects as well as fees paid to other
entities which conduct                    43
45
certain research activities on behalf of the company. Research and development
expenses incurred in connection with research contracts were $32 million and
$22 million for the years ended June 30, 1999 and 1998, respectively.
Income taxes
The company provides for income taxes using the liability method. This
method requires that deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the
expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the tax bases
of assets and liabilities and their financial statement reported amounts.
Fair value of financial instruments
The carrying value of the company financial instruments including cash
and cash equivalents, short- and long-term investments, accounts receivable and
accrued liabilities approximate fair value due to their short maturities. The
carrying value of the company capital lease obligations approximate fair value
based on borrowing rates currently available to the company.
Stock-based compensation
The company accounts for employee stock-based compensation using the
intrinsic value method prescribed in Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 25,
Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees, and related interpretations. The
Company provides additional pro forma disclosures as required under Statement of
Financial Accounting Standards No. 123 SFAS 123, Accounting for Stock-Based
Compensation.

sales. The company is required to supply Alcon with bulk drug substance through
its manufacturing collaboration with Celanese; Alcon will be responsible for
formulation and packaging of finished products.
E-Z-EM License. In August 1995, the company entered into an agreement
with E-Z-EM, Inc., a leading manufacturer and worldwide distributor of oral
contrast agents and other products for use in gastrointestinal radiology, for
the exclusive marketing and sale of the company CITRA VU product in the United
States. In fiscal 1997, the company entered into a similar agreement with

in profits from the sale if any of CITRA VU, and the company may also receive
premium payments if certain sales levels are achieved. During the year ended

46
company recorded revenue of $25,000 net of royalties aid to The University of
Texas upon signing these agreements. There were no revenues associated with
these agreements for the years ended June 30, 1999 and 1998.
Nycomed Collaboration. In October 1997, the company entered into an
agreement with Nycomed Imaging A/S, in which Nycomed acquired exclusive sales
and marketing rights to LUTRINTM photosensitizer for cancer treatments in all
markets of the world excluding the United States, Canada and Japan. LUTRIN is a
lutetium texaphyrin molecule being developed as a photosensitizer for use in the
photodynamic therapy of cancer. In exchange for these rights, Nycomed has agreed
to pay the company up to approximately $140 million as a combination of license
fees, a portion of the company development costs, based upon an agreed budget,
and milestone payments related to the initial cancer treatments for LUTRIN to be
developed by the company and Nycomed, in each case subject to attainment of
certain development, clinical or commercialization milestones. Approximately
$140 million in additional milestone payments and development costs assuming

restructuring. As a result of the change in its business focus Celanese
requested that Pharmacyclics pursue alternative supply sources. Celanese and the
company are presently negotiating the definitive terms and conditions of an
agreement pursuant to which Celanese will transfer the manufacturing process it
developed with the company to other manufacturers. The company has entered into
agreements with three new manufacturers to evaluate their ability to supply the
company with components of bulk drug substance. These new manufacturers are

quantities, of such products for delivery to the company during fiscal year
2000.

47 NOTE 4 -- STOCKHOLDERS' EQUITY     Common stock
In November 1996, the company sold 580,000 shares of unregistered common
stock to a single purchaser in a private placement. The shares were sold at a
price of $1400 per share, which resulted in proceeds of $81 million. In
February 1997, the company sold 862,190 shares of unregistered common stock to
four purchasers in a private placement. The shares were sold at $1905 per
share, which resulted in net proceeds of $163 million. The company filed a
registration statement on Form S-3 related to these shares, which was declared
effective on April 22, 1997. In February 1998, the company sold 2,012,500 shares
of its common stock at a price of $2175 per share, which resulted in net
proceeds of approximately $408 million.
Preferred stock
In September 1995, the company amended its Certificate of Incorporation
effective upon the conversion of the Convertible Preferred Stock to authorize
1,000,000 shares of Preferred Stock, par value $00001 per share. The Board of
Directors is authorized to issue the preferred stock in one or more series and
to fix the rights, preferences, privileges and restrictions thereof, including
dividend rights, dividend rates, conversion rights, voting rights, terms of
redemption, redemption prices, liquidation preferences and the number of shares
constituting any series or the designation of such series, without further vote
or action by the stockholders.
The ability of the company Board of Directors to issue shares of
preferred stock without stockholder approval, and the adoption of a stockholder
rights plan, may alone or in combination have certain anti-takeover effects. The
company is also subject to provisions of the Delaware General Corporation Law
which may make certain business combinations more difficult.
Shareholder rights plan
In April 1997, the Board of Directors approved a shareholder rights plan
under which stockholders of record on May 1, 1997 received a right to purchase
a Right one one-hundredth of a share of Series A Junior Participating
Preferred Stock, par value $001 per share the Series A Preferred Stock, at
an exercise price of $125 per one one-hundredth of a share, subject to
adjustment. The Rights will separate from the common stock and Rights
certificates will be issued and will become exercisable upon the earlier of i
10 business days following a public announcement that a person or group of
affiliated or associated persons has acquired, or obtained the right to acquire,
beneficial ownership of 15% or more of the company outstanding common stock or
ii 10 business days or such later date as may be determined by a majority of
the Board of Directors following the commencement of, or announcement of, an
intention to make a tender offer or exchange offer, the consummation of which
would result in the beneficial ownership by a person or group of 15% or more of
the outstanding common stock of the Company. The Rights expire at the close of
business on April 30, 2007. The company has designated 120,000 shares of its
Preferred Stock as Series A Junior Participating Preferred Stock in connection
with this plan.
Warrants
In connection with entering into certain capital leases, the company
issued to lessors warrants to purchase 73,042 shares of convertible preferred
stock at a weighted average exercise price of $449 per share. In July 1995, in
connection with certain short-term note agreements entered into prior to the
company initial public offering, the company issued to the holders of such
notes warrants to purchase 57,976 shares of common stock at an exercise price of
$863 per share. Also in July 1995, the company issued warrants to purchase
66,522 shares of convertible preferred stock at an exercise price of $863 per
share to certain holders of such stock, in exchange for an agreement by the
holders to modify certain rights received in connection with the Series C
preferred stock financing which occurred in June 1994. Management ascribed a
nominal value to these warrants.                    46
48
In connection with the company initial public offering, the above
warrants were converted into warrants to purchase shares of common stock. In
fiscal 1998, holders of all of the warrants granted in July 1995 elected net
issue exercises at an average market price of $2415 per share, resulting in
the issuance of 80,033 shares of common stock and the cancellation of warrants
to purchase 44,465 shares of common stock. In fiscal 1999, warrants for 45,661
shares were exercised. The remaining 14,706 warrants are exercisable at $488
per share and expire in 2000. At June 30, 1999, the company has reserved 14,706
shares of common stock for future issuance upon the exercise of the remaining
outstanding warrants.
Stock option plans
1992 Stock Option Plan. The 1992 Stock Option Plan the 1992 Plan, as
amended, authorizes the Board of Directors to grant incentive stock options and
non-statutory stock options to employees, directors and consultants to purchase
up to 1,233,334 shares of common stock. Under the 1992 Plan, incentive stock
options are granted at a price not less than 100% of the estimated fair value of
the stock on the date of grant, as determined by the Board of Directors.
Nonqualified stock options are granted at a price not less than 85% of the
estimated fair value of the stock on the date of grant, as determined by the
Board of Directors. To date, all options granted under the 1992 Plan have been
granted at 100% of the estimated fair value of the common stock as determined by
the Board of Directors.
Generally, options granted under the 1992 Plan are exercisable on and
after the date of grant, subject to the company right to repurchase from the
optionee, at the optionee original cost per share, any unvested shares which
the optionee has purchased and holds in the event the optionee attempts to
dispose of such shares or in the event of the optionee termination of
employment with or without cause. The company right to repurchase lapses as
the shares become vested. Generally, shares subject to options granted under the
1992 Plan vest at the rate of 1/4th of the shares on the first anniversary of
the grant date of the option, and an additional 1/48th of the shares upon
completion of each succeeding month of continuous employment thereafter. Options
are exercisable for a period of ten years.
1995 Stock Option Plan. The company 1995 Stock Option Plan the 1995
Plan was adopted by the Board of Directors on August 2, 1995, as the successor
to the 1992 Plan. The 1995 Plan authorizes for issuance 2,052,579 shares of
common stock. Beginning on January 1, 1996, the 1995 Plan also allows for an
annual increase to the number of shares available for issuance equal to 1% of
the number of shares of common stock outstanding on the last day of the
preceding calendar year, not to exceed 500,000 shares per year. Shares of common
stock subject to outstanding options, including options granted under the 1992
Plan, that expire or terminate prior to exercise will be available for future
issuance under the 1995 Plan.
Under the 1995 Plan, employees including officers, non-employee
members of the Board of Directors other than those serving as members of the
Compensation Committee and independent consultants may, at the discretion of
the plan administrator, be granted options to purchase shares of common stock at
an exercise price not less than 85% of the fair market value of such shares on
the grant date. Non-employee members of the Board of Directors will also be
eligible for automatic option grants under the company 1995 Non-Employee
Directors Stock Option Plan. Generally, shares subject to options under the 1995
Plan vest over a five-year period and are exercisable for a period of ten years.
In the event the company is acquired by merger, consolidation or asset
sale, options outstanding under the 1995 Plan will immediately vest in full,
except to the extent the options are assumed by the acquiring entity. Any
assumed options will accelerate upon the optionee involuntary termination
within 18 months following the acquisition. The Compensation Committee also has
discretion to provide for the acceleration of one or more outstanding options
under the 1995 Plan including options incorporated from the 1992 Plan and the
vesting of shares subject to outstanding options upon the occurrence of certain
hostile tender offers. Such accelerated vesting may be conditioned upon the
subsequent termination of the affected optionee service.
The Board may amend or modify the 1995 Plan at any time. The 1995 Plan
will terminate on August 1, 2005, unless terminated earlier by the Board.                    47
49
1995 Non-Employee Directors Stock Option Plan. The Company 1995
Non-Employee Directors Stock Option Plan the Directors Plan, was adopted by
the Board of Directors on August 2, 1995. Automatic option grants are made at
periodic intervals to eligible non-employee Board members under the Directors
Plan. The Directors Plan became effective as of the effective date of the
Company initial public offering. A total of 166,667 shares of common stock
have been reserved for issuance under the Directors Plan.
Each individual serving as a non-employee Board member on the effective
date of the company initial public offering was automatically granted a
non-statutory option to purchase 5,000 shares of common stock, vesting in equal
monthly installments for one year after the grant date. Each individual first
elected or appointed as a non-employee Board member after the effective date of
the company initial public offering will automatically be granted, on the date
of such election or appointment, a non-statutory option to purchase 10,000
shares of common stock vesting over five years. In addition, on the date of each
annual stockholders meeting, beginning with the 1996 Annual Meeting, each
individual who is to continue to serve as a non-employee Board member after that
annual meeting and has been a member of the Board for at least six months will
automatically be granted a non-statutory option to purchase 5,000 shares of
common stock, vesting in equal monthly installments for one year after the grant
date. There will be no limit on the number of such annual 5,000-share option
grants any one non-employee Board member may receive over his or her period of
continued Board service. The exercise price per share of each automatic option
grant will be equal to the fair market value of the common stock on the
automatic grant date. Each automatic option will be immediately exercisable;
however, any shares purchased upon exercise of the option will be subject to
repurchase should the optionee service as a non-employee Board member cease
prior to vesting in the shares. Each 10,000-share grant will vest in five equal
and successive annual installments over the optionee period of Board service.
Each 5,000-share grant will vest in twelve equal and successive monthly
installment over the optionee period of Board service.
In the event of the optionee death or permanent disability or in the
event the company is acquired by a merger or asset sale and in the event of
certain hostile tender offers, each outstanding option will become fully vested.
Upon the acquisition of 50% or more of the Company outstanding voting stock
pursuant to a hostile tender offer, each automatic option grant outstanding for
at least six months may be surrendered automatically or be cancelled in exchange
for cash distribution to the director based upon the tender offer price. The
Directors Plan will terminate on August 1, 2005.

the fair market value of the stock on specified dates. The company has reserved
100,000 shares of common stock under the Purchase Plan. Sales under the Purchase
Plan in fiscal 1999, 1998 and 1997 were 13,643, 10,372 and 14,557 shares of
common stock at an average price of $1277, $1436 and $1051 per share,
respectively. Shares available for future purchase under the Purchase Plan are

fair value, as defined by SFAS 123, for awards granted under its stock option
plans and stock purchase plan, the company net loss and net loss per share

NOTE 5 -- COMPREHENSIVE INCOME LOSS     Effective July 1, 1998, the company adopted Statement of Financial
Accounting Standards No. 130, SFAS 130, Reporting Comprehensive Income.
SFAS 130 establishes standards for reporting comprehensive income loss and its
components in a year end financial statement that is displayed with the same
prominence as other financial statements. Similar information should be provided
in the notes to financial statements. Comprehensive income loss as defined
includes all changes in equity net assets during a period from non-owner
sources. Examples of items to be included in comprehensive income loss, which
are excluded from the results of operations, include foreign currency
translation adjustments and unrealized gains losses on available-for-sale
securities.
The company did not record comprehensive income during fiscal 1998 and
1997 as such amounts were not material. During fiscal 1999, comprehensive income
loss consisted of net unrealized losses on available-for-sale securities of
$85,000, resulting in comprehensive net loss of $19,331,000.

approximately $580 million for federal income tax reporting purposes and tax
credit carryforwards of approximately $29 million for federal reporting
purposes. These amounts expire at various times through 2019.
Under the Tax Reform Act of 1986, the amounts of and the benefit from
net operating losses and tax credit carryforwards that can be carried forward
may be impaired or limited in certain circumstances. These circumstances
include, but are not limited to, a cumulative stock ownership change of greater
than 50%, as defined, over a three year period. As a result of ownership changes
that have occurred during the past four fiscal years, management believes that
utilization of the company net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards is
subject to certain annual limitations.

Rent expense for the years ended June 30, 1999, 1998, and 1997 was
$457,000, $366,000 and $371,000, respectively, and $2,269,000 for the period
from inception through June 30, 1999. The terms of the facility leases provide
for rental payments on a graduated scale. The company recognizes rent expense on
a straight-line basis over the lease period and has accrued for rent expense
incurred but not paid at June 30, 1999.
At June 30, 1999, the company had approximately $74 million in
cancelable purchase commitments with three suppliers of drug components and
final bulk drug substance and one supplier of lasers.
NOTE 8 -- SUBSEQUENT EVENT unaudited     On August 27, 1999, the company entered into an agreement to terminate
its manufacturing and supply agreement with Celanese see Note 2. Pursuant to
that agreement, Celanese assigned to the company all right, title and interest
in and to the manufacturing technology and intellectual property for bulk drug
substance and agreed to make a cash payment of $750,000 to the company. The
termination agreement also relieved the company of all obligations to pay
Celanese for shared development costs incurred prior to termination of the
agreement. As of June 30, 1999, the company had accrued approximately $28
million associated with such costs. Substantially all of the amounts discussed
above will be reflected as a reduction in research and development expense
during the quarter ending September 30, 1999.
