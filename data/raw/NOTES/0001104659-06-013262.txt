Item 5: Controls and Procedures
Evaluation
of Disclosure Controls and Procedures
As required by Rule13a-15bof
the Securities Exchange Act, our management, including the Chief Executive
Officer and Chief Financial Officer, conducted an evaluation as of December31,
2005, of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as
defined in Exchange Act Rule13a-15e. Based on that evaluation,
our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, concluded that, as of December31, 2005,
our controls and procedures were effective to ensure that information required
to be disclosed in reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act are
recorded, processed, summarized and reported in accordance with the rulesand
forms of the SEC and that such information is accumulated and communicated to
management as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required
disclosure.
Changes
in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting
We have previously reported on-going remediation
efforts related to the material weakness identified as of December31,
2004 related to our lack of a sufficient complement of personnel with a level
of technical accounting expertise commensurate with our financial reporting
requirements. During fiscal 2005, we designed and placed in operation new
controls to remediate the material weakness. Specifically, in the first quarter
of 2005, we hired a Chief Financial Officer with extensive industry experience.
Additionally, in the second quarter of 2005, we implemented new controls over
the period-end financial reporting process, including controls to review and
evaluate the accounting impact of certain transactions related to stock-based
compensation and redeemable convertible preferred stock. In the third quarter
of 2005, we hired additional personnel to strengthen the controls put in place
during the second quarter of 2005. These personnel included, several accounting
analysts, an Assistant Controller and Senior Director of Tax and Treasury. As
of December31, 2005, we have determined that the new controls are
effectively designed and have demonstrated effective operation for a sufficient
period of time to enable management to conclude the material weakness
identified in 2004 has been remediated.
As required by Rule13a-15dof
the Exchange Act, our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and
Chief Financial Officer, conducted an evaluation of our internal control over
financial reporting as defined in Exchange Act Rule13a-15fto
determine whether any changes in our internal control over financial reporting
occurred during the fourth quarter of 2005 that materially affected, or are
reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial
reporting. Based on that evaluation, other than as described above, there have
been no such changes during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2005.
Limitation
on Effectiveness of Controls
Our management, including
our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, do not expect that our
disclosure controls and procedures or our internal control over financial
reporting will prevent or detect all errors and all occurrences of fraud. A
control system, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only
reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control systems
are met. Further, the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there
are resource constraints, and the benefits of all controls must be considered relative to their costs. Control systems can be
circumvented by the individual acts of some persons, by collusion of two or
more people, or by management override of the control. In addition, over time,
controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or the degree
of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. Because of the
inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can
provide absolute assurance that the control systems will detect all control
issues, including instances of fraud, if any. 46 Managements
Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting
Our management is responsible for establishing and
maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as defined in Rules13a-15fand
15d-15funder the Exchange Act, for FormFactor. Our management
with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial
Officer conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control
over financial reporting as of December31, 2005. This evaluation was
based on the framework established in Internal
ControlIntegrated Framework, issued by the Committee of Sponsoring
Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Based on this evaluation, our
management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was
effective as of December31, 2005.
Managements assessment of
the effectiveness of the Companys internal control over financial reporting as
of December31, 2005 has been audited by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, the
Companys independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in their
report which appears in this Annual Report on Form10-K.
