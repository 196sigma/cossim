REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM
To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of Pegasystems Inc. Cambridge, Massachusetts We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance
sheets of Pegasystems Inc. and subsidiaries the Company as of December31, 2014 and 2013, and the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive income loss, stockholders equity, and cash flows for each of
the three years in the period ended December31, 2014. We also have audited the Companys internal control over financial reporting as of December31, 2014, based on criteria established in Internal ControlIntegrated
Framework 2013issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. The Companys management is responsible for these financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control over financial
reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Managements Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on
these financial statements and an opinion on the Companys internal control over financial reporting based on our audits. 
We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board United States. Those
standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all
material respects. Our audits of the financial statements included examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by
management, and evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material
weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe
that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions. A companys internal control over financial reporting is a
process designed by, or under the supervision of, the companys principal executive and principal financial officers, or persons performing similar functions, and effected by the companys board of directors, management, and other
personnel to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A companys internal
control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that 1pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company;
2provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being
made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and 3provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the companys assets
that could have a material effect on the financial statements. Because of the inherent limitations of internal control over
financial reporting, including the possibility of collusion or improper management override of controls, material misstatements due to error or fraud may not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. Also, projections of any evaluation of the
effectiveness of the internal control over financial reporting to future periods are subject to the risk that the controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may
deteriorate. In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material
respects, the financial position of Pegasystems Inc. and subsidiaries as of December31, 2014 and 2013, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December31, 2014, in
conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Also, in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December31, 2014, based
on the criteria established in Internal ControlIntegrated Framework 2013issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. /s/ DELOITTE TOUCHE LLP Boston, Massachusetts

BASIS OF PRESENTATION 
a Business The Company develops, markets, licenses, and supports software to automate complex, changing business processes. The Company provides implementation, consulting, training, technical support and hosting
services to facilitate the use of its software. b Management estimates and reporting 
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America
U.S. requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of
revenues and expenses during the periods presented. Actual results could differ from those estimates. Accounts with reported amounts based on significant estimates and judgments include revenue, deferred income taxes, income taxes payable, fair
value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed, intangible assets, goodwill, deferred revenue, and stock-based compensation. 
c Principles of consolidation The consolidated financial statements include Pegasystems Inc. and its wholly owned subsidiaries. All intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. 
d Stock split On March6, 2014, the Companys Board of Directors approved a two-for-one stock split of the Companys common stock, effected in the form of a stock dividend the Stock Split.
On April1, 2014, each stockholder of record at the close of business on March20, 2014 the Record Date received as a dividend, one additional share of common stock, par value $01, for each share of common stock held on the
Record Date. All shares and amounts of common stock, additional paid-in capital, and per share amounts in the Companys audited consolidated financial statements and in the accompanying notes for all periods presented have been restated to
reflect the Stock Split, except for the number of authorized shares of common stock. e Retrospective application of
purchase price adjustments During 2014, the Company made adjustments to the purchase price allocation in connection
with its acquisition of Antenna Software, Inc. together with its subsidiaries, Antenna. These purchase price adjustments are reflected retrospectively as of December31, 2013 in the Companys audited consolidated balance
sheet. These revisions did not have any impact on the Companys previously reported results of operations or cash flows. See Note 8 Acquisitions for further discussion of these adjustments. 2.
SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES 
a Revenue recognition The Companys revenue is derived primarily from software licenses, maintenance fees related to the Companys software licenses, and consulting services. The Companys license arrangements,
whether involving a perpetual license or a term license, generally contain multiple elements, including consulting services, training, and software maintenance services. 
46 Table of Contents PEGASYSTEMS INC. 
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTSContinued 
Software revenue recognition requires judgment, including whether a software arrangement
includes multiple elements, and if so, whether vendor-specific objective evidence VSOE of fair value exists for those elements. The amount of arrangement consideration allocated to undelivered elements is based on the VSOE of fair
value for those elements and recognized as those elements are delivered. Any remaining portion of the total arrangement fee is allocated to the software license, the first delivered element. Revenue is recognized for each element when all of the
revenue recognition criteria have been met. Changes in the mix of the elements in a software arrangement, the ability to
identify VSOE for those elements, the fair value of the respective elements, and changes to a products estimated life cycle could materially impact the amount of earned and unearned revenue. 
Before the Company can recognize revenue, the following four basic criteria must be met:  Persuasive evidence of an arrangementAs evidence of the existence of an arrangement, the Company uses a contract or purchase order signed
by the client and the Company for software and maintenance, and a statement of work for consulting services. In the event the client is a reseller, the Company ensures a binding agreement exists between the reseller and end user of the software.
Delivery of product and servicesThe Company delivers its software electronically or ships it via disk media. Services are considered
delivered as the work is performed or, in the case of maintenance, over the contractual service period.  Fee is fixed or determinableThe Company assesses whether a fee is fixed or determinable at the onset of the arrangement. In addition, the
Company assesses whether contract modifications to an existing arrangement constitute a concession. The Companys agreements do not include a right of return.  Collection of fee is probable The Company assesses the probability of collecting from each client at the onset of the arrangement based on
a number of factors, including the clients payment history, its current creditworthiness, economic conditions in the clients industry and geographic location, and general economic conditions. If, in the Companys judgment,
collection of a fee is not probable, revenue is recognized as cash is collected, provided all other conditions for revenue recognition have been met. Software license revenues Perpetual software license fees are recognized
as revenue when the software is delivered, any acceptance required by contract that is not perfunctory is obtained, no significant obligations or contingencies exist related to the software, other than maintenance, and all other revenue recognition
criteria are met. Term software license fees are payable on a monthly, quarterly, or annual basis under license agreements
that typically have a three to five-year term and may be renewed for additional terms at the clients option. As a
result of the Companys focus on frequent sales to its targeted clients, the Companys strategy is to sell initial term licensing agreements to those clients with the goal to generate follow-on sales, and as a result of extended payment
terms and other factors, such as the risk of concessions, the Company recognizes term license revenue over the term of the agreement as payments become due or earlier if prepaid, provided all other criteria for revenue recognition have been met.
Subscription revenue primarily consists of license, maintenance, and bundled services revenue recognized on the
Companys license arrangements that include a right to unspecified future products, which is recognized ratably over the term of the subscription period. 
47 Table of Contents PEGASYSTEMS INC. 
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTSContinued 
Maintenance revenues First-year maintenance typically is sold with the related software license and renewed on an annual basis thereafter. Maintenance revenue is deferred and recognized ratably over the term of the support
period, which is generally one year and subject to annual renewals. Perpetual license maintenance obligations are based on separately stated renewal rates in the arrangement that are substantive and therefore represent VSOE of fair value. Term
license arrangements include separately stated maintenance fees and the Company uses separate sales to determine VSOE of fair value. 
Services revenues The Companys services revenue is comprised of fees for consulting services including software implementation, training, reimbursable expenses, and sales of its Pega Cloud as-a-platform offering Pega Cloud. Consulting services may be provided on a stand-alone basis or bundled with a license and software maintenance services. 
Revenue from training services and consulting services under time and materials contracts is recognized as services are performed. The
Company has VSOE of fair value for its training services and consulting services under time and materials contracts in North America, Australia, and Europe. Consulting services may occasionally be provided on a fixed-price basis. The Company does not have VSOE of fair value for fixed-price services or time and materials services in certain geographical
regions. When these services are part of a multiple element arrangement, and the services are not essential to the functionality of the software, and when services, including maintenance, are the only undelivered element, the Company recognizes the
revenue from the total arrangement ratably over the longer of the software maintenance period or the service period. Revenue from fixed-price services that are not bundled with a software license is generally recognized ratably over the service
period, which is typically less than four months. Revenue from stand-alone sales of Pega Cloud is recognized ratably over the term of the service. When implementation services are sold together with the
Companys Pega Cloud offering and these services have stand-alone value to the client, the Company
accounts for these services separately from its Pega Cloud offering as described earlier. Stand-alone value is
established through the clients ability to buy these services from many trained partner system integrators and from transactions sold independently from the sale of Pega Cloud. Since these multiple-element arrangements are not software license sales, the Company applies a selling price hierarchy. Under the selling price hierarchy,
third-party evidence of selling price TPE will be considered if VSOE does not exist, and estimated selling price ESP will be used if neither VSOE nor TPE is available. Generally, the Company is not able to determine TPE
as its sales strategy is customized to the needs of its clients and the Companys products and services are dissimilar to comparable products or services in the marketplace. In determining ESP, the Company applies significant judgment as it
weighs a variety of factors, based on the facts and circumstances of the arrangement. The Company typically arrives at an ESP for a service that is not sold separately by considering company-specific factors such as geographies, competitive
landscape, and pricing practices used to establish bundled pricing and discounting. Deferred revenue 
Deferred software license revenue typically results from client billings for which all of the criteria to recognize revenue have not been
met. Deferred maintenance revenue represents software license updates and product support contracts that are typically billed in advance and are recognized ratably over the support periods. Deferred services revenue represents advanced billings for
consulting, hosting, and training services that are recognized as the services are performed.

b Fair value of financial instruments 
The principal financial instruments held by the Company consist of cash equivalents, marketable securities, accounts receivable, and
accounts payable. The carrying value of these instruments approximates their fair value due to their short maturities. See Note 3 Marketable Securities and Note 5 Fair Value Measurements for further discussion of financial
instruments that are carried at fair value on a recurring basis. c Derivative instruments 
The Company has historically used foreign currency forward contracts to manage its exposures to changes in foreign currency exchange
rates associated with its foreign currency denominated accounts receivable, intercompany payables, and cash. The foreign currency forward contracts utilized by the Company are not designated as hedging instruments and as a result, the Company
records the fair value of these contracts at the end of each reporting period in its consolidated balance sheet as other current assets for unrealized gains and accrued expenses for unrealized losses, with any fluctuations in the value of these
contracts recognized in other expense, net, in its consolidated statement of operations. The fluctuations in the value of these foreign currency forward contracts partially offset the gains and losses from the remeasurement or settlement of the
foreign currency denominated accounts receivable, intercompany payables, and cash held by the U.S. operating company, thus partly mitigating the volatility. Generally, the Company enters into foreign currency forward contracts with terms of
90days or less. d Property and equipment 
Property and equipment are recorded at cost. Depreciation and amortization are computed using the straight-line method over the estimated
useful lives of the assets, which are three years for equipment and five years for furniture and fixtures. Leasehold improvements are amortized over the lesser of the term of the lease or the useful life of the asset. Repairs and maintenance costs
are expensed as incurred. The Company capitalizes and amortizes certain direct costs associated with computer software
developed or purchased for internal use. The Company amortizes capitalized software costs generally over three to five years commencing on the date the software is placed into service. During 2014, 2013, and 2012, the Company did not capitalize any
costs for computer software developed for internal use. e Goodwill 
Goodwill represents the residual purchase price paid in a business combination after all identified assets and liabilities have been
recorded. Goodwill is not amortized. The Company operates as a single reporting unit. The Company performed its qualitative assessment as of November30, 2014, 2013, and 2012, and concluded it was not more likely than not that the fair value of
its reporting unit was less than their carrying value. f Intangible and long-lived assets 
All of the Companys intangible assets are amortized using the straight-line method over their estimated useful life. The Company
evaluates its long-lived tangible and intangible assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of such assets may not be recoverable. Impairment is assessed by comparing the undiscounted cash
flows expected to be generated by the intangible asset to its carrying value. If impairment exists, the Company calculates the impairment by comparing the carrying value of the intangible asset to its fair value as determined by discounted expected
cash flows. The Company did not record any impairments in 2014, 2013, or 2012. 
49 Table of Contents PEGASYSTEMS INC. 
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTSContinued 
g Business combinations 
The Company uses its best estimates and assumptions to accurately assign fair value to the tangible and intangible assets acquired and
liabilities assumed at the acquisition date. The Companys estimates are inherently uncertain and subject to refinement. During the measurement period, which may be up to one year from the acquisition date, the Company may record adjustments to
the fair value of these tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed, with the corresponding offset to goodwill. In addition, uncertain tax positions and tax-related valuation allowances are initially established in connection
with a business combination as of the acquisition date. The Company continues to collect information and reevaluates these estimates and assumptions quarterly and records any adjustments to the Companys preliminary estimates to goodwill
provided that the Company is within the measurement period. Upon the conclusion of the measurement period or final determination of the fair value of assets acquired or liabilities assumed, whichever comes first, any subsequent adjustments are
recorded to the Companys consolidated statements of operations. h Research and development and software costs
Research and development costs are expensed as incurred. Capitalization of computer software developed for resale
begins upon the establishment of technological feasibility, generally demonstrated by a working model or an operative version of the computer software product. Such costs have not been material to date as technological feasibility is established
within a short timeframe from the softwares general availability and, as a result, no costs were capitalized in 2014, 2013, or 2012. 
i Stock-based compensation The Company recognizes stock-based compensation expense associated with equity awards based on the fair value of these awards at the grant date. Stock-based compensation is recognized over the requisite
service period, which is generally the vesting period of the equity award, and is adjusted each period for anticipated forfeitures. The Company recognizes stock-based compensation using the accelerated recognition method, which treats each vesting
tranche as if it were an individual grant. See Note 15 Stock-based Compensation for discussion of the Companys key assumptions included in determining the fair value of its equity awards at grant date. 
j Acquisition-related expenses Acquisition-related costs are expensed as incurred and include direct and incremental costs associated with an impending or completed acquisition. During 2014 and 2013, the $05 million and $13 million,
respectively, of acquisition-related costs were primarily professional fees associated with the Companys acquisition of Antenna Software, Inc. Antenna. k Restructuring expenses Restructuring expenses
are recorded when a plan of restructuring is in place and management has committed to execution of the plan. To the extent that a restructuring plan provides employee benefits for services rendered in future periods beyond a minimum period, the
costs are recognized over the requisite service period. In 2014 and 2013, restructuring costs include future lease payments and demising costs, net of estimated sublease income, for the elimination of space within one facility related to the
integration of Antenna. See Note 12 Accrued Restructuring for further detail.

l Foreign currency translation 
The translation of assets and liabilities for the majority of the Companys foreign subsidiaries is made at period-end exchange
rates, while revenue and expense accounts are translated at the average exchange rates during the period transactions occurred. The resulting translation adjustments are reflected in accumulated other comprehensive income. The Companys India
subsidiary, as well as all foreign Antenna subsidiaries, use the U.S. dollar as its functional currency, therefore, its monetary assets and liabilities are remeasured at current rates and its non-monetary assets are recorded at historical exchange
rates. Realized and unrealized exchange gains or losses from transactions and remeasurement adjustments are reflected in foreign currency transaction loss gain, in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations. 
m Accounting for income taxes The Company uses the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes. Under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on temporary differences between the financial
statement and tax basis of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse. The Company regularly assesses the need for a valuation allowance against its deferred tax assets.
Future realization of the Companys deferred tax assets ultimately depends on the existence of sufficient taxable income within the available carryback or carryforward periods. Sources of taxable income include taxable income in prior carryback
years, future reversals of existing taxable temporary differences, tax planning strategies, and future taxable income. The Company records a valuation allowance to reduce its deferred tax assets to an amount it believes is more-likely-than-not to be
realized. Changes in the valuation allowance impacts income tax expense in the period of adjustment. The Companys deferred tax valuation allowance requires significant judgment and uncertainties, including assumptions about future taxable
income that are based on historical and projected information. The Company recognizes excess tax benefits when they are realized, through a reduction in income taxes payable using the with and without stock option method. 
The Company assesses its income tax positions and records tax benefits based upon managements evaluation of the facts,
circumstances, and information available at the reporting date. For those tax positions where it is more-likely-than-not that a tax benefit will be sustained, the Company records the largest amount of tax benefit with a greater than 50percent
likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement with a taxing authority having full knowledge of all relevant information. For those income tax positions where it is not more-likely-than-not that a tax benefit will be sustained, no tax benefit
is recognized in the financial statements. The Company classifies liabilities for uncertain tax positions as non-current liabilities unless the uncertainty is expected to be resolved within one year. The Company classifies interest and penalties on
uncertain tax positions as income tax expense. As a global company, the Company uses significant judgment to calculate and
provide for income taxes in each of the tax jurisdictions in which it operates. In the ordinary course of the Companys business, there are transactions and calculations undertaken whose ultimate tax outcome cannot be certain. Some of these
uncertainties arise as a consequence of transfer pricing for transactions with the Companys subsidiaries and nexus and tax credit estimates. In addition, the calculation of acquired tax attributes and the associated limitations are complex.
See Note 16 Income Taxes for further information. The Company estimates its exposure to unfavorable outcomes related to these uncertainties and estimates the probability of such outcomes. 
n New accounting pronouncements Revenue from Contracts with Customers: In May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standard Board FASB issued Accounting Standards Update ASU No2014-09,
Revenue from Contracts with Customers Topic 606. This ASU amends the guidance for revenue recognition to replace numerous, industry-specific requirements and converges areas under this topic with those of the International Financial
Reporting Standards. 
51 Table of Contents PEGASYSTEMS INC. 
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTSContinued 
This ASU implements a five-step process for customer contract revenue recognition that focuses on transfer of control, as opposed to transfer of risk and rewards. This ASU also requires enhanced
disclosures regarding the nature, amount, timing and uncertainty of revenues and cash flows from contracts with customers. Other major provisions include ensuring the time value of money is considered in the transaction price, and allowing estimates
of variable consideration to be recognized before contingencies are resolved in certain circumstances. The amendments in this ASU are effective for reporting periods beginning after December15, 2016, and early adoption is not permitted.
Entities can transition to the standard either retrospectively or as a cumulative-effect adjustment as of the date of adoption. This ASU will be effective for the Company January1, 2017. Management is currently assessing the impact the
adoption of this ASU will have on the Companys consolidated financial statements.  3.

DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS 
The Company has historically used foreign currency forward contracts forward contracts to manage its
exposure to changes in foreign currency exchange rates associated with its foreign currency denominated accounts receivable, cash and intercompany payables. The U.S. operating company invoices most of its foreign clients in foreign currencies, which
results in cash and receivables held at the end of the reporting period denominated in these foreign currencies. Since the U.S. operating companys functional currency is the U.S. dollar, the Company recognizes a foreign currency transaction
gain or loss on the foreign currency denominated cash, intercompany payables and accounts receivable held by the U.S. operating company in its consolidated statements of operations when there are changes in the foreign currency exchange rates
versus the U.S. dollar. 
52 Table of Contents PEGASYSTEMS INC. 
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTSContinued 
The Company has been primarily exposed to the fluctuation in the British pound, Euro, Australian dollar, and Indian rupee relative to the U.S. dollar. The Company began to use forward contracts
to mitigate its British pound and Euro exposures in the second quarter of 2011 and for its Australian dollar and Indian rupee exposures in the third quarter of 2013. The forward contracts utilized by the Company are not designated as hedging instruments and as a result, the Company records the fair value of these contracts at the end of each reporting period in its
consolidated balance sheet as other current assets for unrealized gains and accrued expenses for unrealized losses, with any fluctuations in the value of these contracts recognized in other expense, net, in its consolidated statement of operations.
However, the fluctuations in the value of these foreign currency forward contracts partially offset the gains and losses from the remeasurement or settlement of the foreign currency denominated accounts receivable, intercompany payables, and cash
held by the U.S. operating company, thus partly mitigating the volatility. Generally, the Company enters into foreign currency forward contracts with terms not greater than 90 days. 
The Company is in the process of reassessing its hedging strategy and has not entered into any forward contracts since February 2014. As
of December31, 2014 and 2013, the Company did not have any forward contracts outstanding. The Company entered into

FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS 
Fair value is an exit price, representing the amount that would be received from the sale of an asset or paid to
transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants based on assumptions that market participants would use in pricing an asset or liability. As a basis for classifying the fair value measurements, a three-tier fair value
hierarchy, which classifies the fair value measurements based on the inputs used in measuring fair value, was established as follows: Level 1 observable inputs such as quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities; Level 2
significant other observable inputs that are observable either directly or indirectly; and Level 3 significant unobservable inputs in which there is little or no market data, which requires the Company to develop its own assumptions. This
hierarchy requires the Company to use observable market data, when available, and to minimize the use of unobservable inputs when determining fair value. On a recurring basis, the Company records its marketable securities at fair value. 
The Companys money market funds and investments classified within Level1 of the fair value hierarchy are valued using quoted
market prices in active markets for identical assets. The Companys investments classified within Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy are valued based on a market approach using quoted prices  53 Table of Contents PEGASYSTEMS INC. 
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTSContinued 
when available, or matrix pricing compiled by third party pricing vendors, using observable market inputs such as interest rates, yield curves, and credit risk. If applicable, the Company will
recognize transfers into and out of levels within the fair value hierarchy at the end of the reporting period in which the actual event or change in circumstance occurs. In the fourth quarter of 2014, the Company transferred all municipal and
corporate bonds from Level 1 to Level 2 based on the Companys periodic review of its policy and the fact that these securities are not traded as frequently as Level 1 investments. There were no significant transfers of investments between
Level 1 and Level 2 during the year ended December31, 2013. The fair value hierarchy of the Companys cash

which is included in accrued expenses. In addition, up to $15 million in additional cash consideration may be payable to the selling shareholders of one of the three acquired companies based on
the achievement of certain performance milestones through the end of 2016. Acquisitions completed in 2013 
Antenna On
October9, 2013, the Company acquired Antenna, a leading provider of mobile application development platforms. The Company acquired all of the outstanding capital stock of Antenna in a cash merger for $271 million, including the final working
capital adjustment to the purchase price, which was paid by the Company in the first quarter of 2014. During 2014 and 2013, the Company incurred direct and incremental expenses associated with the transaction of $03 million and $13 million,
respectively, which were primarily professional fees. The operations of Antenna are included in the Companys operating
results from the date of acquisition. Due to the rapid integration of the products, sales force, and operations of Antenna, other than the maintenance and hosting revenue attributable to the recognition of the fair value of acquired deferred
maintenance and hosting revenue, it is no longer feasible for the Company to identify revenue from new arrangements solely attributable to Antenna. In 2014, the Company made $6 million in purchase price adjustments to goodwill primarily related to the final determination of assumed sales tax liabilities and deferred tax assets associated with the
acquired NOLs. These purchase price adjustments are also reflected retrospectively as of December31, 2013 in the accompanying audited consolidated balance sheet. As of December31, 2014, as a result of the final purchase price allocation, the Company recognized $23 million of goodwill, which is primarily due to the expected synergies of the combined entities
and the workforce in place. The goodwill created by the transaction is nondeductible for tax purposes. A summary of the final purchase price allocation for the acquisition of Antenna is as follows:  in thousands Total purchase consideration

existing hosting arrangements. The fair value of this assumed liability was based on the estimated cost plus a reasonable margin to fulfill these service obligations. The majority of the deferred
revenue was recognized in the 12 months following the acquisition. The valuation of the acquired intangible assets is
inherently subjective and relies on significant unobservable inputs.The Company used an income approach to value the acquired customer related, technology and trade name intangible assets. The non-compete assets were valued using the
with-and-without method, a form of the income approach which considers the cash flow differentials under multiple scenarios with or without key executives. The valuation for each of these intangible assets was based on estimated projections of
expected cash flows to be generated by the assets, discounted to the present value at discount rates commensurate with perceived risk. The valuation assumptions take into consideration the Companys estimates of contract renewal, technology
attrition and revenue growth projections. The estimated fair values for specifically identifiable intangible
assets acquired, by major asset class, are as follows:  in thousands  years Customer related intangible assets 4,279 4 Technology 3,656 3 Non-compete 1,342 1 Trade name 1,078 3

The following pro forma financial information presents the combined results of operations of the Company and Antenna as if the
acquisition had occurred on January1, 2012 after giving effect to certain pro forma adjustments. The pro forma adjustments reflected herein include only those adjustments that are directly attributable to the Antenna acquisition, factually
supportable, and expected to have a continuing impact on the Company. These pro forma adjustments include a net increase in amortization expense to eliminate historical amortization of Antenna intangible assets and to record amortization expense for
the $104 million of acquired identifiable intangibles, a decrease in interest income as a result of the cash paid for the acquisition, a decrease in interest expense as a result of the repayment of all Antenna outstanding debt in connection with
the acquisition, and the elimination of approximately $13 million of acquisition-related costs, including transaction costs incurred by the Company and Antenna. The pro forma financial information does not reflect any adjustments for anticipated
synergies resulting from the acquisition and is not necessarily indicative of the operating results that would have actually occurred had the transaction been consummated on January1, 2012. Pro

STOCKHOLDERS EQUITY 
a Preferred stock The Company has authorized 1,000,000 shares of preferred stock, which may be issued from time to time in one or more series. The Board of Directors has the authority to issue the shares of preferred stock
in one or more series, to establish the number of shares to be included in each series, and to fix the designation, powers, preferences and rights of the shares of each series and the qualifications, limitations or restrictions thereof, without any
further vote or action by the stockholders. The issuance of preferred stock could decrease the amount of earnings and assets available for distribution to holders of common stock, and may have the effect of delaying, deferring or defeating a change
in control of the Company. The Company had not issued any shares of preferred stock through December31, 2014. b Common stock
The Company has 200,000,000 authorized shares of common stock, $001 par value per share, of which 76,357,000 shares

2012. Therefore, there was no dividend payment in the first quarter of 2013. For the years ended December31, 2014, 2013, and 2012, the Company paid cash dividends of $69 million, $34 million, and $57 million, respectively. It is the
Companys current intention to pay a quarterly cash dividend of $003 per share, however, the Board of Directors may terminate or modify this dividend program at any time without notice. d Warrants summary In January 2012, a former stockholder of
1mind Corporation 1mind exercised a warrant to purchase 4,928 shares, on a post-split basis, of the Companys common stock, which was originally issued as part of the consideration for the Companys acquisition of 1mind in
2002. In accordance with the net exercise provisions of this warrant, the Company withheld 156 shares, on a post-split basis, of its common stock to cover the exercise price of the warrant, which shares were valued at $2,094 based on the average
closing price of its common stock over the ten consecutive trading days ending on the third trading day prior to the exercise date, and issued 4,772 shares, on a post-split basis, of its common stock. The issuance of these shares was made in
reliance on an exemption from registration under Regulation D under the Securities Act of 1933. As of December31, 2014 and December31, 2013, there were no warrants outstanding. 15.
STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION 
The majority of the Companys stock-based compensation arrangements vest over either a four or five year vesting
schedule and the Companys stock options have a ten-year term. The Company recognizes stock-based compensation using the accelerated recognition method, treating each vesting tranche as if it were an individual grant. 
62 Table of Contents PEGASYSTEMS INC. 
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTSContinued 
The Company periodically grants stock options and restricted stock units
RSUs for a fixed number of shares upon vesting to employees and non-employee Directors. The exercise price for stock options is greater than or equal to the fair market value of the shares at the grant date. RSUs deliver to the
recipient a right to receive a specified number of shares of the Companys common stock upon vesting. Unlike stock options, there is no cost to the employee at share issuance. The Company values its RSUs at the fair value of its common stock on
the grant date, which is the closing price of its common stock on the grant date, less the present value of expected dividends, as the employee is not entitled to dividends during the requisite service period. Upon vesting of the RSUs, the Company
withholds shares of common stock in an amount sufficient to cover the minimum statutory tax withholding obligations and issues shares of its common stock for the remaining amount. 
Employees may elect to receive 50% of their target incentive compensation under the Companys Corporate Incentive Compensation Plan
the CICP in the form of RSUs instead of cash. If elected by an employee, the equity amount is equal in value on the date of grant to 50% of his or her target incentive opportunity, based on the employees base salary. The number
of RSUs granted is determined by dividing 50% of the employees target incentive opportunity by the fair value of a RSU on the grant date. If elected, the award vests 100% on the CICP payout date of the following year for all participants.
Vesting is conditioned upon the performance conditions of the CICP and on continued employment; if threshold funding does not occur, the equity grant will be cancelled. The Company considers vesting to be probable on the grant date and recognizes
the associated stock-based compensation expense over the requisite service period beginning on the grant date and ending on the vest date. The Company grants options that allow for the settlement of vested stock options on a net share basis net settled stock options, instead of settlement with a cash payment cash settled
stock options. With net settled stock options, the employee does not surrender any cash or shares upon exercise. Rather, the Company withholds the number of shares to cover the option exercise price and the minimum statutory tax withholding
obligations from the shares that would otherwise be issued upon exercise. The settlement of vested stock options on a net share basis results in fewer shares issued by the Company. 
Share-Based Compensation Plans: 
a 1994 Long-term Incentive Plan In 1994, the Company adopted the 1994 Long-Term Incentive Plan as amended in 2003, the 1994 Plan to provide employees, Directors and consultants with opportunities to purchase stock through
incentive stock options and non-qualified stock options. In addition to options, participants under the 1994 Plan were eligible to receive stock appreciation rights, restricted stock and long-term performance awards. The term for granting awards
under the 1994 Plan expired in April 2005, however, awards outstanding prior to expiration continued to be governed by the terms and conditions of the 1994 Plan. As of December31, 2014, all options to purchase shares of common stock under the
1994 Plan were exercised. b 1996 Non-Employee Director Stock Option Plan 
In 1996, the Company adopted the 1996 Non-Employee Director Stock Option Plan the Director Plan, which provided for the
grant to non-employee Directors of the Company of options to purchase shares of its common stock. All shares authorized for issue under this plan have been awarded. Since 2006, in lieu of granting fully vested options, the Company has granted shares
of its common stock to its non-employee directors under the 2004 Long-Term Incentive Plan, as described below. As of December31, 2014, options to purchase an aggregate of approximately 30,000 shares of common stock were outstanding under the
Director Plan.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTSContinued 
c Amended and Restated 2004 Long-Term Incentive Plan 
In 2004, the Company adopted the 2004 Long-Term Incentive Plan the 2004 Plan to provide employees, non-employee Directors
and consultants with opportunities to purchase stock through incentive stock options and non-qualified stock options. In addition to options, eligible participants under the 2004 Plan may be granted stock purchase rights and other stock-based
awards. In July 2011, the Companys stockholders approved the Pegasystems Inc. Amended and Restated 2004 Long-Term Incentive Plan the Restated 2004 Plan, which authorized the issuance of an additional 5,000,000 shares under the
plan and extended the term of the plan to 2021. Since 2006, the Company has granted to each non-employee director of the Company unrestricted shares of common stock on an annual basis in consideration of their board service. The number of
unrestricted shares granted to each non-employee director was equal to $95,000, $70,000, and $70,000, divided by the fair market value of the Companys common stock on the grant date, for 2014, 2013, and 2012, respectively. On March6,
2014, the Companys Board of Directors approved a two-for-one stock split of the Companys common stock, effected in the form of a stock dividend.See Note 1 Basis of Presentation dfor further discussion of the
Stock Split. As a result of the Stock Split, the number of shares available for issuance under the 2004 Plan doubled. As of December31, 2014, approximately 7,788,000 shares were subject to outstanding options and stock-based awards under the
Restated 2004 Plan. d 2006 Employee Stock Purchase Plan 
In 2006, the Company adopted the 2006 Employee Stock Purchase Plan the 2006 ESPP pursuant to which the Companys
employees are entitled to purchase up to an aggregate of 500,000 shares of common stock at a price equal to at least 85% of the fair market value of the Companys common stock on either the commencement date or completion date for offerings
under the plan, whichever is less, or such higher price as the Companys Board of Directors may establish from time to time. Until the Companys Board of Directors determines otherwise, the Board has set the purchase price at 95% of the
fair market value on the completion date of the offering period. As a result, the 2006 ESPP is non-compensatory and is tax qualified. Therefore, as of December31, 2014, no compensation expense related to shares issued under the plan had been
recognized. In October 2012, the Companys Board of Directors amended the term of the 2006 ESPP such that it will continue until there are no shares remaining to be issued under the plan or until the plan is terminated by the Board of
Directors, whichever occurs first. On March6, 2014, the Companys Board of Directors approved a two-for-one stock split of the Companys common stock, effected in the form of a stock dividend.See Note 1 Basis of
Presentation dfor further discussion of the Stock Split. As a result of the Stock Split, the number of shares available for issuance under the 2004 Plan doubled. As of December31, 2014, approximately 307,000 shares had been
issued thereunder. Shares reserved As of December31, 2014, there were approximately 5,896,000 shares remaining for issuance for future equity grants under the Companys stock plans, consisting of approximately 5,203,000 shares
under the Restated 2004 Plan and approximately 693,000 shares under the 2006 ESPP. There were no shares available for future equity grants under the 1994 Plan or the Director Plan. Equity grants, assumptions and activity During 2014, the Company issued
approximately 774,000 shares to its employees under the Companys share-based compensation plans and approximately 29,000 shares to the non-employee members of its Board of Directors.

Stock Options The Company estimates the fair value of stock options using a Black-Scholes option valuation model. Key inputs used to estimate the fair value of stock options include the exercise price of the award, the
expected term of the option, the expected volatility of the Companys common stock over the options expected term, the risk-free interest rate over the options expected term, and the Companys expected annual dividend yield.
The amount of stock-based compensation recognized during a period is based on the value of the awards that are ultimately expected to vest. Forfeitures are estimated at the time of grant and revised, if necessary, in subsequent periods if actual
forfeitures differ from those estimates. Ultimately, the Company recognizes the actual expense over the vesting period only for the shares that vest. The weighted-average grant-date fair value for stock options granted in 2014, 2013, and 2012, was
$758, $672 and $472, respectively. The weighted-average assumptions used in the Black-Scholes option valuation model are
as follows:  Year ended December31 2014 2013 2012 Expected volatility 1 47 49 54 Expected term in years 2 44 45 43 Risk-free interest rate 3 133 102 063 Expected annual dividend yield 4 044 042 052  1
The expected volatility for each grant is determined based on the average of historical daily price changes of the Companys common stock over a period of time
which approximates the expected option term.  2
The expected option term for each grant is determined based on the historical exercise behavior of employees and post-vesting employment termination behavior.
3
The risk-free interest rate is based on the yield of zero-coupon U.S. Treasury securities for a period that is commensurate with the expected option term at the time of
grant.  4
The expected annual dividend yield is based on the weighted-average of the dividend yield assumptions used for options granted during the applicable period. The
expected annual dividend has historically been based on the expected dividend of $006 per share, per year $0015 per share, per quarter times 4 quarters, on a post-split basis, divided by the average stock price. On May27, 2014, the Company
announced an increase in its quarterly cash dividend from $0015 to $003 per share. Thus, for grants made after this date, the expected annual dividend is based on the expected dividend of $012 per share, per year $003 per share, per quarter
times 4 quarters, divided by the average stock price. The Company elected to adopt the alternative transition
method short cut method in calculating its historical pool of windfall tax benefits in regards to its share-based compensation.

The purchase price adjustments related to the Antenna acquisition identified during 2014 were retrospectively applied as of December31, 2013. See Note 8
Acquisitions for further discussion of these adjustments. The Company regularly assesses the need
for a valuation allowance against its deferred tax assets. In making that assessment, the Company considers both positive and negative evidence related to the likelihood of realization of the deferred tax assets to determine, based on the weight of
available evidence, whether it is more-likely-than-not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. This determination requires significant judgment, including assumptions about future taxable income that are based on historical
and projected information. There were no material adjustments to the Companys valuation allowance position during 2014. The $05 million net decrease in the valuation allowance during the period primarily relates to movements in foreign
exchange rates. The $24 million net increase in the valuation allowance during 2013 primarily relates to the valuation allowance recorded against the acquired Antenna federal and foreign NOLs that the Company had preliminarily determined it would
not be able to utilize due to various limitations and restrictions. The Company acquired approximately $396 million and
$581 million of federal and foreign NOLs, respectively, in the Antenna acquisition. The Company has determined that it may utilize $75 million of the acquired Antenna federal NOLs under the applicable section 382 limitation, and these losses are
scheduled to expire through 2031. A valuation allowance is recorded on the deferred tax assets in excess of the federal NOLs that are deemed recoverable under the limitation. With regard to the acquired foreign NOLs, a full valuation allowance has
been recorded as of December31, 2014 due to uncertainty regarding the availability of these NOLs to offset future income generated by the related foreign businesses due to limitations under local country

change in control provisions. As of December31, 2014, the Company had approximately $393 million of acquired Antenna federal NOLs, which are subject to annual use limitations under section
382. Based on those limitations, the Company anticipates using $71 million of the remaining NOLs by 2031. As of
December31, 2014, the Company had approximately $1158 million of acquired Chordiant federal NOLs, which are subject to annual use limitations under section 382. Based on those limitations, the Company anticipates using $90 million of the
remaining NOLs by 2029. In addition, the Company has $07 million of deferred tax assets related to state NOLs as of December31, 2014. As of December31, 2014, the Company had available $62 million of state tax research and experimentation RE credits and $05 million of investment tax credits expiring in the
years 2015 through 2029. The Companys India subsidiary is a development center in an area designated as a Special
Economic Zone SEZ and is entitled to a tax holiday in India. The tax holiday reduces or eliminates income tax in that country and is scheduled to expire in 2022. For the years ended December31, 2014, 2013, and 2012, the effect of
the income tax holiday was to reduce the overall income tax provision by approximately $08 million, $05 million, and $05 million, respectively. The benefit of the tax holiday on net income per share diluted was $001 for each of the years ended
December31, 2014, 2013, and 2012. In 2014, the Company reduced its income tax payable by $31 million for the tax
benefit realized from the exercise, sale or vesting of equity awards. Undistributed earnings of the Companys foreign
subsidiaries amounted to approximately $447 million as of December31, 2014. The Company has not provided any additional federal or state income taxes or foreign withholding taxes on the undistributed earnings as such earnings have been
indefinitely reinvested in the business. It is impractical to estimate the amount of tax the Company could have to pay upon repatriation due to the complexity of foreign tax credit calculations and because the Company considers its earnings
permanently reinvested. Uncertain tax benefits and other considerations 
A reconciliation of the beginning and ending balances of the total amounts of gross unrecognized tax benefits is as follows: in thousands

Balance as of December31 43,396 40,929 26,317 
As of December31, 2014, the Company had approximately $434 million of total unrecognized tax
benefits, of which $234 million would decrease the Companys effective tax rate if recognized. However, approximately $20 million of these unrecognized tax benefits relate to acquired NOLs and research tax credits, which are subject to
limitations on use. The Company expects that the changes in the unrecognized benefits within the next twelve months will be approximately $05 million, all of which relate to the expiration of applicable statute of limitations and would reduce the
Companys effective tax rate if realized.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTSContinued 
For the year ended December31, 2014, the reductions for tax positions of prior
years were related to the lapse in the applicable statute of limitations, revision of purchase accounting estimates, settlements of audits, and the impact for foreign currency exchange rates. For the years ended December31, 2013 and 2012, the
reductions for tax positions of prior years were all related to the lapse in the applicable statute of limitations. The
Company recognizes interest accrued and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits in the income tax provision. For the years ended December31, 2014, 2013, and 2012, the Company recognized interest expense of approximately $03 million 03 million, and $01 million, respectively. For the years ended December31, 2014, 2013, and 2012, the Company did not recognize any significant penalties. As of December31, 2014 and 2013, the Company had accrued approximately $15
million and $11 million, respectively, for interest and penalties. The Company files income tax returns in the U.S. and in
foreign jurisdictions. The Companys 2011, 2012 and 2013 federal income tax returns are under examination. The Company is generally not subject to U.S. federal, state, or local, or foreign income tax examinations by tax authorities for the
years before 2008. With few exceptions, the statute of limitations remains open in all jurisdictions for the tax years 2009 to the present.  17.

Diluted earnings per share is computed using the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding during the period, plus the dilutive effect of outstanding options, warrants, and RSUs, using the treasury stock method and the average market
price of the Companys common stock during the applicable period. Certain shares related to some of the Companys outstanding stock options, warrants and RSUs were excluded from the computation of diluted earnings per share because they
were antidilutive in the periods presented, but could be dilutive in the future.  Year Ended December31 in thousands, except per share amounts
