BOWLIN Outdoor Advertising
& Travel Centers Incorporated We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of BOWLIN Outdoor
Advertising & Travel Centers Incorporated and subsidiaries as of January 31,
2000 and 1999, and the related consolidated statements of income, stockholders'
equity and cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended
Januar 31, 2000. These consolidated financial statements are the responsibility
of the Company management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on
these consolidated financial statements based on our audits.
We conducted our audits in accordance with generally  accepted auditing
standards. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material
misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting
the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes
assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by
management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.
We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present
fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of BOWLIN Outdoor
Advertising & Travel Centers Incorporated and subsidiaries as of January 31,
2000 and 1999, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each
of the years in the three-year period ended January 31, 2000, in conformity with
generally accepted accounting principles.

and major additions to property and equipment are capitalized.
Depreciation is provided by the Company using primarily straight-line,
as well as accelerated methods.
g Intangible Assets
Goodwill, which represents the excess of purchase price over fair
value of net assets acquired, is amortized on a straight-line basis
over the expected periods to be benefited, generally 5 to 15 years.
The Company assesses the recoverability of this intangible asset by
determining whether the amortization of the goodwill balance over its
remaining life can be recovered through undiscounted future operating
cash flows of the acquired operation.  The amount of goodwill
impairment, if any, is measured based on projected discounted future
operating cash flows using a discount rate reflecting the Company
average cost of funds.
Covenants not-to-compete are amortized over the life of the respective
covenants using the straight-line method, ranging from one to ten
years.
Debt issuance costs are deferred and amortized over the terms of the
respective borrowings on a straight-line basis for the revolving
portion and the interest method for the term note portion.
Franchise fees are amortized on a straight-line basis over the shorter
of the life of the related franchise agreements or the periods
estimated to be benefited, ranging from fifteen to twenty-five years.
h Sales and Cost Recognition
Sales of merchandise are recognized at the time of sale and the
associated costs of the merchandise are included in cost of sales.
Revenues from rental of billboard space are recognized on an accrual
basis ratably over the terms of the contracts as advertising services
are provided.
i Deferred Income
Deferred income consists principally of advertising revenue received
in advance. Deferred advertising revenue is recognized in income as
services are provided over the term of the contract.

j Income Taxes
Income taxes are accounted for under the asset and liability method.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax
consequences  attributable to differences  between the financial
statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and
their  respective tax bases and operating loss and tax credit
carryforwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using
enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in
which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or
settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change
in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the
enactment date.
k Stock Option Plan
The Company accounts for its stock option plan in accordance with the
provisions of Accounting Principles Board APB Opinion No. 25,
Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees, and related interpretation.
As such, compensation expense is recorded on the date of grant only if
the current market price of the underlying stock exceeds the exercise
price. SFAS No. 123, Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation, permits
entities to continue to apply the provisions of APB Opinion No. 25 and
provide pro forma net income and pro forma earnings per share
disclosures  for  employee  stock  option  grants  as  if  the
fair-value-based method defined in SFAS No. 123 has been applied. The
Company has elected to continue to apply the provisions of the APB
Opinion No. 25 and provide the pro forma disclosure provisions of SFAS
No. 123.
l Impairment of Long-lived Assets and Long-lived Assets to Be Disposed
Of
The Company reviews its long-lived assets and certain identifiable
intangibles for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances
indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable.
Recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by a
comparison of the carrying amount of an asset to future net cash flows
expected to be generated by the asset. If such assets are considered
to be impaired, the impairment to be recognized is measured by the
amount by which the carrying amount of the assets exceeds the fair
value of the assets. Assets to be disposed of are reported at the
lower of the carrying amount of fair value less costs to sell.
m Financial Instruments
The Company financial instruments are cash and cash equivalents,
accounts receivable, notes receivable, accounts payable, accrued
liabilities, short-term borrowings, and long-term debt. The carrying
amounts of cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, notes
receivable,  accounts payable,  accrued  liabilities,  short-term
borrowings, and long-term debt approximate fair value.

n Use of Estimates
Management of the Company has made a number of estimates and
assumptions relating to the reporting of assets and liabilities and
the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities to prepare these
consolidated  financial  statements in conformity with generally
accepted accounting principles. Actual results could differ from those
estimates.
o Reclassification
Certain reclassifications have been made to the prior year financial
statements to conform to the current year presentation.
p Earnings Per Share
Basic earnings per share of common stock is computed by dividing net
income by the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding
during the period. Diluted earnings per share is calculated in the
same manner as basic earnings per share except that the denominator is
increased to include the number of additional common shares that would
have been outstanding, assuming the exercise of all employee stock
options that would have had a dilutive effect on earnings per share. A
reconciliation of the number of shares used in the calculation of
basic and diluted earnings per share for the years ended January 31,
2000, 1999 and 1998 follows

Options to purchase 247,000, 259,000 and 301,500 shares of common
stock were outstanding during the years ended January 31, 2000,
1999 and 1998, respectively, but were not included in the
computation of diluted EPS because the options' exercise price was
greater than the average market price of the common shares. The
options, which expire December 2006, were still outstanding at
January 31, 2000.

Through January 31, 2000, the Company received proceeds from insurance
totaling $1,086,865 to replace assets destroyed by a fire at the Company
headquarters during November 1998 which resulted in recognition of a
$711,805 gain.
During the year ended January 31, 1998, the Company determined the actual
lives for approximately $214,100 of billboard expenditures were generally
longer than the estimated useful lives  previously  established for
depreciation purposes. Therefore, effective February 1, 1997, the Company
extended the estimated useful lives of those assets up to 7 years. The
effect of this change in accounting estimate increased net income by
$105,400 $02 per basic and diluted share.

8 Stockholders' Equity
In December 1996, the Company completed an initial public offering of
1,100,000 shares of common stock at $800 per share. Concurrent with the
closing of the initial public offering, the Company issued a five-year
nonredeemable option to purchase up to 93,500 shares of common stock at an
exercise price equal to 120 percent of the offering price, or $960 per
share to the underwriter. The option became exercisable in December 1997.
As of January 31, 2000, the option has not been exercised.
9 Stock Option Plan
On September 27, 1996, the Company adopted the 1996 Stock Option Plan the
Plan pursuant to which the Company board of directors may grant stock
options to officers and key employees. The Plan authorizes grants of
options to purchase shares of authorized but unissued common stock up to an
amount equal to ten percent of issued and outstanding shares of common
stock 438,485 shares as of January 31, 2000. Stock options are granted
with an exercise price equal to the stock fair market value at the date
of grant. All stock options expire in ten years and vest, and become fully
exercisable as determined by the board at time of grant.
At January 31, 2000, there were 485 additional shares available for grant
under the Plan. The per share weighted-average fair value of stock options
granted during 2000 was $169 on the date of grant using the Black Scholes
option-pricing model with the following weighted-average assumptions:
expected dividend yield 00 percent, expected volatility of 70 percent,
risk-free interest rate of 7 percent, and an expected life of 2 years.
The Company applies APB Opinion No. 25 in accounting for its Plan and,
accordingly, no compensation cost has been recognized for its stock options
in the consolidated financial statements. Had the Company determined
compensation cost based on the fair value at the grant date for its stock
options under SFAS No. 123, the Company net income and earnings per share
would have been reduced to the pro forma amounts indicated below for the
years ended January 31
