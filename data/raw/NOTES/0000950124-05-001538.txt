Financial Statements and Supplementary
Data REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC
ACCOUNTING FIRM To the Board of Directors and Shareholders of
Covansys Corporation We have completed an integrated audit of Covansys
Corporations 2004 consolidated financial statements and of
its internal control over financial reporting as of
December31, 2004 and audits of its 2003 and 2002
consolidated financial statements in accordance with the
standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board
United States. Our opinions, based on our audits are presented
below. Consolidated
financial statements In our opinion, the consolidated financial
statements listed in the index appearing under
a1 present fairly, in all material respects, the
financial position of Covansys Corporation and its subsidiaries
at December31, 2004 and 2003, and the results of their
operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in
the period ended December31, 2004 in conformity with
accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of
America. These financial statements are the responsibility of
the Companys management. Our responsibility is to express
an opinion on these financial statements based on our audits. We
conducted our audits of these statements in accordance with the
standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board
United States. Those standards require that we plan and
perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether
the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An
audit of financial statements includes examining, on a test
basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the
financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used
and significant estimates made by management, and evaluating the
overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our
audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. As described in Note2 to the consolidated
financial statements, the Company has restated its previously
reported 2003 and 2002 consolidated financial statements,
related primarily to certain income tax and leasing matters. Internal
control over financial reporting Also, we have audited managements
assessment, included in Managements Report on Internal
Control Over Financial Reporting appearing under Item9A,
that Covansys Corporation did not maintain effective internal
control over financial reporting as of December31, 2004,
because of the effect of material weaknesses relating to the
Companys revenue recognition, percentage-of completion
accounting, property and equipment, income taxes and leasing,
based on criteria established in Internal Control-Integrated
Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring
Organizations of the Treadway Commission COSO. The
Companys management is responsible for maintaining
effective internal control over financial reporting and for its
assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over
financial reporting. Our responsibility is to express opinions
on managements assessment and on the effectiveness of the
Companys internal control over financial reporting based
on our audit. We conducted our audit of internal control over
financial reporting in accordance with the standards of the
Public Company Accounting Oversight Board United States. Those
standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control
over financial reporting was maintained in all material
respects. An audit of internal control over financial reporting
includes obtaining an understanding of internal control over
financial reporting, evaluating managements assessment,
testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of
internal control, and performing such other procedures as we
consider necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our
audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinions. A companys internal control over financial
reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance
regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the
preparation of financial statements for external purposes in
accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A
companys internal control over 27 Table of Contents financial reporting includes those policies and
procedures that: ipertain to the maintenance of records
that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the
transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company;
iiprovide reasonable assurance that transactions are
recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial
statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting
principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company
are being made only in accordance with authorizations of
management and directors of the company; and iiiprovide
reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of
unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the
companys assets that could have a material effect on the
financial statements. Because of its inherent limitations, internal
control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect
misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of
effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that
controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions,
or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures
may deteriorate. A material weakness is a control deficiency, or
combination of control deficiencies, that results in more than a
remote likelihood that a material misstatement of the annual or
interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected.
The following material weaknesses have been identified and
included in managements assessments.   
1.
The Company did not maintain effective controls
over the validity and accuracy of contract revenue and the
related billed and unbilled accounts receivable. Specifically,
the Company did not maintain effective controls over obtaining a
signed contract or determining that a contract amendment was
authorized at the time revenue is recognized; and that all
original or amended contract terms primarily customer
acceptance conditions and fee limitation clauses are accurately
reflected within the consolidated financial statements. This
control deficiency resulted in the Company recording a material
adjustment to the fourth quarter 2004 financial statements.
Additionally, this control deficiency could result in a
misstatement to the revenue accounts that would result in a
material misstatement to annual or interim financial statements
that would not be prevented or detected.
2.
The Company did not maintain effective controls
over the completeness and accuracy of revenue accounted for
under the percentage-of-completion method and the associated
revenue in excess of billings balance sheet account. The Company
accounts for a portion of its fixed price contracts using the
percentage-of-completion method. Under this accounting method,
revenue to be recognized is dependent upon, among other things,
managements ability to reasonably estimate the costs to
complete the contract. The Companys
percentage-of-completion accounting control procedures were not
designed to require the use of a consistent risk-adjusted method
to estimate the costs to complete. Additionally, the
Companys controls over cost to complete estimates were not
operating effectively because project management and accounting
personnel did not consistently document manual adjustments to
cost estimates and percentage-of-completion accounting records
and they did not in limited instances provide written
certifications attesting to the accuracy of their cost to
complete estimates. The control deficiency did not result in any
adjustments to the 2004 annual or interim consolidated financial
statements. However, this control deficiency could result in a
misstatement to the revenue and revenue in excess of billings
accounts that would result in a material misstatement to annual
or interim financial statements that would not be prevented or
detected.
3.
The Company did not maintain effective controls
over the completeness and accuracy of the Companys net
property and equipment balance and the related depreciation
expense. Specifically, substantially all of the Companys
property and equipment records are maintained using databases
and spreadsheets, which are not integrated with the
Companys underlying information technology system and do
not have adequate controls to ensure that assets, asset values,
capitalization dates and useful lives are complete, accurate and
recorded on a timely basis. Additionally, reconciliation
controls over inter-company fixed asset transactions were not
operating effectively. This control deficiency resulted in the
restatement of the Companys consolidated financial
statements for 2003, 2002, and 2001 and for each of the quarters
for the two years in the period ended December31, 2003,
and in the Company recording an adjustment to the fourth quarter
2004 financial statements. Additionally, this control
28 Table of Contents   
deficiency could result in a misstatement to the
property and equipment and related depreciation expense accounts
that would result in a material misstatement to annual or
interim financial statements that would not be prevented or
detected.
4.
The Company did not maintain effective controls
over the accuracy of the Companys current tax payable
account, the deferred tax asset and liability balances,
valuation allowance and income tax expense. Specifically, the
Company did not have controls in place to ensure that the
Company had sufficient supporting documentation for these income
tax balances and that its income tax accounts were periodically
reconciled to supporting documentation. This control deficiency
resulted in the restatement of the Companys consolidated
financial statements for 2003, 2002, and 2001, for each of the
quarters for the two years in the period ended December31,
2003 and for the first, second and third quarters for 2004, and
in the Company recording an audit adjustment to the fourth
quarter 2004 financial statements. Additionally, this control
deficiency could result in a misstatement to the current tax
payable account, the deferred tax asset and liability balances,
valuation allowance and to income tax expense that would result
in a material misstatement to the annual or interim financial
statements that would not be prevented or detected.
5.
The Company did not maintain effective controls
over the completeness and accuracy of its accrued lease
liability and related lease expense. Specifically, the Company
did not have controls in place to ensure the accounting
implications for new or amended leases were consistently
evaluated and reviewed by management. Additionally, the
Companys controls over its selection and monitoring of its
accounting policy for lease accounting were ineffective. The
Company incorrectly applied generally accepted accounting
principles to lease agreements with step increases in rental
payments resulting in an error in the accrued lease liability
and related lease expense. This control deficiency resulted in
the restatement of the Companys consolidated financial
statement for 2003, 2002 and 2001, for each of the quarters for
the two years in the period ended December31, 2003 and for
the first, second and third quarters for 2004. Additionally,
this control deficiency could result in a misstatement to the
accrued lease liability and lease expense that would result in a
material misstatement to annual or interim financial statements
that would not be prevented or detected.
These material weaknesses were considered in
determining the nature, timing, and extent of audit tests
applied in our audit of the 2004 consolidated financial
statements, and our opinion regarding the effectiveness of the
Companys internal control over financial reporting does
not affect our opinion on those consolidated financial
statements. In our opinion, managements assessment that
Covansys Corporation did not maintain effective internal control
over financial reporting as of December31, 2004, is fairly
stated, in all material respects, based on criteria established
in Internal Control Integrated Framework
issued by the COSO. Also, in our opinion, because of the
effects of the material weaknesses described above on the
achievement of the objectives of the control criteria, Covansys
Corporation has not maintained effective internal control over
financial reporting as of December31, 2004, based on
criteria established in Internal Control
Integrated Framework issued by the COSO. PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP Detroit, Michigan March11, 2005 29 Table of Contents COVANSYS CORPORATION AND

and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies   
Operations Covansys Corporation and its wholly-owned
subsidiaries the Company provide information technology IT
services worldwide to large and mid-size organizations. The
Company offers its clients a focused range of IT services
specializing in industry-specific solutions, strategic
outsourcing and integration services. The Companys range
of experience runs from advising clients on IT business strategy
and strategic technology plans to developing and implementing
appropriate IT applications solutions.   
Principles of Consolidation and
Organization The consolidated financial statements include the
accounts of the Company and all of its wholly-owned
subsidiaries. All significant intercompany accounts and
transactions have been eliminated in the accompanying
consolidated financial statements.   
Foreign Currency For significant foreign operations, the local
currencies have been designated as the functional currencies.
The financial statements of these subsidiaries are translated
into U.S. dollars using exchange rates in effect at year end for
assets and liabilities and at the average exchange rate during
the year for revenue and expenses. The resulting foreign
currency translation adjustment is reflected as a separate
component of shareholders equity. Transaction gains and losses, which were not
significant in the years presented, are reflected in the
consolidated statements of operations in other income, net.

Short Term Investments Short term investments consist principally of
mutual funds. The Company classifies such securities as
available-for-sale. Securities classified as available-for-sale
are required to be reported at fair value with unrealized gains
and losses, net of taxes, excluded from earnings and shown
separately as a component of other comprehensive income within
shareholders equity. The unrealized gains and losses on these
investments included in accumulated other comprehensive income
for December31, 2004 and 2003 are as follows

Financial Instruments The fair values and carrying amounts of the
Companys financial instruments, short term investments, a
note receivable and a note payable, are approximately equivalent
due to the short term nature of the instruments and the variable
interest rates on the notes.   
Investments The Company accounts for certain investments in
equity instruments on the cost method. The Company continually
evaluates whether events and circumstances have occurred that
indicate a decline in the market value of the investments is
judged to be other than temporary. When factors indicate that
the decline in market value is other than temporary, the cost
basis is written down to fair market value. During 2004, the
Company fully reserved for its investment in JPSystems.
The impairment loss of $1,000 before tax is included in selling,
general and administrative expenses in the income statement and
is included in the other category for segment reporting. The following table summarizes of the

businesses acquired and the acquisition of shares of a
subsidiary. The Company continually evaluates whether events and
circumstances have occurred that indicate the remaining

amortized over the expected life of the asset or term of the
lease, whichever is shorter. Renewal periods of leases have been
included in the lease term if the renewals are reasonably
assured. Internally developed computer software is
recorded at cost and includes purchased, internally developed
and externally developed software to be used in the
Companys operations.   
Long-Lived Assets We evaluate the recoverability of long-lived
assets excluding goodwill in accordance with SFAS144
whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the
carrying amounts may be impaired. The impairment evaluation is
performed by comparing their carrying values to the undiscounted
cash flows expected to be derived from such long-lived assets.
If such evaluation indicated an impairment, we use discounted
cash flows to measure fair value in determining the amount of
the long-lived assets that should be written-off.   
Revenue Recognition We recognize revenue in accordance with Staff
Accounting Bulletin No104, for our time-and-materials and
fixed price outsourcing contracts. For those service contracts
which are billed on a time and materials basis, we recognize
revenues as the services are performed. In our time and
materials contracts our effort, measured by our time incurred,
represents the contractual milestones or output measure which is
the contractual earnings pattern. For our fixed price IT
outsourcing, maintenance and transaction processing contracts,
we recognize revenue ratably over the applicable period as the
services are performed continuously over the contract period. For our contracts to design, develop or modify
complex information systems based upon the clients
specifications, we recognize revenue on a percentage of
completion basis in accordance with Statement of Position 81-1.
The percentage of completion is determined by relating the
actual cost of labor performed to date to the estimated total
cost of labor for each contract. This method is followed where
reasonably dependable estimates of revenue and cost can be made.
Estimates of total contract revenues and costs are continuously
monitored during the term of the contract, and recorded revenues
and costs are subject to revision as the contract progresses.
Such revisions, which may result in increases or decreases to
revenue and income, are reflected in the financial statements in
the period in which they are first identified. If the estimate
indicates a loss on a particular contract, a provision is made
for the entire estimated loss without reference to the
percentage of completion See Note5. Covansys periodically enters into contracts that
include multiple-element arrangements, which may include any
combination of services, software, support/maintenance, and the
re-sale of hardware or software. Contracts entered into after
June30, 2003 containing multiple elements or deliverables
are segmented into separate units of accounting where the
separate elements represent separate earnings processes in
accordance with EITF00-21. Revenues are allocated among
the elements based on the relative fair values of the elements
and are recognized in accordance with our policies for the
separate elements unless the undelivered elements are essential
to the functionality of the delivered elements. In circumstances
where an undelivered element is 36 Table of Contents COVANSYS CORPORATION AND
SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTSContinued Dollars in thousands, except per share
data essential to the functionality of the delivered
element, no revenue is recognized for the delivered element
until the undelivered element is delivered. Retainages are included in revenue earned in
excess of billings in the accompanying condensed consolidated
balance sheets. Revenue earned in excess of billings is
primarily comprised of revenue recognized on certain contracts
in excess of contractual billings on such contracts. Billings in
excess of revenue earned are classified as deferred revenue.   
Computer Software We perform research to develop software for
various business applications. The costs of such research are
charged to expense when incurred. When the technological
feasibility of the product is established, subsequent costs are
capitalized in accordance with SFAS86 Computer
Software to be Sold, Leased or Otherwise Marketed.
Capitalized software costs are amortized on a product-by-product
basis. Amortization is recorded on the straight-line method over
the estimated economic life of the product, generally five
years, commencing when such product is available. The
establishment of technological feasibility and the ongoing
assessment of the recoverability of these costs requires
considerable judgment by management with respect to certain
external factors including, but not limited to, anticipated
future gross product revenue, estimated economic product lives
and changes in software and hardware technology. These
assumptions are reevaluated and adjusted as necessary at the end
of the accounting period. Management reviews the valuation and
amortization of capitalized development costs. We periodically
consider the value of future cash flows attributable to the
capitalized development costs in evaluating potential impairment
of the asset. Based on these analyses and evaluations, the
Company has identified and recorded an impairment loss of $225
for its Claims Connect software product. Amounts charged to
expense for research and development of computer software were
not material in the periods indicated. Amounts capitalized were $208, $909 and $1,021
for the years ended December31, 2004, 2003 and 2002,
respectively. During the year ended December31, 2002, in
connection with the acquisition of PDA Software Services, Inc.
see Note7, the Company acquired computer software
totaling $5,694. The amortization of software development costs
was $1,707, $2,437 and $1,737 for the years ended
December31, 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively. Accumulated amortization on computer software
amounted to $8,892 and $7,289 as of December31, 2004 and
2003, respectively.   
Income Taxes Deferred tax assets and liabilities are
recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to
differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of
existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted
tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in
which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered
or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of
a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that
includes the enactment date.   
Other Income, Net Other income, net, represents interest earned and
realized gains and losses on cash and short-term investments,
loss from sale of investment carried at cost and foreign
currency gains/losses. 37 Table of Contents COVANSYS CORPORATION AND

Net Income Loss Per Share Basic and diluted net income loss per share is
computed in accordance with SFAS No128, Earnings

available for common shareholders by the weighted average number
of shares of common stock outstanding. The calculation of

beginning after March31, 2004. The Company adopted
Issue03-6 in the second quarter ended June30, 2004
and restated EPS for all prior periods presented. The adoption
of Issue03-6 results in a reduction in EPS available for
common shareholders in periods where the Company has income and
has no impact in periods where the Company has a loss. The
Companys SeriesA Voting Convertible Preferred Stock

CDRShareholder see Note3.   
Use of Estimates in the Preparation of
Financial Statements The preparation of financial statements in
conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the
United States requires management to make estimates and
assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and
liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities
at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts
of revenue and expenses during the reporting period. Actual
results could differ from those estimates. Estimates and assumptions which, in the opinion
of management, are significant to the underlying amounts
included in the financial statements and for which it would be
reasonably possible that future events or information could
change those estimates include: 1revenue recognition
under the percentage-of-completion method, 2impairment
assessments of goodwill and other long-lived assets,
3realization of deferred tax assets and assessment of
tax reserves recorded, 4allowance for doubtful accounts
and 5litigation-related contingencies. These estimates
are discussed further throughout the accompanying notes to the
consolidated financial statements. The Company has formal
variable compensation plans for sales, delivery and management
employees. These plans are structured to pay out quarterly,
semi-annually or annually depending on the plan. Amounts are
accrued on a monthly basis relative to actual performance
compared to performance targets.   
Stock Options The Company has elected to account for stock
options using the intrinsic value method prescribed in
Accounting Principles Board Opinion No25,
Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees, and related 38 Table of Contents COVANSYS CORPORATION AND

data interpretations. As supplemental information, the
Company has elected to provide the pro forma disclosures, as
permitted under the provisions of Statement of Financial
Accounting Standards No123, Accounting for
Stock-Based Compensation SFAS No123.
Accordingly, no compensation expense other than expense required
for changes to stock option grants has been recognized for the
Plan within the accompanying consolidated statements of
operations. Had compensation expense for the Plan been
determined based on the fair value at the grant date consistent
with the provisions of SFAS No123, the Companys pro

During 2004, the Company made amendments to the
stock option grants of two employees upon their termination. In
connection with the amendments, the Company recorded a charge of
$243. Recently Issued Financial Accounting
Standards In December 2004 the FASB issued FAS123R,
Share-Based Payment, that requires companies to
expense the value of employee stock options and similar awards.
The effective date for application by public companies is
interim and annual periods beginning after June15, 2005.
FAS123R applies to all outstanding and unvested
share-based payment awards at a Companys adoption date.
FAS123R allows alternative transition methods. The Company
has not yet selected a transition method. Management is
presently reviewing the impact on our results of operations and
financial position from implementing FAS123R. In December 2004, the FASB issued an FASB Staff
Position FSP109-2 Accounting and Disclosure
Guidance for the Foreign Earnings Repatriation Provision within
the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004, which provides
accounting and disclosure guidance for the foreign earnings
repatriation provision within the American Jobs Creation Act of
2004. The Act provides special one-time dividends received
deduction on the repatriation of certain foreign earnings to a
U.S. taxpayer. FSP FASB109-2 provides for a period of time
beyond the financial reporting period of enactment for a company
to evaluate the effect of the Act on its plan for reinvestment
or repatriation of foreign earnings. The Company is in the
process of evaluating the effects of one-time repatriation
opportunities provided by the Act. At the time of filing these
statements, the Company cannot reasonably estimate the income
tax effects of such repatriation under the Act. 39 Table of Contents COVANSYS CORPORATION AND

Restatement of Financial Statements Subsequent to the issuance of its financial
statements for the years ended December31, 2003 and 2002,
the Company identified adjustments related to leases, income
taxes and fixed assets that required restatement of its
previously issued financial statements. Each of these
adjustments is described further below.   
Lease Accounting During the 2004 year end closing process, the
Company initiated and completed an analysis of its lease
accounting in order to determine if its historical practices
have deviated from the lease accounting standards discussed in
SFAS13, Accounting for Leases. As part of that
analysis, the Company determined that it had not properly
accounted for the operating lease for its US headquarters signed
in 1993 in accordance with the guidance set forth in FASB
Technical Bulletin85-3, Accounting for Operating
Leases with Scheduled Rent Increases and FASB Technical
Bulletin88-1, Issues Relating to Accounting for
Leases. The Company assessed the impact of the resulting
errors on its historical financial statements and concluded that
it was required to restate its financial statements for all
periods affected by the matter. As a result, the Company
restated its Consolidated Financial Statements for the years
ended December31, 2003 and 2002, the effect of which was
to reduce income from continuing operations before income taxes
by $132 and $124 respectively. The impact of this matter on the Companys
Consolidated Financial Statements for the years prior to
December31, 2001 is reflected in the Consolidated
Statement of Shareholders Equity as a reduction to
retained earnings of $1,525 as of December31, 2001.   
Income Tax Accounting In connection with its 2004 year end closing
process, the Company performed a calculation of the cumulative
temporary difference for property and equipment and capitalized
software development costs and concluded that the net deferred
tax liability of $1,638 required to be recorded for these
differences had been misclassified in its financial statements
as a contingent tax reserve since December31, 2001. Upon
discovery of the error, the Company evaluated its accounting
treatment for contingent tax reserves from December31,
2001 through 2004. This analysis concluded that the Company did
not have sufficient tax reserves at December31, 2001 due
to this error and it had excess reserves at December31,
2003 due to other errors. The analysis of prior periods
identified tax reserves for items that should have been released
in the year ended December31, 2003 due to the settlement
of two issues reviewed under IRS examination offset partially by
an error in recording state tax valuation allowances determined
to be necessary in 2003 and one other less significant
computational error. The Company assessed the impact of these
errors on its historical financial statements and concluded that
it was required to restate its financial statements for all
periods affected by the matters. As a result, the Company
restated its Consolidated Financial Statements for the year
ended December31, 2003, the principal effect of which was
to increase net income from continuing operations by$349. The impact of these matters on the Companys
Consolidated Financial Statements for the years prior to
December31, 2001 is reflected in the Consolidated
Statement of Shareholders Equity as a reduction to
retained earnings of $1,638 as of December31, 2001.   
Fixed Asset Accounting In connection with its 2004 year end closing
process, the Company discovered that a consolidating entry to
properly state property and equipment on the balance sheet at
December31, 2003 was classified as accumulated other
comprehensive income in error. The classification of the amount
$723 has been corrected and has the effect of increasing
property and equipment and reducing accumulated other 40 Table of Contents COVANSYS CORPORATION AND
SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTSContinued Dollars in thousands, except per share
data comprehensive loss by $723 as of
December31, 2003. The correction had no impact on income
from continuing operations or net income. The following schedule reconciles net income
loss available for common shareholders for 2003 and 2002, as
previously reported, to the corresponding amounts on a restated
basis, after giving effect to the adjustments described above.

Recapitalization On April27, 2004, the Company announced
that it had entered into a long-term Master Services Agreement
and a Stock Purchase Agreement with Fidelity Information
Services FIS, Inc., a subsidiary of Fidelity
National Financial, Inc. The Master Services Agreement is
expected to generate an anticipated $150,000 in revenues to the
Company over the next five years. Under the Stock Purchase Agreement, as amended,
with FIS and approved by shareholders on September15,
2004, the Company issued to FIS 8,700,000shares of the
Companys common stock and warrants for $95,700. The four
tranches of warrants, each for 1,000,000shares of the
Companys common stock, have a strike price between $15 and
$24 per share. FIS also acquired 2,300,000shares of the
Companys common stock from Rajendra Vattikuti, founder and
Chief Executive Officer of the Company. In order to facilitate the transactions with FIS,
the Company also entered into a Recapitalization Agreement, as
amended, with a wholly-owned subsidiary of a private equity
investment fund managed by Clayton, Dubilier Rice, Inc.
the CDR Stockholder to restructure the CDR
Stockholders ownership interest in the Company and certain
corresponding governance rights, in exchange for a combination
of cash, stock, notes and warrants. The CDR Stockholder owned
200,000 shares of the Companys SeriesA Voting
Convertible Preferred Stock, or approximately
8,695,000shares of common stock on an as converted basis,
and 5,300,000common stock warrants with a strike price
ranging from $25 to $31 per share. Under the terms of the Recapitalization Agreement
approved by shareholders on September15, 2004 the CDR
Stockholder exchanged all of its existing holdings in the
Company for consideration valued at $227,700 consisting of
$177,500of cash, 2,000,000shares of common stock of
the Company, subordinated notes in the total amount of $17,500
due December31, 2005, which bears interest at LIBOR plus
220%, and five-year warrants for 5,000,000shares of
common stock with a strike price of $18per share. In
accordance with EITF D-42, as amended by EITF 00-27, the Company
recorded a reduction to income available to common shareholders
of $28,674. The Company financed the transaction with the CDR
Stockholder with cash on hand as well as proceeds from the FIS
investment.

Fixed Price Contracts The Company realized approximately 405% of its
revenue during the year ended December31, 2004, from fixed
price contracts percentage of completion as well as fixed price
IT outsourcing and maintenance. Approximately 128% of our
revenue during the year ended December31, 2004 was
realized from fixed price contracts with respect to which we
recognize revenue on a percentage of completion basis. These
contracts expose the Company to collection risk on both billed
and unbilled receivables in the event that contract milestones
are not met or the client does not accept the product as
delivered. In addition, the Company could incur unanticipated
losses if it is necessary to increase its estimated cost to
complete. 45 Table of Contents COVANSYS CORPORATION AND
SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTSContinued Dollars in thousands, except per share
data The Companys 2004 financial results were
negatively impacted by approximately $11,192 due to four
significant fixed price contracts which it considers to be
challenged. Communications with contracting parties during
2004 caused management to re-assess the collectibility of billed
and unbilled receivables for two troubled projects. In both
cases, the Company has been informed that its services would no
longer be required to complete the project prior to its
implementation. As of December31, 2004, the Company is not
performing work on either of these contracts. As a result, the
Company reduced the related receivables by $5,500 and $350 to
their net realizable value in the first quarter and third
quarter of 2004, respectively. In accordance with the
application of percentage of completion accounting, the Company
reflected the changes as a contract price adjustment, and
accordingly, as a reduction in revenue. In the fourth quarter of
2004, the Company reached a settlement with one of these
customers, resulting in the recovery of $350 of the previously
written-off receivable. This recovery was reflected as revenue
in the fourth quarter. The Company also determined it was necessary to
increase its estimated cost to complete for three of these
projects due to changes in 2004 in both scope and resource
requirements. The revision in estimates had the effect of
reducing gross margin by $5,700 in 2004. At December31, 2004, the Company has $4,000
in billed and unbilled receivables related to a challenged
contract for which the Company is still performing services and
which management believes are collectible.   
6.
Common Stock Repurchase Program The Companys board of directors has

253,100shares, 557,200shares and
1,124,376shares for cash, at a total cost of $2,408 1,485 and $6,583, respectively. Through December31, 2004,
the Company has repurchased 11,434,976shares of its common
stock for cash, at a total cost of $141,980. As of
December31, 2004, 2,565,024shares remain available
for repurchase under the board of directors authorization at
prices not to exceed $12per share. The Company has entered
into a Credit Agreement which restricts the Companys

The Company tested for impairment of its
reporting units by comparing estimated fair value to carrying
value. Fair value was determined using a discounted cash flow
methodology. The Company performed this analysis as part of its
annual assessment as of December31, 2004 and 2003. These
evaluations indicated that goodwill was not impaired.

Realization of deferred tax assets associated
with the Companys future deductible temporary differences
and net operating loss carryforwards is dependent upon
generating sufficient taxable income prior to their expiration.
Although realization of the deferred tax assets is not assured,
management believes it is more likely than not that the net
deferred tax assets will be realized through future taxable
income. The Company utilized domestic net operating loss
carryforwards during 2004 and 2003. The effective tax rate was
204% for the full year 2004. On a quarterly basis, management
assesses whether it remains more likely than not that the net
deferred tax assets will be realized. The valuation allowance
recorded relates to state net operating losses that begin to
expire in 2005. During 2004, the Company reversed $2,236 of
valuation reserves related to federal net operating losses that
were deemed to be no longer required based on managements
estimates of future profitability of the Company. The Company has six business units four in 2003
in India which are entitled to a tax holiday for 10 consecutive
years commencing with the year the business unit started
producing computer software or until the Indian tax year ending
March31, 2009, whichever is earlier. Once the tax holiday
period has expired, these business units are eligible to deduct
a portion of the profits attributable to export activities. The
deduction for export activities was 30% and expired during the
Indian tax year ended March31, 2004. The remaining business units are subject to the
tax holiday for various periods ranging from March31, 2005
through March31, 2009 and will not be able to avail
themselves of the deduction for export activities. As the tax
holiday expires, the Companys overall effective tax rate
will be negatively impacted. The tax benefit for this tax
holiday was approximately $3,384 for the year ended
December31, 2004. The Company had available U.S. Federal net
operating loss carryforwards of approximately$9,118 as of
December31, 2004. The majority of the net operating loss
carryforward was acquired in an acquisition and its utilization
is limited to $688per year. This net operating loss
carryforward will expire in 2017. 18.Segment
Information The Company is a provider of IT services, and is
organized geographically throughout North America, India and
Asia, and other international locations. The chief operating
decision-maker evaluates each locations 54 Table of Contents COVANSYS CORPORATION AND
SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTSContinued Dollars in thousands, except per share
data performance based primarily on its revenue and
income loss from operations due to the similarity of the
nature of services provided to clients. Revenue for the India/
Asia operation is evaluated based on the full attribution of
bill rates charged to the end customer. The segment revenue
figures disclosed below are stated at full attribution. Full
attribution revenue is calculated using the end customer invoice
rate on intersegment engagements, as opposed to using the
transfer price rate. Geographic revenue is presented using the
transfer price rate. The chief operating decision-maker does not
evaluate segment performance based on assets. Assets, including
the related depreciation and amortization expense, are managed
primarily by corporate management. Under this organization, the
operating segments have been aggregated into the following four
operating segments and other.   
Public Sector includes all services provided to
domestic state and local municipalities.
Commercial includes all North American services
provided to non public sector customers. Commercial includes
application services for maintenance and development outsourcing
AMD/O, retail, healthcare, distribution, manufacturing,
financial services, telecommunications, utilities, e-business,
packaged software implementation and other services. Commercial
also includes telecommunication services provided in Europe.
India/Asia includes all services performed in
India or Asia.
Europe includes services performed in Europe.
Telecommunication services performed in Europe are excluded from
the Europe figures as such services are included in the
Commercial segment.
Other consists primarily of the labor and
supporting expenses for the Corporate functions, depreciation
and amortization expenses, lease expenses for corporate
headquarters and costs attributable to closed and overlapping
cost centers in 2002. See realignment discussion below.
The accounting policies of the operating segments
are the same as those described in the summary of significant
accounting policies in Note1. The organizational realignment initiated during
the second quarter 2003 substantially modified the
companys reporting structure and requires the migration
from the traditional single segment reporting presentation to a
multi-segment presentation. This modified reporting format
presents revenue of each segment on a full attribution basis,
whereby the end customer invoice rate is presented, with
inter-segment eliminations separately identified. This
presentation reflects the importance and critical relationship
whereby India/ Asia supports, primarily, the U.S. Commercial and
Public Sector segments with services. The segment operating
results at the income from operations level utilizes the
companys transfer pricing methodology and thereby
attributes a majority of the margin to the segments where the
end customers are located. Thus the profitability of Commercial
and Public Sector is enhanced while the profitability of
India/Asia is directly reduced. India/Asia: India/Asia supplies substantial
resources to North American and European customers. The rate
charged by India to U.S. and Europe has been developed utilizing
a cost plus transfer pricing methodology. This results in a
large component of the available gross profit accruing to North
America or Europe where the end customer is located. 55 Table of Contents COVANSYS CORPORATION AND

19.Commitments,
Contingencies and Potential Liability to Clients We are, from time to time, involved in litigation
and various legal matters that arise in the ordinary course of
business. We do not believe that the ultimate resolution of
these matters will have a material adverse effect on our
financial condition, results of operations, or cashflows. We
believe the legal allegations levied against us are without
merit and intend to defend these matters vigorously. We have certain contracts with our state and
local clients that require us to provide a surety bond as a
guarantee of performance. As of December31, 2004, we had
12 performance bonds outstanding and posted with clients, with
an aggregate total value of approximately $37,604 to secure
performance of contractual obligations with our clients. Eleven
of these performance bonds are secured by letters of credit
totaling $7,808. In general, we would only be liable for the
amount of these guarantees in the event of default in the
performance of our obligations under each contract, the
probability of which we believe is remote. We believe that we
have sufficient capacity in the surety markets and liquidity
from our cash flow and revolving credit facility to meet ongoing
business needs and to respond to future requests for proposals
from state and local governments. 20.Restructuring,
Merger and Other Related Charges In April 2003, the Company announced it would
realign the organization. The realignment which is complete,
aligned sales, subject matter expertise and delivery and
provided a strong foundation for the future growth and
profitability for the Company. As part of the realignment, the
Company reduced headcount in the second quarter of 2003 by over
200 net positions in North America or approximately 85% of
domestic headcount. The reduction in headcount was split with
over 80% of the eliminated positions billable and 57 Table of Contents COVANSYS CORPORATION AND
SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL

data delivery employees coming from costs of revenue
with the remaining coming from selling, general and
administrative. During 2004, the Company recorded $1,696 of lease
termination costs and $1,252 related to severance. Amounts
related to lease terminations will be paid out through 2011.
Amounts related to severance will be paid through 2005. During 2003, the Company recorded costs of
$4,208, split $1,834 included in cost of revenue and $2,374
included in selling, general and administrative expenses,
related to various headcount reductions, including the
reductions implemented during the second quarter as discussed
above, and termination of lease obligations associated with the
consolidation of facilities. During 2002, the Company recorded restructuring
and other costs of $1,354 related to the termination of 30
employees, including employees from executive management and
certain business units. The following is a roll forward of the accrual

Net In August, 2003, the Company was notified that
the Board of Directors and majority shareholders of one of the
Companys investments carried at cost had agreed to merge
with another entity. The merger consummated in August, 2003 and
the Company recognized a loss of approximately $680 which is
included in other income, net. 22.Subsequent
Event During the fourth quarter of 2004, the Company
continued to perform services for one of its significant
customers after it had reached the authorized spending limit on
a time and material contract. While the Company believed it
would be paid for these services, management concluded that it
did not have a legally enforceable contractual right to the
revenue as of December31, 2004. As a result, in accordance
with the Companys revenue recognition policies, and Staff
Accounting Bulletin104, the Company recognized the costs
of providing the services, but did not recognize any revenue for
these services in 2004. Gross profit in the Commercial segment
was negatively impacted in the fourth quarter by approximately
$3,500. In 2005, the 58 Table of Contents COVANSYS CORPORATION AND
SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTSContinued Dollars in thousands, except per share

services and will recognize the revenue in the first quarter of
