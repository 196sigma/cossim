of cash flows present fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated
financial position of US Oncology, Inc. and its subsidiaries at December 31,
2002 and 2001, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for the
three years ended December 31, 2002 in conformity with accounting principles
generally accepted in the United States of America. These financial statements
are the responsibility of the Company management. Our responsibility is to
express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audits. We
conducted our audits of these statements in accordance with auditing standards
generally accepted in the United States of America, which require that we plan
and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial
statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a
test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial
statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates
made by management, and evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.
We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

NOTE 1 - ORGANIZATION AND SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
US Oncology, Inc. together with its subsidiaries, US Oncology or the
Company provides comprehensive services in the oncology field, with the
mission of expanding access to and improving the quality of cancer care in local
communities and advancing the delivery of care. The Company offers the following
services.  Oncology Pharmaceutical Services. We purchase and manage specialty
oncology pharmaceuticals for our affiliated practices. Annually, we
are responsible for purchasing, delivering and managing more than $800
million of pharmaceuticals through a network of more than 400
admixture sites, 39 licensed pharmacies, 116 pharmacists and 219
pharmacy technicians.  Cancer Center Services. We develop and manage comprehensive,
community-based cancer centers, which integrate all aspects of
outpatient cancer care, from laboratory and radiology diagnostic
capabilities to chemotherapy and radiation therapy. As of December 31,
2002, we had developed and operated 79 integrated community-based
cancer centers and manage over one million square feet of medical
office space. We also had installed and managed 16 Positron Emission
Tomography PET units.  Cancer Research Services. We facilitate a broad range of cancer
research and development activities through our network. We contract
with pharmaceutical and biotechnology firms to provide a comprehensive
range of services relating to clinical trials. We currently manage
approximately 102 clinical trials, supported by our network of
approximately 500 participating physicians in more than 170 research
locations. During 2002, we enrolled over 3,200 new patients in
research studies.  Other Practice Management Services. Under our physician practice
management arrangements, we act as the exclusive manager and
administrator of all day-to-day non-medical business functions
connected with our affiliated practices. As such, we are responsible
for billing and collecting for medical oncology services, physician
recruiting, data management, accounting, systems, and capital
allocation to facilitate growth in practice operations.
The Company provides these services to oncology practices comprising over 450
sites, with over 4,800 employees and over 875 physicians. The Company is not a
provider of medical services but provides comprehensive services to oncology
practices, including management and capital resources, data management,
accounting, compliance and other administrative services. The affiliated
practices offer comprehensive and coordinated medical services to cancer
patients, integrating the specialties of medical and gynecologic oncology,
hematology, radiation oncology, diagnostic radiology, and blood and marrow stem
cell transplantation.
The following is a summary of the Company significant accounting policies Principles of consolidation
The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and
its wholly owned subsidiaries. All intercompany transactions and balances have
been eliminated. The Company has determined that none of its existing service
agreements meets requirements for consolidation under generally accepted
accounting principles.
Use of estimates
The preparation of the Company financial statements in conformity with
accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America
requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported
amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, as well as disclosures of
contingent assets and liabilities. Management considers many factors in
selecting appropriate operational and financial accounting policies and
controls, and in developing the estimates and assumptions that are used in the
preparation of these financial statements. Management must apply significant
judgment in this process. Among the factors, but not fully inclusive of all
factors, that may be considered by management in these processes are: the range
of accounting policies permitted by U.S. generally accepted accounting
principles; management understanding of the Company business, expected rates
of business and operational change, sensitivity and volatility associated with
the

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - CONTINUED
in thousands, except per share amounts
assumptions used in developing estimates, and whether historical trends are
expected to be representative of future trends. The estimation process often may
yield a range of potentially reasonable estimates of the ultimate future
outcomes and management must select an amount that lies within that range of
reasonable estimates - which may result in the selection of estimates which
could be viewed as conservative or aggressive - based upon the quantity, quality
and risks associated with the variability that might be expected from the future
outcome and the factors considered in developing the estimate. Because of
inherent uncertainties in this process, actual future amounts will differ from
those estimated amounts used in the preparation of the financial statements.
Service fee revenue
The Company recognizes service fees from its service agreements as revenue when
the fees are earned and are deemed realizable based upon the contractually
agreed amount of such fees, after taking into consideration the payment priority
of amounts retained by practices.
Approximately 66% of the Company 2002 net operating revenue has been derived
from practices under the earnings model, as of December 31, 2002. Under the
earnings model service agreements the Company receives a service fee that
includes an amount equal to the direct expenses associated with operating the
practice plus an amount which is calculated based on the service agreement for
each of the practices. The direct expenses include rent, depreciation,
amortization, provision for uncollectible accounts, pharmaceutical expenses,
medical supply expenses, salaries and benefits of non-physician employees who
support the practices and interest. The direct expenses do not include salaries
and benefits of physicians. The non-expense-reimbursement related portion of the
service fee is a percentage, ranging from 25% to 35%, of the earnings and taxes
of the affiliated practice. The earnings of an affiliated practice are
determined by subtracting the direct expenses from the professional revenues and
research revenues earned by the affiliated practice.
Approximately 31% of the Company 2002 net operating revenue has been derived
from practices under the net revenue model, as of December 31, 2002. Under the
net revenue model service agreements the Company receives a service fee, which
typically includes all practice costs other than amounts retained by the
physicians, a fixed fee, a percentage fee in most states and, if certain
financial and performance criteria are satisfied, a performance fee. These
service agreements permit the affiliated practice to retain a specified amount
typically 23% of the practice net revenues for physician salaries of the
affiliated practices. Payment of such salaries is given priority over payment of
the service fee. The amount of the fixed fee is related to the size of the
affiliation transaction and, as a result, varies significantly among the service
agreements. The percentage fee, where permitted by applicable law, is generally
seven percent of the affiliated practice net revenue. Performance fees are paid
after payment of all practice expenses, amounts retained by practices and the
other service fees and, where permitted by state law, are approximately 50% of
the residual profits of the practice. Service fees are not subject to
adjustment, with the exception that the fixed fee may be adjusted from time to
time after the fifth year of the service agreement to reflect inflationary
trends. The affiliated practice is also entitled to retain all profits of the
practice after payment of the service fee to the Company.
The Company recognizes revenue from pharmaceutical management service line
agreements based upon the cost of pharmaceuticals purchased by the associated
practice plus a mark-up fee. Such amounts are recorded gross in other revenue
and the related costs are included in pharmaceutical and supplies expense. These
revenues are recognized upon the delivery of goods and services authorized by
the associated practices.
The remaining service agreements provide for a fee that is a percentage of
revenue or of earnings of the affiliated practice or is a predetermined, fixed
amount. Each affiliated practice is responsible for paying the salaries and
benefits of its physician employees from the amount retained by the affiliated
practice after payment of the Company service fee.
The Company recognizes revenues from cancer research services when the fees are
earned and deemed realizable based upon the contractually agreed amount of such
fees.
Cash equivalents

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - CONTINUED
in thousands, except per share amounts
The Company considers all highly liquid debt securities with original maturities
of three months or less to be cash equivalents. As of December 31, 2002 and
2001, the Company held no debt securities.
Accounts receivable
To the extent permitted by applicable law, the Company purchases the accounts
receivable generated by affiliated practices from patient services rendered
pursuant to the service agreements. The accounts receivable are purchased at
their net collectible value, after adjustment for contractual allowances and
allowances for doubtful accounts. The Company is reimbursed by the practices for
purchased receivables that are deemed uncollectible following the Company
purchase. If any purchased accounts receivable are subsequently deemed
uncollectible, then the practice responsible for the receivables would reduce
its revenue during the period in which the uncollectible amount is determined.
Because the Company service fee is based in part on the practice revenue, the
reduction in revenue caused by the uncollectible accounts receivable would
reduce the Company future service fee. The impact of such adjustments is
typically not significant. However, laws and regulations governing Medicare and
Medicaid programs are complex and subject to interpretation, which along with
other third party payor actions, could impact the collection of accounts
receivable in the future.
The process of estimating the ultimate collectibility of accounts receivable
arising from the provision of medical services to patients by affiliated
practices is highly subjective and requires the application of judgment by
management. Management considers many factors, including contractual
reimbursement rates, changing reimbursement rules, the nature of payors, scope
of services, age of receivables, historical cash collection experience, billing
practices and other factors to form their best judgment of expected
collectibility. Actual results often times vary from estimates, but generally do
not vary materially.
The Company accounts receivable are a function of net patient revenue of the
affiliated practices rather than the Company revenue. Receivables from the
Medicare and state Medicaid programs are considered to have minimal credit risk,
and no other payor comprised more than 10% of accounts receivable at December
31, 2002.
Other receivables
Other receivables consist of amounts due for services provided under the
Company pharmaceutical management and cancer research activities and are
stated at their estimated net realizable value.
Prepaids and other current assets
Prepaids and other current assets consist of prepayments, insurance and certain
other receivables.
Inventories
Inventories consist of pharmaceutical drugs and are stated at the lower cost or
market, with cost determined by the purchase price. Inventory quantities at
December 31, 2002 were determined from physical counts or from the Company
perpetual inventory records.
Due from and to affiliates
The Company has advanced to certain of its practices amounts needed for working
capital purposes -- primarily to purchase pharmaceuticals, assist with the
development of new markets, to support the addition of physicians, and support
the development of new services. Certain advances bear interest at a market rate
negotiated by the Company and the affiliated practices, which approximates the
prime-lending rate 425% at December 31, 2002. These advances are unsecured
and are repaid in accordance with the terms of the instrument evidencing the
advance. Amounts payable to related parties represent transfers due to
affiliated practices for amounts to be retained by physician groups under
service agreements.
Amounts due from affiliates are reviewed when events or changes in circumstances
indicate their recorded amount may not be recoverable. If the review indicates
that the anticipated recoverable amount is less than the carrying value, the
Company carrying value of the asset will be reduced accordingly Note 11.

Property and equipment
Property and equipment is stated at cost. Depreciation of property and equipment
is provided using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of
three to ten years for computers and software, equipment, and furniture and
fixtures, the lesser of ten years or the remaining lease term for leasehold
improvements and twenty-five years for buildings. Interest costs incurred during
the construction of major capital additions, primarily cancer centers, are
capitalized. These lives reflect management best estimate of the respective
assets' useful lives and subsequent changes in operating plans or technology
could result in future impairment charges to these assets.
The carrying value of the fixed assets is reviewed for impairment when events or
changes in circumstances indicate their recorded cost may not be recoverable. If
the review indicates that the undiscounted cash flows from operations of the
related fixed assets over the remaining useful life is expected to be less than
the recorded amount of the assets, the Company carrying value of the asset
will be reduced to its estimated fair value using expected cash flows on a
discounted basis Note 11. Impairment analysis is subjective and assumptions
regarding future growth rates and operating expense levels as a percentage of
revenue can have significant effects on the expected future cash flows and
ultimate impairment analysis.
Service agreements
Service agreements consist of the costs of purchasing the rights to manage
practices. Under the initial 40-year terms of the agreements, the affiliated
practices have agreed to provide medical services on an exclusive basis only
through facilities managed by the Company. The agreements are noncancelable
except for performance defaults. The Company amortizes these costs over 25
years. The Company recorded amortization expense related to these assets of
$171 million, $202 million and $289 million, for the years ended December 31,
2002, 2001, and 2000, respectively. The future expected amortization expense
related to the Company service agreements are approximately $107 million for
each of the five years ending December 31, 2007. Should these agreements be
terminated prior to their full amortization, the Company may experience a charge
to its operating results for the unamortized portion of the asset. Under the
service agreements, the Company is the exclusive provider of certain services to
its affiliated practices, providing facilities, management information systems,
clinical research services, personnel management and strategic, financial and
administrative services. Specifically, the Company, among other things, i
develops, constructs and manages free standing cancer centers which provide for
treatment areas and equipment for medical oncology, radiation therapy and
diagnostic radiology, ii expands diagnostic capabilities of practices through
installation and management of PET technology, iii coordinates and manages
cancer drug research for pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, iv
purchases and manages the inventory for cancer related drugs for affiliated
practices, and v provides management and capital resources to affiliated
practices including data management, accounting, compliance and other
administrative services.
Each service agreement provides for the formation of a policy board. The policy
board meets periodically, approves those items having a significant impact on
the affiliated practice and develops the practice strategic initiatives. The
two most significant items reviewed and approved by the policy board are the
annual budget for the practice and the addition of facilities, services or
physicians in conjunction with review of practice financial performance. Each
service agreement provides a mechanism to adjust the Company service fee if a
change in law modifies the underlying financial arrangement between the Company
and the affiliated practice.
The carrying value of the service agreements is reviewed for impairment when
events or changes in circumstances indicate their recorded cost may not be
recoverable. If the review indicates that the undiscounted cash flows from
operations of the related service agreement over the remaining contractual
period is expected to be less than the recorded amount of the service agreement
intangible asset, the Company carrying value of the service agreement
intangible asset will be reduced to its estimated fair value. Fair values are
calculated using the Company expected cash flows on a discounted basis Note
11. Impairment analysis is subjective and assumptions regarding future growth
rates and operating expense levels as a percentage of revenue can have
significant effects on the expected future cash flows and ultimate impairment
analysis.

Other assets
Other assets consist of costs associated with obtaining debt financing, costs
associated with entering into non-compete agreements with affiliated physicians,
goodwill, and investments in joint ventures. The debt financing costs are
capitalized and amortized over the terms of the related debt agreements. The
Company recorded amortization expense related to these assets of $18 million 12 million and $14 million for the years ended December 31, 2002, 2001 and
2000, respectively. The amounts recorded for non-compete agreements are being
amortized on a straight-line basis over the term of the respective contract.
Prior to 2002, goodwill was amortized on a straight-line basis over 20 years.
Upon adoption of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 142, Goodwill
and Other Intangible Assets FAS 142, in January 2002, the Company ceased
amortization of these assets. For further discussion, see New Accounting
Pronouncements. Investments in joint ventures for which the Company does not
have control would be accounted for under the equity method of accounting. For
2002, 2001 and 2000, operational activity relating to joint ventures was not
material to the operations of the Company.
Income taxes
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the temporary
differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and the tax bases
of assets and liabilities using the enacted tax rates in effect in the years in
which the differences are expected to reverse. In estimating future tax
consequences, all expected future events are considered other than enactments of
changes in the tax law or rates.
Stock-based compensation
At December 31, 2002, the Company has eight stock-based employee compensation
plans, which are described more fully in Note 10. The Company accounts for those
plans under the recognition and measurement principles of Accounting Principles
Board Opinion No. 25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees, and related
Interpretations. Stock based employee compensation costs for options granted
under those plans with exercise prices less than the market value of the
underlying Common Stock on the date of the grant are insignificant for the three
years ended December 31, 2002, 2001 and 2000.
The Company also provides a benefit plan to non-employee affiliates which is
accounted for using fair value based accounting with compensation expense being
recognized over the respective vesting period. The Company recognized $14
million, $20 million and $16 million in compensation cost during the years
ended December 31, 2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively.

The Company receivables, payables, prepaids and accrued liabilities are
current and on normal terms and, accordingly, the recorded values are believed
by management to approximate fair value. Management also believes that
subordinated notes issued to affiliated physicians approximate fair value when
current interest rates for similar debt securities are applied. Management
estimates the fair value of its bank indebtedness approximates its book value.
Earnings per share
The Company discloses basic and diluted earnings per share EPS. The
computation of basic earnings per share is based on a weighted average number of
Common Stock and Common Stock to be issued shares outstanding during these
periods. The Company includes Common Stock to be issued in both basic and
diluted EPS, as there are no foreseeable circumstances which would relieve the
Company of its obligation to issue these shares. The computation of diluted
earnings per share is based on the weighted average number of Common Stock and
Common Stock to be issued shares outstanding during the periods as well as
dilutive stock options calculated under the treasury stock method.

New Accounting Pronouncements
In June 2001, the FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No.
141, Business Combinations FAS 141, which requires that all business
combinations be accounted for using the purchase method. In addition, FAS 141
requires that intangible assets be recognized as assets apart from goodwill if
certain criteria are met. The Company adoption of FAS 141 has not had a
material effect on the Company financial position or operating results.
In June 2001, the FASB issued FAS 142, which established standards for reporting
acquired goodwill and other intangible assets. FAS 142 accounts for goodwill
based on the reporting units of the combined entity into which an acquired
entity is integrated. In accordance with the statement, goodwill and indefinite
lived intangible assets will not be amortized, goodwill will be tested for
impairment at least annually at the reporting unit level, intangible assets
deemed to have an indefinite life will be tested for impairment at least
annually, and the amortization period of intangible assets with finite lives
will not be limited to forty years. Goodwill amortization expense for 2001 and
2000 was $05 million and $07 million, respectively. The Company implemented
FAS 142 in 2002 and ceased

amortization of goodwill from acquisitions of businesses under the purchase
method of accounting. Implementation of FAS 142 does not result in the
elimination of amortization for the Company service agreement intangible
assets because such assets are excluded from the scope of this statement.
In June 2001, the FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No.
143, Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations FAS 143, which addresses
accounting and reporting for obligations associated with the retirement of
tangible long-lived assets and the associated asset retirement costs. FAS 143 is
effective for fiscal years beginning after June 15, 2002. Implementation of this
new standard did not impact the Company.
In August 2001, the FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No.
144, Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets FAS 144, which was
effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2001 and was implemented
by the Company on January 1, 2002. The provisions of FAS 144 provide accounting
models for impairment of long-lived assets and discontinued operations. The
Company adoption of FAS 144 has not had a material effect on the Company
financial position or operating results.
In April 2002, the FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No.
145, Rescission of FASB Statements Nos. 4, 44 and 64, Amendment of FASB
Statement No. 13 and Technical Corrections FAS 145. SFAS 145 rescinds SFAS 4,
Reporting Gains and Losses from Extinguishment of Debt. By rescinding FASB
Statement No. 4, gains or losses from extinguishment of debt that do not meet
the criteria of APB No. 30 should no longer be reported as an extraordinary item
and should be reclassified to income from continuing operations in all periods
presented. APB No. 30 states that extraordinary items are events and
transactions that are distinguished by their unusual nature and by the
infrequency of their occurrence. FAS 145 is effective for all fiscal years
beginning after May 15, 2002, including all prior year presentations. The
Company expects to implement FAS 145 in the first quarter of 2003, at which time
income from operations will be restated to classify the extraordinary loss on
the early extinguishment of debt to be included within income loss from
continuing operations.
In June 2002, the FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No.
146, Accounting for Costs Associated with Exit or Disposal Activities FAS

associated with exit or disposal activities and rescinds Emerging Issues Task
Force EITF Issue No. 94-3, Liability Recognition for Certain Employee
Termination Benefits and Other Costs to Exit an Activity including Certain
Costs Incurred in a Restructuring by requiring that a liability for a cost
associated with an exit or disposal activity be recognized when the liability is
incurred. Under EITF Issue 94-3, a liability for an exit cost as defined in EITF
Issue 94-3 was recognized at the date of an entity commitment to an exit plan.
The provisions of this Statement are effective for exit or disposal activities
that are initiated after December 31, 2002. Management does not expect the
adoption of SFAS 146 to have a material impact on its financial conditions or
results of operations.
In November 2002, the FASB issued Interpretation No. 45 FIN 45, Guarantor
Accounting and Disclosure Requirements for Guarantees, including Indirect
Guarantees of Indebtedness of Others. The interpretation requires disclosure
about the nature and terms of obligations under certain guarantees that the
Company has issued. The interpretation also clarifies that a guarantor is
required to recognize, at inception of a guarantee, a liability for the fair
value of the obligation undertaken in issuing a guarantee. The initial
recognition and initial measurement provisions are applicable on a prospective
basis to guarantees issued or modified after December 31, 2002. The disclosure
requirements in this interpretation are effective immediately. The Company does
not expect to be impacted by the issuance of FIN 45.
In December 2002, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Statement of
Financial Accounting Standards No. 148, Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation
and Disclosure - an amendment of FASB Statement No. 123 FAS 148. This
statement amends FASB Statement No. 123, Accounting for Stock-Based
Compensation, to provide alternative transition methods for a voluntary change
to fair value accounting for stock-based employee compensation. In addition,
this Statement amends the disclosure requirements of FAS 123 to require more
prominent disclosures in both annual and interim financial statements about the
method of accounting for stock-based employee compensation and the effect of the
method used on reported results. Management does not expect to adopt fair value
accounting for stock-based employee compensation.

applies to an entity in which either 1 the equity investors do not have a
controlling financial interest or 2 the equity investment at risk is
insufficient to finance that entity activities without receiving additional

for all contracts created or modified after the date the Statement is issued
and otherwise effective at the beginning of the first interim period beginning
after June 15, 2003. Management does not expect the adoption of SFAS 149 to
have a material impact on its financial conditions or results of operations.
NOTE 2 - REVENUE
The Company provides the following services to physician practices: oncology
pharmaceutical services, cancer center services, cancer research services, and
other practice management services. The Company currently earns revenue from
physician practices under two models, the physician practice management PPM
model, and the service line model. Under the PPM model, the Company enters into
long term agreements with affiliated practices to provide comprehensive
services, including all those described above, and the practices pay the
Company a service fee and reimburse all expenses. Under the service line model,
the first three services described above are offered by the Company under
separate agreements for each service line.
Net operating revenue includes two components - net patient revenue and the
Company other revenue. Net patient revenue. The Company reports net patient revenue for
those business lines under which the Company revenue is derived
from payments for medical services to patients and the Company is
responsible for billing those patients. Currently, net patient
revenue consists of patient revenue of affiliated practices under
the PPM model. Net patient revenue also will include revenues of
practices that enter into agreements under the cancer center
services service line. Other revenue. Other revenue is revenue derived from sources other
than services provided to patients by affiliated practices. Other
revenue includes revenue from pharmaceutical research, informational
services and activities as a group purchasing organization. Other
revenue also includes revenues from pharmaceutical services rendered
by the Company under its oncology pharmaceutical management service
line agreements.
Net patient revenue is recorded when services are rendered to patients based on
established or negotiated charges reduced by contractual adjustments and
allowances for doubtful accounts. Differences between estimated contractual
adjustments and final settlements are reported in the period when final
settlements are determined.
Under the Company PPM service agreements, amounts retained by the affiliated
physician groups for physician compensation are primarily derived under two
models. Under the first model the net revenue model, amounts retained by
physician groups are based upon a specified amount typically 23% of net
revenue and, if certain financial criteria are satisfied, an incremental
performance-based amount. Under the second model the earnings model, amounts
retained by practices are based upon a percentage typically 65% - 75% of the
difference between net patient revenues less direct expenses, excluding
interest expense and taxes.
The Company revenue is equal to net operating revenue minus amounts retained
by the practices under the Company PPM service agreements.
The following presents the amounts included in the determination of the
Company revenues                    63                 US ONCOLOGY, INC.

For the years ended December 31, 2002, 2001 and 2000, the affiliated practices
derived approximately 43%, 40% and 37%, respectively, of their net patient
revenue from services provided under the Medicare and state Medicaid programs.
Capitation revenues were less than 1% of total net patient revenue in 2002,
2001 and 2000. Changes in the payor reimbursement rates, particularly Medicare
and Medicaid due to its concentration, or affiliated practices' payor mix can
materially and adversely affect the Company revenues.

Operating margin is computed by dividing the earnings component of the service
fee by the total service fee.

Credit Facility
From June 1999 until February 2002, the Company utilized a $175 million
syndicated revolving credit facility for working capital and other corporate
purposes expiring in June 2004.
On February 1, 2002, the Company terminated its $175 million revolving facility
and entered into a new $100 million five-year revolving credit facility New
Credit Facility, which expires in February 2007. Proceeds from loans under the
New Credit Facility may be used to finance development of cancer centers and
new positron emission tomography PET facilities, to provide working capital
or for other general business uses. Costs incurred in connection with the
extinguishment of the Company previous credit facility were expensed during
the first quarter of 2002 and recorded as an extraordinary loss in the
Company condensed consolidated statement of operations and comprehensive
income. Costs incurred in connection with establishing the New Credit Facility
are being capitalized and amortized over the term of the New Credit Facility.
Borrowings under the New Credit Facility are secured by substantially all of
the Company assets. At the Company option, funds may be borrowed at the
base interest rate or the London Interbank Offered Rate LIBOR, plus an amount
determined under a defined formula. The base rate is selected by First Union
National Bank First Union and is defined as its prime rate or Federal Funds
Rate plus 1/2%. No amounts were borrowed or outstanding under the New Credit
Facility during 2002 and 2001.
Senior Secured Notes
In November 1999, the Company issued $100 million in senior secured notes
Senior Secured Notes to a group of institutional investors. The notes bore
interest at 842%, matured in equal annual installments of $20 million from
2002 through 2006 and ranked equally in right of payment with all current and
future senior indebtedness of the Company. The Senior Secured Notes contained
restrictive financial and operational covenants and were secured by the same
collateral as the Company previous credit facility.
The Senior Secured Notes were repaid in full on February 1, 2002 with the
proceeds of the Company Senior Subordinated Notes.
Senior Subordinated Notes
On February 1, 2002, the Company issued $175 million in 9625% senior
subordinated notes Senior Subordinated Notes to various institutional
investors in a private offering pursuant to Rule 144A. The notes were
subsequently exchanged for substantially identical notes in an offering
registered under the Securities Act of 1933. The notes are

Payments under the Senior Subordinated Notes are subordinated, in substantially
all respects, to the Company New Credit Facility and other Senior
Indebtedness, as defined in the indenture governing the Senior Subordinated
Notes.
Proceeds from the Senior Subordinated Notes were used to pay off the $100
million in borrowings under the existing Senior Secured Notes, an $117 million
prepayment penalty on the early termination of the Senior Secured Notes and
facility fees and related expenses associated with establishing the Senior
Subordinated Notes and New Credit Facility of $48 million and $27 million,
respectively. Costs incurred in connection with extinguishment of the Company
previous Senior Secured Notes, including the prepayment penalty were expensed in
the first quarter of 2002 and reflected as an extraordinary loss in the
Company condensed consolidated statement of operations and comprehensive
income. Costs incurred in connection with establishing the Senior Subordinated
Notes, including facility fees, were capitalized, and are being amortized over
the term of those notes.
Leasing Facility
The Company entered into a synthetic leasing facility in December 1997, under
which a special purpose entity has constructed and owns certain of the Company
cancer centers and leases them to the Company. The facility was funded by a
syndicate of financial institutions and is secured by the property to which it
relates and matures in June 2004.
As of December 31, 2002, the Company had $720 million outstanding under the
synthetic lease facility, and no further amounts are available under that
facility. The annual lease cost of the synthetic lease is approximately $33
million, based on interest rates in effect as of December 31, 2002. At December
31, 2002, the lessor under the synthetic lease held real estate assets based on
original acquisition and construction costs of approximately $554 million and
equipment of approximately $166 million based on original acquisition cost at
nineteen locations.
The lease is renewable in one-year increments, but only with the consent of the
financial institutions that are parties thereto. In the event the lease is not
renewed at maturity, or is earlier terminated for various reasons, the Company
must either purchase the properties under the lease for the total amount
outstanding or market the properties to third parties. Effective December 31,
2002, the Company amended the synthetic lease agreement whereby the Company
guarantees 100% of the residual value of the properties in the lease.
Previously, the Company had guaranteed 85% of the residual value. The Company
increased its guaranty to provide greater ability to sell, move or transfer the
assets in the lease. In January 2003, the Company sold two properties under the
lease in connection with practice disaffiliations.
As a result of this amendment, the Company recorded $720 million outstanding
under the lease as indebtedness in its consolidated balance sheet. The Company
also included assets under the lease as assets in its consolidated balance sheet
based upon the Company determination of fair values of those properties at
December 31, 2002, and recognized an impairment charge of $200 million in the
fourth quarter of 2002 related to these cancer centers. Prior to December 31,
2002, and increase to the Company guarantee, the lease was recorded as an
operating lease and, accordingly neither the debt nor the assets were recorded
on its consolidated balance sheet.
Borrowings under the revolving credit facility and advances under the
synthetic leasing facility bear interest at a rate equal to a rate based on
prime rate or the London Interbank Offered Rate, based on a defined formula.
The credit facility, synthetic leasing facility and Senior Subordinated Notes
contain affirmative and negative covenants, including the maintenance of certain
financial ratios, restrictions on sales, leases or other dispositions of
property, restrictions on other indebtedness and prohibitions on the payment of
dividends. Events of default under the credit facility, synthetic leasing
facility and Senior Subordinated Notes included cross-defaults to all material
indebtedness, including each of those financings. Substantially all of the
Company assets, including certain real property, are pledged as security under
the credit facility and the guarantee obligations of the synthetic leasing
facility.
Notes payable
The notes payable bear interest, which is payable annually, at rates ranging
from 53% to 10% and mature between 2003 to 2005. The notes are payable to
physicians with whom the Company entered into long-term service agreements and
relate to affiliation transactions. The notes payable are unsecured.
Subordinated notes
The subordinated notes are issued in substantially the same form in different
series and are payable to the physicians with whom the Company entered into
service agreements. Substantially all of the notes outstanding at December 31,
2002 and 2001 bear interest at 7%, are due in installments through 2007 and are
subordinated to senior bank and certain other debt. If the Company fails to make
payments under any of the notes, the respective practice can terminate the
related service agreement

Capital lease obligations and other indebtedness
Leases for medical and office equipment are capitalized using effective interest
rates between 65% and 115% with original lease terms between two and seven
years. At December 31, 2002 and 2001, the gross amount of assets recorded under
the capital leases was $42 million and $47 million, respectively, and the
related accumulated amortization was $41 million and $42 million,
respectively. Amortization expense is included with depreciation in the
accompanying consolidated statement of operations and comprehensive income.
Other indebtedness consists principally of installment notes and bank debt, with
varying interest rates, assumed in affiliation transactions. See Note 13 for
operating lease commitments.
Maturities
As of December 31, 2002, future principal maturities of long-term indebtedness,
including capital lease obligations, were approximately $154 million in 2003 832 million in 2004, $64 million in 2005, $51 million in 2006, $19 million

As part of entering into long-term service agreements with practices as
described in Note 3, the Company has made nonforfeitable commitments to issue
shares of Common Stock at specified future dates for no further consideration.
Holders of the rights to receive such shares have no dispositive, voting or cash
dividend rights with respect to such shares until the shares have been
delivered. Common Stock to be issued is shown as a separate component in
stockholders' equity. The amounts, upon issuance of the shares, are reclassified
to other equity accounts as appropriate.
The shares of Common Stock to be issued at specified future dates were valued at
the transaction date at a discount from the quoted market price of a delivered
share after considering all relevant factors, including normal discounts for
marketability due to the time delay in delivery of the shares. The discount for
shares of Common Stock to be issued at specified future dates is 10% for shares
to be delivered prior to the fifth anniversary of the transaction and is 20% for
shares to be delivered thereafter. The Common Stock in the transactions is to be
delivered under the terms of the respective agreements for periods up to seven
years after the initial transaction date. The recorded value represents
management best estimate of the fair value of the shares of Common Stock to be
delivered in the future as of the transaction date. A portion of the Common
Stock to be issued commitment is based upon obligations to deliver a specified
dollar value of Common Stock shares. The value of these shares is not discounted
and the number of shares to be issued would change with change in the market
value of the Company Common Stock.
For transactions completed through December 31, 2002, the scheduled issuance of
the shares of Common Stock that the Company is committed to deliver over the
passage of time are approximately 1,392 in 2003, 1,391 in 2004, 894 in 2005, 18

Board of Directors. However, the stock option plan provides that the options
granted may be incentive options at an exercise price no less than fair value at
the grant date or 85% of fair value in the case of nonqualified options. Option
terms may not exceed ten years. Individual option grants vest ratably over time,
generally five years. At December 31, 2002, 8,538 Common Stock options with a

between 2000 and 2003. The Company ability to grant further options under
these plans ceased on the date of the Company initial public stock offering.
In December 2000, an officer exercised his remaining 1,640 options outstanding
in a cashless option exercise facilitated by the Company. This cashless exercise
resulted in the Company recognizing a $25 million non-cash charge for
compensation expense during the fourth quarter of 2000, reflecting the
difference between the exercise prices of the options and

which equaled the fair market value of the Company Common Stock at the date of
the grant. The options vest six months from the grant date and have an option
term not to exceed 10 years. At December 31, 2002, there are no options
available for future grants under this plan.
The Company 1993 Non-Employee Director Stock Option Plan provides that up to
600 options to purchase Common Stock can be granted. The options vest in 4

ratably over the vesting periods of three to five years. Of the outstanding
options to purchase shares of Common Stock granted under this plan, 1,740 were
granted to physician employees of the affiliated practices and 26 were granted
to other employees of the affiliated practices. In 2002, 2001 and 2000 the
average fair value of the options granted to non-employees was $552, $534 and
$344 per share, respectively, as determined using the Black-Scholes Valuation
Model. Compensation expense will be recognized over the respective vesting
periods. Expense of $14 million, $20 million and $16 million was recognized
in 2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively, related to these options.
The 2002 Key Executive Performance Stock Option Plan provides for the grant of
up to 5,000 nonqualified stock options to key executive officers including
officers who may be members of the Board of Directors of US Oncology and its
subsidiaries. Persons receiving awards, vesting periods and terms and conditions

may not be granted with an exercise prices less than 100% of the fair market
value per share of common stock at the date of grant and ii a minimum of 3,750
of the shares available under the plan were required to be granted in initial
grants, which contained the following provisions: a a requirement that the
option holder shall not receive any additional grants of stock options or other
equity interests including, without limitation, restricted stock grants, stock
appreciation rights and phantom stock rights, whether pursuant to the plan or
any other plan, prior to the second anniversary of the holder initial grant
under the plan; b a provision that vesting of the stock options granted would

vesting is accelerated pursuant to the next provision below; and c a vesting
schedule setting forth certain internal return on invested capital commonly
referred to as ROIC targets for US Oncology beginning with the fiscal year
ending December 31, 2002, which targets, if met, will result in some or all of
the stock options granted becoming vested and exercisable. Options to purchase
3,850 shares were granted during 2002 pursuant to such initial grants. In
addition, the Plan includes a requirement that the exercise price of any stock
options granted thereunder may not be decreased or otherwise repriced, whether
through amendment, cancellation or replacement grants.
All of the Company Common Stock options vest automatically upon those events
constituting a change in control of the Company, as set forth in such stock
option plans.

NOTE 11 - IMPAIRMENT, RESTRUCTURING, AND OTHER CHARGES, NET
During 2002, 2001 and 2000, the Company recognized net impairment, restructuring
and other charges of $1501 million, $59 million and $2018 million,
respectively. The charges are summarized in the following table and discussed in
more detail below                          Year Ended December 31,

Generally accepted accounting principles require that companies periodically
assess their long-lived assets for potential impairment. In accordance with this
requirement, from time to time the Company evaluates its intangible assets for
impairment. For each of the Company service agreements, this analysis involves
comparing the aggregate expected future cash flows under the agreement to its
carrying value as an intangible asset on the Company balance sheet. In
estimating future cash flows, the Company considers past performance as well as
known trends that are likely to affect future performance. In some cases the
Company also takes into account its current activities with respect to that
agreement that may be aimed at altering performance or reversing trends.
In 1999, the Company noted a significant increase in operating costs, most
notably the cost of pharmaceuticals, which increased by 5% as a percentage of
revenue from 1998 to 1999. The Company believed that some of this increase was
attributable either to inefficiencies arising directly from the AOR/PRN merger
and the integration of the formerly separate companies, or from delays in
implementation of cost containment strategies during the first half of 1999
pending consummation of the merger. In addition, the Company continued to
believe that it had developed effective strategies to diversify revenues away
from medical oncology and to curtail the increase in drug prices and otherwise
contain costs. As the remaining lives of its service agreements were
substantially longer than their estimated recovery periods, and because the
Company believed that it would be able to reverse or slow many of the negative
cost trends, the Company did not believe any impairment provisions were
necessary at that time. During 2000, the Company continued to experience adverse
trends in operating margins. Although the Company strategies to lower
pharmaceutical costs slowed the rate of increase, pharmaceutical costs continued
to rise, reducing operating margins during 2000. Single-source drug use
continued to grow, and treatment protocols involving a greater number of
different, expensive drugs for each patient were also becoming more common.
Based upon the significant increase in the number of oncological pharmaceuticals
which would upon approval be new single-source drugs in development, the
Company believed the trend towards increased use of lower-margin pharmaceuticals
would continue. The Company also experienced increased pressure on reimbursement
from payors, including significant initiatives with respect to government
programs, to reduce oncology reimbursements, particularly for pharmaceuticals.
Moreover, the Company became increasingly aware of growing complexity in the
administrative aspects of the practices and rising personnel costs in the health
care sector, neither of which were being effectively slowed or stopped by
anticipated economies of scale and other efficiencies arising from the merger.
Even though the practices' profitability continued to increase significantly
during this period, because practices that operate under the net revenue model
do not share in increasing operating costs, the Company shared
disproportionately in the decline in operating margins. Based upon these trends
the Company management determined during the latter part of 2000 that the cost
of operating in the oncology sector was continuing to increase and that this
trend was likely to continue, regardless of Company action, in the next several
years. For this reason, the Company determined that

in thousands, except per share amounts
rising costs, and the Company disproportionately sharing in these costs under
the net revenue model, would be an integral part of its forecast of future cash
flows in an impairment analysis with respect to its service agreements.
In its impairment analysis for the fourth quarter of 2000, the Company
incorporated additional assumptions regarding rising cost trends. With respect
to service agreements under the net revenue model, the Company has greater
exposure in an environment of rising costs because practices retain a portion of
revenues before any fees are paid. Therefore, the Company impairment review
focused primarily on net revenue model service agreements. Using current
assumptions, many of the Company net revenue model service agreements would
contribute decreasing positive cash flows in the immediate future and then begin
contributing negative cash flows. Although management commenced during the
fourth quarter of 2000 an initiative to convert net revenue model agreements to
earnings model agreements, there can be no assurance as to the number of
conversions that will be achieved. Substantial differences between the estimates
used in the impairment analysis and actual trends occurring in the future could
result in future additional impairment charges, or in certain practices
experiencing better than expected future cash flows, than those currently
forecast. The charge for impairment of service agreements related to thirteen
practices with total net book value of approximately $1450 million as of
December 31, 2000 prior to the impairment charge. No provision has been made for
potential losses under these contracts; as such amounts are not yet probable and
reasonably estimable.
Based upon this analysis, in the fourth quarter of 2000, the Company recorded a
non-cash pretax charge to earnings of approximately $1381 million related to
thirteen service agreements, primarily for arrangements under the net revenue
model, for which the projected cash flows, based upon management analysis and
evaluations of each market, including the continuation of historical trends,
would be insufficient to recover the net book value of the intangible assets. In
projecting the estimated cash flows from the service agreements, the Company
assumed net practice revenues would increase at rates of 5% to 8% annually, and
that practice costs, including pharmaceutical costs, would increase as a
percentage of Company revenues by 1% to 2% annually for the next five years.
Assumptions were also made with respect to the level of minimal capital
expenditures necessary to maintain projected operations and overhead
allocations.
The Company had impaired assets of approximately $320 million during 2000 for
the difference between the carrying value of the assets related to certain
practices with which it anticipated terminating its agreements and the
consideration expected to be received upon termination of service agreements
with those practices.
In the fourth quarter of 2001, the Company recognized a net gain on separation
of approximately $34 million relating to service agreement terminations.
Included in this net gain is approximately $90 million arising from final
settlements with several practices with which the Company terminated its
relationships where the ultimate settlements were more beneficial to the Company
than the Company estimated during 2000. The net gain included the forgiveness of
$15 million in notes payable by the Company to physicians, the waiver by the
physicians of their rights to receive $12 million of the Company common stock
previously recognized by the Company as an obligation when the Company
affiliated with the physicians, and additional consideration received by the
Company in connection with the terminations of $63 million in excess of the
carrying value of the net assets of the terminated practices, less a charge of
$56 million recognized during the fourth quarter of 2001 for the difference
between the carrying value of certain assets and the amount the Company expected
to realize from those assets.
The 2002 charges relating to impairment of service agreements include a a
non-cash, pretax charge during the third quarter of $683 million comprising i
a $130 million charge related to a PPM service agreement that was terminated in
connection with conversion to the service line model, ii a $510 million
charge related to three net revenue model service agreements that became
impaired during the third quarter based upon the Company analysis of projected
cash flows under those agreements, taking into account developments in those
markets during the third quarter and iii a $43 million charge related to a
group of physicians under a net revenue model service agreement with which the
Company disaffiliated during the third quarter, b a non-cash, pretax charge of
$397 million during the second quarter comprising i a $338 million charge
related to a net revenue model service agreement that became impaired during the
second quarter based upon the Company analysis of projected cash flows under
that agreement, taking into account developments in that market during the
second quarter and ii a $59 million charge related to two PPM service
agreements that were terminated in connection with conversions to the service
line model and c a non-cash pretax charge during the fourth quarter of $52
million related to impairment of a service agreement under which the Company
significantly reduced the scope of services provided during the year.

The $56 million net gain on sale of practice assets during 2002 consisted of
i a $36 million net gain on sale of practice assets during the third quarter
comprising net proceeds of $49 million paid by converting and disaffiliating
physicians, partially offset by a $03 million net loss on working capital
assets, and a $11 million net charge arising from accelerating consideration
that would have been due to physicians in the future in connection with those
transactions; and ii a $20 million net gain on sale of practice assets during
the second quarter. During the second quarter of 2002, the Company terminated a
service agreement as it related to certain radiology sites and sold the related
assets, including the right to future revenues attributable to radiology
technical fee revenue at those sites, in exchange for delivery of 11 million
shares of the Company Common Stock. In connection with that sale, the Company
also recognized a write-off of a receivable of $05 million due from the
physicians and agreed to make a cash payment to the buyer of $06 million to
reflect purchase price adjustments during the third quarter of 2002. The
transaction resulted in a $39 million gain based on the market price of the
Company Common Stock as of the date of the termination. This gain was
partially offset by a $19 million net impairment of working capital assets
relating to service line conversions, disaffiliations and potential
disaffiliations.
The $276 million fixed asset charge during the fourth quarter of 2002 was based
upon the Company determination as a result of transitional activity during the
quarter, that assets relating to 16 of its 79 cancer centers had become
impaired. A summary of the activity involved is as follows.  $81 million relates to eight cancer centers that became impaired
during the fourth quarter based upon the Company decision to close
or dispose of such centers, comprising i two cancer centers that
were sold, one that was leased to a departing physician, one that was
closed, and two the Company agreed to close and replace for a practice
that will in part convert to the earnings model and in part
disaffiliate in the first quarter of 2003; ii one cancer center the
Company determined to sell in connection with the anticipated
departure of radiation oncologists from a group management expects to
convert to the service line in the first half of 2003; and iii one
cancer center the Company closed as part of a consolidation of
services within one market.  $141 million relates to five cancer centers used by groups that had
converted to the earnings model. The centers became impaired as a
result of the Company ongoing discussions with physician practices
during the latter part of 2002 regarding underperforming centers. In
some of these discussions, the Company has agreed to assume greater
liability for underperforming assets or for cancer center closures.
Three of these centers were opened during 2001, and management
generally cannot fully assess the long-term value of a center until
after a ramp-up period of 12 to 18 months.  $54 million relates to three cancer centers that became impaired
during the fourth quarter, comprising i one center in which the
Company determined that its relationship with the practice, as well as
the announced departure of several physicians from that practice,
meant improvement in substandard performance was unlikely and ii two
centers in which management had determined that its remedial actions
taken since opening had been ineffective and additional remedial
actions were unlikely to improve performance.
Restructuring Charges
In the fourth quarter of 2000, the Company comprehensively analyzed its
operations and cost structure, with a view to repositioning itself to
effectively execute its strategic and operational initiatives. This analysis
focused on the Company non-core assets and activities it had determined were
not consistent with its strategic direction. As a result of this analysis,
during the fourth quarter of 2000, the Company recorded restructuring charges of
$161 million comprising i $65 million related to abandonment of information
systems initiatives, including clinical information systems and e-commerce
initiatives, ii $65 million impairment of a home health business, iii $04
million related to contractual severance of an executive position and iv $26
million related to abandonment of leased and owned facilities for remaining
lease obligations and the difference in the net book value of the owned real
estate and its expected fair value. Details of the restructuring charge activity
relating to that charge in 2002 are as follows                    76                 US ONCOLOGY, INC.

amounts to physician groups and retains fees based upon management estimates
of practice performance. Subsequent events and related adjustments may result in
the creation of a receivable with respect to certain amounts advanced. During
the third quarter 2002, the Company made the determination that a portion of
such amounts owed by physician practices to the Company have become
uncollectible due to, among other things, the age of the receivable and
circumstances relating to practice operations.
In the fourth quarter of 2001, the Company recognized unusual charges including:
i $19 million of practice accounts receivable and fixed asset write-off, ii
a $10 million charge related to its estimated exposure to losses under an

In the fourth quarter of 2000, the Company recognized a pre-tax $25 million
non-cash charge related to the cashless exercise of 1,600 stock options by the
Company Chairman and Chief Executive Officer the optionee, due to the
termination of the stock option plan under which the options were granted. To
consummate the exercise, the optionee surrendered approximately 1,300 shares
having an average strike price of $344 to satisfy exercise price and tax
liability with respect to all options. As a result of this transaction, the
optionee received approximately 300 shares of Common Stock. The Company also
realized an offsetting $10 million reduction in its federal income tax
obligation as a result of this transaction.
During the third quarter and second quarter of 2000, the Company incurred costs
of $02 million and approximately $17 million, respectively, in connection with
qui tam lawsuits, consisting primarily of professional and legal fees and
related expenses. In addition, the Company incurred $15 million of costs in the
second quarter of 2000 consisting of intangible asset and receivable write-downs
as a result of terminating its affiliation with a sole practitioner and with the
physician practice named in the qui tam lawsuits.
The Company also recognized impairment and other charges totaling approximately
$98 million in 2000. These charges consist of i $51 million of receivables
from affiliated practices which are not considered to be recoverable; ii $24
million for bank and noteholder fees associated with amending the Credit
Facilities to accommodate debt covenant compliance related to unusual charges;
iii $13 million related to expenses to recruit and relocate certain members
of the current management team; and iv $10 million for a change in the
Company vacation policy.
The Company has recognized a deferred income tax benefit for substantially all
of these charges, as many of the items will be deductible for income tax
purposes in future periods
NOTE 12 - SEGMENT FINANCIAL INFORMATION
The Company has adopted the provisions of FASB Statement of Financial Accounting
Standards No. 131, Disclosure About Segments of an Enterprise and Related
Information FAS 131. FAS 131 requires the utilization of a management
approach to define and report the financial results of operating segments. The
management approach defines operating segments along the lines used by
management to assess performance and make operating and resource allocation
decisions.
Beginning in the first quarter of 2002, the Company has determined that its
reportable segments are those that are based on the Company method of internal
reporting, which disaggregates its business by service line, and that sufficient
information is now available to permit such reporting. The Company reportable
segments are oncology pharmaceutical services, other practice management
services, cancer center services, and cancer research services. The oncology
pharmaceutical services segment purchases and manages specialty oncology
pharmaceuticals for the Company affiliated practices. Management of the
administrative aspects of affiliated medical oncology practices is included in
the other practice management services segment. The cancer center services
segment develops and manages comprehensive, community-based cancer centers,
which integrate all aspects of outpatient cancer care, from laboratory and
radiology diagnostic capabilities to chemotherapy and radiation therapy. The
cancer research services segment contracts with pharmaceutical and biotechnology
firms to provide a comprehensive range of services relating to clinical trials.
The operating results of this segment are reflected in the other category. The
Company business is conducted entirely in the United States.
The financial results of the Company segments are presented on the accrual
basis. For 2002, 993% of the Company oncology pharmaceutical services revenue
and cancer center services revenue was derived from the PPM model with the
remainder derived under service line model agreements providing oncology
pharmaceutical services. To determine results of the oncology pharmaceutical
services segment with respect to practices managed under the Company PPM
model, management has assumed that the pharmaceuticals purchased and pharmacy
management services under this segment are provided at rates consistent with the
rates at which the Company is currently offering those services outside of the
PPM model. Therefore, the financial results of that segment include
inter-segment revenues while other practice management services reflects PPM
results after the effect of removing the oncology pharmaceutical services
results and cancer center services results which are actual results of that
service line within the PPM model disclosed below. As such, the combined
operating results of the oncology

pharmaceutical services segment and other practice management segments for the
year ended December 31, 2002 represent the operating results under the Company
PPM activities relative to the management of the non-medical aspects of
affiliated medical oncology practices plus the results under oncology
pharmaceutical services for practices under service line model agreements.
The Company has not disclosed prior year segment data on a comparative basis
because management could not obtain comparative data for prior years due to
financial systems limitations. Asset information by reportable segment is not
reported since the Company does not produce such information internally.

Synthetic Lease Facility
Effective December 31, 2002, the Company amended the synthetic lease agreement
whereby the Company guarantees 100% of the residual value of the properties in
the lease. Previously, the Company had guaranteed 85% of the residual value. The
Company increased its guaranty in connection with the lease amendment in order
to provide the ability to sell, move or transfer the assets in the lease. In
January 2003, the Company sold two properties under the lease in connection with
practice disaffiliations.
There are additional risks associated with the synthetic lease arrangement. A
deterioration in the Company financial condition that would cause an event of
default under the synthetic lease facility, including a default on material
indebtedness, would give the parties under the synthetic lease the right to
terminate that lease, and the Company would be obligated to purchase or remarket
the properties. In such an event, the Company may not be able to obtain
sufficient financing to purchase the properties. In addition, changes in future
operating decisions or changes in the fair market values of underlying leased
properties or the associated rentals could result in significant charges or
acceleration of charges in the Company statement of operations for leasehold
abandonments or residual value guarantees. Because the synthetic lease payment
floats with a referenced interest rate, the Company is also exposed to interest
rate risk under the synthetic lease.

Insurance
The Company and its affiliated practices maintain insurance with respect to
medical malpractice risks on a claims-made basis in amounts believed to be
customary and adequate. Management is not aware of any outstanding claims or
unasserted claims that are likely to be asserted against it or its affiliated
practices which would have a material impact on the Company financial position
or results of operations.
In February 2002, PHICO Insurance Company PHICO, at the request of the
Pennsylvania Insurance Department, was placed in liquidation by an Order of the
Commonwealth Court of Pennsylvania Liquidation Order. From November 1997
through December 2001, the Company had placed its primary malpractice insurance
coverage through PHICO. These policies have not been replaced with policies from
other insurers. Currently the Company has two unsettled claims from the policy
years covered by PHICO issued policies and there are other claims against its
affiliated practices. The Liquidation Order refers these claims to various state
guaranty associations. These state guaranty association statutes generally
provide for coverage between $01 million - $03 million per insured claim,
depending upon the state. Some states also have catastrophic loss funds to cover
settlements in excess of the available state guaranty funds. Most state
insurance guaranty statues provide for net worth and residency limitations that,
if applicable, may limit or prevent the Company or its affiliated practices from
recovering sufficiently from these state guaranty association funds. At this
time, the Company believes that the Company will meet the requirements for
coverage under the applicable state guaranty association statutes, and that the
resolution of these claims will not have a material adverse effect on the
Company financial position, cash flow and results of operations. However,
because the rules related to state guaranty association funds are subject to
interpretation, and because these claims are still in the process of resolution,
the Company has reserved $10 million to estimate potential costs it may incur
either directly or indirectly during this process.
Guarantees
Beginning January 1, 1997, the Company has guaranteed that the amounts retained
by the Company affiliated practice in Minnesota will be at least $52 million
annually under the terms of the related service agreement provided that certain
targets are met. The Company has not been required to make payments under this
guarantee to that practice for any of the three years ended December 31, 2002.
Litigation
The Company has previously disclosed that it and certain of its affiliated
practices are the subject of certain qui tam complaints, commonly referred to as
whistle-blower lawsuits, filed under seal. The U.S. Department of Justice has
determined that it will not intervene in any of those qui tam suits of which the
Company is aware. In one such suit, the individual who filed the complaint may
choose to continue to pursue litigation in the absence of government
intervention, but has not yet indicated an intent to do so. The other qui tam
suits of which we are aware have been dismissed. Furthermore, the Company may
from time to time in the future become aware of additional qui tam lawsuits. The
United States has determined not to intervene in any such suit against the
Company of which the Company is aware. Because qui tam actions are filed under
seal, there is a possibility that the Company could be the subject of other qui
tam actions of which it is unaware.
Assessing the Company financial and operational exposure on litigation matters
requires the application of substantial subjective judgments and estimates based
upon facts and circumstances, resulting in estimates that could change as more
information becomes available.

outstanding Common Stock. At December 31, 2002 and 2001, TOPA was indebted to
the Company in the aggregate amount of approximately $63 million and $68
million, respectively. This indebtedness was incurred when the Company advanced
working capital to TOPA for various uses, including the development of new
markets and physician salaries and bonuses. This indebtedness bears interest at
a rate negotiated by the Company and TOPA that approximates the prime-lending
rate 425% at December 31, 2002. Effective January 1, 2001, the Company and
TOPA entered into a Third Amended and Restated Service Agreement. The
significant changes in the service agreement effected by the Third Amended and

35% to 335% of TOPA Earnings; ii the implementation of certain fee
adjustments based upon performance in excess of predetermined thresholds and
iii incentives to achieve returns on invested capital in excess of certain
