REPORT OF INDEPENDENT PUBLIC ACCOUNTANTS
To the Stockholders of
Health Systems Design Corporation   We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Health
Systems Design Corporation a Delaware corporation and subsidiary as of
September 30, 1999 and 1998, and the related consolidated statements of
operations, stockholders' equity and cash flows for each of the three years in
the period ended September 30, 1999. These consolidated financial statements and
the schedule referred to below are the responsibility of the Company
management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated
financial statements and schedule based on our audits.
We conducted our audits in accordance with generally accepted auditing
standards. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material
misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting
the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes
assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by
management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.
We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly,
in all material respects, the financial position of Health Systems Design
Corporation and subsidiary as of September 30, 1999 and 1998, and the results of
their operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period
ended September 30, 1999, in conformity with generally accepted accounting
principles.
Our audit was made for the purpose of forming an opinion on the basic
financial statements taken as a whole. The schedule listed in Item 14 of
Form 10-K is presented for purposes of complying with the Securities and
Exchange Commission rules and is not part of the basic financial statements.
This schedule has been subjected to the auditing procedures applied in the audit
of the basic financial statements and, in our opinion, fairly states in all
material respects the financial data required to be set forth therein in
relation to the basic financial statements taken as a whole.

HEALTH SYSTEMS DESIGN CORPORATION
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
1. ORGANIZATION   Health Systems Design Corp. was incorporated in the State of California on
July 1, 1988. In February 1996, the Company was reorganized as Health Systems
Design Corporation the Company, a Delaware holding corporation which owns
100% of the stock of Health System Design Corp., the California corporation. The
Company is a provider of health benefits information systems software to
organizations that administer health benefits. The Company introduced its first
internally developed product, DIAMOND-REGISTERED TRADEMARK- 725, in fiscal 1992
followed by DIAMOND-REGISTERED TRADEMARK- 950C/S in fiscal 1995.
Substantially all of the Company operations are in one industry segment:
developing and selling health benefits information systems. Therefore, no
industry segment information is presented.
2. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES PRINCIPLES OF CONSOLIDATION
The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Health Systems
Design Corporation and its subsidiary. All intercompany accounts and
transactions have been eliminated.
CASH, CASH EQUIVALENTS AND SHORT-TERM MARKETABLE SECURITIES
The Company considers cash and cash equivalents to be all highly liquid
investments with an original maturity of less than three months from the date of
purchase. Short-term marketable securities generally consist of highly liquid
securities with original maturities in excess of 90 days. The Company has
classified its short-term marketable securities as held to maturity. The cost
of these securities closely approximates their fair market value at
September 30, 1999.
CUSTOMER CONCENTRATION
The Company earned 58%, 31% and 35% of its revenue from two customers in
fiscal 1999, 1998, and 1997, respectively. In fiscal 1999, Blue Shield of
California represented 41% of total revenues while Kaiser Permanente represented
17% of total revenues. In fiscal 1998, Kaiser Permanente represented 20% of
total revenues while Covation Health Services represented 11% of total revenues.
In fiscal 1997, Blue Cross/Blue Shield of Florida represented 23% of total
revenues while Blue Cross/Blue Shield of North Carolina represented 12% of total
revenues. No other customers exceed 10% of total revenues in any of the years
presented.
In addition, at September 30, 1999, a total of 52% of accounts receivable,
95% of unbilled revenue and 75% of unearned revenue is related to Blue Shield of
California and Kaiser Permanente.
CONCENTRATION OF BUSINESS RISKS
The market for the Company products and services is characterized by
intense competition, rapid technological developments, frequent new product
introductions, and evolving industry standards. Accordingly, the Company is
required to continually improve the performance, features and reliability of its
products and develop and maintain strategic relationships with distributors and
with other service organizations. In addition, substantially all of the
Company revenue is derived from its two principal products.
The Company operates primarily in the United States, but has contracts in
other countries. These contracts could be impacted by particular economic and
political situations overseas.

2. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES: CONTINUED
CONCENTRATION OF CREDIT RISK
Financial instruments that potentially subject the Company to concentrations
of credit risk consist principally of accounts receivable. The Company addresses
this risk through its contract approval process and periodic evaluation of its
accounts receivable.
ADOPTION OF ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS
In June 1997, the FASB issued SFAS No. 131, Disclosures about Segments of
an Enterprise and Related Information, which is required to be adopted for
fiscal years beginning after December 15, 1997. The Statement changes the way
public companies report segment information in financial statements and also
requires those companies to report selected segment information in interim
financial reports to stockholders. The Company adopted SFAS No. 131 for the
fiscal year ended September 30, 1998.
In June 1998, the FASB issued SFAS No. 133 Accounting for Derivative
Instruments and Hedging Activities which is required to be adopted for fiscal
quarters beginning after June 15, 1999. Adoption of this pronouncement is not
expected to have a material impact on the Company financial statements taken
as a whole.
In June 1999, the FASB issued SFAS No. 137 Accounting for Derivative
Instruments and Hedging Activities--Deferral of the Effective Date of SFAS
No. 133 which extended the required adoption date for SFAS No. 133 to fiscal
years beginning after June 15, 2000.
MANAGEMENT'S USE OF ESTIMATES
The preparation of the consolidated financial statements in conformity with
generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates
and assumptions. These assumptions effect the reported amounts of assets and
liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the dates of
the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and
expenses during the reporting periods. Actual results could differ from those
estimates. Significant estimates made by management include: revenue recognition
under the percentage-of-completion method for its license contracts which
require extended installation periods, determination of technological
feasibility of software under development and related research and development
cost capitalization, product life amortization periods for capitalized software
costs, and allowance for doubtful accounts receivable, and certain other
reserves, including a reserve required under the SMS amendment.
REVENUE RECOGNITION
The Company licenses its internally developed software products and other
software products directly to end-users and indirectly through remarketers,
under the terms of product license contracts. The Company also generates
revenues from sales of implementation services, fees for product enhancement,
post-contract support, consulting services, reselling hardware and third party
products, and training services performed for customers who license the
Company products.
If the contract does not require significant production or customization of
software, license revenue is recognized when all the following conditions are
met: a signed contract is obtained, delivery has occurred, the fee is fixed and
determinable, and collection is probable. The Company generally recognizes
DIAMOND-REGISTERED TRADEMARK- 725 license revenue upon shipment of the software
to end users, as no significant production or
29
HEALTH SYSTEMS DESIGN CORPORATION
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED
2. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES: CONTINUED
customization of this software is required, and the installation period is
relatively short. The Company generally recognizes DIAMOND-REGISTERED TRADEMARK-
950C/S license revenue on a percentage-of-completion basis based on the labor
hours required to implement the system, as this software generally requires an
extended installation period and can require significant enhancements. If the
software license agreement provides for acceptance criteria that extend beyond
the published specifications of the applicable product, then revenues are
recognized upon the earlier of customer acceptance or the expiration of the
acceptance period.
Implementation, consulting and training fees are billed either on an hourly
or a monthly basis and are recognized as services are rendered. Third party
software and hardware are typically billed and recognized as revenue when
delivered to the end user.
The Company generally recognizes DIAMOND-REGISTERED TRADEMARK- enhancement
revenues on a percentage-of completion basis based on the labor hours required
to complete the applicable release project.
Post-contract support services are billed on a monthly basis. Customers who
purchase post-contract support services under maintenance agreements have the
right to receive unspecified product updates and upgrades. Revenues from
post-contract support services are recognized ratably over the term of the
support period. If post-contract support services are included free or at a
discount in a license agreement, such amounts are recorded at their fair market
value based on the value established by independent sale of such post-contract
support services to customers and license fee revenue is correspondingly
reduced. Customers that do not purchase post-contract support must purchase
product updates and upgrades under separate agreements that are subject to the
criteria of the Company revenue recognition policy.
In January 1994, the Company entered into a marketing agreement with another
company remarketer, whereby the remarketer sells certain of the Company
products to its customer base. License fees under this agreement are recognized
when a contract between the other company and the end-user is executed for
DIAMOND-REGISTERED TRADEMARK- 725 and are recognized for
DIAMOND-REGISTERED TRADEMARK- 950C/S upon successful implementation of the
system at the remarketer end-user site. Revenues under term license agreements
are recognized ratably over the customer contract term. Fees for support and
other services are recognized as services are rendered. In December 1997, the
Company entered into an amendment to the above agreement for the purpose of
resolving certain disagreements between the parties, amongst other matters. The
amendment provides for a $4 million credit pool against which the remarketer may
charge billings for services rendered by the Company, as well as future
royalties payable by the remarketer to license the DIAMOND-REGISTERED TRADEMARK-
products. As of September 30, 1999, the credit pool had been reduced to
approximately $24 million.
During fiscal 1995, the Company entered into an agreement with a customer to
create certain product enhancements for them. As part of that same agreement,
HSD also agreed to pay the customer a percentage of all future
DIAMOND-REGISTERED TRADEMARK- 950C/S sales, which met certain criteria and which
included the customer enhancements in the release. The royalty, however, was
not to exceed the enhancement fees paid to HSD by the customer. In April of
1999, HSD and the customer amended the agreement to provide for a $700,000
credit pool in lieu of future royalties. At the time of the agreement, HSD had
booked sales that would generate royalties exceeding $700,000 over time. The
credit pool may be used by the customer to pay for valid enhancement invoices
presented in the future. As of September 30, 1999, the credit pool had been
reduced to approximately $400,000.

HEALTH SYSTEMS DESIGN CORPORATION
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED
2. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES: CONTINUED
Revenue recognized in excess of billings is recorded as an asset unbilled
revenue. Billings in excess of recognized revenue are recorded as a liability
unearned revenue.
CAPITALIZED SOFTWARE DEVELOPMENT COSTS
The Company accounts for capitalized software development costs in
accordance with SFAS No. 86, Accounting for the Costs of Computer Software to
be Sold, Leased or Otherwise Marketed. The Company begins capitalizing software
development costs upon the establishment of technological feasibility, which is
established upon the completion of a working model or, in the case of major
releases, detailed program design. Costs incurred prior to technological
feasibility are charged to expense as incurred. Capitalization ceases when the
product is considered available for general release to customers. Capitalized
software development costs are amortized to direct costs over the estimated
economic lives of the software products based on actual sales experience and
product life expectancy. Generally, estimated economic lives of the software
products do not exceed 3 years. Capitalized software development cost
amortization was approximately $1,146,000, $345,000, and $192,000 in fiscal
1999, 1998 and 1997, respectively.
PROPERTY AND EQUIPMENT
Computer equipment and office furniture are recorded at cost and are
depreciated using the straight-line method over their estimated useful lives of
three and seven years, respectively. The cost of assets retired or otherwise
disposed of and the related accumulated depreciation are removed from the
accounts, and any gain or loss is included in the results of operations.
Maintenance and repairs that do not improve or extend the life of assets are
expensed as incurred. The net book value of property and equipment under capital
lease obligations was approximately $565,000 at September 30, 1999.
INCOME TAXES
The Company provides for income taxes under Statement of Financial
Accounting Standards SFAS No. 109, Accounting for Income Taxes, issued in
February 1992. Under the liability method specified by SFAS No. 109, deferred
income taxes are determined based on the difference between the financial
statement and tax bases of assets and liabilities as measured by the effective
tax rate. A valuation allowance is placed on the deferred tax assets to reduce
them to their net realizable value.
NET INCOME LOSS PER SHARE
During 1998, the Company adopted SFAS No. 128, Earnings per Share. Net
income loss per share is computed using the weighted average number of shares
outstanding. Stock options and warrants totaling 46,113 and 339,172 in fiscal
1999 and 1998, respectively, are excluded from the computation as their effect
is antidilutive in fiscal 1999, 1998 and 1997.
RECLASSIFICATIONS
During the fourth quarter of fiscal 1998 and 1999 management decided to
revise its expense classifications and reassign its cost centers to be more
consistent with industry standards. This decision resulted in a shift of costs
between product development and cost of revenues, as well as between general and
administrative expenses and sales and marketing expenses. All prior periods in
this filing have been

reclassified on the same basis. None of these reclassifications had an impact on
the loss from operations or the net loss for any period.
3. RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS   The Company paid approximately $79,000 and $90,000 in consulting fees and
out of pocket expenses to a director during the years ended September 30, 1999
and 1998. The Company also paid approximately $56,000 and $67,000 in consulting
fees and out of pocket expenses to two other directors during the year ended
September 30, 1999. During the year ended September 30, 1999 the Company paid
approximately $78,000 for consulting and out of pocket expenses to a Corporation
of which the then interim Chief Executive Officer was a principal.
4. LEASE COMMITMENTS   Operating leases: The Company is obligated under certain operating leases
for office space and certain equipment. Future minimum lease payments for fiscal
years ending September 30 are as follows

At September 30, 1999, the Company has approximately $7,283,000 and
$1,227,000 of federal tax net operating loss carryforward and tax credit
carryforward, respectively, which are available to reduce future taxable income
of the Company, if any. These carryforwards begin to expire in fiscal 2007.
Provisions under the Tax Reform Act of 1986 may limit the federal net
operating loss carryforward and credits available to be used in any given year
in the event of a significant change in ownership, including the March 5, 1996
initial public offering.
The Company has approximately $2,732,000 and $858,000 of California tax net
operating loss carryforward and research and development tax credit
carryforward, respectively, which are available to reduce future taxable income
of the Company, if any. The carryforwards begin to expire in fiscal 2000.
7. RETIREMENT PLAN   The Company maintains a 401k retirement plan the Plan for full-time
employees. The plan year is from January 1 to December 31, and the discretionary
employer contribution is established at the end of the plan year. Participants
become fully vested after four years of service, although they vest
incrementally on an annual basis until the four-year period is completed. No
contributions were made during the fiscal years ended September 30, 1999, 1998
and 1997.
8. STOCK OPTION PLAN AND WARRANTS   Effective August 5, 1994, the Company implemented the 1994 Stock Option Plan
1994 Plan and reserved 500,000 shares of stock for grants. However, since the
inception of the 1996 Omnibus Equity Incentive Plan the Company no longer issues
stock options on the 1994 Plan.
On January 2, 1996, the Board of Directors authorized the 1996 Omnibus
Equity Incentive Plan 1996 Plan, under which the Company is authorized to
grant up to 500,000 shares of common stock to employees and consultants of the
Company. The number of authorized shares increased from 900,000 to 1,400,000
during fiscal 1998 and to 1,550,000 during fiscal 1999. The plan allows
incentive stock options to be granted to employees only, while nonstatutory
stock options may be granted to both employees and consultants. Under the terms
of the 1996 plan, incentive stock options to purchase shares of the Company
common stock must be granted at a price equal to the market price of the stock
at the date of grant, except for employees who, prior to the grant, own more
than 10 percent of the voting power of all stock. The exercise price for such
employees must be no less than 110 percent of the market price. For nonstatutory
stock options, the exercise price for both employees and consultants will be no
less than 85 percent of the market price. Both incentive stock options and
nonstatutory stock options may be exercised within ten years from the date of
grant, except for employees and consultants who own more than 10 percent of the
voting power of all classes of stock. In this case, the options may be exercised
within a five-year period. Options generally vest over a five-year period.
In October 1996, the Company Board of Directors approved the issuance of
300,000 shares under the Health Systems Design Corporation Employee Stock
Purchase Plan ESP Plan. The Plan allows for employees to purchase the
Company common stock at a 15% discount off the stock market value as defined
under the Plan. Employees began participating in the ESP Plan on January 1,
1998. As of September 30, 1999, the Company had issued 24,750 shares under the
ESP plan.
In March 1997, the Company stockholders approved the Nonemployee Director
Stock Option Plan Director Plan, which is authorized to grant up to 60,000
shares to nonemployee directors of the Company. Members of the Board of
Directors are generally granted 5,000 options on the date of each annual meeting
which vest on the first anniversary of that meeting.
The Company accounts for the above plans under APB Opinion No. 25, under
which approximately $79,000, was charged to deferred compensation in the year
ended September 30, 1995 because certain
35
8. STOCK OPTION PLAN AND WARRANTS: CONTINUED
options were granted at below the then fair market value of the common stock.
This deferred compensation is being amortized over the vesting period of the
related options. Amortization of deferred compensation was approximately $16,000
for each of the years ended September 30, 1999, 1998 and 1997 and no other
compensation cost has been recognized under APB Opinion No. 25 as all other
options have been granted at an option exercise price equal to the market value
of common stock on the date of grant. Had compensation cost for these plans been
determined consistent with SFAS No. 123, the Company net loss in total and per
share would have been changed to the following pro forma amounts                                  YEAR ENDED SEPTEMBER 30,

the Black-Scholes option pricing model with the following weighted-average
assumptions used for grants in 1999, 1998 and 1997: risk-free weighted average
interest rate of 50, 515, and 611 percent, respectively, expected dividend
yields of 0 percent, expected lives of 5 years from the date of grant and
expected volatility of 105 percent for fiscal years 1999, 98 percent for fiscal
1998, and 103 percent for fiscal 1997.
