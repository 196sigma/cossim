To the Board of Directors and Shareholders of TransAct Technologies
Incorporated We have completed integrated audits of TransAct Technologies Incorporated 2005
and 2004 consolidated financial statements and of its internal control over
financial reporting as of December 31, 2005, and an audit of its 2003
consolidated financial statements in accordance with the standards of the Public
Company Accounting Oversight Board United States. Our opinions, based on our
audits, are presented below.
Consolidated financial statements and financial statement schedule
In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements listed in the accompanying
index present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of
TransAct Technologies Incorporated and its subsidiaries at December 31, 2005 and
2004, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the
three years in the period ended December 31, 2005 in conformity with accounting
principles generally accepted in the United States of America. In addition, in
our opinion, the financial statement schedule listed in the accompanying index
presents fairly, in all material respects the information set forth therein when
read in conjunction with the related consolidated financial statements. These
financial statements and financial statement schedule are the responsibility of
the Company management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these
financial statements and financial statement schedule based on our audits. We
conducted our audits of these statements in accordance with the standards of the
Public Company Accounting Oversight Board United States. Those standards
require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about
whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit of
financial statements includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting
the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the
accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, and
evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our
audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
Internal control over financial reporting
Also, in our opinion, management assessment, included in Management Report
on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting appearing under Item 9A, that the
Company maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of
December 31, 2005 based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated
Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway
Commission COSO, is fairly stated, in all material respects, based on those
criteria. Furthermore, in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material
respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31,
2005, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework
issued by the COSO. The Company management is responsible for maintaining
effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of
the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting. Our
responsibility is to express opinions on management assessment and on the
effectiveness of the Company internal control over financial reporting based
on our audit. We conducted our audit of internal control over financial
reporting in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting
Oversight Board United States. Those standards require that we plan and
perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective
internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material
respects. An audit of internal control over financial reporting includes
obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting,
evaluating management assessment, testing and evaluating the design and
operating effectiveness of internal control, and performing such other
procedures as we consider necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our
audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinions.
A company internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to
provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting
and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance
with generally accepted accounting principles. A company internal control over
financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that i pertain to
the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly
reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; ii
provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to
permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted
accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are
being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of
the company; and iii provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or
timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the
company assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting
may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of
effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become
inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance
with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. s/ PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP

1.  DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS
TransAct Technologies Incorporated TransAct, which has its
headquarters in Wallingford, CT and its primary operating facility in
Ithaca, NY, operates in one industry segment, transaction-based printers
and related products. TransAct designs, develops, assembles, markets and
services world-class transaction printers under the Epic and IthacaR
brand names. Known and respected worldwide for innovative designs and
real-world service reliability, our impact, thermal and inkjet printers
generate top-quality receipts, tickets, coupons, register journals and
other documents. We focus on two core markets: point-of-sale POS and
banking, and gaming and lottery. We sell our products to original equipment
manufacturers, value-added resellers and selected distributors, as well as
directly to end-users. Our product distribution spans across the Americas,
Europe, the Middle East, Africa, the Caribbean Islands and the South
Pacific. In addition, we have a strong focus on the after-market side of
the business, with a growing commitment to printer service, supplies and
spare parts.
We design, develop, manufacture and market a broad array of
transaction-based printers utilizing inkjet, thermal and impact printing
technology for applications requiring up to 60 character columns in each of
our vertical markets. Our printers are configurable, which offer customers
the ability to choose from a variety of features and functions. Options
typically include printed circuit board configuration, paper cutting
devices, paper handling capacities and cabinetry color. In addition to our
configurable printers, we manufacture custom printers for certain OEM
customers. In collaboration with these customers, we provide engineering
and manufacturing expertise for the design and development of specialized
printers.
2.  SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
STOCK SPLIT: On March 17, 2004, we effected a three-for-two split of
our common stock in the form of a 50 percent stock dividend. All share and
per-share amounts within the accompanying financial statements and
footnotes reflect the stock split.
PRINCIPLES OF CONSOLIDATION: The accompanying consolidated financial
statements were prepared on a consolidated basis to include the accounts of
TransAct and its wholly-owned subsidiaries. All intercompany accounts,
transactions and unrealized profit were eliminated in consolidation.
RECLASSIFICATIONS: Certain amounts in the prior years' financial
statements have been reclassified to conform to the current year
presentation.
USE OF ESTIMATES: The accompanying consolidated financial statements
were prepared using estimates and assumptions that affect the reported
amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses, and disclosure of
contingent assets and liabilities as of the date of the consolidated
financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses
during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those
estimates.                    34            TRANSACT TECHNOLOGIES INCORPORATED

2.  SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES CONTINUED
SEGMENT REPORTING: We apply the provisions of Statement of Financial
Accounting Standards No. 131, Disclosures about Segments of an Enterprise
and Related Information FAS 131. We view our operations and manage our
business as one segment, the design, development, manufacture and sale of
transaction-based printers. Factors used to identify TransAct single
operating segment include the organizational structure of the Company and
the financial information available for evaluation by the chief operating
decision-maker in making decisions about how to allocate resources and
assess performance. We operate predominantly in one geographical area, the
United States of America. See Note 20 for information regarding our
international operations. We provide the following disclosures of revenues

Total net sales        $51,091  1000%  $59,847  1000%  $52,098  1000%
CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS: We consider all highly liquid investments
with a maturity date of three months or less at date of purchase to be cash
equivalents.
ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE: We have standardized credit granting and review
policies and procedures for all customer accounts, including      -  Credit reviews of all new customer accounts      -  Ongoing credit evaluations of current customers      -  Credit limits and payment terms based on available credit
information      -  Adjustments to credit limits based upon payment history and the
customer current creditworthiness.
PROVISIONS FOR LOSSES ON UNCOLLECTIBLE RECEIVABLES: We establish an
allowance for doubtful accounts to ensure trade receivables are valued
appropriately. We maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts based on a
variety of factors, including the length of time receivables are past due,
significant one-time events and historical experience. We record a specific
allowance for individual accounts when we become aware of a customer
inability to meet its financial obligations, such as in the case of
bankruptcy filings or deterioration in the customer operating results or
financial position. If circumstances related to customers change, we would
further adjust estimates of the recoverability of receivables. Allowances
for doubtful accounts on accounts receivable balances were $240,000 and
$175,000, as of December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively.
INVENTORIES: Inventories are stated at the lower of cost principally
standard cost which approximates actual cost on a first-in, first-out
basis or market. We assess market value based on historical usage and
estimates of future demand in the market.
FIXED ASSETS: Fixed assets are stated at cost. Depreciation is
recorded using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives.
The estimated useful life of tooling is five years; machinery and equipment
is ten years; furniture and office equipment is five to ten years; and
computer software and equipment is three to five years. Leasehold
improvements are amortized over the shorter of the term of the lease or the
useful life of the asset. Costs related to repairs and maintenance are
expensed as incurred. The costs of sold or retired assets are removed from
the related asset and accumulated depreciation accounts and any gain or
loss is recognized. Depreciation expense was $1,419,000, $1,608,000 and
$1,579,000 in 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively.                    35            TRANSACT TECHNOLOGIES INCORPORATED
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
2.  SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES CONTINUED
LEASES: Rent expense under non-cancelable operating leases with
scheduled rent increases or free rent periods is accounted for on a
straight-line basis over the lease term, beginning on the date of control
of physical use of the asset or of initial possession, which is generally
when we enter the space and begin construction build-out. The amount of the
excess of straight-line rent expense over scheduled payments is recorded as
a deferred liability. Construction allowances and other such lease
incentives are recorded as deferred credits, and are amortized on a
straight-line basis as a reduction of rent expense beginning in the period
they are deemed to be earned, which generally coincides with the occupancy
date.
GOODWILL: We adopted the provisions of Statement of Financial
Accounting Standard No. 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets FAS
142 on January 1, 2002. Under FAS 142, goodwill is no longer amortized
and is tested for impairment at least annually at the reporting unit level.
We test goodwill annually for impairment, or whenever events or
changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be
recoverable. We have performed an impairment test as of December 31, 2005
and determined that no impairment has occurred.
REVENUE RECOGNITION: Our typical contracts include the sale of
printers, which are sometimes accompanied by separately-priced extended
warranty contracts. We also sell spare parts, consumables, and other repair
services sometimes pursuant to multi-year product maintenance contracts
which are not included in the original printer sale and are ordered by the
customer as needed. We recognize revenue pursuant to the guidance within
SAB 104, Revenue Recognition. Specifically, revenue is recognized when
evidence of an arrangement exists, delivery based on shipping terms, which
are generally FOB shipping point has occurred, the selling price is fixed
and determinable, and collectibility is reasonably assured. We provide for
an estimate of product returns based on historical experience at the time
of revenue recognition.
Revenue related to extended warranty and product maintenance contracts
is recognized pursuant to FASB Technical Bulletin 90-1 FTB 90-1,
Accounting for Separately Priced Extended Warranty and Product Maintenance
Contracts. Pursuant to FTB 90-1, revenue related to separately priced
product maintenance contracts is deferred and recognized over the term of
the maintenance period. We record deferred revenue for amounts received
from customers for maintenance contracts prior to the maintenance period.
CONCENTRATION OF CREDIT RISK: Financial instruments that potentially
expose TransAct to concentrations of credit risk are limited to accounts
receivable.
Accounts receivable from customers representing 10% or more of total
accounts receivable were as follows       December 31,
2005  2004
Customer A   19%  10%
Customer B    *  18%
Customer C    *  14   - customer balances were less than 10% of total accounts receivable
Sales to customers representing 10% or more of total net sales were as
follows       Year ended December 31,
2005  2004  2003
Customer A    17%  16%  19%
Customer B    14%   *   *
Customer C     *  14%   *
Customer D     *  --   12   - customer balances were less than 10% of total net sales                    36            TRANSACT TECHNOLOGIES INCORPORATED

2.  SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES CONTINUED
WARRANTY: We generally warrant our products for up to 24 months and
record the estimated cost of such product warranties at the time the sale
is recorded. Estimated warranty costs are based upon actual past experience
of product repairs and the related estimated cost of labor and material to
make the necessary repairs.
The following table summarizes the activity recorded in the accrued
product warranty liability during 2005, 2004 and 2003                     Year ended December 31,
In thousands               2005  2004  2003
Balance, beginning of year        $ 597  $ 495  $ 644
Additions related to warranties issued   613   610   409
Warranty costs incurred          566  508  558
Balance, end of year           $ 644  $ 597  $ 495
Approximately $145,000 and $153,000 of the accrued product warranty
liability were classified as long-term at December 31, 2005 and 2004,
respectively.
RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT EXPENSES: Research and development expenses
include engineering, design and product development expenses incurred in
connection with specialized engineering and design to introduce new
products and to customize existing products, and are expensed as a
component of operating expenses as incurred. We spent approximately
$2,726,000, $2,715,000 and $2,276,000 on research and development expenses
in 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively.
ADVERTISING: Advertising costs are expensed as incurred. Advertising
expenses for the years ended December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003 totaled
$371,000, $343,000 and $417,000, respectively.
RESTRUCTURING: In 2001, we undertook a plan to consolidate all
manufacturing and engineering into our existing Ithaca, NY facility and
close our Wallingford, CT manufacturing facility. We continue to apply the
consensus set forth in EITF 94-3, Liability Recognition for Certain
Employee Termination Benefits and Other Costs to Exit an Activity
Including Certain Costs Incurred in a Restructuring in recognizing
restructuring expenses. See Note 8 for additional disclosures related to
our restructuring plan.
INCOME TAXES: The income tax amounts reflected in the accompanying
financial statements are accounted for under the liability method in
accordance with FAS 109 Accounting for Income Taxes. Deferred tax assets
and liabilities are recognized for the estimated future tax consequences
attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying
amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases
and operating loss and tax credit carryforwards. Deferred tax assets and
liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in
which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled.
We assess the likelihood that net deferred tax assets will be realized from
future taxable income, and to the extent that we believe that realization
is not likely, we establish a valuation allowance.
FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSLATION: The financial position and results of
operations of our foreign subsidiary in the United Kingdom are measured
using local currency as the functional currency. Assets and liabilities of
such subsidiary have been translated into U.S. dollars at the year-end
exchange rate, related revenues and expenses have been translated at the
weighted average exchange rate for the year, and shareholders' equity has
been translated at historical exchange rates. The resulting translation
gains or losses, net of tax, are recorded in stockholders' equity as a
cumulative translation adjustment, which is a component of accumulated
other comprehensive income. Foreign currency transaction gains and losses
are recognized in other income expense and have not been significant for
all periods presented.
FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS: The carrying amount for cash and
cash equivalents approximates fair value because of the short maturity of
these instruments. The carrying amount of receivables, accounts payable and
accrued liabilities is a reasonable estimate of fair value because of the
short-term nature of the transactions.                    37            TRANSACT TECHNOLOGIES INCORPORATED
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
2.  SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES CONTINUED
COMPREHENSIVE INCOME: Statement of Accounting Standard No. 130,
Reporting Comprehensive Income FAS 130, requires that items defined
as comprehensive income or loss be separately classified in the financial
statements and that the accumulated balance of other comprehensive income
or loss be reported separately from accumulated deficit and additional
paid-in-capital in the equity section of the balance sheet. We include the
foreign currency translation adjustment, net of tax, related to our
subsidiary in the United Kingdom within our calculation of comprehensive
income.
STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION: We have elected to follow Accounting
Principles Board Opinion No. 25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees
APB 25, and related interpretations in accounting for stock options.
Since the exercise price of employee stock options granted by the Company
equals the market price of the underlying stock on the date of grant, no
compensation expense is recorded. We have adopted the disclosure-only
provisions of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123,
Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation FAS 123, as amended by
Statement of Financial Standards No. 148, Accounting for Stock-Based
Compensation - Transition and Disclosure - an amendment of FAS 123 FAS
148. See Note 13 for additional disclosures related to our stock-based
compensation plans.
The following table illustrates the effect on net income loss,
compensation expense and net income loss per share as if the
Black-Scholes fair value method described in FAS 123 had been applied to
our stock plans.                                  Year Ended December 31,

31, 2005 includes pro forma compensation expense of approximately $564,000
related to the acceleration of stock option vesting.
NET INCOME AND LOSS PER SHARE: We report net income or loss per share
in accordance with Financial Standard No. 128, Earnings per Share EPS
FAS 128. Under FAS 128, basic EPS, which excludes dilution, is computed
by dividing income or loss available to common shareholders by the weighted
average number of common shares outstanding for the period. Unvested
restricted stock is excluded from the calculation of weighted average
common shares for basic EPS. Net income or loss available to common
shareholders represents reported net income or loss less accretion of
redeemable convertible preferred stock and allocation of preferred
earnings. Diluted EPS reflects the potential dilution that could occur if
securities or other contracts to issue common stock were exercised or
converted into common stock. Diluted EPS includes in-the-money options and
warrants using the treasury stock method, and also includes the assumed
conversion of preferred stock using the if-converted method, but only if
dilutive. During a loss period, the assumed exercise of in-the-money stock
options and warrants and the conversion of convertible preferred stock has
an anti-dilutive effect, and therefore, these instruments are excluded from
the computation of dilutive EPS.                    38            TRANSACT TECHNOLOGIES INCORPORATED
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
2.  SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES CONTINUED
Beginning in the second quarter of 2004, the Company applied the
consensus set forth in EITF 03-06 Participating Securities and the
Two-Class Method under FASB Statement No. 128, Earnings Per Share, which
requires the two-class method of computing earnings per share when
participating securities, such as our redeemable preferred stock, are
outstanding. The two-class method is an earnings allocation formula that
determines earnings per share for common stock and participating securities
based upon an allocation of earnings as if all of the earnings for the
period had been distributed in accordance with participation rights on
undistributed earnings. EITF 03-6 became effective for reporting periods
beginning after March 31, 2004. This guidance impacted the calculation of
earnings per share for the year ended December 31, 2004 and also required
retroactive restatement of earnings per share presented for the year ended
December 31, 2003.
3.  RECENTLY ISSUED ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS
SHARE-BASED PAYMENT: In December 2004, the FASB issued Statement of
Financial Accounting Standards No. 123 revised 2004, Share-Based
Payment FAS 123R. FAS 123R replaced Statement of Financial Accounting
Standards No. 123, Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation FAS 123,
and superseded Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 25, Accounting for
Stock Issued to Employees APB 25. In March 2005, the U.S. Securities
and Exchange Commission SEC issued Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 107
SAB 107, which expresses views of the SEC staff regarding the
interaction between FAS 123R and certain SEC rules and regulations, and
provides the staff views regarding the valuation of share-based payment
arrangements for public companies. FAS 123R will require compensation cost
related to share-based payment transactions to be recognized in the
financial statements. FAS 123R requires measurement of the cost of
share-based payment transactions to employees at the fair value of the
award on the grant date and recognition of expense over the requisite
service or vesting period. FAS 123R allows for implementation using a
modified prospective method, under which compensation expense for the
unvested portion of previously granted awards and all new awards will be
recognized on or after the date of adoption. FAS 123R also allows companies
to adopt FAS 123R by restating previously issued financial statements,
basing the amounts on the expense previously calculated and reported in
their pro forma footnote disclosures required under FAS 123. In April 2005,
the FASB changed the implementation date for FAS 123R and the provisions of
this statement will now be effective for the Company during the first
quarter of 2006.
We are currently reviewing the method of adoption, including the
transition method, method of attribution for compensation cost, valuation
methods and support for the assumptions that underlie the valuation of
awards. Currently, we anticipate utilizing the modified prospective
application MPA as our transition method. A company that chooses to
utilize the MPA will not restate its prior financial statements. Because
the vesting of all existing stock option awards was accelerated on November
2, 2005, we will recognize compensation expense solely for new awards
granted after January 1, 2006. The Company anticipates allocating expense
on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period and using the
short-cut method for calculating the pool of windfall tax benefits. In
addition, with regard to valuation methods, the Company also anticipates
relying exclusively on historical volatility.
ACCOUNTING CHANGES AND ERROR CORRECTIONS: In May 2005, FASB issued
Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 154, Accounting Changes
and Error Corrections FAS 154, a replacement of Accounting Principles
Board Opinion No. 20 Accounting Changes and Statement of Financial
Accounting Standards No. 3 Reporting Accounting Changes in Interim
Financial Statements -- An Amendment of APB Opinion No. 28. FAS 154
applies to all voluntary changes in accounting principle and changes
required by an accounting pronouncement where no specific transition
provisions are included. FAS 154 requires retrospective application to
prior period financial statements of changes in accounting principle,
unless it is impracticable to determine either the period-specific effects
or the cumulative effect of the change. The provisions of FAS 154 are
effective for accounting changes and correction of errors made in fiscal
periods that begin after December 15, 2005, although early adoption is
permitted. We do not anticipate that the implementation of this standard
will have a material impact on our financial position, results of
operations or cash flows.

6.  INTANGIBLE ASSETS
On June 30, 2005, we acquired certain intangible assets related to
casino ticket printer designs and technology from Bally Gaming, Inc.
Bally for $475,000, plus the costs of effecting the acquisition
approximately $35,000. Prior to the acquisition, pursuant to the terms of
a license agreement, we were required to pay Bally a royalty on sales of
certain gaming printers utilizing the licensed technology. As a result of
the acquisition, effective July 1, 2005, we were no longer required to pay
any future royalties to Bally.
The purchase price was allocated, based on management estimates, to
intangible assets based on their relative fair value at the date of
acquisition. The fair value of the intangibles, comprised of purchased
technology and a covenant not to compete, was determined using the future
cash flows method. The intangible assets are being amortized on a
straight-line basis over six and seven years, respectively, for the
estimated life of the assets.
The following summarizes the allocation of the purchase price for the
acquisition of certain intangible assets from Bally in thousands

Amortization expense associated with the technology purchased from
Bally was $41,000 for the year ended December 31, 2005. Amortization
expense for each of the next five years ending December 31 is expected to
be approximately $82,000 per year.

8.  ACCRUED BUSINESS CONSOLIDATION AND RESTRUCTURING EXPENSES
In February 2001, we announced plans to establish a global engineering
and manufacturing center at our Ithaca, NY facility. As part of this
strategic decision, we undertook a plan to consolidate all manufacturing
and engineering into our existing Ithaca, NY facility and close our
Wallingford, CT manufacturing facility the Consolidation. As of
December 31, 2001, substantially all Wallingford product lines were
successfully transferred to Ithaca, NY. We currently maintain our corporate
headquarters and a service center in Wallingford. The closing of the
Wallingford manufacturing facility resulted in the termination of
employment of approximately 70 production, administrative and management
employees. We continue to apply the consensus set forth in EITF 94-3,
Liability Recognition for Certain Employee Termination Benefits and Other
Costs to Exit an Activity Including Certain Costs Incurred in a
Restructuring in recognizing the accrued restructuring expenses.
During 2001, we recorded expenses of approximately $4,096,000 related
to costs associated with the Consolidation, including severance pay, stay
bonuses, employee benefits, moving expenses, non-cancelable lease payments,
accelerated depreciation and other costs.
During 2002, we incurred an additional $958,000 of Consolidation
expenses, primarily due to a revision to our estimate for non-cancelable
lease payments included in the restructuring accrual.
After expanded efforts in 2003, we determined that because of the
continuing regional decline in the commercial real estate market during
2003, it was unlikely that we would be able to sublease our Wallingford, CT
manufacturing facility, which has a lease term that expires in March 2008.
As a result, during 2003, we increased our restructuring accrual by
$1,270,000 to provide for the remaining non-cancelable lease payments and
related costs associated with the manufacturing facility. This increase
represented the reversal of estimated sublease income for the remainder of
the lease term. In addition, we did not terminate certain employees
originally included in the Consolidation. As a result, we reversed the
remaining $142,000 of accrued restructuring expenses in 2003 related to
employee severance and termination expenses, as we completed all required
payments for such expenses by December 31, 2003.
In December 2004, we determined that certain functions would be
relocated and/or expanded in our Wallingford, CT corporate offices. In
order to achieve the benefit of these changes, we expanded our use of space
in our current facility. Because of this increase in useful space in the
Wallingford facility, and because we had experienced lower than expected
operating and maintenance costs than previously estimated, we reversed
$225,000 of previously accrued amounts provided for the remaining
non-cancelable lease payments and related costs.                    41            TRANSACT TECHNOLOGIES INCORPORATED

related expenses expected to be paid to employees who are involuntarily
terminated.
2 Facility closure and consolidation expenses are the estimated costs to
close the Wallingford, CT facility including lease termination expenses and
other related expenses, in accordance with the restructuring plan. The
Wallingford facility closure was substantially completed by December 31,
2001.
At December 31, 2005 and 2004, $587,000 and $1,034,000, respectively,
of the restructuring accrual was classified as part of long-term
liabilities. The long-term portion represents the portion of non-cancelable
lease termination costs and other costs expected to be paid beyond one
year.
9. RETIREMENT SAVINGS PLAN
On April 1, 1997, we established the TransAct Technologies Retirement
Savings Plan the 401k Plan, a defined contribution plan under Section
401k of the Internal Revenue Code. All full-time employees are eligible
to participate in the 401k Plan at the beginning of the calendar quarter
immediately following their date of hire. We match employees' contributions
at a rate of 50% of employees' contributions up to the first 6% of the
employees' compensation contributed to the 401k Plan. Our matching
contributions were $225,000, $201,000 and $174,000 in 2005, 2004 and 2003,
respectively.
10. BORROWINGS
On August 6, 2003, we entered into a $125 million credit facility
the TD Banknorth Credit Facility with TD Banknorth, N.A. The TD
Banknorth Credit Facility provides for an $115 million revolving credit
line expiring on July 31, 2006, and a $1 million equipment loan facility
which, as amended, was available through July 2005. The equipment loan
facility expired in July 2005. Borrowings under the revolving credit line
bear a floating rate of interest at the prime rate and are collateralized
by a lien on all the assets of the company. Under certain circumstances, we
may select a fixed interest rate for a specified period of time of up to
180 days on borrowings based on the current LIBOR rate plus 275% under the
revolving credit facility. We also pay a fee of 025% on unused borrowings
under the revolving credit line. The TD Banknorth Credit Facility imposes
certain quarterly financial covenants on the Company and restricts the
payment of dividends on our common stock and the creation of other liens.
In 2003, we recorded interest expense of approximately $103,000 related to
the write-off of unamortized deferred financing costs from the prior credit
facility.                    42            TRANSACT TECHNOLOGIES INCORPORATED
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
10. BORROWINGS CONTINUED
Concurrent with the signing of the TD Banknorth Credit Facility, we
borrowed $450,000 under the equipment loan facility, which was paid in full
in 2004.
On March 28, 2005, we received a consent from TD Banknorth, N.A. to
permit us to repurchase our common stock pursuant to the terms of the Stock
Repurchase Program as explained in Note 19.
On February 24, 2006, we amended the TD Banknorth Credit Facility to
revise a financial covenant effective December 31, 2005, which resulted in
debt covenant compliance.
The borrowing base of the revolving credit line under the TD Banknorth
Credit Facility is based on the lesser of a $115 million or b 85% of
eligible accounts receivable plus i the lesser of 1 $5,500,000 and 2
45% of eligible raw material inventory plus 50% of eligible finished goods
inventory, less ii $40,000 credit reserve.
As of December 31, 2005, we had no outstanding borrowings on the
revolving credit line. Undrawn commitments under the TD Banknorth Credit
Facility were approximately $11,500,000 at December 31, 2005. However, our
maximum additional available borrowings under the facility were limited to
approximately $6,500,000 at December 31, 2005 based on the borrowing base
of our collateral.
11. COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES
In April 2005, we announced a complaint against FutureLogic, Inc.
FutureLogic, which charges FutureLogic with disseminating false and
misleading statements. We assert claims of defamation and certain other
charges. In May 2005, FutureLogic filed a complaint against us, asserting
false advertising, defamation, trade libel and certain other charges. The
action is currently in the pre-trial motion stage, and, as of December 31,
2005, we are currently unable to estimate any potential liability or range
of loss associated with this litigation. Accordingly, no amounts have been
accrued in the financial statements related to this matter.                    43            TRANSACT TECHNOLOGIES INCORPORATED
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
11. COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES CONTINUED
During the fourth quarter of 2005, we recorded an expense to cost of
goods sold of approximately $135,000 related to estimated
settlement/cancellation payments for non-cancelable purchase orders for
certain excess inventory components related primarily to our Model 850
casino ticket printer.
At December 31, 2005, we were lessee on operating leases for equipment
and real property. The terms of certain leases provide for escalating rent
payments in later years of the lease as well as payment of minimum rent and
real estate taxes. The Company records rent expense related to leases with
escalating rent payments or periods of free rent on a straight-line basis
over the term of the lease. Rent expense was approximately $1,294,000,
$1,098,000 and $1,096,000 in 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. Minimum
aggregate rental payments required under operating leases that have initial
or remaining non-cancelable lease terms in excess of one year as of
December 31, 2005 are as follows: $1,206,000 in 2006; 1,222,000 in 2007;
$853,000 in 2008; $717,000 in 2009; $571,000 in 2010; and $839,000
thereafter. Such payments include those related to the lease of our
Wallingford, CT manufacturing facility, a portion of which has been
recognized within the restructuring accrual described in Note 8.
12. PATENT LICENSE FEES
During 2004, we signed a cross licensing agreement with Seiko Epson.
Under the agreement, Seiko Epson received a license to three of our
patents, and we received a license to eighteen of Seiko Epson patents
relating to printing applications for the point of sale and banking
markets. In addition, we agreed to pay $900,000 as a royalty for the usage
of certain Seiko Epson technology prior to January 1, 2003, which we paid
in full by January 2005. Under the agreement, we continue to pay royalties
on a quarterly basis related to the sales of licensed printers, which is
reflected in cost of sales.
13. STOCK INCENTIVE PLANS AND WARRANTS
STOCK INCENTIVE PLANS. We currently have four primary stock incentive
plans: the 1996 Stock Plan, which provides for the grant of awards to
officers and other key employees of the Company; the 1996 Directors' Stock
Plan, which provides for non-discretionary awards to non-employee
directors; the 2001 Employee Stock Plan, which provides for the grant of
awards to key employees of the Company and other non-employees who may
provide services to the Company; and the 2005 Equity Incentive Plan, which
provides for awards to executives, key employees, directors and
consultants. The plans generally provide for awards in the form of: i
incentive stock options, ii non-qualified stock options, iii restricted
stock, iv restricted stock units, v stock appreciation rights or vi
limited stock appreciation rights. However, the 2001 Employee Stock Plan
does not provide for incentive stock option awards. Options granted under
these plans are at prices equal to 100% of the fair market value of the
common stock at the date of grant. Options granted have a ten-year term and
generally vest over a three- to five-year period, unless automatically
accelerated for certain defined events. Effective upon the approval of the
2005 Equity Incentive Plan on May 25, 2005, no new awards will be made
under the 1996 Stock Plan, the 1996 Directors' Stock Plan or the 2001
Employee Stock Plan. At December 31, 2005, approximately 582,000 shares of
common stock remained available for issuance under the 2005 Equity
Incentive Plan.
EMPLOYEE STOCK PURCHASE PLAN: In May 2000, our shareholders approved
the Employee Stock Purchase Plan the ESPP, under which 75,000 shares of
our common stock were available for issuance to employees beginning June 1,
2000. All full-time employees were eligible to participate in the ESPP at
the beginning of each six-month period the Offering Period, which began
on June 1 and December 1. Eligible employees could elect to withhold up to
5% of their salary to purchase shares of our common stock at a price equal
to 85% of the fair market value of the stock on the first or last day of
each Offering Period, whichever is lower. The ESPP was terminated on May
31, 2005. We issued 2,690, 3,706, and 3,130 shares of common stock under
the ESPP during 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. At December 31, 2005, no
shares remained available for issuance due to the termination of the ESPP.                    44            TRANSACT TECHNOLOGIES INCORPORATED

13. STOCK INCENTIVE PLANS AND WARRANTS CONTINUED
On November 2, 2005, the Compensation Committee of the Board of
Directors approved accelerating the vesting of all outstanding unvested
stock options granted to directors, officers and employees of the Company
under our applicable stock incentive plans. The closing price of our common
stock on the NASDAQ National Market Quotation System to be used for
measurement of compensation as of the date of acceleration was $699. As a
result of the acceleration, options to acquire approximately 109,500 shares
of our common stock, which otherwise would have vested from time to time
over the next four years, become immediately exercisable. All other terms
and conditions applicable to outstanding stock option grants remain in
effect. The option plans under which accelerated grants were issued are our
1996 Stock Plan, 1996 Directors' Stock Plan and the 2001 Employee Stock
Plan.
The Compensation Committee decision to accelerate the vesting of
affected stock options was primarily based upon our required adoption of
FAS 123R effective January 1, 2006. We believe that the acceleration of
vesting of unvested options will eliminate the need to recognize any future
compensation expense in our income statement with respect to these options.
We will recognize compensation expense with respect to stock options
granted after January 1, 2006 pursuant to FAS 123R. We recorded
approximately $26,000 of compensation expense in the fourth quarter of 2005
related to the acceleration of vesting.
RESTRICTED STOCK: Under the 1996 Stock Plan, 2001 Employee Stock Plan
and 2005 Equity Incentive Plan, we have granted shares of restricted common
stock, for no consideration, to our officers, directors and certain key
employees. Restricted stock activity for the 1996 Stock Plan, 2001 Employee
Stock Plan and 2005 Equity Incentive Plan is summarized below                        Year Ended December 31,

average grant price of $982. We granted 81,000 shares of restricted stock
during 2004 at weighted average grant price of $1728. No restricted stock
was granted during 2003. Of the 187,550 shares of restricted stock
outstanding at December 31, 2005, 169,550 shares vest over the original
five-year vesting period, 4,000 shares vest over the original four-year
vesting period and 14,000 shares vest over the original three-year vesting
period. Under certain conditions such as a change in control as defined by
the Plans, vesting may be automatically accelerated.
Unearned compensation for restricted stock award grants is recorded on
the date of grant based on the fair value of such awards. Such unearned
compensation is expensed, using the straight-line method, over the period
during which the related restrictions on such stock lapse. Upon termination
of employment, unvested restricted stock awards are forfeited and the
related compensation expense and unearned compensation previously
recognized are reversed. Compensation expense resulting from these
restricted shares was $458,000, $291,000 and $67,000 during 2005, 2004 and
2003, respectively. Upon adoption of FAS 123R in the first quarter of 2006,
the Company will reverse all amounts previously recorded in Unamortized
Restricted Stock Compensation and continue to record expense as the
restricted stock vests. In the first quarter of 2006, the Company will also
measure a cumulative effect adjustment for estimated forfeitures on
previously recognized restricted stock compensation.                    46            TRANSACT TECHNOLOGIES INCORPORATED

14. STOCKHOLDER RIGHTS PLAN
In December 1997, our Board of Directors adopted a Stockholder Rights
Plan declaring a distribution of one right the Rights for each
outstanding share of our common stock to shareholders of record at December
15, 1997. Initially, each of the Rights will entitle the registered holder
to purchase from the Company one one-thousandth of a share of Series A
Preferred Stock, $001 par value, at a price of $69 per one one-thousandth
of a share. The Rights, however, will not become exercisable unless and
until, among other things, any person or group of affiliated persons
acquires beneficial ownership of 15 percent or more of the then outstanding
shares of the Company Common Stock. If a person, or group of persons,
acquires 15 percent or more of the outstanding Common Stock of the Company
subject to certain conditions and exceptions more fully described in the
Rights Agreement, each Right will entitle the holder other than the
person, or group of persons, who acquired 15 percent or more of the
outstanding Common Stock to purchase Preferred Stock of the Company having
a market value equal to twice the exercise price of the Right. The Rights
are redeemable, under certain circumstances, for $00001 per Right and will
expire, unless earlier redeemed, on December 2, 2007.
On February 16, 1999, we amended the Stockholder Rights Plan to remove
the provision in the plan that stipulated that the plan may be modified or
redeemed only by those members of the Board of Directors who are defined as
continuing directors.
