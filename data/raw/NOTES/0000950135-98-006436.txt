Go2Net, Inc.
We have audited the accompanying balance sheets of Go2Net, Inc. as of September
30, 1998 and 1997 and the related statements of operations, and cash flows for
each of the three years in the period ended September 30, 1998. These financial
statements are the responsibility of the management of Go2Net, Inc. Our
responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on
our audits.
We conducted our audits in accordance with generally accepted auditing
standards. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material
misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting
the amounts and disclosures in financial statements. An audit also includes
assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by
management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.
We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in
all material respects, the financial position of Go2Net, Inc. at September 30,
1998 and 1997, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of
the three years in the period ended September 30, 1998, in conformity with
generally accepted accounting principles.

GO2NET, INC.
NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 1. DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS AND SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS
Go2Net, Inc. The Company http www.go2net.com offers a network of
technology and community-driven Web sites focused on the following categories:
personal finance, search, commerce, and games. The Company also develops
Web-related software. Go2Net properties include: Silicon Investor
the Web premier financial discussion site;
StockSite http www.stocksite.com, which offers proprietary articles,
portfolio tracking tools, company research and news relating to business and
finance; MetaCrawler http www.metacrawler.com, a metasearch service that
combines various existing search/index guides into one service; HyperMart
http www.hypermart.net, the Web leading provider of free business hosting
services; WebMarket http www.webmarket.com, a one-stop comparison shopping
service; and PlaySite http www.playsite.com, a Java-based multiplayer online
games site.
CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS
The Company considers all highly liquid investments with an original maturity of
three months or less to be cash equivalents.
MARKETABLE SECURITIES
The Company classifies its marketable securities as available for sale. At
September 30, 1998 the difference between fair market value and cost was
immaterial, accordingly, unrealized gains and losses on these securities have
not been reflected in the accompanying financial statements. The cost of
securities sold is based on specific identification.
PROPERTY AND EQUIPMENT
Property and equipment are stated at cost. Depreciation is computed using the
straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of 3 to 5 years.
INTANGIBLE ASSETS
Intangible assets consist primarily of the costs associated with acquired and
licensed technology and are recorded at cost. Amortization of intangibles is
recorded using the straight-line method over the shorter of useful lives,
generally 3 years, or the term of the agreement. The recoverability of carrying
values of intangible assets is evaluated on a recurring basis and adjustments,
if any, are made at that time.
CONCENTRATION OF CREDIT RISK
The Company performs ongoing credit evaluations of its customers' financial
conditions and generally does not require collateral on accounts receivable. The
Company maintains allowances for credit losses and such losses have been within
management expectations. Direct write-offs of account receivable were $68,935
for the year ended September 30, 1998. There were no direct write-offs of
account receivable for the years ended September 30, 1997 and 1996,
respectively. No single customer accounted for greater than 10% of total
revenues during the years ended September 30, 1998, 1997 and 1996.
USE OF ESTIMATES
The Company management has made a number of estimates and assumptions relating
to the reporting of assets, liabilities, and expenses to prepare these financial
statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles. Actual
results could differ from those estimates.                    33
34
GO2NET, INC.
NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED REVENUE RECOGNITION
The Company derives its revenue from the sale of advertisements on short-term
contracts. Advertising revenues are recognized ratably over the period in which
the advertisements are displayed. Deferred revenues result from billings in
excess of recognized revenue relating to contracts. Barter transactions are
recorded at the lower of the estimated fair value of advertisements received or
the estimated fair value of the advertisements given. Barter revenue and the
related advertising is recorded based on impressions delivered and received with
the difference recorded as an advance or prepaid. Barter revenue was immaterial
for the years ending September 30, 1998 and 1996 and represented $163,390 of
revenue for the year ended September 30, 1997.
ADVERTISING AND MARKETING EXPENSE
The Company expenses costs associated with advertising and marketing as they are
incurred. Advertising expense was $99,079, $9,717, and $1,730 for 1998, 1997 and
1996, respectively.
NET LOSS PER SHARE
The Company recognizes earnings per share in accordance with Financial
Accounting Standards Board Statement No. 128, Earnings Per Share. The Company
has excluded all convertible preferred stock, warrants and employee stock
options from the computation of basic and diluted earnings per share because all
such securities are anti-dilutive for all periods presented. As a result,
diluted loss per share is the same as basic loss per share, and has not been
presented separately. The computation of basic and diluted earnings per share is
set forth in the statement of operations.
STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION
The Company grants stock options for a fixed number of shares to employees with
an exercise price generally equal to the fair value of the shares at the date of
grant. The Company has elected to adopt the disclosure only provisions of
Statement of Financial Accounting Standards SFAS No. 123, Accounting for
Stock Based Compensation, and accordingly accounts for stock options grants in
accordance with APB Opinion No. 25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees.
Generally, the Company recognizes no compensation expense for its stock option
grants when the exercise price is equal to the fair value of the shares at the
grant date.
RECLASSIFICATIONS
Certain balances have been reclassified to conform to the current year
presentation.
NEW ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS
In June 1997, the FASB issued SFAS No. 130, Reporting Comprehensive Income,
which establishes standards for reporting and display of income and its
components revenue, expenses, gains, and losses in a full set of
general-purpose financial statements. This statement is effective for fiscal
years beginning after December 15, 1997. Reclassification of financial
statements for earlier periods provided for comparative purposes are required.
The Company expects to adopt SFAS 130 for the year ending September 30, 1999.
The adoption of this new accounting standard is not expected to have a material
effect on the Company financial statements.
In June 1997, the FASB issued SFAS No. 131, Disclosure about Segments of an
Enterprise and Related Information, which changes the way public companies
report information about operating segments. SFAS No. 131, which is based on the
management approach to segment reporting, establishes requirements to report
selected segment information quarterly and to report entity-wide disclosures
about products and                    34
35
GO2NET, INC.
NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED services, major customers, and the material countries in which the entity holds
assets and reports revenue.
This statement is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 1997.
Reclassification of financial statements for earlier periods provided for
comparative purposes are required. The Company expects to adopt SFAS 131 for the
year ending September 30, 1999. The adoption of this new accounting standard is
not expected to have a material effect on the Company financial statements.
In March 1998, the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants issued
Statement of Position 98-1 SOP 98-1, Accounting for the Costs of Computer
Software Developed or Obtained for Internal Use, which establishes guidelines
for the accounting for the costs of all computer software developed or obtained
for internal use. The Company is required to adopt SOP 98-1 effective October 1,
1998. The adoption SOP 98-1 is not expected to have a material impact on the
Company financial statements.
In June 1998, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Statement No. 133
SFAS 133, Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities,
which requires that all derivative instruments be recorded on the balance sheet
at their fair value. Changes in the fair value of derivatives are recorded each
period in current earnings or other comprehensive income, depending on whether a
derivative is designated as part of a hedge transaction and, if it is the type
of hedge transaction. The Company currently expects to adopt SFAS 133 for the
year ending September 30, 1999. Management has determined there will be no
material impact on its financial statements resulting from the adoption of SFAS
133 because the Company currently does not use derivative instruments.
