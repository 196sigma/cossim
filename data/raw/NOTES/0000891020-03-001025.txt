37 INDEPENDENT AUDITORS REPORT To the Board of Directors and Shareholders of Assisted Living Concepts, Inc. and
Subsidiaries We have audited the accompanying consolidated
balance sheet of Assisted Living Concepts, Inc. and subsidiaries
as of December31, 2001 and 2002 Successor Company and
the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive
loss, shareholders equity, and cash flows for the years
ended December31, 2000 and 2001 Predecessor Company and
the year ended December31, 2002 Successor Company. These
consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the
Companys management. Our responsibility is to express an
opinion on these consolidated financial statements based on our
audits. We conducted our audits in accordance with
auditing standards generally accepted in the United States of
America. Those standards require that we plan and perform the
audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial
statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes
examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and
disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes
assessing the accounting principles used and significant
estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall
financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits
provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. In our opinion, the consolidated financial
statements referred to above present fairly, in all material
respects, the financial position of Assisted Living Concepts
Inc. and subsidiaries as of December31, 2001 and 2002, and
the results of the Predecessor Companys operations and
cash flows for the years ended December31, 2000, 2001, and
for the Successor Company for the year ended December31,
2002 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted
in the United States of America. As described in Note1 to the consolidated
financial statements, on January1, 2002 the Company
consummated a Joint Plan of Reorganization the Plan which had
been confirmed by the United States Bankruptcy Court. The Plan
resulted in a change of ownership of the Predecessor Company
and, accordingly, effective December31, 2001 the Company
accounted for the change in ownership through fresh-start
reporting. As a result, the consolidated information prior to
December31, 2001 is presented on a different cost basis
than that as of December31, 2001 and, therefore, is not
comparable.

Nature of Business and Summary of Significant
Accounting Policies The Company Assisted Living Concepts, Inc. the
Company owns, leases and operates assisted living
residences which provide housing to older persons who need help
with the activities of daily living such as bathing and
dressing. The Company provides personal care and support
services and makes available routine health care services, as
permitted by applicable law, designed to meet the needs of its
residents. Reorganization On October1, 2001, Assisted Living
Concepts, Inc. the Company, and its wholly owned
subsidiary, Carriage House Assisted Living, Inc. Carriage
House, and together with the Company, the
Debtors each filed a voluntary petition under
Chapter11 of Title11 of the United States Code the
Bankruptcy Code in the United States Bankruptcy
Court for the District of Delaware in Wilmington the
Court, case nos01-10674 and 01-10670,
respectively, which were jointly administered. The Court gave
final approval to the first amended joint plan of reorganization
the Plan on December28, 2001. On January1, 2002 the Effective
Date the Debtors emerged from the proceedings under
Chapter11 of the Bankruptcy Code. The Plan authorized the
issuance as of the Effective Date subject to the Reserve
described below of $4025million aggregate principal
amount of seven-year secured notes the New Senior Secured
Notes, bearing interest at 10% per annum, payable
semi-annually in arrears, and $1525million aggregate
principal amount of ten-year secured notes the New Junior
Secured Notes and collectively with the New Senior Secured
Notes, the New Notes, bearing interest payable in
additional New Junior Secured Notes for three years at 8% per
annum and thereafter payable in cash at 12% per annum, payable
semi-annually in arrears, and c6,500,000 shares of new
common stock, par value $001 the New Common Stock
of the reorganized Company, of which 4% was issued to
shareholders of the Predecessor Company. At the Effective Date, the new Board of Directors
of the reorganized Company consisted of seven members as
follows: Leonard Tannenbaum, Andre Dimitriadis, W. Andrew Adams
Chairman, Matthew Patrick, Mark Holliday, Richard Ladd and Wm.
James Nicol, then the President and Chief Executive Officer of
the Company. Subsequent to the Effective Date, Steven L. Vick
replaced Mr.Nicol as President, Chief Executive Officer
and Director. The Company held back from the initial issuance
of New Common Stock and New Notes on the Effective Date 440,178 of New Senior Secured Notes, $166,775 of New Junior
Secured Notes and 68,241 shares of New Common Stock
collectively, the Reserve to be issued to holders
of general unsecured claims at a later date. The total amount
of, and the identities of all of the holders of, the general
unsecured claims were not known as of the Effective Date, either
because they were disputed or they were not made by their
holders prior to December19, 2001, the cutoff date for
calculating the Reserve the Cutoff Date. Once the
total amount and the identities of the holders of those claims
are determined and the claims agreed, the shares of New Common
Stock and the New Notes held in the Reserve will be distributed
pro rata among the holders of those claims the date of this
distribution, the Subsequent Distribution Date. If the Reserve is insufficient to cover the
general unsecured claims allowed after the Cutoff Date, the
Company and its subsidiaries will have no further liability with
respect to those general unsecured claims and the holders of
those claims will receive proportionately lower distributions of
shares of New Common Stock and New Notes than the holders of
general unsecured claims allowed prior to the Cutoff Date. If
the Reserve exceeds the distributions necessary to cover the
general unsecured claims allowed after the Cutoff Date, the
additional securities remaining in the Reserve will be
distributed among all holders of the general unsecured claims so
as to ensure that each holder of a general unsecured claim
receives, in the aggregate, its pro rata share of the New Common
Stock and the New Notes. In this case, the holders of the
general unsecured 43 ASSISTED LIVING CONCEPTS, INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
Continued claims allowed prior to the Cutoff Date will
receive distributions of securities both on the Effective Date
and on the Subsequent Distribution Date. As a result of the consummation of the Plan, the
Company recognized an extraordinary gain on reorganization as

Fresh Start Reporting Upon emergence from Chapter11 proceedings,
the Company adopted fresh-start reporting in accordance with the
American Institute of Certified Public Accountants Statement of
Position90-7, Financial Reporting By Entities in
Reorganization Under the Bankruptcy Code SOP90-7. In
connection with the adoption of fresh-start reporting, a new
entity has been deemed created for financial reporting purposes.
For financial reporting purposes, the Company adopted the
provisions of fresh-start reporting effective December31,
2001. Consequently, the consolidated balance sheet and related
information at December31, 2001 is labeled Successor
Company, and reflects the Plan and the principles of fresh-start
reporting. Periods presented prior to December31, 2001
have been designated Predecessor Company. In adopting the requirements of fresh-start
reporting as of December31, 2001, the Company was required
to value its assets and liabilities at fair value and eliminate
its accumulated deficit as of December31, 2001. A
$328million reorganization value was determined by the
Company with the assistance of financial advisors in reliance
upon various valuation methods, including discounted projected
cash flow analysis and other applicable ratios and economic
industry information relevant to the operation of the Company
and through negotiations with various creditor parties in
interest. The following reconciliation of the Predecessor
Companys consolidated balance sheet as of
December31, 2001 to that of the Successor Company was
prepared to present the adjustments that give effect to the
reorganization and fresh-start reporting. The adjustments entitled Reorganization reflect
the consummation of the Plan, including the elimination of
existing liabilities subject to compromise, assets conveyed to a
lender and reflect the reorganization value of the Successor
Company. 44 ASSISTED LIVING CONCEPTS, INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
Continued The adjustments entitled Fresh-Start Adjustments
reflect the adoption of fresh start reporting, including the
elimination of goodwill and adjustments to record property,
plant and equipment and other long-term assets and liabilities,
at their fair values. Management estimated the fair value of its
assets and liabilities by utilizing commonly used discounted
cash flow valuation methods.

45 ASSISTED LIVING CONCEPTS, INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
Continued Principles of Consolidation The accompanying consolidated financial
statements include the accounts of the Predecessor Company for
the two years ended December31, 2001, and the Successor
Company as of December31, 2001 and 2002 and the year ended
December31, 2002. All significant intercompany balances
and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. Factors Affecting Comparability of Financial
Information The amounts recorded in the consolidated balance
sheet of the Predecessor Company were materially changed with
the implementation of fresh-start reporting. Consequently, the
consolidated balance sheet of the Successor Company is generally
not comparable to that of the Predecessor Company, principally
due to the adjustment of property, plant and equipment, deferred
financing costs, deferred gains, goodwill, long-term debt and
leases to estimated fair value, the discharge of liabilities
subject to compromise and the recapitalization of the Company.
The Company recorded an extraordinary gain of $795million
from the restructuring of its debt in accordance with the
provisions of the Plan. Fresh-start valuation adjustments of
$1193million were made to reduce the net assets and
liabilities of the Successor Company to fair value as of
December31, 2001. Cash Equivalents and Marketable
Securities Cash equivalents of $11million and
$64million at December31, 2001 and 2002,
respectively, consist of highly liquid investments with
maturities of three months or less at the date of purchase. Any
investments in marketable securities are stated at fair value
with any unrealized gains or losses included as accumulated
other comprehensive loss in shareholders equity. Interest
income is recognized when earned. Leases The Company determines the classification of its
leases as either operating or capital at their inception. The
Company re-evaluates such classification whenever circumstances
or events occur that require the reevaluation of the leases. The Predecessor Company accounted for
arrangements entered into under sale and leaseback agreements
pursuant to Statement of Financial Accounting Standards
SFASNo98, Accounting for Leases. For
transactions that qualify as sales and operating leases, a sale
is recognized and the asset is removed from the books. For
transactions that qualify as sales and capital leases, the sale
is recognized, but the asset remains on the books and a capital
lease obligation is recorded. Transactions that do not qualify
for sales treatment are treated as financing transactions. In
the case of financing transactions, the asset remains on the
books and a finance obligation is recorded as part of long-term
debt. Losses on sale and leaseback agreements are recognized at
the time of the transaction absent indication that the sales
price is not representative of fair value. Gains are deferred
and recognized on a straight-line basis over the initial term of
the lease. In accordance with fresh-start reporting, such gains
were eliminated from the Predecessor Companys books as of
the Effective date. All of the Companys leases contain various
provisions for annual increases in rent, or rent escalators.
Certain of these leases contain rent escalators with future
minimum annual rent increases that are not considered contingent
rents. The total amount of the rent payments under such leases
with non-contingent rent escalators is being charged to expense
on the straight-line method over the term of the leases. The
Company records a deferred credit, included in other
liabilities, to reflect the excess of rent expense over cash
payments. This deferred credit is reduced in the later years of
the lease term as the cash payments exceed the rent expense.
Other liabilities of the Successor Company includes $384,000 of
such deferred credits at December31, 2002. In accordance
with fresh-start reporting, the Predecessor Companys
deferred credit was eliminated as of the Effective Date.
However, lease expense for those leases with non-contingent rent 46 ASSISTED LIVING CONCEPTS, INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
Continued escalators from the Effective Date forward will
continue to be charged to expense on the straight-line method
over the remaining term of the leases. See Note5. Property and Equipment Property and equipment are recorded at cost and
depreciation is computed over the assets estimated useful
lives on the straight-line basis as follows   
Predecessor

Company
Company   
Buildings and building improvements

Equipment under capital lease is recorded at the
net present value of the future minimum lease payments at the
inception of the lease. Amortization of equipment under capital
lease is provided using the straight-line method over the
shorter of the life of the lease or the estimated useful life. As of the Effective Date, the Successor Company
adjusted its property, plant and equipment to estimated fair
value in conjunction with the implementation of fresh-start
reporting. The Successor Company maintains the same policies
concerning transactions affecting property and equipment. The Company evaluates long-lived assets for
impairment whenever facts and circumstances indicate an
assets carrying value may not be recoverable on an
undiscounted cash flow basis. If an impairment is determined to
have occurred, an impairment loss is recognized to the extent
the assets carrying amount exceeds its fair value. Assets
the Company intends to dispose of are reported at the lower of
icarrying amount or iifair value less the cost
to sell. The Successor Company has not recognized any impairment
losses on property. Maintenance and repairs are charged to expense as
incurred, and significant betterments and improvements are
capitalized. Goodwill Goodwill of the Predecessor Company consisted of
costs in excess of the fair value of the net assets acquired in
purchase transactions as of the date of acquisition and was
being amortized over periods ranging between 15 and
20years on a straight-line basis. In accordance with
fresh-start reporting, the Predecessor Companys goodwill
was eliminated as of the Effective Date. Deferred Financing Costs Financing costs related to the issuance of debt
are capitalized as other assets and amortized to interest
expense over the term of the related debt using a method which
approximates the effective interest method. As of the Effective
Date, approximately $38million of net deferred financing
fees associated with the debts that were discharged as a result
of the Plan were eliminated as reorganization and fresh-start
adjustments. Income Taxes The Company uses the asset and liability method
of accounting for income taxes under which deferred tax assets
and liabilities are recognized for the estimated future tax
consequences attributable to the differences between the
financial statement carrying amounts of the existing assets and
liabilities and their respective tax bases temporary
differences. Deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation
allowance when, in the opinion of management, it is more likely
than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets
will not be realized. 47 ASSISTED LIVING CONCEPTS, INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
Continued Unfavorable Leases As of the Effective Date, the Successor Company
revalued its leases in conjunction with the implementation of
fresh-start reporting. Amortization of unfavorable leases is
computed using the straight-line method over the life of the
respective leases. Revenue Recognition Revenue is recognized when services are rendered
and consists of residents fees for basic housing and
support services and fees associated with additional services
such as routine health care and personalized assistance on a fee
for service basis. The collectibility of the accounts receivable
is assessed periodically and a provision for doubtful accounts
is recorded as considered necessary. Classification of Expenses Residence operating expenses exclude all expenses
associated with the Companys corporate home office or
support functions, which have been classified as corporate
general and administrative expense. Net Loss Per Common Share Basic earnings per share EPS is calculated
using net loss attributable to common shares divided by the
weighted average number of common shares outstanding for the
period. Diluted EPS is calculated in periods with net income
using income attributable to common shares considering the
effects of dilutive potential common shares divided by the
weighted average number of common shares and dilutive potential
common shares outstanding for the period. Pursuant to fresh-start accounting, common stock
was adjusted to reflect the capitalization of the Successor
Company in accordance with the Plan. Vested options to purchase 477,000 and 880,000
shares of common stock were outstanding during the years ended
December31, 2000 and 2001, respectively. These options
were excluded from the respective computations of diluted loss
per share, as their inclusion would be antidilutive. All
outstanding options were cancelled upon the Effective Date of
the Plan. Vested options at year-end December31, 2002 were
immaterial. Also excluded from the computations of diluted
loss per share, for the years ended December31, 2000 and
2001 were, 6,685,789 shares of common stock issuable upon
conversion of the Companys convertible subordinated
debentures see Note1 as their inclusion would be
antidilutive. These convertible subordinated debentures were
eliminated upon the Effective Date of the Plan. Segment Reporting Financial Accounting Standards Board Statement
FASB of Financial Accounting Standards
SFASNo131, Disclosure about Segments of an
Enterprise and Related Information requires public
enterprises to report certain information about their operating
segments in a complete set of financial statements to
shareholders. It also requires reporting of certain
enterprise-wide information about the Companys products
and services, its activities in different geographic areas, and
its reliance on major customers. The basis for determining the
Companys operating segments is the manner in which
management operates the business. The Company has no foreign
operations and no customers which provide over 10percent
of gross revenue. The Company reviews operating results at the
residence level; it also meets the aggregation criteria in order
to report the results as one business segment. 48 ASSISTED LIVING CONCEPTS, INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
Continued Use of Estimates The Company has made certain estimates and
assumptions relating to the reporting of assets and liabilities,
and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities, and the
reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting
period to prepare these financial statements in conformity with
accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of
America. Actual results could differ from those estimates.
Significant estimates include professional liability,
workers compensation, fresh start accounting adjustments,
the evaluation of long-lived assets for impairment, and
allowance for doubtful accounts. Workers Compensation and Professional
Liability The Company utilizes third-party insurance for
losses and liabilities associated with workers compensation and
professional liability claims subject to deductible levels.
Losses up to the deductible level are accrued based upon the
Companys estimates of the aggregate liability for claims
incurred based on Company experience. Reclassifications Certain reclassifications have been made in the
prior years financial statements to conform to the current
years presentation. Such reclassifications had no effect
on previously reported net loss or shareholders equity. Fair Value of Financial Instruments The following methods and assumptions were used
to estimate the fair value of each class of financial
instruments for which it is practicable to estimate that value Cash and cash equivalents The
carrying amount approximates fair value because of the short
maturity of those instruments. Long=-term debt The fair value of the
Companys long term debt is estimated based on
1terms for same or similar debt instruments, or
2terms of recently completed transactions of similar
nature or terms offered to the Company, or 3quoted market
rates. The estimated fair values of the Companys
long-term debt is as follows

Stock-based Compensation The Companys stock-based compensation plans
are described in Note10. The company accounts for those
plans under the recognition and measurement principles of APB
Opinion No25, Accounting for Stock Issued to
Employees, and related Interpretations. No stock-based
employee compensation cost is reflected in net income, as all
options granted under those plans had an exercise price equal to
the market value of the underlying common stock on the date of
grant. The following table illustrates the effect on net income
and earnings per share if the company had applied the fair value
recognition provisions of FASB Statement No123,
Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation, to stock-based
employee compensation. 49 ASSISTED LIVING CONCEPTS, INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

Concentration of Credit Risk The Company depends on the economies of Texas,
Indiana, Oregon, Ohio and Washington and to some extent, on the
continued funding of State Medicaid waiver programs in some of
those states. As of December31, 2002, 224% of the
Companys properties were in Texas, 112% in Indiana, 101%
in Oregon, 101% in Ohio and 90% in Washington. Adverse changes
in general economic factors affecting the respective health care
industries or laws and regulator environment in each of these
states, including Medicaid reimbursement rates, could have a
material adverse effect on the Companys financial
condition and results of operations. State Medicaid reimbursement programs constitute
a significant source of revenue for the Company. During the
years ended December31, 2000, 2001, and 2002 direct
payments received from state Medicaid agencies accounted for
approximately 111%, 125%, and 128% respectively, of the
Companys revenue while the tenant paid portion received
from Medicaid residents accounted for approximately 62%, 68 and 75% respectively, of the Companys revenue during
these periods. The Company expects in the future that State
Medicaid reimbursement programs will constitute a significant
source of revenue for the Company. 2. Cash The Companys cash and cash equivalents

The Company has five Oregon leases the
Oregon Leases where the lessor in each case
obtained funding through the sale of bonds issued by the state
of Oregon, Housing and Community Services Department
OHCS. In connection with the Oregon Leases, the
Company entered into Lease Approval Agreements with
OHCS and the lessor, pursuant to which the Company is obligated
to comply with the terms and conditions of certain regulatory
agreements to which the lessor is a party See Note7. The
leases, which have fixed terms of 10years, have been
accounted for as operating leases. Aggregate deposits on these
residences as of December31, 2000, 2001, and 2002 were
$126,000, $90,000, and $136,039, respectively, which are
reflected in other assets. The Company previously had six Oregon
Leases and terminated one of these leases effective
December1, 2001 in accordance with the Plan. The lessor of
this property filed a claim against the Company in the
bankruptcy proceedings regarding the early termination of this
lease. The claim was approved by the Court and resulted in the
issuance of $90,502 of Senior Notes, $34,290 of Junior Notes and
14,031shares of common stock to this lessor. In June 1999, the Company amended all of its 37
leases with LTC. These amendments included provisions to
eliminate future minimum annual rent increases, or rent
escalators, that were not deemed to be contingent rents.
Because of the rent escalators, prior to the amendments, the
Company accounted for rent expense related to such leases on a
straight-line basis. From the date of the amendment forward, the
Company has accounted for the amended leases on a contractual
cash payment basis and amortizes the deferred rent balance, at
the date of the amendment, over the remaining initial term of
the lease. Those amendments also redefined the lease renewal
option with respect to certain leases and provided the lessor
with the option to declare an event of default in the event of a
change of control under certain circumstances. In addition, the
amendments also provide the Company with the ability, subject to
certain conditions, to sublease or assign its leases with
respect to two Washington residences. See Note 9. In accordance with the Companys Plan,
effective January1, 2002, the Company entered into a
Master Lease Agreement with LTC under which 16leases were
consolidated. This Master Lease Agreement provides 51 ASSISTED LIVING CONCEPTS, INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
Continued for aggregate rent reductions of $875,000 per
year and restructures the provision related to minimum rent
increases for the 16properties for the initial remaining
term. As a result of the change in future annual rent increases
as to the 16properties under the Master Lease Agreement,
the Company is required to account for rent expense on a
straight-line basis. In exchange for the rent reduction, LTC
filed a claim in the bankruptcy proceeding to which the Company
did not object in the amount of $2,500,000. The claim was
approved by the Court and entitled LTC to $590,694 of Senior
Secured Notes, $223,803 of Junior Secured Notes and
91,576shares of common stock. Prior to the issuance of any
common stock to LTC, LTC entered into an agreement with
Healthcare Holdings, Inc., a wholly owned subsidiary of CLC
Healthcare, Inc. to allow it to purchase LTCs right to
receive the common stock. The Master Lease Agreement also
provides LTC with the option to exercise certain remedies,
including the termination of the Master Lease Agreement and
certain other LTC leases due to cross-default rights, upon a
change of control under which at least 30% ownership of the
Companys common stock is held by a party or combination of
parties directly or indirectly. LTC has the same option if the
stockholders approve a plan of liquidation or the stockholders
approve a merger or consolidation meeting certain conditions. At
the same time that the Company entered into the Master Lease
Agreement, they also amended 16 other leases with LTC under
which the renewal rights of certain of those leases are tied
together differently than previously with certain other leases. Certain of the Companys leases and loan
agreements contain covenants and cross-default provisions such
that a default on one of those instruments could cause the
Company to be in default on one or more other instruments.
Pursuant to certain lease agreements, the Company restricted
$10million of cash balances as additional collateral see
Note3. In October 2001, the Company repurchased 16
previously leased properties from one lessor. These properties
were purchased with funds borrowed from GE Capital formerly
Heller Healthcare Finance, Inc. see Notes1 and 7. On January1, 2002 the Company emerged from
the proceedings under Chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code. The
Companys Plan of reorganization included the Company
conveying two facilities to one lender in satisfaction of
$59million of debt. The Company then leased these two
properties, one in South Carolina and one in Pennsylvania, from
this lender under a new Master Lease, incorporating two existing
leases as well. Terms under the Master Lease on the South
Carolina facility conveyed to the lender effective
January1, 2002, include monthly payments in the amount of
$19,000, $20,000, $21,000 and $21,667 for the years ended
December31, 2002, 2003, 2004 and all years thereafter
until the end of the lease term, respectively. Terms under the
Master Lease for the Pennsylvania facility conveyed effective
January1, 2002, include monthly payments of $22,330
increasing to $23,780 over the next four years, expiring in
2006. The Companys Plan of reorganization also included
the amendment of two existing leases with the same lender. Such
leases were amended under the Master Lease to provide base
rental rates of $2,000 per month with rent escalation clauses
based upon revenue levels with rental rates not to exceed
$22,000 per month, expiring in 2006. As of December31, 2002, future minimum
annual lease payments under operating leases are as follows in

Continued At December31, 2002, mortgage loans include
three fixed rate loans secured by seven Texas residences, three
Oregon residences and three New Jersey residences. These loans
collectively require monthly principal and interest payments of
$230,000, with balloon payments of $118million 53million and $72million due at maturity in May
2008, August 2008 and September 2008, respectively. These loans
bear fixed annual interest rates between 758% to 879%. Prior to the Companys Plan of
Reorganization, mortgage loans also included a $59million
mortgage loan at a fixed annual interest rate of 879%, secured
by one Pennsylvania residence and one South Carolina residence.
In accordance with the Companys Plan of Reorganization,
the Company conveyed two facilities to this lender in
satisfaction of the $59million of debt. The Company
continues to operate these residences under operating leases
with the same lender. See Notes 1 and 5. Housing and Urban Development HUD
Insured mortgages include three separate loan agreements entered
into in 2001. These are fixed rate mortgages, each of which is
secured by one facility in Texas. These loans mature between
July1, 2036 and August1, 2036 and collectively
require monthly principal and interest payments of $47,493. The
loans bear fixed annual interest rates between 740% and 755%. GE Capital credit facility is a secured line of
credit up to $440million. This is a variable rate credit
facility, secured by 31 facilities. This credit facility matures
in January 2005, required monthly principal payments of $50,000
for 2002, and requires monthly principal payments of $65,000 for
2003 and $80,000 for 2004. The interest on the credit facility
is calculated at LIBOR plus 45%, floating monthly not to be
less than 8% and is payable monthly in arrears. On January1, 2002 the Debtors emerged from
the proceedings under Chapter11 of the Bankruptcy Code.
The Companys Plan of reorganization included the issuance
of $4025million aggregate principal amount of seven-year
secured notes the New Senior Secured Notes,
bearing interest at 10% per annum, payable semi-annually in
arrears, and $1525million aggregate principal amount of
ten-year secured notes the New Junior Secured Notes
and collectively with the New Senior Secured Notes, the
New Notes, bearing interest payable in additional
New Junior Secured Notes for three years at 8% per annum and
thereafter payable in cash at 12% per annum, payable
semi-annually in arrears. The New Junior Secured Notes were
issued at a discount of $26million. The discount will be
amortized over the life of the New Junior Secured Notes using
the effective interest method. The New Notes are secured by 52
properties. See Note1. Of the $501million outstanding in New
Notes, $200million is payable to related parties. See
Note9. As of the Effective Date, the Successor Company
revalued its long-term debt in conjunction with the
implementation of fresh-start reporting. At December31,
2001, an adjustment of $31million was recorded to reduce
long-term debt to its fair market value. Amortization of this

Current portion of long-term debt on the balance

related to assets held for sale. This amount reflects a portion
of scheduled maturities after December31, 2003 55 ASSISTED LIVING CONCEPTS, INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
Continued that the Company believes will be paid out of the
proceeds of future facility sales transactions. The amount
classified as current maturities is equal to the net book value
of the assets classified as held for sale, based on the
Companys estimate that net proceeds will equal or exceed
such amount. The ultimate amount of debt repayment related to
facility sale transactions, when completed, may be higher. The Company has a series of reimbursement
agreements with U.S.Bank for letters of credit that
support certain of our Revenue bonds payable, which total
approximately $232million as of December31, 2002.
The Companys credit agreements with U.S. Bank contain
restrictive covenants which include compliance with certain
financial ratios. Pursuant to amendments to these credit
agreements, the Company provided additional cash collateral in
exchange for the waiver of certain possible defaults related to
the delivery of financial statements and compliance with
financial covenants, including an amendment to certain financial
covenants. The amendments also provides for the release of the
additional collateral upon the achievement of specified
performance targets, provided that the Company is in compliance
with the other terms of the loan agreements. The Predecessor
Company achieved certain of these specified targets during
previous years. The Company has $43million in additional
cash collateral deposited with U.S.Bank. In May 2002, we amended our existing agreement
with U.S.Bank, establishing new covenants, with which we
were in compliance as of December31, 2002. Failure to
comply with these covenants would constitute an event of
default, which would allow U.S.Bank to declare any amounts
outstanding under the loan documents to be due and payable. In addition to the debt agreements with OHCS
related to the six owned residences in Oregon, the Company has
entered into Lease Approval Agreements with OHCS and the lessor
of the Oregon Leases, which obligates the Company to comply with
the terms and conditions of the underlying trust deed relating
to the leased buildings. Under the terms of the OHCS debt
agreements, the Company is required to maintain a capital
replacement escrow account to cover expected capital expenditure
requirements for the Oregon Leases and the six OHCS loans, which
as of December31, 2000, 2001, and 2002 was $422,000 363,000, and $417,000, respectively, and is reflected in other
assets in the accompanying financial statements. In addition,
for the six OHCS loans in the Companys name, a contingency
escrow account is required. This account had a balance of
$136,000, and $136,000, respectively, as of December31,
2001, and 2002, and is reflected in other current assets.
Distribution of any assets or income of any kind by the Company
is limited to once per year after all reserve and loan payments
have been made, and only after receipt of written authorization
from OHCS. As of December31, 2000 and 2001, the
Company was restricted from distributing $278,000 and $322,000
respectively, of income, in accordance with the terms of the
loan agreements and Lease Approval Agreements with OHCS. As a further condition of the debt agreements,
the Company is required to comply with the terms of certain
regulatory agreements which provide, among other things, that in
order to preserve the federal income tax exempt status of the
bonds, the Company is required to lease at least 20% of the
units of the projects to low or moderate income persons as
defined in Section142d of the Internal Revenue Code.
There are additional requirements as to the age and physical
condition of the residents with which the Company must also
comply. Non-compliance with these restrictions may result in an
event of default and cause acceleration of the scheduled
repayment. 8. Income Taxes The Company incurred a loss for both financial
reporting and tax return purposes for the years ended
December31, 2000, 2001 and 2002, and as such, there was no
current or deferred tax provision allocated to the loss from
continuing operations, discontinued operations or to the
extraordinary gain on reorganization. 56 ASSISTED LIVING CONCEPTS, INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

The valuation allowance for deferred tax assets
as of December31, 2001 and 2002 was $436million and
$450million, respectively. The increase in the total
valuation allowance for the years ended December31, 2000,
2001 and 2002 was $61million, $181million, and
$14million, respectively. At December31, 2002, the Company has
approximately $1014million of net operating loss
NOLcarryforwards which will expire between 2009 and
2022. These NOLs have been reduced to $223million as a
result of the discharge and cancellation of various prepetition
liabilities under the Plan. The reduction of the NOLs will be
effective on January1, 2003. The NOLs remaining after the application of the
cancellation of indebtedness provisions are subject to certain
provisions of the Internal Revenue Code which restricts the
utilization of the losses. In addition, any net unrealized
built-in losses resulting from the excess of tax basis over the
carrying value of the Companys assets primarily property
and equipment as of the Effective Date, which are recognized
within five years are also subject to these provisions.
Section382 of the Internal Revenue Code imposes
limitations on the utilization of the loss carryforwards and
built-in losses after certain changes of ownership of a loss
company. The Company is deemed to be a loss company for these
purposes. Under these provisions, the Companys 57 ASSISTED LIVING CONCEPTS, INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
Continued ability to utilize these loss carryforwards and
built-in losses in the future will generally be subject to an
annual limitation of approximately $16million. There can be no assurances that the Company will
be able to utilize these NOLs or built-in losses and therefore
management has established a 100percent valuation
allowance to offset the associated net deferred tax asset. Pursuant to SOP 90-7, the income tax benefit, if
any, of any future realization of the remaining NOL
carryforwards and other deductible temporary differences
existing as of the Effective Date will be recorded as an
adjustment to additional paid-in capital. 9. Related Party Transactions

and $20million of the Companys New Notes see
Note7. The Company currently leases 37properties
1,426 units from LTC. See Note5. Mr.Dimitriadis
owns $1million of the Companys New Note. The Company incurred annual lease expense of
$89million, $88million and $90million for
the years ended December31, 1999, 2000 and 2001,
respectively, pursuant to these leases. In June1999, the Company amended all of its
37 LTC leases. These amendments eliminated provisions related to
future minimum annual rent increases, or rent
escalators, which prior to the amendments required the
Company to account for rent expense related to such leases on a
straight-line basis. From the date of the amendment forward, the
Company is accounting for the amended leases on a contractual
cash payment basis and amortizing the deferred rent balance as
of the date of the amendment over the remaining initial term of
the leases. Those amendments also redefined the lease renewal
option with respect to certain leases and provided the lessor
with the option to declare an event of default in the event of a
change of control under certain circumstances. In addition, the
amendments provide the Company with the ability, subject to
certain conditions, to sublease or assign its leases with
respect to two Washington residences. In accordance with our Plan, effective
January1, 2002, we entered into a Master Lease Agreement
with LTC under which 16 leases were consolidated. This Master
Lease Agreement provides for aggregate rent reductions of
$875,000 per year and restructures the provision related to
minimum rent increases for the 16properties for the
initial remaining term. As a result of the change in future
annual rent increases as to the 16properties under the
Master Lease Agreement, we are required to account for rent
expense on a straight-line basis. In exchange for the rent
reduction, LTC filed a claim in the bankruptcy proceeding to
which we did not object in the amount of $2,500,000. The claim
was approved by the Court and entitled LTC to $590,694 of Senior
Secured Notes, $223,803 of Junior Secured Notes and
91,576shares of common stock. Prior to the issuance of any
common stock to LTC, LTC entered into an agreement with
Healthcare Holdings, Inc., a wholly owned subsidiary of CLC
Healthcare, Inc. to allow it to purchase LTCs right to
receive the 58 ASSISTED LIVING CONCEPTS, INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

provides LTC with the option to exercise certain remedies,
including the termination of the Master Lease Agreement and
certain other LTC leases due to cross-default rights, upon a
change of control under which at least 30% ownership of our
common stock is held by a party or combination of parties
directly or indirectly. LTC has the same option if the
stockholders approve a plan of liquidation or the stockholders
approve a merger or consolidation meeting certain conditions. At
the same time that we entered into the Master Lease Agreement,
we also amended 16 other leases with LTC under which the renewal
rights of certain of those leases are tied together differently
than previously with certain other leases. MYFM Capital,
LLC and BET Associates In December2000, the Company entered into
an agreement with MYFM Capital, LLC MYFM under
which the Company could establish a line of credit with BET

Stock Predecessor
Company Prior to January1, 2002, the effective date
of the Companys Plan of reorganization, the Company had
two Stock Option Plans the Option Plans which
provided for the issuance of incentive and non-qualified stock
options and restricted stock. Except for the Board of Directors
administering the options of the non 59 ASSISTED LIVING CONCEPTS, INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
Continued employee Directors, the Option Plans were
administered by the Compensation Committee of the Board of
Directors which established the terms and provisions of options
granted under the Option Plans, not otherwise provided under the
Option Plans. Incentive options could be granted only to
officers or other full-time employees of the Company, while
non-qualified options could be granted to directors, officers or
other employees of the Company, or consultants who provide
services to the Company. The Amended and Restated 1994 Stock Option Plan
combined an incentive and nonqualified stock option plan, a
stock appreciation rights SAR plan and a stock
award plan including restricted stock. The 1994 Plan was a
long-term incentive compensation plan and was designed to
provide a competitive and balanced incentive and reward program
for participants. This plan was cancelled with the emergence of
the Company from bankruptcy on January1, 2002. Under the Amended and Restated 1994 Stock Option
Plan the 1994 Plan, the Company could grant
options or award restricted stock to its employees, consultants
and other key persons for up to 2,208,000shares of common
stock. The exercise price of each option equaled the market
price of the Companys stock on the date of grant. Each
option expired on the date specified in the option agreement,
but not later than the tenth anniversary of the date on which
the option was granted. Options typically vested three years
from the date of issuance and typically were exercisable within
seven years from the date of vesting. Each option was
exercisable in equal installments as designated by the
Compensation Committee or the Board at the option price
designated by the Compensation Committee or the Board, as
applicable; however, incentive options could not be less than
the fair market value of the common stock on the date of grant.
All options were nontransferable and subject to adjustment upon
changes in the Companys capitalization. The Board of
Directors, at its option, could discontinue or amend the 1994
Plan at any time, provided that certain conditions were
satisfied. Under the Non-Executive Employee Equity
Participation Plan of Assisted Living Concepts, Inc. the
Non-Officer Plan the Company could grant
consultants and non-executives up to 1,000,000shares of
Common Stock pursuant to non-qualified options granted under the
Non-Officer Plan. Officers, directors and significant employees
of the Company were not eligible to participate in the
Non-Officer Plan. Following is the per share weighted-average fair
value of each option grant as estimated on the date of grant
using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model with the following
weighted-average assumptions. There were no options granted
during 2001 and all options were cancelled effective
December31, 2001 in accordance with the Companys
Plan of reorganization, therefore the following table excludes
any data related to 2001. These plans were cancelled when the
company emerged from bankruptcy.

Successor Company The Successor Company had no options outstanding
at December31, 2001. On May8, 2002, the shareholders approved a
new Stock Option Plan. The Stock Option Plan consists of two
plans, one pertaining solely to the grant of incentive stock
options and one pertaining to the grant of other incentive
awards, including non-qualified stock options. The Stock Option
Plan is intended to obtain, retain services of, and provide
incentive for, directors, key employees and consultants. The
Stock Option Plan allows for grants or awards of incentive stock
options, non-qualified stock options, stock appreciation rights,
restricted stock, performance awards, dividend equivalents,
deferred stock and stock payments. Under the Stock Option Plan, the aggregate number
of shares which may be issued upon exercise of options or other
awards shall not exceed 650,000. Except for non-employee
directors, the exercise price and vesting period of each option
is to be set by the Companys Compensation Committee of its
Board of Directors, but the exercise price may not be less than
the deemed fair value of the Companys stock on the date of
grant. Each option will expire on the date specified in the
option agreement, but not later than the tenth anniversary of
the date on which the option was granted. The Board of
Directors, at its option, may discontinue or amend the Stock
Option Plan at any time, provided that certain conditions are
satisfied. Following is the per share weighted-average fair

Workers Compensation The Company utilizes third-party insurance for
losses and liabilities associated with workers compensation
claims subject to deductible levels of $250,000 per occurrence
for all claims incurred beginning January1, 2000. Claims
incurred prior to January1, 2000 were fully insured.
Losses up to this deductible level are accrued based upon the
Companys estimates of the aggregate liability for claims
incurred based on Company experience. At December31, 2001
and 2002, other current liabilities includes reserves for
workers compensation claims payable of approximately
$25million and $27million, respectively. In addition, the Company maintains cash deposits
as required by the insurance carrier. At December31, 2001
and 2002, such deposits were $28million and
$47million, respectively. These deposits are utilized to
pay claims as costs are incurred.   
12.
Professional Liability The Company utilizes third-party insurance for
losses and liabilities associated with professional liability
claims subject to deductible levels of $100,000 per occurrence
for the year ended December31, 2000 and retention levels
of $250,000 for all states except Florida and Texas, where the
retention levels were $500,000 per occurrence, for the year
ended December31, 2001 and 2002. If a lawsuit or claim
arises which ultimately results in an uninsured loss or a loss
in excess of insured limits, such an outcome could have a
material adverse effect on the Company. Losses up to these deductible and retention
levels are accrued based upon the Companys estimates of
the aggregate liability for claims incurred based on Company
experience. At December31, 2001 and 2002, other current
liabilities includes reserves for professional liability claims
payable of approximately $10million, and
$16million respectively.   
13.
Legal Proceedings   
Insurance Coverage Dispute In September, 2000, the Company reached an
agreement to settle the class action litigation relating to the
restatement of its consolidated financial statements for the
years ended December31, 1996 and 1997 and the first three
fiscal quarters of 1998. This agreement received final court
approval on November30, 2000 and the Company was dismissed
from the litigation with prejudice. On September28, 2001,
the Company made its final installment of $10million on
its promissory note for the class action litigation settlement.
Although the Company was dismissed from the litigation with
prejudice, a dispute arose with the Companys corporate
liability insurance 62 ASSISTED LIVING CONCEPTS, INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
Continued carriers. At the time the Company settled the
class action litigation, the Company and the insurance carriers
agreed to resolve this dispute through binding arbitration, and
the Company filed a complaint for a declaratory judgment that
the Company was not liable to the carriers as claimed. The
carriers counter-claimed to recover an amount capped at
$40million. After filing for bankruptcy on October1,
2001, the Company made a motion for dismissal of the
Companys complaint for declaratory relief in the
arbitration based upon having filed for bankruptcy protection.
An objection was filed to the Companys motion, and one of
the Companys insurance carriers filed a proof of claim in
the amount of $40million in the bankruptcy proceeding.
The Company disputed that claim. In January 2003, the Company
and the insurance carrier agreed to settle all outstanding
claims and provide mutual releases from the matters arising from
the class action litigation. Upon approval by the bankruptcy
court of the stipulated settlement, which approval was received
March12, 2003, the insurance carrier has agreed to
withdraw its claim against the Company. In addition to the matter referred to in the
immediately preceding paragraphs, the Company is involved in
various lawsuits and claims arising in the normal course of
business. In the aggregate, such other suits and claims should
not have a material adverse effect on the Companys
financial condition, results of operations, cash flow and
liquidity.   
14.
Employee Benefit Plans The Company has a 401k Savings Plan the
Savings Plan which is a defined contribution plan
covering employees of Assisted Living Concepts, Inc. who have
one year of service and are age 21 or older. Each year

matching contributions as determined annually by ALCs
Board of Directors. Contributions are subject to certain
limitations. The Company has not made any contributions to this
Savings Plan.
