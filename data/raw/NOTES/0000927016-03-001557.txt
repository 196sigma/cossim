39 Table of Contents IDX SYSTEMS CORPORATION 
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS December 31, 2002 
1.SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES Nature of Business and Basis of Presentation IDX Systems Corporation IDX or the Company provides healthcare information systems and services to large integrated healthcare delivery enterprises principally located in the United States. Revenues are derived from the
licensing of software, hardware sales, providing maintenance and services related to systems sales and providing medical transcription services. In March of 2002, the Financial Accounting Standards Board FASB Emerging Issues Task Force EITF issued EITF No. 01-14, Issue
No. 01-14 of the Financial Accounting Standards Board FASB Emerging Issues Task Force EITF No. 01-14. EITF No. 01-14 states that customer reimbursements received for out-of-pocket expenses incurred should be
characterized on the income statement as revenue. These expenses include, but are not limited to, airfare, mileage, hotel stays, out-of-town meals, photocopies, and telecommunications and facsimile charges. Service revenue and cost of service
expenses have been restated for all periods presented to reflect this change resulting in no change to net income. Principles of Consolidation The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company, its subsidiaries and through April 19, 2001, a real estate
trust, BDP Realty Associates BDP. Investments in unconsolidated affiliates are accounted for by the equity method when we hold more than 20% but less than 50% interest, or below 20% interest but have significant influence over the operations of
the companies. Investments in entities over which IDX exerts no significant influence and representing an ownership interest of less than 20%, are accounted for under the cost method. Through April 19, 2001, the Companys consolidated
financial statements include the accounts of BDP, a real estate trust owned by certain stockholders and key employees of the Company whose real estate was leased exclusively by the Company. All transactions between the Company and BDP through April
19, 2001 were eliminated. Minority interest represents net income and equity of BDP through April 2001. On April 19, 2001, the Company acquired the Companys corporate headquarters from BDP for $150 million in cash, which was the fair market
value as determined by independent appraisers. Effective with the date of the acquisition, the Company no longer consolidates BDP. On January 8, 2001, the Company sold certain operations of its majority owned subsidiary, ChannelHealth Incorporated
ChannelHealth to Allscripts Healthcare Solutions, Inc. Allscripts, a public company. see Note 2 IDX owns approximately 20% of Allscripts outstanding common stock and accounts for its investment in Allscripts under
the equity method of accounting. Certain
reclassifications have been made in the accompanying financial statements to conform to the 2002 presentation. Significant Estimates and Assumptions The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States requires management to make significant estimates and assumptions that affect
the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial 
40 Table of Contents IDX SYSTEMS CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTSContinued
December 31, 2002 
statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods. Significant estimates and assumptions by
management affect the Companys revenue recognition, allowance for doubtful accounts, deferred tax assets, certain accrued expenses, amortization periods, capitalized software, intangible and long-lived assets and restructuring charges. Actual
results could differ from those estimates. Revenue
Recognition Revenue Recognition -IDX
licenses software and sells hardware, related ancillary products and transcription services to customers through our direct sales force. IDX generally recognizes revenue from software license, hardware, and related ancillary product revenues using
the residual method when: persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, which is typically when a customer has signed a non-cancelable sales and software license agreement delivery, which is typically FOB shipping point, is complete for the software either physically or electronically, hardware and related ancillary products the customers fee is deemed to be fixed or determinable and free of contingencies or significant uncertainties; collectibility is probable; and vendor specific objective evidence of fair value exists for all undelivered elements, typically maintenance and professional services. Under the residual method, IDX defers revenue recognition of
the fair value of the undelivered elements, allocates the remaining portion of the arrangement fee to the delivered elements and recognize its as revenue, assuming all other conditions for revenue recognition have been satisfied. IDX recognizes
substantially all of our product revenue in this manner. If IDX cannot determine the fair value of any undelivered element included in an arrangement, IDX will defer revenue recognition until all elements are delivered, services are performed or
until fair value can be objectively determined. As part of an arrangement, IDX typically sells maintenance contracts as well as professional services to customers. Maintenance services include telephone and Web-based support as well as rights to unspecified upgrades and
enhancements, when and if we make them generally available. Professional services are deemed to be non-essential and typically are for implementation planning, loading of software, installation of hardware, training, building simple interfaces,
running test data, and assisting in the development and documentation of process rules, and best practices consulting. IDX recognizes revenues from maintenance services ratably over the term of the maintenance contract period based on vendor specific
objective evidence of fair value. Vendor specific objective evidence of fair value is based upon the amount charged for maintenance when purchased separately, which is typically the contracts renewal rate. Maintenance services are typically
stated separately in an arrangement. IDX
generally recognizes revenues from professional services based on vendor specific objective evidence of fair value when: 1 a non-cancelable agreement for the services has been signed or a customers purchase order has been received; and 2
the professional services have been delivered. Vendor specific objective evidence of fair value is based upon the price charged when professional services are sold separately and is typically based on an hourly rate for professional services.
41 Table of Contents IDX SYSTEMS CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTSContinued
December 31, 2002 
IDX
generally recognizes revenue from transcription services based on a reliable, verifiable and objectively determinable measure of fair value when: 1 a non-cancelable agreement for the services has been signed or a customers purchase order has
been received; and 2 the transcription services have been delivered. We base the fair value of transcription services upon the price charged when these services are sold separately. Transcription services are typically charged at a per line rate.
IDXs arrangements with customers generally
include acceptance provisions. However, these acceptance provisions are typically based on our standard acceptance provision, which provides the customer with a right to a refund if the arrangement is terminated because the product did not meet our
published specifications. This right generally expires 30 days after installation. The product is deemed accepted unless the customer notifies the Company otherwise. Generally, IDX determines that these acceptance provisions are not substantive and
historically have not been exercised, and therefore should be accounted for as a warranty in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 5. At the time IDX enters into an arrangement, the Company assesses the probability of collection of the fee and the terms granted to the
customer. The Companys typical payment terms include a deposit and subsequent payments based on specific milestone events and dates. The Companys payment terms are less than 90 days and typically amounts are due within 30 days of invoice
date. If the Company considers the payment terms for the arrangement to be extended or if the arrangement includes a substantive acceptance provision, the Company defers revenue not meeting the criterion for recognition under SOP 97-2 and classifies
this revenue as deferred revenue, including deferred product revenue. IDX recognizes deferred revenue, assuming all other conditions for revenue recognition have been satisfied, when the payment of the arrangement fee becomes due and/or when the
uncertainty regarding acceptance is resolved as generally evidenced by written acceptance or payment of the arrangement fee. Additionally, the Company periodically enters into certain long-term contracts where the Company generally recognizes revenue on a
percentage of completion basis using labor input measures. IDX recognizes losses, if any, on fixed price contracts when the loss is determined. IDX records revenue in excess of billings on long-term service contracts as unbilled receivables and
include in trade accounts receivable. IDX records billings in excess of revenue recognized on service contracts as deferred income until revenue recognition criteria are met. Software Development Costs Costs incurred in the research, design and development of software for sale to others are charged to expense until technological
feasibility is established. Software development costs incurred after the establishment of technological feasibility and until the product is available for general release are capitalized, provided recoverability is reasonably assured. Technological
feasibility is established upon the completion of a working model. Software development costs, when material, are stated at the lower of unamortized cost or net realizable value. Net realizable value for each software product is assessed based on
anticipated profitability applicable to revenues of the related product in future periods. Amortization of capitalized software costs begins when the related product is available for general release to customers and is provided for using the
straight-line method over a one to two year life or the products estimated economic life, if shorter. Capitalized software development costs are $27 million and $21 million at December 31, 2002 and 2001, respectively, net of accumulated
amortization. Amortization of capitalized software amounted to $24 million, $21 million and $223,000 in 2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively. Excluding capitalized software development costs and the related amortization expense, research and
development costs were $501 million, $413 million and $492 million in 2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively. 
42 Table of Contents IDX SYSTEMS CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTSContinued
December 31, 2002 
Cash Equivalents
The Company considers highly liquid
investments with a maturity of three months or less when purchased, to be cash equivalents. Shipping Costs Shipping costs on goods shipped to customers are included in cost of system sales. Financial Instruments The Companys financial instruments consist of cash and cash equivalents, marketable securities, trade receivables, accounts payable, accrued expenses, and notes payable. The carrying value of
these financial instruments approximates fair value due to their short term to maturity. Financial instruments that potentially subject the Company to a concentration of credit risk principally consist of cash and cash equivalents, marketable
securities and trade receivables. All of the
Companys cash equivalents and marketable securities are maintained by major financial institutions. The Companys marketable securities generally consist of high credit quality instruments, primarily U.S. Government and Federal Agency
obligations, tax-exempt municipal obligations and corporate obligations with contractual maturities of a year or less. Substantially all of the Companys customers are large integrated healthcare delivery enterprises principally located in the United
States. The Company performs ongoing credit evaluations of the financial condition of its customers and generally does not require collateral. Although the Company is directly affected by the overall financial condition of the healthcare industry,
management does not believe significant credit risk exists at December 31, 2002. The Company maintains an allowance for doubtful accounts based on accounts past due according to contractual terms and historical collection experience. Actual losses
when incurred are charged to the allowance. The Companys losses related to collection of trade accounts receivables have consistently been within managements expectations. Marketable Securities The Companys marketable securities have been classified as available-for-sale at December 31, 2002 and 2001 and are carried at fair
value based on quoted market values. The cost of marketable securities sold is based on the specific identification method. Interest and dividends on securities classified as available-for-sale are included in interest income. Realized gains and
losses and declines in value judged to be other-than temporary on available-for-sale securities are included in other income. Unrealized gains and losses, net of income tax effect, are reported as a separate component of stockholders equity.
Property and Equipment Real estate, which includes land, buildings and related
improvements, is stated at cost. Buildings and related improvements are depreciated using the straight-line method over their estimated useful lives of 30 to 40 years. Equipment is stated at cost and is depreciated straight-line over its estimated
useful life of two to five years for computer equipment and five to ten years for furniture and fixtures. Leasehold improvements are amortized using the straight-line method over the lesser of the term of the respective lease or the estimated useful
life of the asset. Costs of developing and obtaining software for internal use are accounted for in accordance with SOP No. 98-1, Accounting for the Costs of Computer Software Developed for Internal Use, and are included in
Property and Equipment. These costs are amortized over their estimated useful life of five years. 
43 Table of Contents IDX SYSTEMS CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTSContinued
December 31, 2002 
Long-Lived Asset
Impairment The Company continually
evaluates whether events or circumstances have occurred that indicate that the estimated remaining useful life of long-lived assets excluding goodwill, which is immaterial may warrant revision or that the carrying value of these assets may be
impaired. During this review, the Company reevaluates the significant assumptions used in determining the original cost and estimated lives of long-lived assets. Although the assumptions may vary from asset to asset, they generally include operating
results, cash flows and other indicators of value. Management then determines whether the remaining useful life continues to be appropriate or whether there has been an impairment of long-lived assets based primarily upon whether expected future
undiscounted cash flows are sufficient to support the assets recovery. If impairment exists, the Company would adjust the carrying value of the asset to fair value, generally determined by a discounted cash flow analysis. Income Taxes The Company accounts for income taxes using the liability
method as required by Statement of Financial Accounting Standard SFAS No. 109, Accounting for Income Taxes. Under this method, deferred income taxes are recognized for the future tax consequences of differences between the tax
and financial accounting of assets and liabilities at the end of each reporting period. Deferred income taxes are based on enacted tax laws and statutory tax rates applicable to the periods in which the differences are expected to affect taxable
income. A valuation allowance is established when necessary to reduce deferred tax assets to the amounts expected to be realized. Income tax expense is the tax payable for the period and the change during the period in deferred tax assets and
liabilities. Comprehensive Income Comprehensive income loss is comprised of two components,
net income loss and other comprehensive income loss. Other comprehensive income loss consists of unrealized gains and losses on the Companys available-for-sale securities. Accounting For Stock Based Compensation The Company accounts for its stock-based compensation plan under Accounting Principal Bulletin Opinion
APB No. 25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees. SFAS No. 123, Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation, establishes the fair-value-based method of accounting for stock-based compensation plans. The Company has
adopted the disclosure-only alternative for options granted to employees and directors under SFAS No. 123, which requires disclosure of the pro forma effects on earnings as if SFAS No. 123 had been adopted, as well as certain other information.
Options granted to scientific advisory board members and other non-employees are recorded at fair value based on the fair value measurement criteria of SFAS No. 123. Compensation expense, computed using the Black-Scholes option pricing model, of
$529, $167 and $68 was recorded in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations for the years ended December 31, 2000, 2001 and 2002, respectively The Company has computed the pro forma disclosures required under SFAS No. 123 for all stock options granted to employees and directors of
the Company as of December 31, 2002, 2001 and 2000, using the Black-Scholes option pricing model prescribed by SFAS No. 123.

New Accounting
Standards In October 2001, the FASB issued
SFAS No. 144, Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets. SFAS No. 144 addresses financial accounting and reporting for the impairment or disposal of long-lived assets and does not apply to goodwill or intangible
assets that are not being amortized and certain other long-lived assets. This Statement supersedes SFAS No. 121, Accounting for the Impairment of Long-Lived Assets and for Long-Lived Assets to Be Disposed Of and the accounting and
reporting of APB Opinion No. 30 Reporting the Results of Operations Reporting the Effects of Disposal of a Segment of a Business and Extraordinary, Unusual and Infrequently Occurring Events and Transactions, for the disposal of a
segment of a business as previously defined in that Opinion. SFAS No. 144 is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2001. The adoption of SFAS No. 144 had no impact on the Companys financial
position, results of operations or cash flows. In November 2002, the FASB issued FIN 45, Guarantors Accounting and Disclosure Requirements for Guarantees, Including Indirect Guarantees of Indebtedness of Others. FIN 45 requires that upon issuance of a
guarantee, the guarantor must recognize a liability for the fair value of the obligation it assumes under the guarantee. The disclosure provisions of FIN 45 are effective for financial statements of interim or annual periods ending after December
15, 2002. The provisions for initial recognition and measurement are effective on a prospective basis for guarantees that are issued or modified after December 31, 2002, irrespective of a guarantors year-end. The Company is currently
evaluating the requirements and impact, if any, of FIN 45 on its consolidated results of operations and financial position. In January 2003, the FASB issued FIN 46, Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities, to expand upon and strengthen
existing accounting guidance that addresses when a company should include in its financial statements the assets, liabilities and activities of another entity. Until now, a company generally has included another entity in its consolidated financial
statements only if it controlled the entity through voting interests. 
45 Table of Contents IDX SYSTEMS CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTSContinued
December 31, 2002 
FIN46 changes that guidance by requiring a variable interest entity, as defined, to be consolidated by a company if that company is
subject to a majority of the risk of loss from the variable interest entitys activities or is entitled to receive a majority of the entitys residual returns or both. FIN 46 also requires disclosure about variable interest entities that
the company is not required to consolidate but in which it has a significant variable interest. The consolidation requirements of FIN 46 apply immediately to variable interest entities created after January 31, 2003 and to older entities in the
first fiscal year or interim period beginning after June 15, 2003. Certain of the disclosure requirements apply in all financial statements issued after January 31, 2003, regardless of when the variable interest entity was established. The Company
is currently evaluating the requirements and impact, if any, of FIN 46 on its consolidated results of operations and financial position. In June 2002, the FASB issued SFAS No. 146, Costs Associated with Exit or Disposal Activities. SFAS 146 supercedes EITF Issue
No. 94-3, Liability Recognition for Certain Employee Termination Benefits and Other Costs to Exit an Activity. SFAS No. 146 requires that a liability for a cost associated with an exit or disposal activity be recognized and measured
initially at fair value only when the liability is incurred. SFAS No. 146 is effective for exit or disposal activities that are initiated after December 31, 2002. The adoption of SFAS No. 146 is not expected to have a material impact on the
Companys financial position or results of its operations. In December 2002, the FASB issued SFAS No. 148, Accounting for Stock-Based CompensationTransition Disclosure, An Amendment of FASB Statement No. 123. SFAS No. 148 provides alternative methods of transition
for a voluntary change to the fair value based method of accounting for stock-based employee compensation. In addition, SFAS No. 148 amends the disclosure requirements of SFAS No. 123 to require more prominent and more frequent disclosure in
financial statements regarding the effects of stock-based compensation. The provisions of SFAS No. 148 are effective for fiscal and interim periods ending after December 15, 2002. The Company will continue to apply APB No. 25 as the method used to
account for stock-based employee compensation arrangements, where applicable, but has adopted the disclosure requirements of SFAS No. 148. 2.BUSINESS COMBINATIONS AND DIVESTITURES In April 2002, the Company acquired a minority interest in Stentor, Inc., one of the Companys strategic
partners, by exercising a warrant to purchase 562,069 shares of preferred stock of Stentor, Inc. Company paid approximately $75 million to purchase the preferred shares. Each preferred share is convertible, at any time at the option of the holder,
into one share of common stock of Stentor, Inc., subject to certain adjustments. In addition, the preferred shares are not entitled to dividends but are entitled to a liquidation preference equal to the amount paid by the Company to purchase such
shares. Stentor, Inc. is a California based medical informatics company with products for medical image and information management. The warrant was issued to the Company in November 2000 in connection with the alliance agreement that was entered
into by the parties to jointly develop a medical image and information management system MIMS combining the Companys Imaging Suite product with the image distribution technology from Stentor. This investment will be carried at cost. There is
currently no public market for the preferred shares. In June 2001, the Company acquired Vogt Management Consulting, Inc. for approximately $11 million. This acquisition has been accounted for under the purchase method of accounting. The purchase price has been allocated, principally
to goodwill, based on estimated fair market values at the date of acquisition. In May 2001, the Company acquired PVI, LLC for approximately $10 million. This acquisition has been accounted for under the purchase method of accounting. The purchase price has been allocated based
on estimated fair market values at the date of acquisition, principally to software. There are contingent payments based on a percentage of future sales related to this purchase. 
46 Table of Contents IDX SYSTEMS CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTSContinued
December 31, 2002 
Had these
purchase acquisitions occurred as of the beginning of the year in which they occurred, the Companys pro forma operating results would not be materially different than as reported in the accompanying consolidated financial statements.
On January 8, 2001 the Company sold certain of
the net assets and operations of its majority owned subsidiary, ChannelHealth to Allscripts, a public company providing point-of-care e-prescribing and productivity solutions for physicians. In addition to the sale, the Company entered into a
ten-year strategic alliance the Alliance Agreement whereby Allscripts is the exclusive provider of point-of-care clinical applications sold by IDX to physician practices. In exchange for its 87% ownership of ChannelHealth, IDX received approximately 75 million shares such
shares contained restrictions as to resale as discussed below of Allscripts stock, which represented approximately a 20% ownership interest in Allscripts. IDX recorded the Allscripts shares at an estimated fair value of $295 million, which
included a discount from market value due to restrictions on transfer. At the time of the transaction, ChannelHealths liabilities exceeded its assets by $105 million, resulting in a gain of approximately $40 million. Pursuant to the Alliance
Agreement, IDX guaranteed that Allscripts gross revenues resulting from the alliance less any commissions paid to IDX would amount to at least $45 million for fiscal year 2001. Due to this contingency, IDX deferred $45 million of the gain
as of the date of the transaction and recognized a gain of $355 million in 2001. An additional gain of $43 million was recognized in the first quarter of 2002 when the contingency was resolved. IDX accounts for its investment in Allscripts under the equity
method of accounting. Under the equity method of accounting, IDX recognized its pro-rata share of Allscripts 2001 losses resulting in the elimination of the carrying value of this investment during the third quarter of 2001. IDX has not recorded its
share of losses since then, of which its share amounts to $677 million through December 31, 2002. At December 31, 2002, the estimated market value of the Companys investment in Allscripts is approximately $179 million based on the quoted
market price of the stock. The fair market value of this stock would be discounted to reflect the Companys restricted ability to sell only 25% of its initial Allscripts shares in any one year. Through December 31, 2002, the Company has sold approximately
14,000 shares of Allscripts common stock, which has not materially changed its ownership interest in Allscripts. Summary unaudited financial information for Allscripts for the years ended December 31, 2002 and 2001 is as follows in thousands December 31 2002 2001 Revenue

3.LEASE ABANDONMENT CHARGE In 1999, the Company entered into a lease for new office space in Seattle. Although the Company continued to utilize the existing space, an active search for a sublessor was initiated and has been
ongoing. In 2002, the Company determined it would consolidate its Seattle operations into the new office space and have abandoned the space subject to the 1999 lease. Due to the depressed Seattle real estate market and the inability to obtain a
sublessor, the Company recorded a lease abandonment charge of $92 million in its core Information Systems and Services business segment in the fourth quarter of 2002. The lease abandonment charge is related to lease payments of approximately $79
million through the end of the lease term in 2005 and non-cash write-offs of certain leasehold improvements of approximately $13 million. Cash expenditures related to the accrual are expected to be approximately $22 million in 2003 and $57
million thereafter. 4.RESTRUCTURING
CHARGES On September 28, 2001 the Company
announced its plan to restructure and realign its large physician group practice businesses. The Company implemented a workforce reduction and restructuring program affecting approximately four percent of the Companys employees. The
restructuring program resulted in a charge to earnings of approximately $195 million during the fourth quarter of 2001, in connection with costs associated with employee severance arrangements of approximately $55 million, lease payment costs of
approximately $52 million, and equipment and leasehold improvement write-offs related to the leased facilities and workforce reduction of $88 million. Workforce related accruals, consisting principally of employee severance costs, were based on
specific identification of employees to be terminated, along with their job classification and functions, and their location. Substantially all work-force related actions were completed during the fourth quarter of 2001, with the exception of a
minimal number of staff assigned to transition teams. As of December 31, 2002, the Company had an accrual balance of $29 million related to leased facilities. Cash expenditures related to these accruals are expected to be approximately $17 million
in 2003 and approximately $12 million thereafter. On June 21, 2000 the Company announced the implementation of a restructuring program. The Company halted development and discontinued sales efforts on certain products that had failed to achieve business targets or were deemed
non-strategic to the business going forward. As a result, the Company implemented a workforce reduction affecting approximately five percent of the Companys employees. The restructuring program resulted in a charge to earnings of approximately
$210 million in the second quarter of 2000, in connection with costs associated with product discontinuations, principally settlements with existing users, of approximately $160million and employee severance arrangements of approximately
$50 million. Workforce related accruals, consisting principally of employee severance costs, were established based on specific identification of employees to be terminated, along with their job classification or functions, and their location.
Substantially all work-force related actions were completed during the third quarter of 2000, with the exception of product related sunset support teams. As of December 31, 2002, the accrued restructuring balance was zero and no further
costs are expected. 5.SEGMENT
INFORMATION The Company is required to
disclose segment information in accordance with the provisions of SFAS No. 131, Disclosures about Segments of an Enterprise and Related Information. SFAS No. 131 establishes standards for reporting information regarding operating
segments in annual financial statements and requires selected information for those segments to be presented in interim financial reports issued to stockholders. SFAS No. 131 also establishes standards for related disclosures about major customers,
products and services, and geographic areas. Operating segments are identified as components of an enterprise about which separate discrete financial information is available for evaluation by the chief operating decision maker, or decision making
group, in making decisions how to allocate resources and assess performance. The Companys business units have 
48 Table of Contents IDX SYSTEMS CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTSContinued
December 31, 2002 
separate management teams and infrastructures that offer different products and services. Accordingly, these business units have been
classified as reportable segments information systems and services, medical transcription services, and in 2000, Internet services and content. Information Systems and Services: This reportable segment consists of IDX Systems Corporations healthcare information solutions that
includes software, hardware and related services. IDX solutions enable healthcare organizations to redesign patient care and other workflow processes to improve efficiency and quality. The principal markets for this segment include physician groups,
management service organizations, hospitals, and integrated delivery networks primarily located in the United States. Medical Transcription Services: This reportable segment consists of EDiX, a provider of medical transcription outsourcing services. The
principal markets for this segment include hospitals and large physician group practices primarily located in the United States. Internet Services and Content: ChannelHealth, a majority owned subsidiary until January 8, 2001, offered three Internet channels that
integrated IDXs core practice management systems with extensive Internet-based services and clinically valid content. ChannelHealth services were available to physicians through group practices, hospitals, integrated delivery networks and
managed care organizations. This segment is not reported in 2002 and 2001 as a separate business segment due to the acquisition of ChannelHealth by Allscripts on January 8, 2001. The accounting policies of the reportable segments are the same as those described in Note 1 of the Notes to
Consolidated Financial Statements. The Company evaluates the performance of its operating segments based on revenue and operating income. Intersegment revenues are immaterial. No one customer accounts for greater than 10% of revenue for any
reportable segment, with the exception of EDiX in 2000 in which revenues from one major customer amounted to 103% of EDiXs total revenue.

connection with the Channelhealth sale transaction on January 8, 2001 described in Note 2 in these financial statements, and accordingly required no use of the Companys cash.

10.FINANCING ARRANGEMENTS The Company had a revolving demand line of credit the Demand Line with a bank allowing the Company to borrow up to $180 million bearing interest at the banks base rate, approximately 40% at
December31, 2001. The Demand Line was subject to certain terms and conditions including the requirement that the Company must maintain deposits with the bank that are in excess of the amounts borrowed. The agreement contains covenants related
to minimum cash flow targets, net worth and capital spending. At December 31, 2001, the Company had $150 million outstanding under this arrangement. The Demand Line expired in 2002 and no amounts were outstanding at December 31, 2002. The Company entered into a new revolving line of credit
agreement the New Line during the second quarter of 2002 allowing the Company to borrow up to $400 million subject to certain restrictions. The New Line is secured by deposit accounts, accounts receivable and other assets and bears
interest at the banks base rate plus 25%, which was approximately 50% as of December 31, 2002. The New Line will expire on June 27, 2005. At December 31, 2002, the Company had $187 million outstanding under this arrangement. Amounts due
under the New Line were paid in full on January 2, 2003. In 2002, the Company entered into a $28 million stand-by letter of credit arrangement with a bank in compliance with a provision of an office space lease related to tenant improvements. The Company has no plans to default on the
underlying payment obligation, and therefore has determined that the fair value of this contingent liability is zero. This stand-by letter of credit expires in June 2003. 11.INCOME TAXES The provision benefit for income taxes consists of the following:  2002 2001

At
December 31, 2002, the Company had net operating loss carry forwards NOLs of approximately $41million available to offset the Companys future taxable income. These NOLs will expire, if not used, during the years 2020 through 2021.
These NOLs include deductions of approximately $20 million related to certain stock option exercises. The tax benefit from the NOLs related to the exercise of stock options will be recorded as an increase to additional paid in capital as these NOLs
are utilized. In addition, the Company had NOLs
of approximately $354 million generated by EDiX available to offset the Companys future taxable income subject to an annual limitation of $780,000. These NOLs will expire, if not used, during the years 2009 through 2018. At December 31, 2002, the Company had research and
experimentation credits of approximately $86million available to offset the Companys future tax liabilities subject to limitations. These research and experimentation credits will expire, if not used, during the years 2018 through 2022.
During the year ended December 31, 2002, the
Companys valuation allowance increased by $49 million. This increase was a result of a tax planning strategy that the Company believes is no longer sufficient to support certain deferred tax assets. 
53 Table of Contents IDX SYSTEMS CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTSContinued
December 31, 2002 
The
Company believes that, based upon a number of factors, the available objective evidence creates sufficient uncertainty regarding the realization of certain deferred tax assets, principally NOLs and research and experimentation credits, such that a
partial valuation allowance has been recorded. The remaining balance is considered recoverable on a more likely than not basis as a result of tax planning strategies related to unrealized gains on the Companys investment in publicly traded
common stock that the Company accounts for using the equity method of accounting. The Company will continue to assess the realization of the deferred tax assets based on available tax planning strategies and actual and forecasted operating results.

Options
to purchase approximately 3,417,000, 3,902,000, and 1,345,000 shares of common stock were outstanding during the years ended December 31, 2002, 2001, and 2000, respectively, but were not included in the year to date calculation of diluted shares
because either the options exercise price was greater than the average market price of the common shares during those periods, or the effect of including the options would have been anti-dilutive. 13.EMPLOYEE BENEFIT PLANS Stock Purchase Plan In September 1995, IDXs Board of Directors and
stockholders approved the 1995 Employee Stock Purchase Plan, as amended in July 1997 and May 2001, the ESPP under which eligible employees may purchase the Companys common stock at a price per share equal to 85% of the lower of the fair
market value of the common stock at the beginning or end of each offering period. Participation in the offering is limited to 10% of an employees compensation not to exceed amounts allowed under Section 423 of the Internal Revenue Code, may
be terminated at any time by the employee and automatically ends on termination of employment with the Company. A total of 2,100,000 shares of common stock have been reserved for issuance under the ESPP. During the years ended December 31, 2002,
2001, and 2000, an aggregate of approximately 315,000, 279,000, and 378,000 shares, respectively, were purchased under the ESPP. No additional shares of common stock were issued under the ESPP subsequent to the end of the year. The Company has
approximately 695,000 additional shares of common stock available for issuance pursuant to the ESPP.

IDX Option Plans
During 1985 and 1994, the Company

Retirement Plan The Company maintains a
profit sharing retirement plan for all IDX employees meeting age and service requirements. Contributions to the plan are discretionary, as determined by the Board of Directors. The Company expects to continue the plan indefinitely; however, IDX has
reserved the right to modify, amend or terminate the plan. For the years ended December 31, 2002, 2001 and 2000, the Company has expensed $373,000, $161,000 and $3,572,000, respectively. 401K Retirement Savings Plan Under the plan, employees are eligible to participate in the plan on the first day of the month following the
date of employment. The Company matches participant contributions up to 3%. Matching contributions to the plan were $39 million, $31 million and $33 million for the year ended December 31, 2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively. 14.COMMITMENTS AND LEGAL MATTERS On January 18, 2001, the Company commenced a lawsuit against
Epic Systems Corporation Epic, a competitor of the Company, the University of Wisconsin Medical Foundation the Foundation, and two individuals, claiming, among other things, that trade secrets of the Company involving its
IDXtend medical group practice system were wrongfully disclosed to, and misappropriated by, Epic in a series of meetings that took place in 1998 and 1999. The defendants denied the Companys claims. The Companys lawsuit sought damages and
injunctive relief and was brought in the United States District Court for the Western District of Wisconsin and was entitled IDX Systems Corporation v. Epic Systems Corporation, et al. The Foundation brought a counterclaim against the Company
claiming that its lawsuit interfered with a contract between the Foundation and Epic, and that the confidentiality provisions in IDXs contracts with the Foundation were invalid. The counterclaim sought damages and declaratory judgment. The
Company denied the counterclaim. Subsequently,
Epic filed an Answer denying the essential elements of the Companys claims, and asserted counterclaims against the Company. Epic alleged that the Companys claims asserting its trade secret rights were brought in bad faith, with an intent
to injure Epic competitively, and thereby violated Sections 1 and 2 of the Sherman Act because the Company allegedly possessed monopoly power in the U.S. market for medical practice information systems. Epic also claimed that this same alleged
conduct constituted intentional interference with its contract with the Foundation. The counterclaim sought treble damages. The Company denied the counterclaims. On July 31, 2001, the Companys lawsuit against Epic, the Foundation and the
individuals was dismissed and the counterclaims of Epic and the Foundation were dismissed. The Company appealed the dismissal of its lawsuit to 
57 Table of Contents IDX SYSTEMS CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTSContinued
December 31, 2002 
the United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit, and on April 1, 2002, that appellate court affirmed the District Courts
dismissal of the trade secret claim, but reversed and remanded the other related claims of the Company, including breach of contract and tortuous interference claims against the defendants. On August 13, 2002, the District Court granted the
Companys motion for summary judgment on the issue of whether the Foundation had violated its obligations to keep confidential the Companys proprietary information and stated that it would be reasonable to conclude that Epic intended to
improperly receive the information. On August 28, 2002, the defendants settled the litigation with the Company. In April 2000, the Company commenced a lawsuit for damages caused by wrongful cancellation and material breach of contract by St. John
Health System SJHS, in the United States District Court for Eastern District of Michigan, entitled IDX Systems Corporation v. St. John Health System. Subsequently, SJHS commenced a lawsuit against the Company in the Circuit Court of
Wayne County, Michigan, claiming unspecified damages against the Company for anticipatory repudiation, breach of contract, tort and fraud. On motion of the Company, SJHSs lawsuit was removed to and consolidated in the federal court. In its
answer to the Companys lawsuit, SJHS asserted the same claims previously asserted in its state court action. In September 2001, SJHS specified damage claims of approximately $77 million in allegedly lost savings, and in January 2002 raised
another theory of alleged unspecified damages for cover. The Company believes the claims of SJHS are without merit and continues to vigorously defend itself and prosecute its own claims for damages, which the Company believes may exceed
approximately $9 million. The lawsuit is in the trial preparation stage and the parties are awaiting scheduling of the trial by the court. From time to time, the Company is a party to or may be threatened with other litigation in the ordinary course of its business. The
Company regularly analyzes current information including, as applicable, the Companys defenses and insurance coverage and as necessary, provides accruals for probable and estimable liabilities for the eventual disposition of these matters. The
ultimate outcome of these matters is not expected to materially impact the Companys business or financial condition but could have a material impact on the cash flows and results of operations in the quarterly or annual period in which the
matter is resolved. 15.OPERATING
LEASES During 1999 through 2001, the
Company leased a substantial portion of its space, including its corporate headquarters and sales and support offices, from real estate partnerships and trusts owned by certain stockholders and key employees of the Company. These real estate
partnerships and trusts include 116 Huntington Avenue Limited Partnership HLP through July 1999, BDP through April 2001 and one other real estate partnership and trust REP, which continues to be owned by certain stockholders and key employees of
the Company. Real estate owned by HLP and the REP is leased to the Company under operating leases. At December 31, 2002, minimum lease payments, net of sublease proceeds, for certain facilities and equipment under noncancelable leases
are as follows:  Year

Of the
$148 million due in 2003, $551,000 is due to REP. All other amounts are due to unrelated third parties. Approximately $79 million of this obligation has been accrued in 2002 as a lease abandonment charge. See Note 3. Total rent expense amounted to $90 million, $101 million and
$111 million during 2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively. Total rent expense includes $555,000, $557,000 and $619,000 in 2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively, related to the leases with HLP and REP. 16.GOODWILL In July 2001, the FASB issued SFAS No. 142, Goodwill
and Other Intangible Assets, effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2001. Under the new rules, goodwill and intangible assets deemed to have indefinite lives are no longer amortized, but are subject to annual impairment
tests in accordance with the statements. Other intangible assets continue to be amortized over their useful lives. The Company applied the new rules on accounting for goodwill and other intangible assets beginning in the first quarter of 2002. The
Company has performed the required tests of goodwill and, based on the results, has not recorded any charges related to the adoption of and subsequent conformity with SFAS No. 142. Had SFAS No. 142 been adopted for the three years ending December 31, 2002, the impact on net loss and loss
