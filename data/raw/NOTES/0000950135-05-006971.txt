48 Table of Contents REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM Board of Directors and Stockholders Nuance Communications, Inc. Burlington, Massachusetts We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of
Nuance Communications, Inc. the Company formerly
ScanSoft, Inc. as of September30, 2005 and 2004, and the
related consolidated statements of operations,
stockholders equity and comprehensive income loss, and
cash flows for the year ended September30, 2005 and the
nine months ended September30, 2004. These financial
statements are the responsibility of the Companys
management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these
financial statements based on our audits. We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the
Public Company Accounting Oversight Board United States. Those
standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are
free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a
test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in
the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the
accounting principles used and significant estimates made by
management, as well as evaluating the overall financial
statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a
reasonable basis for our opinion. In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred
to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial
position of Nuance Communications, Inc. at September30,
2005 and 2004, and the results of its operations and its cash
flows for the year ended September30, 2005 and the nine
months ended September30, 2004, in conformity with
accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the
Public Company Accounting Oversight Board United States, the
effectiveness of Nuance Communications, Inc.s internal
control over financial reporting as of September30, 2005,
based on criteria established in Internal Control
Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring
Organizations of the Treadway Commission and our report dated
December14, 2005, expressed an unqualified opinion on
managements assessment on the effectiveness of the
internal control over financial reporting and an adverse opinion
on the effectiveness of internal control over financial
reporting because of the existence of a material weakness.   
/s/ BDO SEIDMAN, LLP   
BDO Seidman, LLP Boston, Massachusetts December14, 2005 49 Table of Contents REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM Board of Directors and Stockholders Nuance Communications, Inc. Burlington, Massachusetts We have audited managements assessment, included in the
accompanying Managements Report on Internal Control over
Financial Reporting, that Nuance Communications, Inc. the
Company formerly ScanSoft Inc. did not maintain
effective internal control over financial reporting as of
September30, 2005, because of the effect of the material
weakness identified in managements assessment, based on
the criteria established in Internal Control-Integrated
Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring
Organizations of the Treadway Commission COSO. The
Companys management is responsible for maintaining
effective internal control over financial reporting and for its
assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over
financial reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion
on managements assessment and an opinion on the
effectiveness of the Companys internal control over
financial reporting based on our audit. We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the
Public Company Accounting Oversight Board United States. Those
standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control
over financial reporting was maintained in all material
respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of
internal control over financial reporting, evaluating
managements assessment, testing and evaluating the design
and operating effectiveness of internal control, and performing
such other procedures as we considered necessary in the
circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable
basis for our opinion. A companys internal control over financial reporting is a
process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the
reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of
financial statements for external purposes in accordance with
generally accepted accounting principles. A companys
internal control over financial reporting includes those
policies and procedures that 1pertain to the maintenance
of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly
reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the
company; 2provide reasonable assurance that transactions
are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial
statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting
principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company
are being made only in accordance with authorizations of
management and directors of the company; and 3provide
reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of
unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the
companys assets that could have a material effect on the
financial statements. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over
financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.
Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future
periods are subject to the risk that controls may become
inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree
of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. As indicated in the accompanying Managements Report on
Internal Control Over Financial Reporting, managements
assessment of and conclusion on the effectiveness of internal
control over financial reporting did not include the internal
controls of ART Advanced Recognition Technologies, Inc., which
the Company acquired on January21, 2005, Phonetic Systems
Ltd., which the Company acquired on February1, 2005, and
Nuance Communications, Inc., the entity acquired by the Company
on September15, 2005, whose name the Company adopted in
accordance with an amendment to its Certificate of Incorporation
on October17, 2005, and all of these acquired entities are
included in the 2005 consolidated financial statements of Nuance
Communications, Inc. from the respective dates of each
acquisition, and collectively constituted approximately 46% of
consolidated assets as of September30, 2005, and
approximately 4% of consolidated revenues for the year ended
September30, 2005. Management did not assess the
effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting at
these entities because the Company acquired these entities
during its fiscal year ended September30, 2005. Refer to
Note3 to the consolidated financial statements for further
discussion of these acquisitions and their impact on the
Companys consolidated financial statements. Our audit of
internal 50 Table of Contents control over financial reporting of Nuance Communications, Inc.
also did not include an evaluation of the internal control over
financial reporting of these entities referred to above. A material weakness is a control deficiency, or combination of
control deficiencies, that results in more than a remote
likelihood that a material misstatement of the annual or interim
financial statements will not be prevented or detected. The
following material weakness was identified and included in
managements assessment   
There existed a material weakness in internal control over
financial reporting in the tax accounting area primarily as a
result of lack of necessary corporate accounting resources and
operating ineffectiveness of certain controls designed to
prevent or detect actual or potential misstatements in the tax
accounts. This material weakness was considered in determining the nature,
timing, and extent of audit tests applied in our audit of the
2005 consolidated financial statements, and this report does not
affect our report dated December14, 2005 on those
financial statements, which expressed an unqualified opinion. In our opinion, managements assessment that Nuance
Communications, Inc. did not maintain effective internal control
over financial reporting as of September30, 2005, is
fairly stated, in all material respects, based on the criteria
established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework
issued by COSO. Also, in our opinion, because of the effect
of the material weakness described above on the achievement of
the objectives of the control criteria, Nuance Communications,
Inc. did not maintain effective internal control over financial
reporting as of September30, 2005, based on the criteria
established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework
issued by COSO.

statements in accordance with the standards of the Public

the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles
used and significant estimates made by management, and
evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We
believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our
opinion.

Summary of Significant Accounting Policies   
Change in Fiscal Year On October23, 2004 the Companys Board of Directors
approved a change in the Companys fiscal year end from
December31 to September30, effective beginning
September30, 2004. All references in the consolidated
financial statements to the period ended September30,
2004, or fiscal 2004, refers to the nine months ended
September30, 2004, whereas the twelve-month periods
yearsended September30, 2005 and December31,
2003 are referred to as fiscal 2005 and 2003, respectively. The
interim statement of operations for the nine months ended
September30, 2003 is unaudited and, in the opinion of
management, reflects all adjustments, consisting of normal
recurring adjustments, necessary for a fair presentation of
results of operations for the nine months ended
September30, 2003.   
Use of Estimates in the Preparation of Financial
Statements The preparation of financial statements in conformity with
generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of
America requires management to make estimates and assumptions
that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and
the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the dates
of 58 Table of Contents NUANCE COMMUNICATIONS, INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTSContinued the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and
expenses during the reporting periods. On an ongoing basis, the
Company evaluates its estimates and judgments, including those
related to revenue recognition, the costs to complete the
development of custom software applications and valuation
allowances specifically sales returns and other allowances;
accounting for patent legal defense costs; the valuation of
goodwill, other intangible assets and tangible long-lived
assets; accounting for acquisitions; valuing stock-based
compensation instruments; evaluating loss contingencies; and
valuation allowances for deferred tax assets. Actual amounts
could differ significantly from these estimates. The Company
bases its estimates and judgments on historical experience and
various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under
the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for
making judgments about the carrying values of assets and
liabilities and the amounts of revenue and expenses that are not
readily apparent from other sources.   
Basis of Consolidation The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of
the Company and its wholly-owned subsidiaries. Intercompany
transactions and balances have been eliminated.   
Foreign Currency Translation The functional currency of the Companys foreign
subsidiaries is the local currency, with the exception of the
Companys subsidiary in Budapest, Hungary for which the
functional currency is the U.S.dollar. Assets and
liabilities of foreign subsidiaries that are denominated in
foreign currencies are translated into U.S.dollars at
exchange rates in effect at the balance sheet date. Revenue and
expense items are translated using the average exchange rates
for the period. Net unrealized gains and losses resulting from
foreign currency translation are included in other comprehensive
income loss, which is a separate component of
stockholders equity, except for Budapest for which foreign
currency translation adjustments are recorded in other income
expense. Foreign currency transaction gains and losses are
included in results of operations. The Company reported foreign
currency related transaction income expenseand other
translation income expense, as follows: a net
$02million loss for fiscal 2005, a net $03million
gain for fiscal 2004 and a $12million gain for fiscal
2003.   
Foreign Currency Risk Management In certain circumstances, the Company enters into forward
exchange contracts to hedge against foreign currency
fluctuations. These contracts are used to reduce the
Companys risk associated with exchange rate movements, as
the gains or losses on these contracts are intended to offset
the exchange rate losses or gains on the underlying exposures.
The Company does not engage in foreign currency speculation.
Hedges of underlying exposures are designated and documented at
the inception of the hedge and are evaluated for effectiveness
monthly. Forward exchange contracts representing cash flow
hedges qualify for hedge accounting when they are designated as
a hedge of the foreign currency exposure and they are effective
in minimizing such exposure. Gains and losses on forward
exchange contracts that qualify for hedge accounting are
recognized as other comprehensive income loss in
stockholders equity, along with the associated losses and
gains on the hedged item. As the terms of the forward exchange
contract and underlying exposure are matched generally at
inception, hedging effectiveness is calculated by comparing the
change in fair value of the contract to the change in fair value
of the underlying exposure. To date the Company has not incurred
any significant gains or losses associated with hedge
ineffectiveness. On January30, 2003, the Company entered into a forward
exchange contract to hedge the foreign currency exposure of its
50million euro note payable to Philips Note3. The
contract and the note payable each had a term that expired on
December31, 2003. On August26, 2003, the Company
entered into a forward exchange contract to hedge the foreign
currency exposure of its 10million euro payable to
Philips. The contract and the payable each had a term that
expired on December31, 2003. Prior to December31 59 Table of Contents NUANCE COMMUNICATIONS, INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTSContinued 2003, the Company made payments to Philips in satisfaction of
these obligations and the related forward hedges were also
terminated. On November3, 2003, the Company entered into a forward
exchange contract to hedge its foreign currency exposure related
to 35million euros of intercompany receivables from its
Belgian subsidiary to the United States. The contract had a
one-year term that expired on November1, 2004. On
November1, 2004 the Company renewed this forward hedge
contract; the renewed contract had a one-year term expiring on
November1, 2005; however it was cancelable at the
Companys discretion. In February 2005, the Company
liquidated the contract. A $05million unrealized loss was
recorded on this contract as of September30, 2004, and the
Company recognized a net gain of less than $01million in
fiscal 2005 through this hedges termination. On November5, 2003, the Company entered into a forward
exchange contract to hedge the Companys foreign currency
exposure related to 75million Singapore dollars of
intercompany receivables from its Singapore subsidiary to the
United States. The original contract expired on January30,
2004, but was extended to October29, 2004. Upon the
contracts termination in October 2004, the Company
realized a loss of approximately $02million. As of September30, 2005, the Company had no outstanding
foreign exchange derivative contracts.   
Revenue Recognition As a result of the SpeechWorks acquisition in August 2003,
professional services became a material component of the
Companys business. As a result of this and the
implementation of Oracle, in January 2004, the Company began to
separately track and disclose professional services revenue and
cost of revenue. Prior to 2004, the Company did not separately
disclose professional services revenue and associated cost of
revenue as they were immaterial and it is not practical to
reclassify these revenues and associated costs retroactively. The Company recognizes revenue in accordance with Statement of
Position SOP 97-2, Software Revenue Recognition,
as amended by SOP98-9, Modification of SOP97-2
with Respect to Certain Transactions, SOP81-1
Accounting for Performance of Construction Type and Certain

EITF Issue01-9, Accounting for
Consideration Given by a Vendor Including a Reseller of the
Vendors Products and Statement of Financial
Accounting Standards SFAS 48, Revenue
Recognition when Right of Return Exists. In general the
Company recognizes revenue when persuasive evidence of an
arrangement exists, delivery has occurred, the fee is fixed or
determinable, collectibility is probable, and vendor specific
objective evidence VSOE, or fair value, exists for
any undelivered elements. The Company reduces revenue recognized
for estimated future returns, price protection and rebates, and
certain marketing funds at the time the related revenue is
recorded. Certain distributors and value-added resellers have been granted
rights of return for as long as the distributors or resellers
hold the inventory. The Company has not analyzed historical
returns from distributor and resellers to form a basis in order
to estimate the future sales returns by distributor and
resellers. As a result, the Company recognizes revenue from
sales to these distributors and resellers when the distributor
and reseller has sold products through to retailers and
end-users. Title and risk of loss pass to the distributor or
reseller upon shipment, at which time the transaction is
invoiced and payment is due. Based on reports from distributors
and resellers of their inventory balances at the end of each
period, the Company records an allowance against accounts
receivable for the sales price of all inventories subject to
return. The Company also makes an estimate of sales returns by retailers
or end users directly or through its distributors or resellers
based on historical returns experience. The Company has analyzed
historical returns from retailers and end users which forms the
basis of its estimate of future sales returns by retailers or end 60 Table of Contents NUANCE COMMUNICATIONS, INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTSContinued users. In accordance with SFAS48, the provision for these
estimated returns is recorded as a reduction of revenue at the
time that the related revenue is recorded. If actual returns
differ significantly from its estimates, such differences could
have a material impact on the Companys results of
operations for the period in which the actual returns become
known. Revenue from royalties on sales of the Companys products
by OEMs to third parties, where no services are included, is
typically recognized upon delivery to the third party when such
information is available, or when the Company is notified by the
OEM that such royalties are due as a result of a sale, provided
that all other revenue recognition criteria are met. When the Company provides professional services considered
essential to the functionality of the software, such as custom
application development for a fixed fee, it recognizes revenue
from the fees for such services and any related software
licenses based on the percentage-of-completion method in
accordance with SOP81-1. The Company generally determines
the percentage-of-completion by comparing the labor hours
incurred to date to the estimated total labor hours required to
complete the project. The Company considers labor hours to be
the most reliable, available measure of progress on these
projects. Adjustments to estimates to complete are made in the
periods in which facts resulting in a change become known. When
the estimate indicates that a loss will be incurred, such loss
is recorded in the period identified. Significant judgments and
estimates are involved in determining the percent complete of
each contract. Different assumptions could yield materially
different results. When the Company provides services on a time and materials
basis, it recognizes revenue as it performs the services based
on actual time incurred. Other professional services not considered essential to the
functionality of the software are limited and primarily include
training and feasibility studies, which are recognized as
revenue when the related services are performed. When the
Company provides software support and maintenance services, it
recognizes the revenue ratably over the term of the related
contracts, typically one year. The Company may sell, under one contract or related contracts,
software licenses, custom software applications and other
services considered essential to the functionality of the
software and a maintenance and support arrangement. The total
contract value is attributed first to the maintenance and
support arrangement based on VSOE of its fair value and
additionally based upon stated renewal rates. The remainder of
the total contract value is then attributed to the software
license and related professional services, which are typically
recognized as revenue using the percentage-of-completion method.
The Company may sell, under one contract or related contracts,
software licenses, a maintenance and support arrangement and
professional services not considered essential to the
functionality of the software. In those arrangements, the total
contract value is attributed first to the undelivered elements
of maintenance and support and professional services based on
VSOE of their fair values. The remainder of the contract value
is attributed to the software licenses, which are typically
recognized as revenue upon delivery, provided all other revenue
recognition criteria are met. The Company follows the guidance of EITF01-9, in
determining whether consideration given to a customer should be
recorded as an operating expense or a reduction of revenue
recognized from that same customer. Consideration given to a
customer is recorded as a reduction of revenue unless both of
the following conditions are met   
The Company receives an identifiable benefit in exchange for the
consideration, and the identified benefit is sufficiently
separable from the customers purchase of the
Companys products and services such that the Company could
have purchased the products from a third party,and     
The Company can reasonably estimate the fair value of the
benefit received. 61 Table of Contents NUANCE COMMUNICATIONS, INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTSContinued Consideration, including that in the form of the Companys
equity instruments if applicable, is recorded as a reduction
of revenue to the extent the Company has recorded cumulative
revenue from the customer or reseller, has resulted in a
$05million, $03million and $02million
reduction in total revenue for fiscal 2005, 2004 and 2003,
respectively. The Company follows the guidance of EITF01-14,
Income Statement Characterization of Reimbursements for
Out-of-Pocket Expenses Incurred, and records
reimbursements received for out-of-pocket expenses as revenue,
with offsetting costs recorded as cost of revenue. Out-of-pocket
expenses generally include, but are not limited to, expenses
related to airfare, hotel stays and out-of-town meals.   
Cost of Revenue As a result of the SpeechWorks acquisition in August 2003,
professional services became a material component of the
Companys business. As a result of this and the
implementation of Oracle, in January 2004, the Company began to
separately track and disclose professional services revenue and
associated cost of revenue. Prior to 2004, the Company did not
separately disclose professional services revenue and cost of
revenue as they were immaterial and it is not practical to
reclassify these revenues and associated costs retrospectively. For fiscal 2005 and 2004, cost of revenue primarily consists of
material and fulfillment costs and third-party royalties. Cost
of professional services revenue primarily consists of salaries
for professional consulting staff, salaries for product support
personnel, and engineering costs associated with certain
contracts which were accounted for under
percentage-of-completion method of accounting. Cost of revenue for fiscal 2003 and for the nine months ended
September30, 2003 consists of material and fulfillment
costs, third-party royalties, salaries for product support
personnel, and engineering costs associated with certain
contracts which were accounted for under
percentage-of-completion method of accounting.   
Costs of Revenue from Amortization of Intangible
Assets Cost of revenue from amortization of intangible assets includes
the amortization of acquired patents and core and completed
technology.   
Cash Equivalents Cash equivalents are short-term, highly liquid instruments with
original maturities of 90days or less at the date of
acquisition. The Company primarily invests in commercial paper
and money market funds. As of September30, 2004, the Company escrowed
approximately $04million of cash as a result of a dispute
with one of its vendors. This dispute was resolved in fiscal
2005, and the amount was released from escrow.   
Accounts Receivable The Company establishes reserves against its accounts receivable
for potential credit losses when it determines receivables are
at risk for collection based upon the length of time the
receivables are outstanding as well as various other criteria.
Receivables are written off against these reserves in the period
they are determined to be uncollectible.   
Inventory Inventory consists of finished goods, primarily of software
media and user manuals, and is stated at the lower of cost
determined on a first-in, first-out basis or market value. 62 Table of Contents NUANCE COMMUNICATIONS, INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTSContinued   
Property and Equipment Property and equipment are stated at cost and are depreciated
using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives
of the assets. Leasehold improvements are amortized over the
term of the related lease or the useful life, if shorter. The
cost and related accumulated depreciation of sold or retired
assets are removed from the accounts and any gain or loss is
included in operations. Repairs and maintenance costs are
expensed as incurred.   
Long-lived Tangible and Intangible Assets and
Goodwill The Company has significant long-lived tangible and intangible
assets, including goodwill, which are susceptible to valuation
adjustments as a result of changes in various factors or
conditions. The most significant long-lived tangible and other
intangible assets are fixed assets, patents and core technology,
completed technology and trademarks which are amortized using
the straight-line method over their estimated useful lives,
which the Company believes is the most rational method. The
values of intangible assets, with the exception of goodwill,
were initially determined by a risk-adjusted, discounted cash
flow approach. The Company assesses the potential impairment of
identifiable intangible assets and fixed assets whenever events
or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may
not be recoverable. Factors it considers important, which could
trigger an impairment of such assets, include the following   
Significant underperformance relative to historical or projected
future operating results     
Significant changes in the manner of or use of the acquired
assets or the strategy for the Companys overall business     
Significant negative industry or economic trends     
Significant decline in the Companys stock price for a
sustained period;and     
A decline in the Companys market capitalization below net
book value. Future adverse changes in these or other unforeseeable factors
could result in an impairment charge that would impact future
results of operations and financial position in the reporting
period identified. Effective January1, 2002, the Company adopted
SFAS142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets.
SFAS142 requires, among other things, the discontinuance
of goodwill amortization. The standard also requires the Company
to test goodwill for impairment on at least an annual basis. The
Company uses July1stas the date of the annual
impairment test. The impairment test compares the fair value of
the reporting unit to its carrying amount, including goodwill,
to assess whether impairment is present. The Company has
reviewed the provisions of SFAS142 with respect to the
criteria necessary to evaluate the number of reporting units
that exist, based on its review the Company has determined that
it operates in one reporting unit. Based on this assessment
test, the Company has not had any goodwill impairment charges.
The Company will assess the impairment of goodwill more often if
indicators of impairment arise. The Company did evaluate the
goodwill as of September30, 2005, following its
acquisition of Former Nuance, and again determined that no
impairment exists. In accordance with SFAS144, Accounting for the
Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets, the Company
periodically reviews long-lived assets for impairment whenever
events or changes in business circumstances indicate that the
carrying amount of the assets may not be fully recoverable or
that the useful lives of those assets are no longer appropriate.
Each impairment test is based on a comparison of the
undiscounted cash flows to the recorded value for the asset. If
impairment is indicated, the asset is written down to its
estimated fair value based on a discounted cash flow analysis.
No impairment charges were taken in fiscal 2005 or 2004. In
fiscal 2003, a charge of $02million was recorded relating
to a portion of the technology acquired from Philips. 63 Table of Contents NUANCE COMMUNICATIONS, INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTSContinued Significant judgments and estimates are involved in determining
the useful lives and amortization patterns of intangible assets,
determining what reporting units exist and assessing when events
or circumstances would require an interim impairment analysis of
goodwill or other long-lived assets to be performed. Changes in
the organization or the Companys management reporting
structure, as well as other events and circumstances, including
but not limited to technological advances, increased competition
and changing economic or market conditions, could result in
ashorter estimated useful lives, badditional
reporting units, which may require alternative methods of
estimating fair values or greater disaggregation or aggregation
in our analysis by reporting unit, and/or cother changes
in previous assumptions or estimates. In turn, this could have a
significant impact on the consolidated financial statements
through accelerated amortization and/or impairment charges
Notes6 and7.   
Research and Development Costs Costs incurred in the research and development of new software
products and enhancements to existing products, other than
certain software development costs that qualify for
capitalization, are expensed as incurred. Software development
costs incurred subsequent to the establishment of technological
feasibility, but prior to the general release of the product,
are capitalized and amortized to cost of revenue over the
estimated useful life of the related products. In fiscal 2005,
2004 and 2003, costs eligible for capitalization were not
material.   
Legal Expenses Incurred to Defend Patents The Company capitalizes external legal costs incurred in the
defense of its patents if the Company believes that it is
probable and to the extent that the future economic benefit of
the patent will be increased. The Company monitors the legal
costs incurred and the anticipated outcome of the legal action
and, if changes in the anticipated outcome occur, writes off
capitalized costs, if any, in the period the change is
determined. As of September30, 2005 and 2004, capitalized
patent defense costs totaled $23million and
$05million, respectively.   
Capitalization of Internal Use Software Costs The Company capitalizes development costs of software for
internal use pursuant to SOP98-1, Accounting for the
Costs of Computer Software Developed or Obtained for Internal
Use. These costs are included in property and equipment
Note6, and are amortized over their estimated useful
life.   
Income Taxes Deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the
difference between the financial statement and tax bases of
assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect in the
years in which the differences are expected to reverse. A
valuation allowance against deferred tax assets is recorded if,
based on the weight of available evidence, it is more likely
than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will not be
realized. The Company does not provide for U.S.income
taxes on the undistributed earnings of its foreign subsidiaries,
which the Company considers to be permanent investments. The Company monitors the realization of its deferred tax assets
based on changes in circumstances, for example, recurring
periods of income for tax purposes following historical periods
of cumulative losses or changes in tax laws or regulations. The
Companys income tax provisions and its assessment of the
realizability of its deferred tax assets involve significant
judgments and estimates. If the Company continued to generate
taxable income through profitable operations in future years it
may be required to recognize these deferred tax assets through
the reduction of the valuation allowance which would result in a
material benefit to its results of operations in the period in
which the benefit is determined, excluding the recognition of
the portion of the 64 Table of Contents NUANCE COMMUNICATIONS, INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTSContinued valuation allowance which relates to net deferred tax assets
acquired in a business combination and stock compensation.   
Comprehensive Income Loss Total comprehensive income loss, net of taxes, was
$67million, $95million and $62million
for fiscal 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. Comprehensive
income loss consists of net income loss and other
comprehensive income loss, which includes current period
foreign currency translation adjustments and gains related to
derivatives reported as cash flow hedges and gains or losses on
marketable securities. For the purposes of comprehensive loss
disclosures, the Company does not record tax provisions or
benefits for the net changes in the foreign currency translation
adjustment, as the Company intends to permanently reinvest
undistributed earnings in its foreign subsidiaries. As of September30, 2005 accumulated other comprehensive
loss consisted of approximately $2,058,000 and $42,000 of
unrealized translation losses and unrealized losses on
marketable securities, respectively. As of September30,
2004 accumulated other comprehensive loss consisted of
approximately $703,000 and $140,000 of unrealized translation
losses and unrealized losses on marketable securities,
respectively.   
Concentration of Risk Financial instruments that potentially subject the Company to
significant concentrations of credit risk consist principally of
cash, cash equivalents, and trade accounts receivable. The
Company places its cash and cash equivalents with financial
institutions with high credit ratings. The Company performs
ongoing credit evaluations of its customers financial
condition and does not require collateral, since management does
not anticipate nonperformance of payment. The Company also
maintains reserves for potential credit losses and such losses
have been within managements expectations. At
September30, 2005 and 2004, no customer represented
greater than 10% of the Companys net accounts receivable
balance.   
Fair Value Disclosures of Financial Instruments Financial instruments include cash equivalents, marketable
securities, accounts receivable, and long-term notes payable and
are carried in the financial statements at amounts that
approximate their fair value as of September30, 2005 and
2004.   
Advertising Costs Advertising costs are expensed as incurred and are classified as
sales and marketing expenses. The Company incurred advertising
costs of $18million, $18million and
$23million for fiscal 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively.   
Net Income Loss Per Share The Company computes net income loss per share under the
provisions of SFAS128 Earnings per Share, and
EITF03-6 Participating Securities and
Two ClassMethod under FASB Statement
No128, Earnings per Share. Accordingly,
basic net income loss per share is computed by dividing net
income loss available to common stockholders by the
weighted-average number of common shares outstanding for the
period. Diluted net income loss per share is computed by dividing net
income loss available to common stockholders by the
weighted-average number of common shares outstanding for the
period plus potential dilutive common equivalent shares, which
include, when dilutive, outstanding stock options, warrants,
unvested shares of restricted stock using the treasury stock
method and the convertible debenture using the as converted
method. As the Company was in a loss position in each fiscal
period presented, the diluted 65 Table of Contents NUANCE COMMUNICATIONS, INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTSContinued weighted-average common shares exclude 13,133,936, 12,807,361
and 14,463,449 common equivalent shares for fiscal 2005, 2004
and 2003, respectively.   
Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation Stock-based compensation expenses result from non-cash charges
for common shares, including restricted common shares of stock,
issued with exercise or purchase prices that are less than the
fair market value of the common stock on the date of grant. The Company accounts for stock-based awards to employees using
the intrinsic value method as prescribed in Accounting
Principles Board APB Opinion25,
Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees and related
interpretations. The Company follows the disclosure provisions
of SFAS123, Accounting for Stock-Based
Compensation. Deferred compensation is recorded for
restricted stock granted to employees based on the fair value of
the Companys common stock at the date of grant and is
amortized over the period in which the restrictions lapse. All
stock-based awards to non-employees are accounted for at their
fair value in accordance with SFAS123 and related
interpretations. Had compensation expense for the Companys employee
stock-based compensation plans been determined based on fair
market value at the grant dates, as prescribed by SFAS123,
the Companys net loss and pro forma net loss and pro forma
net loss per share, would have been as follows in thousands,
except per share amounts

following assumptions: expected volatility of 51% to 55% for
various grants made in fiscal 2005, 74% for fiscal 2004 and 80%
for fiscal 2003, risk-free interest rate of 296% to 420% for
options granted in fiscal 2005, 221% to 344% for options
granted in fiscal 2004, and 159% to 368% for options granted
in fiscal 2003. Expected option term of 35years to
40years was used in fiscal 2005, and 35years was
used in each of fiscal 2004 and 2003. The Company has not paid
dividends to date and assumed no dividend yield. The weighted average grant date fair value per share of options
granted excluding those assumed under the Former Nuance Stock
Option Plan, which were valued under EITF99-12 was $187 263, and $258 for fiscal 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. For the Companys Employee Stock Purchase Plan, the fair
value of each purchase right was estimated at the beginning of
the offering period using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model
with the following assumptions used in fiscal 2005, 2004 and
2003: expected volatility of 52%, 60% and 80%, respectively;
risk-free interest rate of 259% to 371%, 100% to 177%, and
105% to 165%, respectively; and expected lives three 66 Table of Contents NUANCE COMMUNICATIONS, INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTSContinued months in fiscal 2005, and six months in fiscal 2004 and 2003.
The Company has not paid dividends and assumed no dividend yield. The weighted-average fair value of all purchase rights granted
in fiscal 2005, 2004 and 2003, were $129, $151 and $172.   
Accounting for Long-Term Facility Obligations The Company has historically acquired companies who have
previously established restructuring charges relating to lease
exit costs, and has recorded restructuring charges of its own
that include lease exit costs. The Company follows the
provisions of EITF95-3 Recognition of Liabilities in
Connection with a Purchase Business Combination or
SFAS146 Accounting for Costs Associated with Exit or
Disposal Activities, as applicable. In accounting for
these obligations, the Company is required to make assumptions
relating to the time period over which the facility will remain
vacant, sublease terms, sublease rates and discount rates. The
Company bases its estimates and assumptions on the best
information available at the time of the obligation having
arisen. These estimates are reviewed and revised as facts and
circumstances dictate; changes in these estimates could have a
material effect on the amount accrued on the balance sheet.   
Recently Issued Accounting Standards In May 2005, the FASB issued SFAS154, Accounting
Changes and Error Corrections, which replaces APB20,
Accounting Changes, and SFAS3, Reporting
Accounting Changes in Interim Financial Statements
An Amendment of APB Opinion No28. SFAS154
provides guidance on the accounting for and reporting of
accounting changes and error corrections. It establishes
retrospective application, or the latest practicable date, as
the required method for reporting a change in accounting
principle and the reporting of a correction of an error.
SFAS154 is effective for accounting changes and
corrections of errors made in fiscal years beginning after
December15, 2005 and is therefore required to be adopted
by the Company in the first quarter of fiscal 2007. The Company
is currently evaluating the effect that the adoption of
SFAS154 will have on its consolidated results of
operations and financial condition, but does no expect it will
have a material impact. In December 2004, the Financial Accounting Standards Board
FASB issued SFAS123 revised 2004
SFAS123R, Share-Based Payment,
which is a revision of SFAS123. SFAS123R supersedes
APB25, and amends SFAS95, Statement of Cash
Flows. Generally, the approach in SFAS123R is
similar to the approach described in SFAS123. However,
SFAS123R requires all share-based payments to employees,
including grants of employee stock options, to be recognized in
the income statement based on their fair values. Pro forma
disclosure is no longer an alternative. SFAS123R is now
effective for the first fiscal year beginning after
June15, 2005. As a result, the new standard will be
effective for the Company beginning October1, 2005. In
March 2005, the SEC issued SAB107 regarding the SECs
interpretation of SFAS123R and the valuation of
share-based payments for public companies. The Company is
evaluating the requirements of SFAS123R and SAB107
and expects that the adoption of SFAS123R will have a
material impact on its consolidated results of operations and
earnings per share. The Company has not yet determined the
method of adoption or the effect of adopting SFAS123R, and
it has not determined whether the adoption will result in
amounts that are similar to the current pro-forma disclosures
under SFAS123. In November 2004, the FASB issued SFAS151, Inventory
Costs, an amendment of Accounting Research Bulletin
ARB43, Chapter4, Inventory
Pricing. SFAS151 amends previous guidance regarding
treatment of abnormal amounts of idle facility expense, freight,
handling costs, and spoilage. This statement requires that those
items be recognized as current period charges regardless of
whether they meet the criterion of so abnormal which
was the criterion specified in ARB43. In addition, this
Statement requires that allocation of fixed production overheads
to the cost of the production be based on normal capacity of the
production facilities. This pronouncement is effective for the
Company for fiscal periods 67 Table of Contents NUANCE COMMUNICATIONS, INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTSContinued beginning October1, 2005. The Company is currently
evaluating the effect that the adoption of SFAS151 will
have on its consolidated results of operations and financial
condition, but does not expect it will have a material impact.   
Reclassifications Certain prior year financial statement amounts have been
reclassified to conform to the current year presentation. As a
result of the SpeechWorks acquisition in August 2003,
professional services became a material component of the
Companys business. As a result of this and the
implementation of certain applications of Oracle Financials in
January 2004 the Company began to separately track and disclose
professional services revenue and cost of revenue. Prior to
fiscal 2004, the Company did not separately disclose
professional services revenue and cost of revenue as they were
immaterial and it is not practical to reclassify these revenues
and associated costs retroactively. Certain balance sheet accounts have increased significantly at
September30, 2005 and are now separately presented, the
appropriate balances at September30, 2004 have been
reclassified to conform to the September30, 2005
presentation.

Acquisition of SpeechWorks International, Inc.
SpeechWorks On August11, 2003, the Company acquired SpeechWorks, a
leading provider of software products and professional services
that enable enterprises, carriers and government organizations
to offer automated, speech-activated services over any

markets. The addition of SpeechWorks professional services
organization enabled the Company to support major accounts,

the acquisition enhanced the Companys strengths in key
vertical markets, including multiple deployments in

common stock Note13, and 279,581shares of the

In connection with the SpeechWorks acquisition, the Company
eliminated 54 former employees of SpeechWorks. In connection
with this action, a liability of $13million, representing
severance and related benefits, has been included in the
purchase price allocation. All of the restructuring accrual
related to SpeechWorks acquisition had been paid as of
September30, 2004. In December 2002, SpeechWorks committed to a restructuring plan
to vacate two office locations during 2003. In connection with
this restructuring plan, SpeechWorks recorded a charge of
$59million. As of the acquisition date, the balance of
this accrual was $54million, which has been included in
accrued expenses and in other long-term liabilities in the table
above. During the quarter ended December31, 2003, the
Company completed its review of all of the assumed leases, based
on the provisions of the lease agreements and managements
expectations for post-acquisition operations, the Company
determined that the total fair value of the assumed liabilities
related to leases for which there will be no future benefit
amounted to $129million. The Company recorded this
obligation at its net present value as discussed in
Note10. During the quarter ended September30, 2004,
the Company negotiated a sublease for a portion of the assumed
SpeechWorks lease obligations. The terms of the sublease will
result in approximately $08million of additional sublease
income to the Company. Therefore, the lease obligation and
goodwill were reduced by approximately $08million.
Additionally, during the quarter ended September30, 2004
the Company finalized its analysis of certain litigation assumed
in the acquisition. The analysis resulted in the Company
increasing the acquired liabilities and goodwill by
approximately $08million. 79 Table of Contents NUANCE COMMUNICATIONS, INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTSContinued In fiscal 2005, the Company reduced goodwill by
$28million, primarily related to the recognition of
assets related to purchased net operating losses which
previously had a full valuation allowance. These net changes are
reflected in the table above. The table above includes the changes to goodwill and the other
balance sheet accounts that are discussed in the preceding
paragraphs. The following are the identifiable intangible assets acquired

The weighted average life of customer relationships is six

acquired was based on their respective fair values determined as
of the acquisition date. The excess of the purchase price over
the tangible and identifiable intangible assets was recorded as
goodwill and amounted to approximately $1392million. In
accordance with SFAS142, the goodwill is not being
amortized and will be tested for impairment as required at least
annually.   
Acquisition of Philips Speech Processing Telephony and
Voice Control Business On January30, 2003, the Company completed the acquisition
of the Philips Speech Processing Telephony and Voice Control
business units of Royal Philips Electronics N.V.
Philips, and related intellectual property. The
Telephony business unit offers speech-enabled services including
directory assistance, interactive voice response and voice
portal applications for enterprise customers, telephony vendors
and carriers. The Voice Control business unit offers a product
portfolio including small footprint speech recognition engines
for embedded applications such as voice-controlled climate,
navigation and entertainment features in automotive vehicles, as
well as voice dialing for mobile phones. The acquisition of the Philips Speech Processing Telephony and
Voice Control business enhances the Companys market share
in key markets and gives the Company additional competitive
momentum in its target markets, specifically the telephony,
automotive and embedded markets. In addition, it enhances the
distribution channel adding new reference accounts for both
customer relationships and technology partners. These
incremental intangible benefits attributed to excess purchase
consideration resulting in goodwill. Consideration for the acquisition, before any purchase price
adjustment determined by the parties as described below, totaled
$395million, including transaction costs of
$21million. The consideration consisted of
31million euros $34million in cash paid at
closing, subject to adjustment in accordance with the provisions
of the purchase agreement, as amended; a deferred payment of
10million euros in cash due no later than
December31, 2003, a 50million euro note due
December31, 2003; bearing 50% interest per annum; and a
$275million three-year, zero-interest subordinated
debenture, convertible at any time through January30, 2006
at Philips option, into shares of common stock at
$600per share. The 10million euro and
50million euro payments have been made as of
September30, 2004. The fair value of the convertible
debenture was determined to be $275million based on the
present value of the expected cash outflows using 80 Table of Contents NUANCE COMMUNICATIONS, INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTSContinued an incremental borrowing rate of 12% and the fair value of the
conversion feature based on the Black-Scholes option pricing
model using the following assumptions: the fair value of the
Companys common stock of $362per share, the closing
price of the Companys common stock on the day the parties
entered into the acquisition agreement; volatility of 100 risk-free interest rate of 216%; no dividends and an expected
term of 3years. The purchase price was subject to adjustment based on
calculations set forth in the purchase agreement, as amended,
which required agreement by the parties. In accordance with the
provisions of the agreement, the Company and Philips agreed
during the fourth quarter of 2003 to a final purchase price,
adjustment of approximately $41million, resulting in a
corresponding reduction in goodwill. The Company received
$11million of the purchase price adjustment prior to
December31, 2003. The remaining $30million
25million euros, was received on January5, 2004.

On March31, 2003, the Company entered into an agreement
that grants an exclusive license to the Company to resell, in
certain geographies worldwide, certain productivity
applications. The period of exclusivity expires after seven
years, unless terminated earlier as permitted under the
agreement. Total consideration to be paid by the Company for the
license was $130million. On June30, 2003, the terms
and conditions of the agreement were amended, resulting in a
$12million reduction in the license fee. The initial
payment of $64million due on or before June30, 2003
was paid in accordance with the terms of the license agreement,
the first installment payment of $28 was paid on March31,
2004, and the remaining payment of $28million including
interest of $02million was paid in April 2005. Based on the net present value of the deferred payments due in
2004 and 2005, using an interest rate of 70%, the Company
recorded $114million as completed technology, which is
being amortized to cost of revenue based on the greater of
athe ratio of current gross revenue to total current and
expected future revenue for the products or bthe
straight-line basis over the period of expected use, five years.
The $06million difference between the stated payment
amounts and the net present value of the payments was charged to
interest expense over the payment period. As of
September30, 2004, the payment due on or before
March31, 2005, was classified as deferred payment for
technology license and other liabilities. On March31, 2003, the Company acquired certain
intellectual property assets related to multimodal speech
technology, in exchange for $01million in cash and the
issuance of a warrant for common stock valued at
$01million Note13. The purchase price was
recorded as completed technology and is being amortized over
three years. 84 Table of Contents NUANCE COMMUNICATIONS, INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL

Debt and Credit Facilities   
Credit Facility On October31, 2002, the Company entered into a Loan and
Security Agreement as amended, the Loan Agreement
with Silicon Valley Bank the Bank that consisted
of a $100million revolving loan the Credit
Facility. The Company amended this Loan and Security
Agreement as of March31, 2004, extending the term to
March31, 2006. Under this amendment, the Company must
comply with both a minimum adjusted quick ratio and a minimum
tangible net worth calculation, as defined in the Loan
Agreement. Depending on the Companys adjusted quick ratio,
borrowings under the Credit Facility bear interest at the
Banks prime rate plus up to 075%, collectively 675% at
September30, 2005, as defined in 85 Table of Contents NUANCE COMMUNICATIONS, INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTSContinued the Loan Agreement. The maximum permissible amount of borrowings
outstanding at any one time was amended to the lesser of
$200million or a borrowing base equal to either 80% or
70% of eligible accounts receivable, as defined in the Loan
Agreement, based on the Companys adjusted quick ratio,
reduced in a case by the amount of the outstanding letters of
credit. Borrowings under the Loan Agreement cannot exceed the
borrowing base and must be repaid in the event they exceed the
calculated borrowing base or upon expiration of the loan term.
Borrowings under the Loan Agreement are collateralized by
substantially all of the Companys personal property,
predominantly its accounts receivable, but not its intellectual
property. On March31, 2005, the Company further amended
the Loan and Security Agreement. This amendment modified the
terms under which the minimum adjusted quick ratio covenant is
calculated. All other terms remained the same. As of
September30, 2005, no amounts were outstanding under the
Credit Facility. As of September30, 2005 61million committed for outstanding letters of credit.
In connection with the Companys acquisition of Former
Nuance, it recorded $1508million of goodwill, which
caused the Company to no longer satisfy the tangible net worth
covenant, and therefore as of September30, 2005, the
Company was no longer in compliance with all covenants in the
Loan Agreement. The Company can make no guarantees as to its
ability to receive a waiver of its non-compliance, or become in
compliance with the covenants as they currently exist. If the
Company is unable to successfully amend the Loan Agreement, or
otherwise satisfy the parties secured by the outstanding letters
of credit, it will no longer have the borrowing capacity under
the Loan Agreement, and may be required to deposit
$61million of its existing cash or investments to satisfy
the parties secured by the outstanding letters of credit. The
Company believes that it is probable it will be able to satisfy
these parties, and therefore it has not recorded a restriction
on the $61million.   
Equipment Line of Credit In connection with the acquisition of SpeechWorks, the Company
assumed $15million of principal amounts outstanding under
a one-year equipment line-of-credit with a bank which expired on
June30, 2003. As of September30, 2005, a balance of
$01million remains outstanding. Borrowings under this
line are collateralized by the fixed assets purchased and bear
interest at the banks prime rate 675% at
September30, 2005, which is payable in equal monthly
payments over a period of 36months. In accordance with the
terms of the equipment line of credit, as of September30,
2005, principal payments of $01million are due during the
year ending September30, 2006. Under the financing
agreement, the Company is obligated to comply with certain
financial covenants that it was not in compliance with as of
September30, 2005. The remaining $01million is
classified as current in the accompanying consolidated balance
sheet.   
NotesPayable In connection with the LH acquisition, the Company issued a
$35million promissory note the LH Note
to Lernout Hauspie Speech Products, N.V. The Note had
a stated maturity date of December15, 2004 and bore
interest at 9%per annum. The terms of the LH Note
were amended in September 2002 to provide for the acceleration
of the maturity date of the outstanding principal and interest
to January1, 2003 if certain events did not occur by
January1, 2003. The Company did not complete these events
by January1, 2003 and, accordingly, the debt became
immediately due and payable. To fulfill this obligation, on
January3, 2003, the Company paid $33million in full
settlement of all outstanding principal and accrued interest
under the LH Note. In connection with the Philips acquisition on January30,
2003, the Company issued a 50million euro promissory note
the Philips Note to Philips. The unsecured Philips
Note matured on December31, 2003 and bore interest at
5%per annum. Payments of principal and accrued interest
were due at maturity. In connection with the issuance of the
Philips Note, the Company entered into a forward foreign
currency exchange contract on January31, 2003 to hedge the
foreign exchange exposure on the Philips Note. Prior to
December31, 2003, the Company made payments to Philips in
satisfaction of these obligations and the related forward hedges
were also terminated. 86 Table of Contents NUANCE COMMUNICATIONS, INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTSContinued   
Convertible Debenture On January30, 2003, the Company issued a
$275million three-year, zero-interest convertible
subordinated debenture due January 2006 the Convertible
Note to Philips in connection with the Philips
acquisition. The Convertible Note is convertible into shares of
the Companys common stock at $600per share at any
time until maturity at Philips option. The conversion rate
may be subject to adjustments from time to time as provided in
the Convertible Note. The Convertible Note contains a provision
in which all amounts unpaid at maturity will bear interest at a
rate of 3%per quarter until paid. The Convertible Note contains covenants that place restrictions
on the declaration or payment of dividends or distributions
other than distributions of equity securities of the Company
on, or the redemption or purchase of, any shares of the
Companys capital stock while the Convertible Note is
outstanding. This restriction terminates when one-half or more
of the principal amount of the Convertible Note is converted by
Philips into common stock. The Convertible Note contains a
provision which provides Philips the right to require the
Company to redeem the Convertible Note or any remaining portion
of the principal amount, on the date a Change in
Control occurs. The Convertible Note provides that a
Change in Control is deemed to have occurred when
any person or entity acquires beneficial ownership of shares of
capital stock of the Company entitling such person or entity to
exercise 40% or more of the total voting power of all shares of
capital stock of the Company, or the Company sells all or
substantially all of its assets, subject to certain exceptions.
None of the Companys acquisitions has resulted in a Change
in Control.

Accrued Business Combination Costs In connection with several of its acquisitions, the Company has
assumed obligations relating to certain leased facilities that
were abandoned by the acquired companies prior to the
acquisition date, or have been or will be abandoned by the
Company in connection with a restructuring plan implemented as a
result of the acquisitions occurrence. Additionally, the
Company has included in its restructuring plan to eliminate
duplicate personnel or assets in connection with the business
combination. Costs such as these are recognized as liabilities
assumed by the Company, and accordingly are included in the
allocation of the purchase price, resulting in an increase to
the recorded amount of the goodwill. Included in the Companys determination of the fair value
of the obligation are assumptions relating to estimated sublease
income. In addition, for those facilities that were abandoned by
the acquired companies prior to the acquisition date, the gross
payments have been discounted in order to calculate the fair
value of the obligation as of the date of acquisition. As of
September30, 2005 the total gross payments due from the
Company to the landlords of the facilities is
$1040million. This is reduced by $249million of
estimated sublease income and a $92million discount. The
remaining $699million is classified as $149million
of current liability and $550million of long-term
liability. In addition to the facilities accrual, the Company has an
obligation relating to certain incentive compensation for former
employees of the acquired companies whose positions have been
eliminated in connection with the combination. These accruals were first established in connection with the
fiscal 2003 acquisition of SpeechWorks, in fiscal 2005 there
were costs recorded in connection with the Companys
acquisition of Rhetorical, Phonetic 87 Table of Contents NUANCE COMMUNICATIONS, INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL

common stock in semi-annual offerings to employees at a price
equal to the lower of 85% of the closing price on the applicable
offering commencement date or 85% of the closing price on the
applicable offering termination date. The Plan currently meets
all regulatory requirements to be considered a non-compensatory
plan. The Company issued 385,265, 332,119 and
163,837shares of common stock under this plan during
fiscal 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. 95 Table of Contents NUANCE COMMUNICATIONS, INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL

Commitments and Contingencies   
Operating Leases The Company has various operating leases for office space around
the world. In connection with many of its acquisitions the
Company assumed facility lease obligations, among these assumed
obligations are lease payments related to certain office
locations that were vacated by certain of the acquired companies
prior to the acquisition date Note10. Additionally,
certain of the Companys lease obligations have been
included in various restructuring charges, and are included in
the Companys balance sheet as accrued expenses
Note11. The following table outlines the Companys
gross future minimum payments under all non-cancelable operating
leases as of September30, 2005 in thousands

At September30, 2005, the Company has sub-leased certain
office space to third parties. Total sub-lease income under
contractual terms is $117million, or approximately
$11million annually, which has not been reflected in the
above operating lease contractual obligations, will be received
through February 2016. Total rent expense, net of sublease payments, under operating
leases for fiscal 2005, 2004 and 2003 was $74million 40million and $40million, respectively. In connection with certain of its acquisitions, the Company
assumed certain financial guarantees that the acquired companies
had committed to the landlords of certain facilities. These
financial guarantees consist of standby letters of credit
outstanding which are secured by certificates of deposit,
representing the restricted cash requirements that collateralize
the Companys lease obligations. These certificates of
deposit total $117million as of September30, 2005,
and are included in Other Assets. The majority of this amount
relates to one of Former Nuances leases of property that
is not occupied, and is included in the amounts discussed in
Note10.   
Litigation and Other Claims Like many companies in the software industry, the Company has
from time to time been notified of claims that it may be
infringing certain intellectual property rights of others. These
claims have been referred to counsel, and they are in various
stages of evaluation and negotiation. If it appears necessary or
desirable, the Company may seek licenses for these intellectual
property rights. There is no assurance that licenses will be
offered by all claimants, that the terms of any offered licenses
will be acceptable to the Company or that in all cases the
dispute will be resolved without litigation, which may be time
consuming and expensive, and may result in injunctive relief or
the payment of damages by the Company. From time to time, the Company receives information concerning
possible infringement by third parties of the Companys
intellectual property rights, whether developed, purchased or
licensed by the Company. In response to any such circumstance,
the Company has counsel investigate the matter thoroughly and
the Company takes all appropriate action to defend its rights in
these matters. 96 Table of Contents NUANCE COMMUNICATIONS, INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTSContinued On May18, 2005, Former Nuance received a copy of a
complaint naming Former Nuance and the members of the board of
directors as defendants in a lawsuit filed on May13, 2005,
in the Superior Court of the State of California, County of
SanMateo, by Mr.Frank Capovilla, on behalf of
himself and, purportedly, the holders of Former Nuances
common stock. The complaint alleges, among other things, that
Former Nuances board of directors breached their fiduciary
duties to Former Nuances stockholders respecting the
merger agreement that was entered into with the Company. The
complaint seeks to declare that the merger agreement was
unenforceable. The complaint also seeks an award of
attorneys and experts fees. The Company believes the
allegations of this lawsuit are without merit and expects the
Company and its directors are vigorously contesting the action. On August5, 2004, Compression Labs Inc. filed an action
against the Company in the United States District Court for the
Eastern District of Texas claiming patent infringement. Damages
are sought in an unspecified amount. In the lawsuit, Compression
Labs alleges that the Company is infringing United States Patent
No4,698,672 entitles Coding System for Reducing
Redundancy. The Company believes this claim has no merit,
and intends to defend the action vigorously. On July15, 2003, Elliott Davis Davis filed
an action against SpeechWorks in the United States District
Court for the Western District for New York Buffalo claiming
patent infringement. Damages are sought in an unspecified
amount. In addition, on November26, 2003, Davis filed an
action against the Company in the United States District Court
for the Western District for New York Buffalo also claiming
patent infringement. Damages are sought in an unspecified
amount. SpeechWorks filed an Answer and Counterclaim to
Daviss Complaint in its case on August25, 2003 and
the Company filed an Answer and Counterclaim to Daviss
Complaint in its case on December22, 2003. The Company
believes these claims have no merit, and it intends on defending
the actions vigorously. On November27, 2002, AllVoice Computing plc
AllVoice filed an action against the Company in
the United States District Court for the Southern District of
Texas claiming patent infringement. In the lawsuit, AllVoice
alleges that the Company is infringing United States Patent
No5,799,273 entitled Automated Proofreading Using
Interface Linking Recognized Words to Their Audio Data While
Text Is Being Changed the 273 Patent. The
273 Patent generally discloses techniques for manipulating audio
data associated with text generated by a speech recognition
engine. Although the Company has several products in the speech
recognition technology field, the Company believes that its
products do not infringe the 273 Patent because, in addition to
other defenses, they do not use the claimed techniques. Damages
are sought in an unspecified amount. The Company filed an Answer
on December23, 2002. On January4, 2005, the case was
transferred to a new judge of the United States District Court
for the Southern District of Texas for administrative reasons.
The Company believes that it has meritorious defenses and it
intends on defending itself vigorously. In August 2001, the first of a number of complaints was filed,
in the United States District Court for the Southern District of
New York, on behalf of a purported class of persons who
purchased Former Nuance stock between April12, 2000 and
December6, 2000. Those complaints have been consolidated
into one action. The complaint generally alleges that various
investment bank underwriters engaged in improper and undisclosed
activities related to the allocation of shares in Former
Nuances initial public offering of securities. The
complaint makes claims for violation of several provisions of
the federal securities laws against those underwriters, and also
against Former Nuance and some of the Former Nuances
directors and officers. Similar lawsuits, concerning more than
250 other companies initial public offerings, were filed
in 2001. In February 2003, the Court denied a motion to dismiss
with respect to the claims against Former Nuance. In the third
quarter of 2003, a proposed settlement in principle was reached
among the plaintiffs, issuer defendants including Former
Nuance and the issuers insurance carriers. The settlement
calls for the dismissal and release of claims against the issuer
defendants, including Former Nuance, in exchange for a
contingent payment to be paid, if necessary, by the issuer
defendants insurance carriers and an assignment of certain 97 Table of Contents NUANCE COMMUNICATIONS, INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTSContinued claims. The timing of the conclusion of the settlement remains
unclear, and the settlement is subject to a number of
conditions, including approval of the Court. The settlement is
not expected to have any material impact upon Former Nuance or
the Company, as payments, if any, are expected to be made by
insurance carriers, rather than by Former Nuance. In July 2004,
the underwriters filed a motion opposing approval by the court
of the settlement among the plaintiffs, issuers and insurers. In
March 2005, the court granted preliminary approval of the
settlement, subject to the parties agreeing to modify the term
of the settlement which limits each underwriter from seeking
contribution against its issuer for damages it may be forced to
pay in the action. In the event a settlement is not concluded,
the Company intends to defend the litigation vigorously. The
Company believes it has meritorious defenses to the claims
against Former Nuance. The Company believes that the final outcome of the current
litigation matters described above will not have a significant
adverse effect on its financial position and results of
operations. However, even if the Companys defense is
successful, the litigation could require significant management
time and will be costly. Should the Company not prevail in these
litigation matters, its operating results, financial position
and cash flows could be adversely impacted.   
Guarantees and Other The Company currently includes indemnification provisions in the
contracts it enters with its customers and business partners.
Generally, these provisions require the Company to defend claims
arising out of its products infringement of third-party
intellectual property rights, breach of contractual obligations
and/or unlawful or otherwise culpable conduct on its part. The
indemnity obligations imposed by these provisions generally
cover damages, costs and attorneys fees arising out of
such claims. In most, but not all, cases, the Companys
total liability under such provisions is limited to either the
value of the contract or a specified, agreed upon, amount. In
some cases its total liability under such provisions is
unlimited. In many, but not all, cases, the term of the
indemnity provision is perpetual. While the maximum potential
amount of future payments the Company could be required to make
under all the indemnification provisions in its contracts with
customers and business partners is unlimited, it believes that
the estimated fair value of these provisions is minimal due to
the low frequency with which these provisions have been
triggered. The Company has entered into agreements to indemnify its
directors and officers to the fullest extent authorized or
permitted under applicable law. These agreements, among other
things, provide for the indemnification of its directors and
officers for expenses, judgments, fines, penalties and
settlement amounts incurred by any such person in his or her
capacity as a director or officer of the Company, whether or not
such person is acting or serving in any such capacity at the
time any liability or expense is incurred for which
indemnification can be provided under the agreements. In
accordance with the terms of the SpeechWorks merger agreement,
the Company is required to indemnify the former members of the
SpeechWorks board of directors, on similar terms as described
above, for a period of six years from the acquisition date. In
connection with this indemnification, the Company was required
to purchase a director and officer insurance policy related to
this obligation for a period of three years from the date of
acquisition, this three year policy was purchased in 2003. In
accordance with the terms of the Former Nuance merger agreement,
the Company is required to indemnify the former members of the
Former Nuance board of directors, on similar terms as described
above, for a period of six years from the acquisition date. In
connection with this indemnification, the Company was required
to purchase, and has purchased, a director and officer insurance
policy related to this obligation covering the full period of
six years. On January21, 2005, the Company, as tenant, entered into a
lease with Wayside Realty Trust Wayside, as
landlord the Lease. Pursuant to the Lease, the
Company is leasing office space in Burlington, MA, for an
initial term of ten years beginning on June1, 2005. Rent
payments are due monthly, in advance. The Lease provides for
escalating rent payments, which the Company is recording as rent
expense on a straight line basis over the term of the lease.
Under the terms of the Lease, the Company is also required to 98 Table of Contents NUANCE COMMUNICATIONS, INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTSContinued pay utilities, property taxes, and other operating and
maintenance expenses relating to the leased facilities. As a
security deposit for the Companys obligations under the
Lease, in April 2005, the Company delivered to Wayside a letter
of credit in the amount of $33million. On each successive
anniversary of the term commencement date, the letter of credit
will be reduced by 10% until the security deposit total has been
reduced to $18million. On the eighth anniversary of the
term commencement date, the security deposit will be reduced to
$13million, and shall continue as such throughout the
remainder of the initial lease term.   
17.
401k Savings Plan The Company has established a retirement savings plan under
Section401k of the Internal Revenue Code the
401k Plan. The 401k Plan covers substantially
all employees of the Company who meet minimum age and service
requirements, and allows participants to defer a portion of
their annual compensation on a pre-tax basis. Effective
July1, 2003, Company match of employees
contributions was established, dollar for dollar up to 2% of
salary. Employees who were hired prior to April1, 2004 are
100% vested into the plan as soon as they start to contribute to
the plan. Employees hired April1, 2004 and thereafter,
vest one-third of the contribution annually over a three year
period. The Companys contributions to the 401k Plan
totaled $07million, $05million and
$02million for fiscal 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively.

The benefits for federal income taxes in fiscal 2003 relate to
refunds related to Caere Corporation. The deferred income tax provision in fiscal 2005 and fiscal 2004
includes a $30 million and $09million provision to
increase the deferred tax valuation allowance, respectively. A
portion of the deferred tax liabilities are created by taxable
temporary differences related to certain goodwill for which the
period the differences will reverse is indefinite. Following the
adoption of SFAS142, taxable temporary differences
creating deferred tax liabilities as a result of different
treatment of goodwill for book and tax purposes cannot offset
deductible temporary differences that create deferred tax assets
in determining the valuation allowance. As a result, a deferred
tax provision is required to increase the Companys
valuation allowance. The deferred tax provision in fiscal 2003
includes $04million related to fiscal 2002. 99 Table of Contents NUANCE COMMUNICATIONS, INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL

The cumulative amount of undistributed earnings of foreign

for which U.S.income taxes have not been provided, totaled
approximately $38million at September30, 2005. An
estimate of the tax consequences from the repatriation of these
earnings is not practicable at this time due to conditions and

The increase in Nuances net deferred tax assets before
valuation allowance to $215million from $78million
as of September30, 2005 compared to September30,
2004, primarily relates to incremental tax assets due to the
attributes of companies acquired in fiscal 2005. At September30, 2005 and 2004, the Company provided a full
valuation allowance for its net deferred tax assets in the
United States due to the uncertainty of realization of those
assets as a result of the recurring and cumulative losses from
operations. The Company monitors the realization of its deferred tax assets
based on changes in circumstances, for example, recurring
periods of income for tax purposes following historical periods
of cumulative losses or changes in tax laws or regulations. The
Companys income tax provisions and its assessment of the
realizability 100 Table of Contents NUANCE COMMUNICATIONS, INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTSContinued of its deferred tax assets involve significant judgments and
estimates. If the Company generates taxable income through
profitable operations in future years it may be required to
recognize these deferred tax assets through the reduction of the
valuation allowance which would result in a material benefit to
its results of operations in the period in which the benefit is
determined, excluding the recognition of the portion of the
valuation allowance which relates to net deferred tax assets
acquired in a business combination and stock compensation. The
valuation allowance with respect to acquired tax assets of
approximately $1785million when subsequently released,
will reduce goodwill, other intangible assets, and to the extent
remaining, the provision for income tax. A reconciliation of the Companys effective tax rate to the
statutory federal rate is as follows

At September30, 2005 and 2004, the Company had federal net
operating loss carryforwards of approximately
$3790million and $1607million, respectively, of
which approximately $290million and $272million,
respectively, relate to tax deductions from stock compensation.
The tax benefit related to the stock compensation
$110million and $100million as of
September30, 2005 and 2004, respectively, when realized,
will be accounted for as additional paid-in capital rather than
as a reduction of the provision for income tax. At
September30, 2005 and 2004, the Company had state net
operating loss carryforwards of approximately $930million
and $164million, respectively. At September30, 2005
the Company had federal and state research and development
credit carryforwards of approximately $96million and
$63million, respectively. At September30, 2004 the
Company had federal and state research and development credit
carryforwards of approximately $65million and
$14million, respectively. The net operating loss and
credit carryforwards will expire at various dates through 2025,
if not utilized. Utilization of the net operating losses and credits are subject
to an annual limitation due to the ownership change limitations
provided by the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 and similar state
provisions. The annual limitation will result in the expiration
of certain net operating losses and credits before utilization.

Related Parties At December31, 2003, Xerox owned approximately 15% of the
Companys outstanding common stock and all of the
Companys outstanding SeriesB Preferred Stock. In
addition, Xerox had the opportunity to acquire additional shares
of common stock pursuant to a warrant Note13. On
March19, 2004, the 102 Table of Contents NUANCE COMMUNICATIONS, INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTSContinued Company announced that Warburg Pincus, had agreed to purchase
all outstanding shares of the Companys stock held by Xerox
Corporation for approximately $80million. As a result of
the Xerox and Warburg Pincus transaction, Xerox is no longer a
related party as of June30, 2004. During fiscal 2004 and
2003, Xeroxs related party revenue accounted for 1% and
5%, respectively, of the Companys total revenue under
several non-exclusive agreements in which the Company grants
Xerox the royalty-bearing right to copy and distribute certain
versions of the Companys software programs. The Company
does not engage in transactions in the normal course of its
business with Warburg Pincus. In connection with the Caere acquisition in the first quarter of
2000 and pursuant to a concurrent non-competition and consulting
agreement, the Company agreed to pay in cash to the former Caere
President and CEO, a current member of the Board of Directors of
the Company, on the second anniversary of the merger,
March13, 2002, the difference between $1350 and the
closing price per share of Nuance common stock at that time,
multiplied by 486,548. On March5, 2002, the Company
negotiated a deferred payment agreement with the former Caere
President and CEO to terminate this agreement. Under the terms
of the deferred payment agreement, the Company paid
$10million in cash on March5, 2002 and agreed to
make future cash payments totaling $33million, with such
amounts payable in equal quarterly installments of approximately
$04million over the following two years. During fiscal
2004, the Company paid the final quarterly installment under
this agreement totaling $04million. The total
consideration of this agreement was accounted for in the
original Caere purchase price and had no effect on the results
of operations in fiscal 2004 or 2003. At September30, 2005 and 2004, a member of the
Companys Board of Directors is a senior executive at
Convergys Corporation. The Company and Convergys have entered
into multiple non-exclusive agreements in which Convergys
resells the Companys software. During fiscal 2005 and
2004, Convergys accounted for approximately $39,000 and
$03million in total net revenue, respectively. As of
September30, 2005 and 2004, Convergys owed the Company
$2,000 and $01million, respectively, pursuant to these
agreements. These amounts are included in accounts receivable. A member of the Companys Board of Directors is also a
partner at Wilson Sonsini Goodrich Rosati, Limited
Partnership, a law firm that provides services to the Company.
In fiscal 2005, 2004 and 2003 the Company paid
$21million, $07million and $18million,
respectively, to Wilson Sonsini Goodrich Rosati for
professional services provided to the Company. As of
September30, 2005 and 2004 the Company had
$25million and $03million, respectively, included
in accounts payable and accrued expenses to Wilson Sonsini
Goodrich Rosati. 103 Table of Contents NUANCE COMMUNICATIONS, INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
