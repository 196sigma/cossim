43 REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM To the Board of Directors and Shareholders of Ciena Corporation We have completed integrated audits of Ciena Corporations 2006 and 2005 consolidated
financial statements and of its internal control over financial reporting as of October31, 2006,
and an audit of its 2004 consolidated financial statements in accordance with the standards of the
Public Company Accounting Oversight Board United States. Our opinions, based on our audits, are
presented below. Consolidated financial statements In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements listed in the accompanying index present
fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Ciena Corporation and its subsidiaries
at October31, 2006 and 2005, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of
the three years in the period ended October31, 2006 in conformity with accounting principles
generally accepted in the United States of America. These financial statements are the
responsibility of the Companys management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these
financial statements based on our audits. We conducted our audits of these statements in accordance
with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board United States. Those
standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether
the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit of financial statements
includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the
financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by
management, and evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits
provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. As discussed in Note 1 to the
consolidated financial statements, the Company changed the
manner in which it accounts for share-based compensation in fiscal year 2006. Internal control over financial reporting Also, in our opinion, managements assessment, included in Report of Management on Internal
Control Over Financial Reporting appearing under Item9A, that the Company maintained effective
internal control over financial reporting as of October31, 2006 based on criteria established in
Internal Control Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the
Treadway Commission COSO, is fairly stated, in all material respects, based on those criteria.
Furthermore, in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal
control over financial reporting as of October31, 2006, based on criteria established in Internal
Control Integrated Framework issued by the COSO. The Companys management is responsible for
maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the
effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting. Our responsibility is to express
opinions on managements assessment and on the effectiveness of the Companys internal control over
financial reporting based on our audit. We conducted our audit of internal control over financial
reporting in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board United
States. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance
about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material
respects. An audit of internal control over financial reporting includes obtaining an understanding
of internal control over financial reporting, evaluating managements assessment, testing and
evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control, and performing such other
procedures as we consider necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a
reasonable basis for our opinions. A companys internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide
reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of
financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting
principles. A companys internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and
procedures that ipertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately
and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; iiprovide
reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial
statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and
expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and
directors of the company; and iiiprovide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely
detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the companys assets that could have
a material effect on the financial statements. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not
prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future
periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in
conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. s/PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 1CIENA CORPORATION AND SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES Description of Business Ciena Corporation is a supplier of communications networking equipment, software and services
that support the delivery and transport of voice, video and data services. Our products are used in
communications networks operated by telecommunications service providers, cable operators,
governments and enterprises across the globe. We specialize in transitioning legacy communications
networks to converged, next-generation architectures, capable of efficiently delivering a broader
mix of high-bandwidth services. By improving network productivity, reducing costs and enabling
integrated services offerings, our optical, data and broadband access platforms create business and
operational value for our customers. Ciena was incorporated in Delaware in November1992, and completed its initial public offering
on February7, 1997. Cienas principal executive offices
are located at 1201 Winterson Road,
Linthicum, Maryland 21090. Principles of Consolidation Ciena has 14 wholly owned U.S. and international subsidiaries, which have been consolidated in
the accompanying financial statements. On May3, 2004, Ciena acquired by merger Catena Networks
Inc. Catena, a Delaware company based in Kanata, Canada, and Internet Photonics, Inc.
Internet Photonics, a Delaware company based in Shrewsbury, New Jersey. The Catena and Internet
Photonics transactions were both accomplished as tax-free reorganizations, and were recorded using
the purchase accounting method. The accompanying consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Ciena and its
wholly owned subsidiaries. All material inter-company accounts and transactions have been
eliminated in consolidation. Fiscal Year Ciena has a 52 or 53week fiscal year, which ends on the Saturday nearest to the last day of
October in each year October28, 2006, October29, 2005, and October30, 2004. For purposes of
financial statement presentation, each fiscal year is described as having ended on October31.
Fiscal 2006, fiscal 2005 and fiscal 2004 were each comprised of 52weeks. Use of Estimates The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting
principles requires Ciena to make estimates, judgments and assumptions that affect the reported
amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses, together with amounts disclosed in the
related notes to the financial statements. Actual results could differ from the recorded estimates. Cash and Cash Equivalents Ciena considers all highly liquid investments purchased with original maturities of three
months or less to be cash equivalents. Restricted cash collateralizing letters of credits are
included in other current assets and other long-term assets depending upon the duration of the
restriction. Investments Cienas short-term and long-term investments are classified as available-for-sale and are
reported at fair value, with unrealized gains and losses, net of tax, recorded in accumulated other
comprehensive income. Realized gains or losses and declines in value determined to be other than
temporary, if any, on available-for-sale securities, are reported in other income or expense as
incurred. Ciena also has certain other minority equity investments in privately held technology
companies. These investments are carried at cost because Ciena owns less than 20% of the voting
equity and does not have the ability to exercise significant influence over these companies. These
investments are inherently high risk as the markets for technologies or products
manufactured by these companies are usually early stage at the time of the investment by Ciena
and such markets may never 49 be significant. Ciena could lose its entire investment in some or all of
these companies. Ciena monitors these investments for impairment and makes appropriate reductions
in carrying values when necessary. Inventories Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market, with cost determined on the first-in,
first-out basis. Ciena records a provision for excess and obsolete inventory whenever an impairment
has been identified. Equipment, Furniture and Fixtures Equipment, furniture and fixtures are recorded at cost. Depreciation and amortization are
computed using the straight-line method over useful lives of two years to five years for equipment,
furniture and fixtures and nine months to ten years for leasehold improvements. Impairments of
equipment, furniture and fixtures are determined in accordance with Statement of Financial
Accounting Standards SFASNo144, Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived
Assets. Internal use software and web site development costs are capitalized in accordance with
Statement of Position SOPNo98-1, Accounting for the Costs of Computer Software Developed or
Obtained for Internal Use, and Emerging Issues Task Force EITFIssue No00-2, Accounting for
Web Site Development Costs. Qualifying costs incurred during the application development stage,
which consist primarily of outside services and purchased software license costs, are capitalized
and amortized over the estimated useful life of the asset. Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets Ciena has recorded goodwill and purchased intangible assets as a result of several
acquisitions. Ciena accounts for goodwill in accordance with SFAS 142 Goodwill and Other
Intangible Assets, which requires Ciena to test each reporting units goodwill for impairment on
an annual basis, which Ciena has determined to be the last business day of fiscal September each
year. Testing is required between annual tests if events occur or circumstances change that would,
more likely than not, reduce the fair value of the reporting unit below its carrying value. Purchased intangible assets are carried at cost less accumulated amortization. Amortization is
computed using the straight-line method over the economic lives of the respective assets, generally
three to seven years. Impairments of other intangibles assets are determined in accordance SFAS
144. For additional information see Note 4. Concentrations Substantially all of Cienas cash and cash equivalents, short-term and long-term investments,
are maintained at two major U.S. financial institutions. The majority of Cienas cash equivalents
consist of money market funds and overnight repurchase agreements. Deposits held with banks may
exceed the amount of insurance provided on such deposits. Generally, these deposits may be redeemed
upon demand and, therefore, bear minimal risk. During fiscal 2006, Sprint, Verizon and ATT each accounted for at least 10% of Cienas
revenue. During fiscal 2005, Verizon, BellSouth, and Science Applications International Corporation
SAICeach accounted for at least 10% of Cienas revenue. During fiscal 2004, only SAIC accounted
for at least 10% of Cienas revenue. The substantial reduction in orders by, or loss of, any
significant customer, could materially adversely affect Cienas financial condition or operating
results. For additional information see Note 19. Additionally, Cienas access to certain raw materials is dependent upon single and sole source
suppliers. The inability of any supplier to fulfill Cienas supply requirements could affect future
results. Ciena relies on a small number of contract manufacturers to perform the majority of the
manufacturing operations for its products. If Ciena cannot effectively manage these manufacturers
and forecast future demand, or if they fail to deliver products or components on time, Cienas
business may suffer. Revenue Recognition Ciena recognizes revenue in accordance with Staff Accounting Bulletin SABNo104, Revenue
Recognition, which states that revenue is realized or realizable and earned when all of the
following criteria are met: persuasive evidence of an
arrangement exists; delivery has occurred or services have been rendered; the price to the
buyer is fixed or determinable; and collectibility is reasonably assured. In instances where final
acceptance of the product, system, or solution is specified by the 50 customer, revenue is deferred
until all acceptance criteria have been met. Revenue for maintenance services is generally deferred
and recognized ratably over the period during which the services are to be performed. Some of Cienas communications networking equipment is integrated with software that is
essential to the functionality of the equipment. In some cases, Ciena provides unspecified software
upgrades and enhancements related to the equipment through maintenance contracts for these
products. For transactions involving the sale of software, revenue is recognized in accordance with
SOP 97-2, Software Revenue Recognition, including deferral of revenue recognition in instances
where vendor specific objective evidence for undelivered elements is not determinable. For arrangements that involve the delivery or performance of multiple products, services
and/or rights to use assets, except as otherwise covered by SOP 97-2, the determination as to how
the arrangement consideration should be measured and allocated to the separate deliverables of the
arrangement is determined in accordance with EITF 00-21, Revenue Arrangements with Multiple
Deliverables. When a sale involves multiple elements, such as sales of products that include
services, the entire fee from the arrangement is allocated to each respective element based on its
relative fair value and recognized when revenue recognition criteria for each element are met. Fair
value for each element is established based on the sales price charged when the same element is
sold separately. Revenue Related Accruals Ciena provides for the estimated costs to fulfill customer warranty and other contractual
obligations upon the recognition of the related revenue. Such reserves are determined based upon
actual warranty cost experience, estimates of component failure rates, and managements industry
experience. Cienas sales contracts do not permit the right of return of product by the customer
after the product has been accepted. Accounts Receivable Trade, Net Cienas allowance for doubtful accounts is based on its assessment, on a specific
identification basis, of the collectibility of customer accounts. Ciena performs ongoing credit
evaluations of its customers and generally has not required collateral or other forms of security
from its customers. In determining the appropriate balance for Cienas allowance for doubtful
accounts, management considers each individual customer account receivable in order to determine
collectibility. In doing so, management considers creditworthiness, payment history, account
activity and communication with such customer. If a customers financial condition changes, Ciena
may be required to take a charge for an allowance for doubtful accounts. Research and Development Ciena charges all research and development costs to expense as incurred. Types of expense
incurred in research and development include employee compensation, prototype, consulting,
depreciation, facility costs and information technologies. Advertising Costs Ciena expenses all advertising costs as incurred. Share-Based Compensation Expense On November1, 2005, Ciena adopted SFAS 123R, Share-Based Payment, which requires the
measurement and recognition of compensation expense, based on estimated fair values, for all
share-based awards, made to employees and directors, including stock options, restricted stock,
restricted stock units and participation in Cienas employee stock purchase plan. In March2005,
the Securities and Exchange Commission issued SAB 107 relating to SFAS 123R. Ciena has applied
the provisions of SAB 107 in its adoption of SFAS 123R. Ciena adopted SFAS 123R using the modified prospective application transition method, which
requires the application of the accounting standard as of November1, 2005, the first day of
Cienas fiscal year 2006. Cienas consolidated financial statements for fiscal 2006 reflect the
impact of SFAS 123R. In accordance with the modified prospective application transition method,
Cienas consolidated financial statements for prior periods have not been restated
to reflect, and do not include, the impact of SFAS 123R. Share-based compensation cost recognized
under SFAS 123R for fiscal 2006 was $140million, of which $03million was capitalized as part
of inventory. 51 Prior to the adoption of SFAS 123R, Ciena accounted for share-based awards to employees and
directors using the intrinsic value method in accordance with Accounting Principles Board APB
Opinion No25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees, as interpreted by FASB Interpretation
FINNo44, Accounting for Certain Transactions Involving Stock Compensation, an Interpretation
of APB Opinion No25, as allowed under SFAS 123, Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation.
Share-based compensation expense of $94million and $119million for fiscal 2005 and fiscal 2004,
respectively, was solely related to share-based awards assumed through acquisitions and restricted
stock unit awards that Ciena had been recognizing in its consolidated statement of operations in
accordance with the provisions set forth above. Because the exercise price of Cienas stock options
granted to employees and directors equaled the fair market value of the underlying stock at the
grant date, under the intrinsic value method, no share-based compensation expense was otherwise
recognized in Cienas consolidated statement of operations. SFAS 123R requires companies to estimate the fair value of share-based awards on the date of
grant using an option-pricing model. The value of the portion of the award that is ultimately
expected to vest is recognized as expense in Cienas consolidated statement of operations over the
requisite service periods. Share-based compensation expense recognized in Cienas consolidated
statement of operations for fiscal 2006 includes compensation expense for share-based awards
granted iprior to, but not yet vested as of October31, 2005, based on the grant date fair value
estimated in accordance with the provisions of SFAS 123, and iisubsequent to October31, 2005,
based on the grant date fair value estimated in accordance with the provisions of SFAS 123R. Upon
adoption of SFAS 123R, Ciena changed its method of attributing the value of share-based
compensation expense from the accelerated multiple-option approach to the straight-line
single-option method. Compensation expense for all share-based awards granted on or prior to
October31, 2005 will continue to be recognized using the accelerated multiple-option approach.
Compensation expense for all share-based awards subsequent to October31, 2005 is recognized using
the straight-line single-option method. Because share-based compensation expense is based on awards
that are ultimately expected to vest, share-based compensation expense has been reduced to account
for estimated forfeitures. SFAS 123R requires forfeitures to be estimated at the time of grant
and revised, if necessary, in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates.
In Cienas pro forma information required under SFAS 123 for periods prior to fiscal 2006, Ciena
accounted for forfeitures as they occurred. To calculate option-based compensation under SFAS 123R, Ciena uses the Black-Scholes
option-pricing model, which it had previously used for valuation of option-based awards for its pro
forma information required under SFAS 123 for periods prior to fiscal 2006. Cienas determination
of fair value of option-based awards on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes model is affected
by Cienas stock price as well as assumptions regarding a number of subjective variables. These
variables include, but are not limited to Cienas expected stock price volatility over the term of
the awards, and actual and projected employee stock option exercise behaviors. For additional
information see Note 16. No tax benefits were attributed to the share-based compensation expense because a full
valuation allowance was maintained for all net deferred tax assets. Income Taxes Ciena accounts for income taxes in accordance with SFAS 109, Accounting for Income Taxes.
SFAS 109 describes an asset and liability approach that requires the recognition of deferred tax
assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences attributable to differences between
the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and their
respective tax bases, and for operating loss and tax credit carry forwards. In estimating future
tax consequences, SFAS 109 generally considers all expected future events other than the enactment
of changes in tax laws or rates. Valuation allowances are provided, if, based upon the weight of
the available evidence, it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will
not be realized. Fair Value of Financial Instruments The carrying amounts of Cienas financial instruments, which include short-term and long-term
investments, accounts receivable, accounts payable, and other accrued expenses, approximate their
fair values due to their short maturities. Foreign Currency Translation Some of Cienas foreign branch offices and subsidiaries use the U.S. dollar as their
functional currency, because Ciena, as the U.S. parent entity, exclusively funds the operations of
these branch offices and subsidiaries with U.S. dollars. For those subsidiaries using the local
currency as their functional currency, assets and liabilities are translated at exchange rates in
effect at the balance sheet date. Resulting translation adjustments are recorded directly to a
separate component of 52 stockholders equity. Where the U.S. dollar is the functional currency,
translation adjustments are recorded in other income. The net gain losson foreign currency
re-measurement and exchange rate changes for fiscal 2006, fiscal 2005 and fiscal 2004 was
immaterial for separate financial statement presentation. Computation of Basic Net Income Loss per Common Share and Diluted Net Income Loss per Dilutive
Potential Common Share Ciena calculates earnings per share EPSin accordance with the SFAS 128, Earnings per
Share. This statement requires dual presentation of basic and diluted EPS on the face of the
income statement for entities with a complex capital structure and requires a reconciliation of the
numerator and denominator used for the basic and diluted EPS computations. Software Development Costs SFAS 86, Accounting for the Costs of Computer Software to be Sold, Leased or Otherwise
Marketed, requires the capitalization of certain software development costs incurred subsequent to
the date technological feasibility is established and prior to the date the product is generally
available for sale. The capitalized cost is then amortized over the estimated product life. Ciena
defines technological feasibility as being attained at the time a working model is completed. To
date, the period between achieving technological feasibility and the general availability of such
software has been short, and software development costs qualifying for capitalization have been
insignificant. Accordingly, Ciena has not capitalized any software development costs. Segment Reporting SFAS 131, Disclosures about Segments of an Enterprise and Related Information, establishes
annual and interim reporting standards for operating segments of a company. It also requires
entity-wide disclosures about the products and services an entity provides, the material countries
in which it holds assets and reports revenue, and its major customers. Prior to the third quarter of fiscal 2006 Ciena reported its results of operations based on
four operating segments: the Transport and Switching Group TSG, the Data Networking Group DNG,
the Broadband Access Group BBGand Global Network Services GNS. In an effort to address
increased market opportunities for product convergence, facilitate product functionality cross-over
and improve operational efficiency, Ciena reorganized aspects of the management of its business.
Ciena eliminated its former business units and no longer has operating segment general managers.
Cienas development resources were reorganized along technology skill sets applicable across
multiple products, rather than by specific product lines. In addition, Ciena no longer manages its
business, allocates its resources or evaluates its operating performance on the basis of financial
information about its former business units. As a consequence, Ciena eliminated its historical
operating segments and discontinued reporting its results of operations on a historical segment
basis. Revenue from sales to customers outside of the United States is reflected as International in
Cienas geographic distribution of revenue in entity wide disclosures. Reclassification Certain prior year amounts have been reclassified to conform to current year consolidated
financial statement presentation. Newly Issued Accounting Standards In September2006, the Securities and Exchange Commission SECissued SAB 108, Considering
the Effects of Prior Year Misstatements when Quantifying Misstatements in Current Year Financial
Statements. SAB 108 provides interpretative guidance on the process of quantifying financial
statement misstatements and is effective for fiscal years ending after November15, 2006. Ciena
does not believe that the adoption of this statement will have a material impact on its financial
condition, results of operations or cash flows. In September2006, the Financial Accounting Standards Board FASBissued SFAS 157, Fair
Value Measurements. SFAS 157 defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value
under generally accepted accounting principles, and expands disclosures about fair value
measurements. SFAS 157 is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning
after November15, 2007, and interim periods within those fiscal years. Ciena is currently
evaluating the impact the adoption of this statement could have on its financial condition, results
of operations or cash flows. 53 In July2006, the FASB issued FIN 48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes, an
interpretation of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No109, Accounting for Income
Taxes. FIN 48 clarifies the accounting for income taxes by prescribing the minimum recognition
threshold a tax position is required to meet before being recognized in the financial statements.
FIN 48 also provides guidance on derecognition, measurement, classification, interest and
penalties, accounting in interim periods, disclosure and transition. The interpretation applies to
all tax positions related to income taxes subject to SFAS 109. FIN 48 is effective for fiscal years
beginning after December15, 2006. Differences between the amounts recognized in the statements of
financial position prior to the adoption of FIN 48 and the amounts reported after adoption should
be accounted for as a cumulative-effect adjustment recorded to the beginning balance of retained
earnings. Ciena is currently evaluating the impact the adoption of this interpretation could have
on its financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. In February2006, the FASB issued SFAS 155, Accounting for Certain Hybrid Financial
Instruments which amends SFAS 133, Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities
and SFAS 140, Accounting for Transfers and Servicing of Financial Assets and Extinguishments of
Liabilities. SFAS 155 simplifies the accounting for certain derivatives embedded in other
financial instruments by allowing them to be accounted for as a whole if the holder elects to
account for the whole instrument on a fair value basis. SFAS 155 also clarifies and amends certain
other provisions of SFAS 133 and SFAS 140. SFAS 155 is effective for all financial instruments
acquired, issued or subject to a remeasurement event occurring in fiscal years beginning after
September15, 2006. Ciena does not believe the adoption of this statement will have a material
impact on its financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. In May2005, the FASB issued SFAS 154, Accounting Changes and Error Corrections which
supersedes APB Opinion No20, Accounting Changes and SFAS 3, Reporting Accounting Changes in
Interim Financial Statements. SFAS 154 changes the requirements for the accounting for and
reporting of a change in accounting principle. SFAS 154 also carries forward without change the
guidance contained in APB 20 for reporting the correction of an error in previously issued
financial statements and a change in accounting estimate. SFAS 154 requires retrospective
application to prior periods financial statements of changes in accounting principle, unless it is
impracticable to determine either the period-specific effects or the cumulative effect of the
change. The correction of an error in previously issued financial statements is not a change in
accounting principle. However, the reporting of an error correction involves adjustments to
previously issued financial statements similar to those generally applicable to reporting an
accounting change retroactively. Therefore, the reporting of a correction of an error by restating
previously issued financial statements is also addressed by SFAS 154. SFAS 154 is effective for
accounting changes and corrections of errors made in fiscal years beginning after December15,
2005. Ciena does not believe that the adoption of this statement will have a material impact on its
financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. 2BUSINESS COMBINATIONS In fiscal 2004, Ciena acquired Catena and Internet Photonics. As a result of these
acquisitions, Ciena has recorded charges for in-process research and development and recorded
intangible assets related to existing technology. In-process research and development represents in-process technology that, as of the date of
acquisition, has not reached technological feasibility and has no alternative future use. Based on
valuation assessments, the value of in-process technology is determined by estimating the net cash
flows from the sale of products resulting from the completion of the projects, reduced by the
portions of revenue attributable to developed technology and future completion of the project. The
resulting cash flows are then discounted back to their present values at appropriate discount
rates. Existing technology represents purchased technology for which development had been completed
as of the date of acquisition. This amount is determined using the income approach. This method
consisted of estimating future net cash flows attributable to existing technology for a discrete
projection period and discounting the net cash flows to their present value. The existing
technology will be amortized over its useful life. The purchase price for Cienas acquisitions were based on the average closing price of Cienas
common stock for the two trading days prior to the announcement of the acquisition, the date of the
announcement, and the two trading days after the announcement. The following table summarizes the allocation of the purchase price at the date of the acquisitions

Catena Catena was a privately held corporation headquartered in Kanata, Canada. Pursuant to the terms
of the acquisition agreement, Catena merged into Ciena, and the outstanding shares of Catena common
and preferred stock were exchanged for approximately 9,681,920 shares of Ciena common stock. The
aggregate purchase price was $4661million, which included Ciena common stock valued at $4072
million, Ciena options, warrants and restricted stock valued at $537million, and transaction
costs of $52million. The $730million assigned to existing technology will be amortized over periods ranging from
45 to 65years. The $180million assigned to the contracts, customer relationships and purchase
orders will be amortized over periods ranging from 3months to 45years. The goodwill allocated to the purchase price was $3262million and is not deductible for tax
purposes. The operations of Catena were originally incorporated into Cienas former BBG operating
segment, and accordingly, the goodwill from the transaction was assigned to that operating segment.
For additional information see Note 4. The following unaudited pro forma data summarizes the results of operations for fiscal 2004 as

Internet Photonics Internet Photonics was a privately held corporation headquartered in Shrewsbury, New Jersey.
Pursuant to the terms of the acquisition agreement, Internet Photonics merged into Ciena, and the
outstanding shares of Internet Photonics common 55 and preferred stock were exchanged for
approximately 3,231,902 shares of Ciena common stock. The aggregate purchase price was $1492
million, which included Ciena common stock valued at $1394million, options and restricted stock
valued at $61million, and transaction costs of $37million. The $100million assigned to existing technology will be amortized over 65years. The $22
million assigned to non-compete agreements will be amortized over 12months. The $211million
assigned to the contracts, customer relationships and purchase orders will be amortized over
periods ranging from 3months to 65years. The $94million assigned to the value of the loan
payable to Ciena was based upon the present value of the loan at the time of the acquisition. This
loan was eliminated during the allocation of the purchase price. The goodwill allocated to the purchase price was $1206million and is not deductible for tax
purposes. The operations of Internet Photonics were originally incorporated into Cienas former TSG
operating segment, and accordingly, the goodwill from the transaction was assigned to that
operating segment. For additional information see Note 4. The operations of Internet Photonics are
not material to the consolidated financial statements of Ciena, and accordingly, separate pro forma
financial information has not been presented. 3RESTRUCTURING COSTS Ciena has previously taken actions to align its workforce, facilities and operating costs with
business opportunities. Ciena historically has committed to a restructuring plan and has incurred
the associated liability concurrently in accordance with the provisions of SFAS 146, Accounting
for Costs Associated with Exit or Disposal Activities. The following table displays the activity

During the first quarter of fiscal 2004, Ciena recorded a restructuring charge of
$13million related to the exit of a warehouse, $14million related to workforce
reductions of 52 employees and $07million related to an adjustment to estimates
associated with costs for previously restructured facilities.   
During the second quarter of fiscal 2004, Ciena recorded a restructuring charge of $25
million related to a workforce reduction of 68 employees and $26million primarily related
to an adjustment to estimates associated with costs for previously restructured facilities.   
During the third quarter of fiscal 2004, Ciena recorded a restructuring charge of $125
million related to a workforce reduction of 321 employees, $07million related to exit
activities associated with Cienas San Jose, CA facility and an adjustment of $03million
related to an adjustment to estimates associated with costs for previously restructured
facilities.   
During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2004, Ciena recorded a restructuring charge of $54
million related to a workforce reduction of 119 employees, $258million primarily related
to exit activities associated with Cienas San Jose, CA facility and $38million primarily
related to an adjustment to estimates associated with costs for previously
restructured facilities   b
During the first quarter of fiscal 2005, Ciena recorded a restructuring charge of
approximately $10million related to a workforce reduction of 21 employees and a charge of
approximately $03million related to certain other costs associated with the closure of
its San Jose, CA facility on September30, 2004. This restructuring charge also reflects a
reversed charge of $01million related to an adjustment to estimates associated with costs
for previously restructured facilities. 56   
During the second quarter of fiscal 2005, Ciena recorded a restructuring charge of
approximately $21million related to a workforce reduction of 53 employees and a charge of
approximately $76million related to an adjustment to estimates associated with costs for
previously restructured facilities.   
During the third quarter of fiscal 2005, Ciena recorded a restructuring charge of
approximately $23million related to a workforce reduction of 96 employees and recorded a
charge of approximately $01million related to the closure of one of its Kanata, Canada
facilities. This restructuring charge also reflects approximately $19million related to an
adjustment to estimates associated with costs for previously restructured facilities.   
During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2005, Ciena recorded a restructuring charge of
approximately $04million related to a workforce reduction of 7 employees and recorded a
charge of approximately $04million related to the closure of Cienas Durham, NC
facilities. This restructuring charge also reflects approximately $20million related to an
adjustment to estimates associated with costs for previously restructured facilities.   c
During the first quarter of fiscal 2006, Ciena recorded a charge of $07million
related to the closure of one of its facilities located in Kanata, Canada and a charge of
$15million related to a workforce reduction of 62 employees. During the first quarter of
fiscal 2006, Ciena recorded a credit adjustment of $02million related to costs associated
with previously restructured facilities. During the first quarter of fiscal 2006, Ciena
recorded a gain of $60million related to the buy-out of the lease of its former Fremont,
CA facility, which Ciena had previously restructured.   
During the second quarter of fiscal 2006, Ciena recorded a charge of $07million related to
the closure of its Shrewsbury, NJ facility and a charge of $25million related to a
workforce reduction of 86 employees. During the second quarter of fiscal 2006, Ciena
recorded a credit adjustment of $02million related to costs associated with previously
restructured facilities. During the second quarter of fiscal 2006, Ciena recorded a gain of
$56million related to the buy-out of the lease of its former Cupertino, CA facility, which
Ciena had previously restructured.   
During the third quarter of fiscal 2006, Ciena recorded a charge of $05million related to
a workforce reduction of 7 employees and additional employee costs related to the closure of
its Shrewsbury, NJ facility in the second quarter of fiscal 2006. During the third quarter
of fiscal 2006, primarily due to changes in market conditions, Ciena recorded an adjustment
of $101million related to costs associated with previously restructured facilities, $100
million of which was related to its former facilities located in San Jose, CA. Ciena also
recorded a charge of $04million related to the closure of its facility located in Beijing,
China during the third quarter of fiscal 2006.   
During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2006, Ciena recorded a charge of $01million related to
other costs associated with a previous workforce reduction and a credit of $05million
related to the settlement of a previously recorded facility liability. 4GOODWILL AND LONG-LIVED ASSET IMPAIRMENTS Goodwill Impairment SFAS 142 Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, requires Ciena to test each reporting units
goodwill for impairment on an annual basis, which Ciena has determined to be the last business day
of fiscal September each year. Testing is required between annual tests if events occur or
circumstances change that would, more likely than not, reduce the fair value of the reporting unit
below its carrying value. For fiscal 2006, fiscal 2005 and fiscal 2004, Ciena has determined that
its operating segments and reporting units are the same. Due to the elimination of Cienas former
business units in the third quarter of fiscal 2006, the fair value of Cienas goodwill was tested
for impairment on an enterprise level for fiscal 2006. For fiscal 2005 and fiscal 2004, the fair
value of Cienas goodwill was tested for impairment on a segment level. The table below sets forth
changes in carrying amount of goodwill during fiscal 2004, fiscal 2005 and fiscal 2006 in

Goodwill Assessment Fiscal 2006 During fiscal 2006, Ciena performed an assessment of the fair value of Cienas single
reporting unit and its intangible assets as of September23, 2006. Ciena compared its fair value to
its carrying value including goodwill and determined that
its carrying value, including goodwill, did not exceed fair value. Because the carrying
amount, including goodwill, was less than its fair value, no impairment loss was recorded for
fiscal 2006. During fiscal 2006, the fair value of Ciena was determined using the average market
price of Cienas common stock over a 10-day period before and after September23 57 2006, with a
control premium added to the valuation results. Goodwill Assessment Fiscal 2005 During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2005, Ciena performed its annual test to determine and
measure goodwill impairment on a reporting unit basis. Management performed an assessment of the
fair value of Cienas reporting units and their intangible assets as of September24, 2005. Ciena
compared the fair value of each of its reporting units at that time to each reporting units
carrying value including goodwill. During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2005 and in conjunction with
Cienas annual assessment, it became apparent that developments in the market for broadband loop
carrier products, particularly outside of the United States, would require Ciena to make a
substantial commitment of research and development resources in order to compete successfully in
this market with Cienas CN 1000 Next-Generation Broadband Access platform. Given the
uncertainties associated with this international market and the magnitude of the investment
required, Ciena determined it would not be cost-effective to make such investment and suspended
research and development for this product. This decision significantly reduced Cienas forecasted
long-term revenue for its former BBG reporting unit. As a result, the carrying value of BBG,
including goodwill, exceeded the fair value of BBG as of September24, 2005. The fair value of the
BBG reporting unit was determined using the average of the valuations calculated using market
multiples and discounted cash flows. Because of the forecasted decline in long-term revenue for
BBG, no control premium was added to the valuation results for the BBG reporting unit. Because BBGs carrying value, including goodwill, exceeded the fair value of the reporting
unit as a whole, Ciena assessed the fair value of BBGs individual assets, including identified
intangible assets and liabilities, in order to derive an implied fair value for BBGs goodwill.
Ciena determined the estimated fair value of the identifiable intangible assets of the unit using
discounted cash flows. Ciena used cash flow periods ranging from one to ten years, depending on the
nature of the asset, and assumed that revenue for the BBG reporting unit would decline to zero over
ten years. Ciena used discount rates of 10% to 14%, based on the specific risks and circumstances
associated with the identified intangible assets and Cienas weighted average cost of capital. The
assumptions supporting the estimated discounted cash flows for identified intangible assets,
including the cash flow periods, discount rates and forecasted future revenue, reflect managements
estimates. Ciena determined that the implied fair value of goodwill assigned to BBG was zero.
Because the carrying amount of the goodwill assigned to BBG was greater than the implied fair
value, Ciena recorded an impairment loss of $1766million in fiscal 2005. Goodwill Assessment Fiscal 2004 During fiscal 2004, Ciena performed its annual test to determine and measure goodwill
impairment on a reporting unit basis. Management performed an assessment of the fair value of
Cienas reporting units and their intangible assets as of September27, 2004. Ciena compared the
fair value of each of its reporting units at that time to each reporting units carrying value
including goodwill and determined that the carrying value, including goodwill, of the Core
Networking Group CNG, Metro and Enterprise Solutions Group MESG, and BBG exceeded their
respective fair values as of September27, 2004. This decline in the fair value of CNG, MESG and
BBG was primarily due to the decline in the forecasted demand for Cienas products, along with the
reduction in valuations of comparable businesses. The fair value of CNG, MESG and BBG was
determined using the average of the outcomes from the following valuation methods: market
multiples; comparable transactions; and discounted cash flows. A control premium of 15% to 20% was
added to the valuation results for each reporting unit. Because the carrying value, including goodwill, for CNG, MESG and BBG, exceeded the fair value
of each reporting unit as a whole, Ciena assessed the fair value of each reporting units
respective individual assets, including identified intangible assets and liabilities, in order to
derive an implied fair value for each reporting units goodwill. Ciena determined the estimated
fair value of the identifiable intangible assets of each of the reporting units using discounted
cash flows. Ciena used cash flow periods ranging from one to seven years, depending on the nature
of the asset, applying annual growth rates of 5% to 118%. Ciena used discount rates of 10% to 30%
based of the specific risks and circumstances associated with the identified intangible assets and
Cienas weighted average cost of capital. The assumptions supporting the estimated cash flows for
identified intangible assets and other non-goodwill assets and liabilities, including the discount
rate, reflects managements estimates. Because the carrying amount of the goodwill assigned to CNG,
MESG and BBG was greater than the implied fair values, an impairment loss of $933million, $1290
million and $1494million for CNG, MESG, and
BBG, respectively, was recognized in fiscal 2004. Long-Lived Asset Impairment Equipment, Furniture and Fixtures 58 Ciena did not record an impairment of equipment, furniture and fixtures in fiscal 2006. During
fiscal 2005 and fiscal 2004, Ciena recorded impairment losses of $02million and $159million,
respectively, related to excess equipment, furniture and fixtures that were classified as held for
sale as a result of Cienas restructuring activities. Long-Lived Asset Impairment Other Intangible Assets During fiscal 2006, fiscal 2005, and fiscal 2004, Ciena performed an assessment of the
carrying value of Cienas other intangible assets pursuant to SFAS 144. Ciena did not record an impairment of intangible assets in fiscal 2006 or fiscal 2004. During
fiscal 2005, Ciena recorded a charge of $457million related to the impairment of BBG developed
technology and customer relationships acquired from Catena in May2004. This charge was based on
the amount by which the carrying amount of the intangible assets exceeded their fair value. Fair
value was determined based on discounted future cash flows derived from the intangible assets.
Ciena used a cash flow period of five years and assumed that revenue related to these intangible
assets would decline to zero over five years. The discount rate used was 15%. The assumptions
supporting the estimated future cash flows, including the discount rate reflect managements best
estimates. The discount rate was based upon Cienas weighted average cost of capital as adjusted
for the risks associated with its operations. 5MARKETABLE DEBT AND EQUITY SECURITIES Short-term and long-term investments are comprised of the following in thousands

February1, 2008, in an aggregate principal amount of $6900million. Interest is payable on
February 1st and August 1st of each year. The notes may be converted into
shares of Cienas common stock at any time before their maturity or their prior redemption or
repurchase by Ciena. The conversion rate is 13687 shares per each $1,000 principal amount of
notes, subject to adjustment in certain circumstances. Ciena has the option to redeem all or a
portion of the notes that have not been previously converted at the following redemption prices
expressed as percentage of principle amount 63

During fiscal 2006, Ciena repurchased $1065million of the outstanding 375% convertible
notes for $984million in open market transactions. Ciena recorded a gain on the extinguishment of
debt in the amount of $71million, which consists of the $81million gain from the repurchase of
the notes, less a write-off of $10million of associated debt issuance costs. During fiscal 2005, Ciena repurchased $412million of the outstanding 375% convertible notes
for $369million in open market transactions. Ciena recorded a gain on the extinguishment of debt
in the amount of $39million, which consists of the $43million gain from the repurchase of the
notes, less a write-off of $04million of associated debt issuance costs. At October27, 2006, the fair value of the outstanding $5423million in aggregate principal
amount of 375% convertible notes was $5253million. At October28, 2005, the fair value of the
outstanding $6488million in aggregate principal amount of 375% convertible notes was $5879
million. Fair value is based on the quoted market price for the notes on the dates above. 025% Convertible Senior Notes due May1, 2013 On April10, 2006, Ciena completed a public offering of 025% Convertible Senior Notes due May
1, 2013, in aggregate principal amount of $3000million. The notes bear interest at the annual
rate of 025% from April10, 2006, payable semi-annually on May 1 and November1, commencing on
November1, 2006. The notes are senior unsecured obligations of Ciena and rank equally with all of
Cienas other existing and future senior unsecured debt. At the election of the holder, the notes may be converted prior to maturity into shares of
Ciena common stock at the initial conversion rate of 253001 shares per $1,000 in principal amount,
which is equivalent to an initial conversion price of $395255 per share. The notes may not be
redeemed by Ciena prior to May5, 2009. At any time on or after May5, 2009, if the closing sale
price of Cienas common stock for at least 20 trading days in any 30 consecutive trading day period
ending on the date one day prior to the date of the notice of redemption exceeds 130% of the
conversion price, Ciena may redeem the notes in whole or in part, at a redemption price in cash
equal to the principal amount to be redeemed, plus accrued and unpaid interest. If Ciena undergoes a fundamental change as that term is defined in the indenture, holders
of notes will have the right, subject to certain exemptions, to require Ciena to purchase for cash
any or all of their notes at a price equal to the principal amount, plus accrued and unpaid
interest. If the holder elects to convert his or her notes in connection with a specified
fundamental change, in certain circumstances, Ciena will be required to increase the applicable
conversion rate, depending on the price paid per share for Ciena common stock and the effective
date of the fundamental change transaction. As of October27, 2006, the fair value of the $3000million in aggregate principal amount of
025% convertible senior notes outstanding was $2513million, based on the quoted market price for
the notes. ONI 50% Convertible Subordinated Notes During fiscal 2004, Ciena purchased the remaining $482million of the outstanding ONI 50%
convertible subordinated notes. Ciena paid $492million for the notes with a cumulative accreted
book value of $410million, which resulted in a loss on early extinguishment of debt of $82
million. 13EARNING LOSSPER SHARE CALCULATION The following table in thousands except per share amounts is a reconciliation of the
numerator and denominator of the basic net income lossper common share Basic EPS and the
diluted net income lossper dilutive potential common share Diluted EPS. Basic EPS is
computed using the weighted average number of common shares outstanding. Diluted EPS is computed
using the weighted average number of icommon shares outstanding, iishares issuable upon
vesting of restricted stock units; and iiishares issuable upon exercise of outstanding stock
options and warrants using the treasury stock method. 64

Explanation of Shares Excluded due to Anti-Dilutive Effect For fiscal 2004 and fiscal 2005 respectively, approximately 79million and 93million
shares, representing the weighted average number of shares underlying stock options, restricted
stock units, warrants and Cienas 375% convertible notes, are considered anti-dilutive because
Ciena incurred net losses during these periods. For fiscal 2006, approximately 42million shares, representing the weighted average number of
shares underlying stock options, restricted stock units and warrants, are considered anti-dilutive
because the exercise price of these equity awards is greater than the average per share closing
price on the NASDAQ Stock Market during this period. In addition, approximately 42million and 08
million shares, representing the weighted average number of shares issuable upon conversion of
Cienas 025% convertible senior notes and 375% convertible notes, respectively, are considered
anti-dilutive pursuant to SFAS 128 because the interest expense net of tax and nondiscretionary
adjustments associated with each of the convertible notes above, on a per common share if
converted basis, exceeds Basic EPS for the period. The following table in thousands except per
share amounts summarizes the shares excluded, due

65 14STOCKHOLDERS EQUITY Shareholder Rights Plan In December1997, Cienas Board of Directors adopted a shareholder rights plan. This plan is
designed to deter any potential coercive or unfair takeover tactics in the event of an unsolicited
takeover attempt. It is not intended to prevent a takeover of Ciena on terms that are favorable and
fair to all shareholders and will not interfere with a merger approved by the Board of Directors.
Each right entitles shareholders to buy a unit equal to one one-thousandth of a share of
preferred stock of Ciena. The rights will be exercisable only if a person or a group acquires or
announces a tender or exchange offer to acquire 15% or more of Cienas common stock or if Ciena
enters into certain other business combination transactions not approved by the Board of Directors.
In June2005, Ciena amended its rights plan to raise the ownership trigger to 20% for FMR Corp.,
one of Cienas institutional investors, and certain of its affiliated entities. In the event the rights become exercisable, the rights plan allows for Ciena shareholders to
acquire stock of the surviving corporation, whether or not Ciena is the surviving corporation,
having a value twice that of the exercise price of the rights. The rights were distributed to
shareholders of record in January1998. Pursuant to the terms of Cienas rights plan, the number of
rights attached to each share of common stock was proportionately increased to reflect the reverse
stock split on September22, 2006 described below. The rights will expire on December29, 2007 and
are redeemable for $0001 per right at the approval of Cienas Board of Directors. Call Spread Option Concurrent with Cienas April10, 2006 issuance of 025% Convertible Senior Notes due May1,
2013, Ciena purchased a call spread option on its common stock from an affiliate of the
underwriter. The call spread option is designed to mitigate dilution from the conversion of the
notes to the extent that the market price per share of Ciena common stock upon exercise is greater
than the conversion price, subject to a cap. The call spread option covers approximately 76million shares of Ciena common stock, which is
the number of shares issuable upon conversion of the notes in full. The call spread option
effectively has a lower strike price of $395255 and a higher strike price of $4554025 and is
exercisable and expires on May1, 2013, the maturity date of the notes. Ciena can exercise the call
spread option on a net cash basis, a net share basis or a full physical settlement. A net cash
settlement would result in Ciena receiving an amount ranging from $0, if the market price per share
of Ciena common stock upon exercise is equal to or below the lower strike price, to approximately
$457million, if the market price per share of Ciena common stock upon exercise is at or above the
higher strike price. Settlement of the call spread option on a net share basis would result in
Ciena receiving a number of shares ranging from 0, if the market price per share of Ciena common
stock upon exercise is equal to or below the lower strike price, up to approximately 10million
shares, if the market price per share of Ciena common stock upon exercise is equal to the higher
strike price. The value of the consideration of a net share settlement will be equal to the value
upon a net cash settlement. If the market price is between the lower strike price and the higher
strike price, in lieu of a net share or net cash settlement, Ciena may elect to receive the full
number of shares underlying the call spread option upon payment by Ciena of an aggregate option
exercise price of $3000million. Should there be an early unwind of the call spread option, the
amount of cash or net shares to be received by Ciena will be dependent upon the existing overall
market conditions, and on Cienas stock price, the volatility of Cienas stock and the remaining
term of the call spread option. The number of shares subject to the call spread option and the lower price and higher strike
prices are subject to customary adjustments. The $285million cost of the call spread option was
recorded as a reduction in additional paid in capital. Reverse Stock Split At Cienas annual meeting on March15, 2006, shareholders approved a proposal to authorize the
Board of Directors, in its discretion, to effect a reverse stock split at one of three approved
ratios, at any time prior to the 2007 annual meeting, without further action by shareholders. On
August30, 2006, Cienas Board approved a one-for-seven 1-for-7 reverse stock split of Cienas
common stock. The reverse stock split became effective at 5:00 p.m., Eastern Time, on September22,
2006. Pursuant to the reverse stock split, each seven shares of authorized and outstanding common
stock was reclassified and combined into one share of new common stock. In connection with the reverse stock split, the number of shares of common stock authorized
under Cienas Third 66 Restated Certificate of Incorporation was reduced from 980million to 140
million shares, without any change in par value per common share. The reverse split did not change
the number of shares of Ciena preferred stock authorized, which remains at 20million. All
references to share and per-share data for all periods presented have been adjusted to give effect
to the one-for-seven 1-for-7 reverse stock split. 15INCOME TAXES The provision for income taxes consists of the following in

As of October31, 2006, Ciena had a $249billion net operating loss carry forward and an
$824million income tax credit carry forward which begin to expire in fiscal year 2018 and 2012,
respectively. Cienas ability to use net operating losses and credit carry forwards may be subject
to limitations pursuant to the ownership change rules of the Internal Revenue Code Section382. The income tax provision does not reflect the tax savings resulting from deductions associated
with Cienas equity compensation and convertible debt. The tax benefit of approximately $563
million will be credited to additional paid-in capital when realized. Approximately $1280million of the valuation allowance as of October31, 2006 was
attributable to deferred tax assets associated with the acquisitions of ONI, WaveSmith, Akara,
Catena and IPI that, when realized, will first reduce goodwill, then other non-current intangibles
of the acquired companies, and then income tax expense. As of October
31, 2006, it is anticipated the realization of any valuation
allowance associated with acquisitions would only reduce goodwill. 16SHARE-BASED COMPENSATION EXPENSE During fiscal 2005, the Board of Directors determined that all future grants of stock options,
restricted stock units, or other forms of equity-based compensation will solely be issued under the
Ciena Corporation 2000 Equity Incentive Plan the 2000 Plan and the 2003 Employee Stock Purchase
Plan the ESPP. Ciena Corporation 2000 Equity Incentive Plan The 2000 Plan, which is a shareholder approved plan, was assumed by Ciena as a result of its
merger with ONI. It authorizes the issuance of stock options, restricted stock, restricted stock
units and stock bonuses to employees, officers, directors, consultants, independent contractors and
advisors. The Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors has broad discretion to establish
the terms and conditions for equity awards, including number of shares, vesting and required
service or other performance criteria. The maximum term of any award under the 2000 Plan is ten
years. The exercise price of options may not be less than 85% of the fair market value of the stock
at the date of grant, or 100% of the fair market value for qualified options. Under the terms of the 2000 Plan, the number of shares authorized for issuance will increase
by 50% of the number of issued and outstanding shares of Ciena each January 1st, unless
the Compensation Committee reduces the amount of the increase in any year. By action of the
Compensation Committee, the plan increased by izero shares on January1, 2006, iizero shares
on January1, 2005, and iii95million shares, or 20% of the then issued and outstanding shares
of Ciena,
on January1, 2004. In addition, any shares subject to outstanding options or other awards
under the ONI 1997 Stock Plan, ONI 1998 Equity Incentive Plan, or ONI 1999 Equity Incentive Plan
that are forfeited upon cancellation of the award are available for issuance under the 2000 Plan.
As of October31, 2006, there were 56million shares authorized and available for issuance under
the 2000 Plan. Stock Options The following table is a summary of Cienas stock option activity shares in thousands 68

As of October31, 2006, total unrecognized compensation expense related to unvested stock
options was $110million. This expense is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period
of 19years. On October26, 2005, Cienas Board of Directors accelerated the vesting of approximately 20
million unvested, out-of-the-money stock options previously awarded to employees, officers and
directors under Cienas stock option plans. Certain performance-based options held by executives
were not subject to this acceleration. For purposes of the acceleration, options with an exercise
price greater than $1743 per share were deemed out-of-the-money. The accelerated options, which
were considered fully vested as of October26, 2005, had exercise prices ranging from $1750 to
$32893 per share and a weighted average exercise price of $3073 per share. Ciena did not
accelerate the vesting of options that had an exercise price per share of $1743 or less. The
primary purpose of the accelerated vesting was to enable Ciena to avoid recognizing future
compensation expense associated with these out-of-the-money stock options upon adoption of SFAS
123R for fiscal 2006. Restricted Stock Units A restricted stock unit is a right to receive a share of Ciena common stock when the unit
vests. Ciena calculates the fair value of each restricted stock unit using the intrinsic value
method and recognizes the expense straight-line over the requisite period. The following table is a
summary of Cienas restricted stock unit activity, based on Cienas closing stock price as October
27, 2006 of $2359 per share shares and intrinsic value in thousands 69 The following table is a summary of Cienas restricted stock unit activity in thousands, except per share data

The total intrinsic value of restricted stock units converted during fiscal 2006 was $26
million. As of October31, 2006, total unrecognized compensation expense related to restricted stock
units was $28million. This expense is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of
15years. 2003 Employee Stock Purchase Plan In March2003, Ciena shareholders approved the ESPP, which has a ten-year term and originally
authorized the issuance of 29million shares. At the 2005 annual meeting, Ciena shareholders
approved an amendment increasing the number of shares available to 36million and adopting an
evergreen provision that annually increases the number of shares available by up to 06million
shares, provided that the total number of shares available shall not exceed 36million. Pursuant
to the evergreen provision, the maximum number of shares that may be added to the ESPP during the
remainder of its ten-year term is 40million Under the ESPP, eligible employees may enroll in an offer period during certain open
enrollment periods. New offer periods begin March16 and September16 of each year. Prior to the
offer period commencing September15, 2006, ieach offer period consisted of four, six-month
purchase periods during which employee payroll deductions were accumulated and used to purchase
shares of common stock; and iithe purchase price of the shares was 15% less than the fair market
value on either the first day of an offer period or the last day of a purchase period, whichever
was lower. In addition, if the fair market value on the purchase date was less than the fair market
value on the first day of an offer period, then participants automatically commenced a new offer
period. On May30, 2006, the Compensation Committee amended the ESPP, effective September15, 2006, to
shorten the offer period under the ESPP to six months. As a result of this change, the offer period
and any purchase period will be the same six-month period. Under the amended ESPP, the applicable
purchase price equals 95% of the fair market value of Ciena common stock on the last day of each
purchase period. Employees enrolled with offer periods commenced prior to September15, 2006, will
be permitted to complete the remaining purchase periods in their current offer period. These
amendments were intended to enable the ESPP to be considered a non-compensatory plan under FAS
123R for future offering periods. 70

As of October31, 2006, unrecognized compensation expense related to the ESPP was $05
million. This expense is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of 12years. Share-Based Compensation under SFAS 123R for Fiscal 2006 and APB 25 for Fiscal 2005 and Fiscal
2004 On November1, 2005, Ciena adopted SFAS 123R, which requires the measurement and recognition
of compensation expense, based on estimated fair values, for all share-based payments awards made
to Cienas employees and directors including stock options, restricted stock, restricted stock unit
awards and stock purchased under Cienas ESPP. Prior to the adoption of SFAS 123R, Ciena accounted for share-based awards to employees and
directors using the intrinsic value method in accordance with APB 25, as interpreted by FIN 44,
Accounting for Certain Transactions Involving Stock Compensation, an Interpretation of APB Opinion
No25, as allowed under SFAS 123, Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation. Share-based
compensation expense of $94million and $119million for fiscal 2005 and fiscal 2004 was solely
related to share-based awards assumed through acquisitions and restricted stock unit awards that
Ciena had been recognizing in its consolidated statement of operations in accordance with the
provisions set forth above. Because the exercise price of Cienas stock options granted to
employees and directors equaled the fair market value of the underlying stock at the grant date,
under the intrinsic value method, no share-based compensation expense was otherwise recognized in
Cienas consolidated statement of operations. The following table summarizes share-based compensation expense under SFAS 123R for fiscal
2006; and share-based compensation expense under APB 25, as interpreted by FIN 44 for fiscal 2005
and fiscal 2004, which was allocated as follows in thousands

Fair Value and Assumptions Used to Calculate Fair Value under SFAS 123R and SFAS 123 Assumptions for Option-Based Awards under SFAS 123R The fair value of each option award is estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes

Consistent with SFAS 123R and SAB 107, Ciena considered the implied volatility and
historical volatility of its stock price in determining its expected volatility, and, finding both
to be equally reliable, determined that a combination of both would result in the best estimate of
expected volatility. The risk-free interest rate assumption is based upon observed interest rates appropriate for
the term of Cienas employee stock options. The expected life of employee stock options represents the weighted-average period the stock
options are expected to remain outstanding. Because Ciena considers its options to be plain
vanilla, it calculated the expected term using the simplified method as prescribed in SAB 107.
Under SAB 107, options are considered to be plain vanilla if they have the following basic
characteristics: granted at-the-money; exerciseability is conditioned upon service through the
vesting date; termination of service prior to vesting results in forfeiture; limited exercise
period following termination of service; options are non-transferable and non-hedgeable. The dividend yield assumption is based on Cienas history and expectation of dividend payouts. As share-based compensation expense recognized in the consolidated statement of operations for
fiscal 2006 is based on awards ultimately expected to vest, it has been reduced for estimated
forfeitures. Forfeitures were estimated based on Cienas historical experience. Assumptions for option-based awards under SFAS 123 Prior to the first quarter of fiscal 2006, Ciena considered the implied volatility and
historical volatility of its stock price in determining its expected volatility. The risk-free
interest rate was based upon assumption of interest rates appropriate for 72 the term of Cienas
employee stock options. The dividend yield assumption was based on Cienas history and expectation
of dividend payouts. Forfeitures prior to the first quarter of fiscal 2006 were accounted for as
they occurred. Assumptions for Restricted Stock Unit Awards under SFAS 123R and SFAS 123 The fair value of each restricted stock unit award is estimated on the date of grant using the
intrinsic value method. The weighted average fair value of each restricted stock unit granted under
Cienas stock option plans for fiscal 2006 and 2004 was $1947 and $4478, respectively. No
restricted stock unit awards were made during fiscal 2005. Assumptions for Employee Stock Purchase Plan Awards under SFAS 123R On May30, 2006, the Compensation Committee amended the ESPP, effective September15, 2006, to
shorten the offer period under the ESPP from twenty four months to six months. As a result of this
change, the offer period and any purchase period will be the same six-month period. Under the
amended ESPP, the applicable purchase price equals 95% of the fair market value of Ciena common
stock on the last day of each purchase period. These amendments were intended to enable the ESPP to
be considered a non-compensatory plan under FAS 123R for future offering periods. Employees enrolled with offer periods that commenced prior to September15, 2006 are permitted
to complete the remaining purchase periods in their current offer period. For these continuing
offer periods, the fair value is determined as of the grant date, using the graded vesting
approach. Under the graded vesting approach, the 24-month ESPP offer period, which consists of
four, six-month purchase periods, is treated for valuation purpose as four separate option tranches
with individual lives of six, 12, 18 and 24months, each commencing on the initial grant date. Each
tranche is expensed straight-line over its individual life. 17OTHER EMPLOYEE BENEFIT PLANS Employee 401k Plan Ciena has a 401k defined contribution profit sharing plan. The plan covers all U.S. based
employees who are not part of an excluded group. Participants may contribute up to 60% of pre-tax
compensation, subject to certain limitations. The plan includes an employer matching contribution
equal to 50% of the first 3% an employee contributes each pay period. Ciena may also make
discretionary annual profit sharing contributions up to the IRS regulated limit. Ciena has made no
profit sharing contributions to date. During fiscal 2006, fiscal 2005 and fiscal 2004, Ciena made
matching contributions of approximately $12million, $13million and $16million, respectively. 18COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES Operating Lease Commitments Ciena has certain minimum obligations under non-cancelable operating leases expiring on
various dates through 2019 for equipment and facilities. Included in Cienas minimum obligations
under non-cancelable operating leases is $412million of unfavorable lease commitments. These
unfavorable lease commitments were based on the present value of the lease obligations assumed by
Ciena through acquisition, compared to market rates at the time of acquisition. The unfavorable
lease commitments will be paid over the applicable remaining lease term. Also included in Cienas
minimum obligations under non-cancelable operating leases is $445million related to restructured
facilities. For additional information see Note 3. Both the unfavorable lease commitments and
restructured facilities are recorded as liabilities on Cienas balance sheet. Future annual minimum
rental commitments under non-cancelable operating leases at October31, 2006 are as follows in

Rental expense for fiscal 2006, fiscal 2005, and fiscal 2004 was approximately $92million 116million and $163million, respectively. In addition, Ciena paid approximately $453million 330million, and $193million during fiscal 2006, fiscal 2005, and fiscal 2004, respectively,
related to rent costs for restructured facilities and unfavorable lease commitments, which were
offset against Cienas restructuring liabilities and unfavorable lease obligations. Purchase Commitments with Contract Manufacturers and Suppliers Ciena relies on a small number of contract manufacturers to perform the majority of the
manufacturing operations for its products. In order to reduce lead times and ensure adequate
component supply, Ciena enters into agreements with these suppliers that allow them to procure
inventory for Cienas forecasted future demands. As of October31, 2006, Ciena has purchase
commitments of $973million. Litigation On October3, 2000, Stanford University and Litton Systems filed a complaint in the United
States District Court for the Central District of California against Ciena and several other
defendants, alleging that optical fiber amplifiers incorporated into certain of those parties
products infringe U.S. Patent No4,859,016 the 016 Patent. The complaint seeks injunctive
relief, royalties and damages. On October10, 2003, the court stayed the case pending final
resolution of matters before the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office the PTO, including a request
for and disposition of a reexamination of the 016 Patent. On October16, 2003 and November2,
2004, the PTO granted reexaminations of the 016 Patent, resulting in a continuation of the stay of
the case. On September11, 2006, the PTO issued a Notice of Intent to Issue a Reexamination
Certificate and Statement of Reasons for Patentability/Confirmation, stating its intent to confirm
certain claims of the 016 Patent. Thereafter, on September19, 2006, Litton Systems filed a status
report in which it requested that the district court lift the stay of the case, which request was
denied by the district court on October13, 2006. Ciena believes that it has valid defenses to the
lawsuit and intends to defend it vigorously in the event the stay of the case is lifted. As a result of Cienas merger with ONI Systems Corp. in June2002, Ciena became a defendant in a securities class action lawsuit.
Beginning in August2001, a number of substantially identical class action complaints alleging violations of the federal securities
laws were filed in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York. These complaints name ONI,
Hugh C. Martin, ONIs former chairman, president and chief executive officer; Chris A. Davis, ONIs former executive
vice president, chief financial officer and administrative officer; and certain underwriters of ONIs initial public
offering as defendants. The complaints were consolidated into a single action, and a consolidated amended complaint was
filed on April24, 2002. The amended complaint alleges, among other things, that the underwriter defendants violated the securities
laws by failing to disclose alleged compensation arrangements such as undisclosed commissions or stock stabilization practices
in the initial public offerings registration statement and by engaging in manipulative practices to artificially inflate the
price of ONIs common stock after the initial public offering. The amended complaint also alleges that ONI and the named former
officers violated the securities laws on the basis of an alleged failure to disclose the underwriters alleged compensation arrangements
and manipulative practices. No specific amount of damages has been claimed. Similar complaints have been filed against more
than 300 other issuers that have had initial public offerings since 1998, and all of these actions have been included
in a single coordinated proceeding. Mr.Martin and Ms.Davis have been dismissed from the action without prejudice pursuant
to a tolling agreement. In July2004, following mediated settlement negotiations, the plaintiffs, the issuer defendants
including Ciena, and their insurers entered into a settlement agreement, whereby, if approved, the plaintiffs cases against the
issuers would be dismissed, the insurers would agree to guarantee a recovery by the plaintiffs from the underwriter defendants
of at least $1billion, and the issuer defendants would agree to assign or surrender to the plaintiffs certain claims the
issuers may have against the underwriters. The settlement agreement does not require Ciena to pay any amount toward the settlement
or to make any other payments. In October 2004, the district court certified a class with respect to the Section 10b
claims in six focus cases selected out of all of the consolidated cases, which cases did not include Ciena,
and which decision was appealed by the underwriter defendants to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second
Circuit. On February15, 2005, the district court granted the motion filed by the plaintiffs and issuer defendants for
preliminary approval of the settlement agreement, subject to certain modifications to the proposed bar order, and directed
the parties to submit a revised settlement agreement reflecting its opinion. On August31, 2005,
the district court issued a preliminary order approving the revised stipulated settlement agreement, and approving and setting
dates for notice of the settlement to all class members. A fairness hearing was held on April24, 2006,
at which time the court took the matter under advisement. If the court determines that the settlement is fair
to the class members, the settlement will be approved. On December5, 2006, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second
Circuit vacated the district courts grant of class certification in the six focus cases. Because the settlement
agreement involves certification of a settlement class as part of the approval process, the impact of the
Second Circuits decision on the settlement remains unclear. 74 In addition to the matters described above, Ciena is subject to various legal proceedings,
claims and litigation arising in the ordinary course of its business. While the outcome of these
matters is currently not determinable, Ciena does not expect that the ultimate costs to resolve
these matters will have a material effect on its results of operations, financial position or cash
flows. 19ENTITY WIDE DISCLOSURES Revenue from sales to customers outside of the United States is reflected as International in

supervision and with the participation of Cienas management, including Cienas Chief Executive
Officer and Chief Financial Officer, of Cienas disclosure controls and procedures as defined in
Rules13a-15e and 15d-15e under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. Based upon
this evaluation, Cienas Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that Cienas
disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of the end of the period covered by this
report. Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting There was no change in Cienas internal control over financial reporting as defined in Rules
13a-15f and 15d-15f under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended during the most
recently completed fiscal quarter that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to
materially affect, Cienas internal control over financial reporting. Report of Management on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting The management of Ciena Corporation is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate
internal control over financial reporting as defined in Rules13a-15f and 15d-15f under the
Securities Exchange Act of 1934. The internal control over financial reporting at Ciena Corporation was designed to provide
reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of
financial statements for external purposes in accordance with accounting principles generally
accepted in the United States of America. Internal control over financial reporting includes those
policies and procedures that   
pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly
reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of Ciena Corporation   
provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit
preparation of financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally
accepted in the United States of America   
provide reasonable assurance that receipts and expenditures of Ciena Corporation are
being made only in accordance with authorization of management and directors of Ciena
Corporation; and   
provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized
acquisition, use or disposition of assets that could have a material effect on the
consolidated financial statements. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent
or detect misstatements. Management of Ciena Corporation assessed the effectiveness of the companys internal control
over financial reporting as of October31, 2006. Management based this assessment on criteria for
effective internal control over financial reporting described in Internal Control Integrated
Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Based on
this assessment, management determined that, as of October31, 2006, Ciena Corporation maintained
effective internal control over financial reporting. Management reviewed the results of its
assessment with the Audit Committee of our Board of Directors. PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, independent registered public accounting firm, who audited and
reported on the consolidated financial statements of Ciena Corporation included in this annual
report, has also audited managements assessment and the effectiveness of Ciena Corporations
internal control over financial reporting as of October31, 2006 as stated in its report appearing
under Item8.
