Financial Statements and Supplementary Data REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM To the Board of Directors and Shareholders of Renaissance Learning, Inc. and Subsidiaries We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of
Renaissance Learning, Inc. and subsidiaries the
Company as of December31, 2004 and 2003, and
the related consolidated statements of income,
stockholders equity, and cash flows for each of the three
years in the period ended December31, 2004. These
financial statements are the responsibility of the
Companys management. Our responsibility is to express an
opinion on these financial statements based on our audits. We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the
Public Company Accounting Oversight Board United States. Those
standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are
free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a
test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in
the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the
accounting principles used and significant estimates made by
management, as well as evaluating the overall financial
statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a
reasonable basis for our opinion. In our opinion, such consolidated financial statements present
fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of
Renaissance Learning, Inc. and subsidiaries as of
December31, 2004 and 2003, and the results of their
operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in
the period ended December31, 2004, in conformity with
accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of
America. We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the
Public Company Accounting Oversight Board United States, the
effectiveness of the Companys internal control over
financial reporting as of December31, 2004, based on the
criteria established in Internal Control Integrated
Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of
the Treadway Commission and our report dated February21,
2005 expressed an unqualified opinion on managements
assessment of the effectiveness of the Companys internal
control over financial reporting and an unqualified opinion on
the effectiveness of the Companys internal control over
financial reporting.

1
Consolidation Our consolidated financial statements include the financial
results of Renaissance Learning, Inc. Renaissance
Learning and our subsidiaries collectively, the
Company. Our significant operating subsidiaries

Learning Systems, LLC Generation21. All
significant intercompany transactions have been eliminated in

Nature of operations Renaissance Learning is a provider of learning information
systems software and school improvement programs to pre-K-12
schools in the United States and Canada. Our computer-based
learning information systems and related professional
development, school improvement programs, consulting and
technical services help educators motivate students, accelerate

student practice of essential skills and to support instruction.
We offer a full line of professional service and support
solutions that integrate with, complement, and enhance the
effectiveness of, our research-based learning information system

Acquisition On August19, 2003, we acquired a start-up enterprise in
order to obtain certain in-process research and development. The
transaction was accounted for using the purchase method of
accounting. The total purchase price of $521,000 was allocated
based on the fair values of the assets acquired and liabilities
assumed and included an allocation of $329,000 to goodwill see
Note5. The operating results of this company, which are
not material to our consolidated financial statements, are
included in our consolidated financial statements since the date
of acquisition. Pro forma data relating to the acquisition is
not provided because it would not differ significantly from
historical results. 32 Table of Contents RENAISSANCE LEARNING, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTSContinued

Significant accounting policies   
a
Use of estimates The preparation of financial statements in conformity with
accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of
America requires management to make estimates and assumptions
that affect the reported amount of assets and liabilities and
disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of
the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues
and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could
differ from those estimates.   
b
Revenue recognition We recognize revenue in accordance with Statement of Position
No97-2 Software Revenue Recognition issued by
the Accounting Standards Executive Committee of the American
Institute of Certified Public Accountants. Revenues are recorded
net of an allowance for estimated returns. Allowances for bad
debts are also recorded at the time of the sale. Product revenue is derived primarily from the sale of software
products. We recognize revenue from sales of perpetually
licensed off-the-shelf software products at the time of shipment
to customers. Revenue from subscription-based products is
recognized on a straight-line basis over the subscription
period. We recognize revenue from the sale of software products
which require significant modification or customization on the
percentage-of-completion method of accounting. Accordingly,
revenue is deferred for advance payments from customers that are
in excess of revenues recognized under the
percentage-of-completion method of accounting. Included in
accounts receivable at December31, 2004 and 2003 is
$181,000 and $96,000, respectively, of amounts recognized as
revenue under the percentage-of-completion method which are not
yet billed to the customers. Service revenue is derived from itraining seminars,
iisoftware telephone support agreements,
iiiconsulting services, and ivtechnical
services. Revenue from training seminars is recognized when the
seminar or workshop is performed. Revenue from consulting and
technical services is recognized as the service is performed or
on a straight-line basis over the contractual period. Telephone
support included with sales of perpetually licensed software has
a duration of twelve months or less and is recognized at the
time the software is shipped with the related costs of providing
the telephone support accrued for at the same time. Revenue from
other software support agreements is initially recorded as
deferred revenue and recognized as revenue on a straight-line
basis over 12 or 24months depending on the term of the
agreement. Deferred revenue includes iamounts invoiced for products
not yet delivered and services not yet performed,
iiadvance invoicing on contracts, and iiithat
portion of software support agreements and subscription-based
product sales that has not yet been recognized as revenue. 33 Table of Contents RENAISSANCE LEARNING, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL

Cash and cash equivalents Cash amounts on deposit at banks and highly liquid debt
instruments purchased with an original maturity date of three
months or less are included in cash and cash equivalents. Debt
instruments are carried at cost, which approximates market value

Investment securities We classify our investment securities as
held-to-maturity or trading in
accordance with the provisions of Statement of Financial
Accounting Standards No115, Accounting for Certain
Investments in Debt and Equity Securities SFAS115.
We do not have any investments classified as available for
sale. Debt securities have an original maturity of more than three
months and a remaining maturity of less than twenty-four months.
All of our debt securities are classified as held-to-maturity
and are carried at amortized cost. The fair value of our debt
securities listed below are based on quoted market prices. Our
investments in debt securities consist of commercial paper,
corporate bonds and municipal obligations. The equity securities we own are held for the purpose of funding
our Supplemental Executive Retirement Plan SERP,
as further described in Note10. These equity securities
are classified as trading and are therefore carried at their
current fair value based on quoted market prices. Our
investments in equity securities consist entirely of various
mutual fund shares in amounts that mirror the aggregate
investment selections of the participants in the SERP. Investment securities consisted of the following at

Inventories Inventories are carried at the lower of first-in, first-out
FIFOcost or market. Inventories primarily consist of
purchased materials which include optical-mark card scanners,
educational products, training materials, manuals, and
motivational items.

Advertising costs Advertising costs are expensed as the advertising takes place.
Advertising expenses for 2004, 2003 and 2002 were approximately
$78million, $72million and $85million,
respectively. gProperty, plant and equipment Property, plant and equipment are recorded at cost and are
depreciated over their estimated useful lives using principally
the straight-line method for financial reporting purposes.
Maintenance and repair costs are charged to expense as incurred,
and renewals and improvements that significantly extend the
useful life of an asset are added to the plant and equipment
accounts. Depreciation expense was $28million 30million and $35million for 2004, 2003 and 2002,
respectively. The estimated useful lives for property, plant and equipment are
as follows: buildings-25 to 40years; furniture, fixtures
and office equipment-5 to 8years; computer and production
equipment-3 to 5years; vehicles-5years; and
leasehold improvements-the lease term. Net property, plant and equipment consisted of the following at

Software development costs We capitalize certain software development costs incurred after
technological feasibility is achieved. Capitalized costs are
reported at the lower of amortized cost or net realizable value.
Capitalized software development costs are amortized on a
product-by-product basis using the straight-line method over the
estimated economic life of the products which is generally
estimated to be 24months. Amortization begins when the
products are available for general release to customers. All
other research and development expenditures are charged to
product development expense in the period incurred. When
capitalized software is fully amortized, the balance is removed
from the capitalized software and accumulated amortization
accounts. Amounts capitalized were approximately $563,000 448,000 and $729,000 in 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively.
Amortization expense of approximately $553,000, $481,000 and
$576,000 for 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively, is included in
cost of sales-products in the consolidated statements of income.
At December31, 2004 and 2003, accumulated amortization of
capitalized software development costs was $10million and
$10million, respectively. 35 Table of Contents RENAISSANCE LEARNING, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL

i
Sales and concentration of credit risks We grant credit to our customers in the ordinary course of
business. The majority of our customers are schools or school
districts, although we do sell some of our products through
resellers. Concentrations of credit risk with respect to trade
receivables are limited due to the significant number of
customers and their geographic dispersion. In 2004, 2003, and
2002, no customer represented more than 10% of net sales.   
j
Stock-based compensation We elected, as permitted by SFAS123 Accounting for
Stock Based Compensation, to follow the intrinsic value
based method of accounting for stock options consistent with
Accounting Principles Board Opinion No25
APB25 Accounting for Stock Issued to
Employees and to provide the pro forma disclosures of net
income and earnings per share as if the fair value based method
had been applied. Under the intrinsic value method, compensation
cost for stock options is measured by the excess, if any, of the
quoted price of our stock at the measurement date over the
exercise price. The Black-Scholes option-pricing model was used
to compute the fair value of each option granted for purposes of
the pro forma disclosures required by SFAS123. Had compensation cost been determined for the stock option
grants based on the fair value method set forth under
SFAS123, net income and earnings per share would have been
adjusted to the pro forma amounts indicated below

Earnings per common share Earnings per share is computed in accordance with SFAS128
Earnings per Share. Basic earnings per common share
Basic EPS is computed by dividing income available
to common stockholders by the weighted average number of common
shares outstanding during the period. Shares issued and shares
reacquired during the period are weighted for the portion of the
period they were outstanding. Diluted earnings per common share Diluted EPS is
computed similarly to Basic EPS except that the weighted average
number of shares outstanding is increased to include the number
of additional common shares that would have been outstanding if
the potentially dilutive common shares had been issued. Our
potentially dilutive common shares consist of unexercised stock
options. The computation of Diluted EPS does not assume conversion,
exercise or contingent issuance of securities that may have an
antidilutive effect on earnings per share. Consequently, stock
options with an exercise price greater than the average market
price for the period are not included in the computation of
potentially dilutive common shares. For the years ended
December31, 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively, there were
768,116; 807,319; and 721,631 options excluded from the
computation of potentially dilutive weighted average common
shares. The weighted average shares outstanding are as follows

Income taxes We account for income taxes according to the provisions of
SFAS109, Accounting for Income Taxes.
SFAS109 requires an asset and liability based approach to
accounting for income taxes. Deferred income tax assets and
liabilities are recorded to reflect the tax consequences on
future years of temporary differences between financial and tax
accounting of revenue and expense items. Valuation allowances
are provided when it is anticipated that some or all of a
deferred tax asset is not likely to be realized.   
m
Comprehensive income loss Our comprehensive income loss includes foreign currency
translation adjustments, which are included in accumulated other
comprehensive income in the consolidated statements of
shareholders equity. On January1, 2002, we
reclassified our investment securities to held-to-maturity from
available-for-sale and have amortized the balance of unrealized
gains and losses as allowed by the SFAS115
Accounting for Certain Investments in Debt and Equity
Securities. This reclassification of our investments did
not have an impact on our reported net income for any of the
periods presented. At December31, 2004, 2003 and 2002,
accumulated other comprehensive income consisted entirely of
foreign currency translation adjustments.   
n
Shipping and handling revenues and costs We include shipping and handling fees billed to customers in net
sales. The related shipping and handling costs are included in
cost of sales. 37 Table of Contents RENAISSANCE LEARNING, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL

Reclassifications Certain previously reported amounts have been reclassified to
conform with the 2004 presentation.

Goodwill and other intangible assets Under SFAS142 Goodwill and Other Intangible
Assets, we are required to assess goodwill at least
annually for impairment by applying a fair-value-based test. We
completed this testing at December31, 2004 and 2003. We
found no instances of impairment of our recorded goodwill. Goodwill of $329,000 was acquired with the purchase of a
start-up enterprise in 2003 Note3. During 2004, the
reported goodwill amount on our balance sheet increased $115,000
solely as a result of the effect of foreign currency translation
when preparing our consolidated financial statements. For the years ended December31, 2004, 2003, and 2002, we
recognized amortization expense of $286,000, $396,000 and
$538,000, respectively on other intangibles with finite lives.
Other intangibles with finite lives are scheduled to be fully
amortized in 2005 with corresponding amortization estimated to
be $192,000 in 2005. The estimated useful lives are four years
for algorithms and software code and five years for a
non-compete agreement. Other intangibles consisted of the following

Lines of credit We have a $150million unsecured revolving line of credit
with a bank, which is available until May31, 2006. The
line of credit bears interest at either a floating rate based on
the prime rate less 10%, or a fixed rate for a period of up to
90days based on LIBOR plus 125%. The rate is at our
option and is determined at the time of borrowing. We also have
a $20million unsecured revolving line of credit with a
bank available until April30, 2006. The line of credit
bears interest based on the prime rate less 10%. As of
December31, 2004, the lines of credit had not been used.

facilities we occupy to carry out our business operations. Rent
expense for 2004, 2003 and 2002 was approximately

Litigation We are subject to various claims and proceedings covering a wide
range of matters that arise in the ordinary course of business
activities. We believe that any liability that may ultimately
arise from the resolution of these matters will not have a
material adverse effect on our financial position, results of
operations or shareholders equity.   
10
Retirement plans In order to provide retirement benefits for our employees, we
have established a defined contribution 401k Savings Plan
covering all employees in the United States who meet certain
service requirements and a Supplemental Executive Retirement
Plan SERP available to senior management. Employees participating in the 401k plan may elect to
contribute up to 50% of their annual pretax compensation subject
to certain IRS limitations. SERP participants may elect to defer
up to 20% of their annual pretax compensation to the SERP. Vesting and employer matching contributions are the same under
both plans. Beginning in 2003, vesting of employer contributions
takes place ratably over an employees first four years of
service with full vesting of past and future employer
contributions once four years of service is reached. Prior to
2003, employees were fully vested in employer contributions
immediately. Employer matching contributions are currently $075 for each
$100 contributed by a participant and are limited to a maximum
of 45% of a participants pretax compensation. Prior to
2003, employer matching contributions were $066 for each $100
contributed by a participant and were limited to 40% of a
participants pretax compensation. For those employees
participating in the SERP, the maximum employer contribution is
determined on a combined basis with the 401k plan.
Discretionary employer contributions may also be made to the
plans. There were no discretionary contributions made in 2004,
2003 or 2002 to the plans. All amounts credited to a SERP participants account are
hypothetically invested in certain publicly traded investment
funds, as directed by each participant. Prior to 2004, we had
not funded this liability. In late 2004, we funded our liability
for benefits payable to SERP participants with investments that
mirror their investment selections. Prior to the funding of the
liability, changes in the market value of the investment funds
chosen by SERP participants caused our liability for this
benefit to increase or decrease and a corresponding loss or gain
to be recognized in our statement of income and results of
operations. As the SERP is now fully funded, future changes in
the market value of the participants investment selections
will no longer affect our statement of income and results of
operations. The liability for the SERP is classified as deferred
compensation and the related investments are classified under
investment securities on our consolidated balance sheets. Our
liability for the SERP was $1,354,000 at December31, 2004
and $958,000 at December31, 2003. 40 Table of Contents RENAISSANCE LEARNING, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL

Stock option plan We have established the 1997 Stock Incentive Plan the
Plan for our officers, key employees, non-employee
directors and consultants. Options granted under the plan may be
in the form of nonqualified stock options NSO or
incentive stock options which comply with Section422 of
the Internal Revenue Code ISO. A combined maximum
of 6,000,000 options, stock appreciation rights
SAR and share awards may be granted under the
plan. The exercise price of the options is the market value of
our common stock at the date of grant. Generally, options vest
and become exercisable ratably over a four-year period,
commencing one year after the grant date. The options expire
10years from the grant date. As of December31, 2004,
only NSOs have been granted; no ISOs, SARs or share awards have
been granted under the plan. At December31, 2004, there
were approximately 27million shares available for
issuance under our 1997 Stock Incentive Plan. A summary of stock option activity under the plan is as follows

Employee stock purchase plan Effective July1, 1998, we adopted an Employee Stock
Purchase Plan ESPP which allows employees to
purchase shares of common stock through payroll deductions, up
to 10% of eligible compensation. The purchase price is equal to
85% of the fair market value of the common stock on either the
first or last day of the subscription period, whichever is
lower. A total of 500,000shares are available for purchase
under the plan. We have elected to apply APB25
Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees, as amended
by FASB Interpretation No44 FIN44, in
accounting for its stock-based plans. Accordingly, no expense is
recognized for employee stock purchases through the plan. Shares
of common stock issued with respect to the plan were
approximately 65,000shares in January 2003 for fiscal 2002
and 43,000shares in January 2002 for fiscal 2001, at a per
share price, representing 85% of the fair market value as
described above, of $1607 and $2465, respectively. We did not
offer the ESPP to our employees in 2003 or 2004 and do not
intend to offer the ESPP in 2005.   
13
Shareholders equity On April17, 2002, our Board of Directors authorized the
repurchase of up to 5,000,000shares of our common stock.
On February9, 2005, our Board of Directors authorized the
repurchase of an additional 3,000,000shares of common
stock. No time limit was placed on the duration of the
repurchase program. Repurchased shares will become treasury
shares and will be used for stock-based employee benefit plans
and for other general corporate purposes. During the period of
January1, 2004 through December31, 2004, we
repurchased 290,000shares at a cost of $55million.
Since authorization, we have repurchased 43million common
shares at a cost of $784million under this repurchase
program. On April14, 1999, our shareholders approved an amendment
to the Companys Amended and Restated Articles of
Incorporation to increase the authorized common stock of the
Company from 50,000,000shares to 150,000,000shares
with a $01par value per share. The Companys Amended
and Restated Articles of Incorporation also includes
authorization to issue up to 5,000,000shares of preferred
stock with a $01par value per share. No preferred stock
has been issued.   
14
Segment reporting Beginning in 2004, our results are presented as one operating
segment. We had previously reported two operating segments:
isoftware and iitraining. We are no longer
organized by these segments and we now manage our operations as
one business. These changes were made to better support our
customers needs through offerings of bundled solutions
which consist of software, professional development,
implementation assistance, technical consulting, and ongoing
maintenance and support plans. Accordingly, we do not produce
discrete financial information or make resource allocation
decisions for separately reportable segments as defined by
SFASNo131, Disclosures about Segments of an
Enterprise and Related Information. Foreign market
operations are not significant at this time. 42 Table of Contents RENAISSANCE LEARNING, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL

Recent accounting pronouncements In December 2004, the FASB issued SFAS123R revised 2004,
Share-Based Payment. This statement revises
SFAS123, Accounting for Stock-Based
Compensation, and requires companies to expense the value
of employee stock option grants and similar awards. The
effective date of this standard is interim and annual periods
beginning after June15, 2005. Historically, we have elected to follow the intrinsic value
method of accounting for our employee stock options.
Accordingly, because the exercise price of our employee stock
options equals the market price of the underlying stock on the
date of grant, we have not recognized any compensation expense
related to grants of stock options to our employees. Upon the adoption of SFASNo123R, we will expense
stock option grants in our Consolidated Statement of Income over
the vesting period of the grants following the modified version
of prospective 43 Table of Contents RENAISSANCE LEARNING, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTSContinued application. For the years ended December31, 2004, 2003
and 2002, total stock-based employee compensation expense, net
of related tax effects determined under this new standard would
have been $17, $38 and $44million, respectively. Stock
option expense in 2005 will be dependent on future awards, in
addition to unvested awards at the date of adoption.   
17
Subsequent Events On January24, 2005, we entered into a definitive agreement
to acquire AlphaSmart, Inc., a publicly traded company listed on
the Nasdaq National Market under the symbol ALSM. We expect to
close the transaction during the second quarter of 2005. The
transaction is valued at approximately $57million.
AlphaSmart stockholders will have the option to be paid in cash,
Renaissance Learning, Inc. common stock or some combination of
the two, subject to pro-ration so that the total consideration
paid will aggregate no more than 45% Renaissance Learning, Inc.
common stock and no less than 55% cash. Given the complementary
nature of AlphaSmarts portable computing devices and our
writing suite of products, we believe the merger enhances the
opportunity to realize our strategic objective of achieving
greater scale and presence in the writing segment of the K-12
market. On February9, 2005, our Board of Directors increased our
quarterly cash dividend from $04per share to
$05per share. The board also authorized an additional
three million shares under the stock re-purchase program. With
this authorization, we may repurchase an additional
37million shares. 44 Table of Contents

Controls and Procedures Conclusion Regarding the Effectiveness of Disclosure Controls
and Procedures Under the supervision and with the participation of our
management, including our chief executive officer and chief
financial officer, we conducted an evaluation of our disclosure
controls and procedures, as such term is defined under
Rule13a-15e promulgated under the Securities Exchange
Act of 1934, as amended the Exchange Act. Based on this
evaluation, management, including our chief executive officer
and chief financial officer, concluded that our disclosure
controls and procedures were effective as of December31,
2004. There has been no change in our internal control over financial
reporting that has occurred during the quarter ended
December31, 2004 that has materially affected, or is
reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control
over financial reporting. Managements Report on Internal Control Over Financial
Reporting Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining
adequate internal control over financial reporting, as such term
is defined under Rule13a-15f promulgated under the
Exchange Act. Under the supervision and with the participation
of our management, including our chief executive officer and
chief financial officer, we conducted an evaluation of the
effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting
based on the framework in Internal Control
Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring
Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Based on our
evaluation using the framework in Internal
Control Integrated Framework, our management
concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was
effective as of December31, 2004. Our managements assessment of the effectiveness of our
internal control over financial reporting as of
December31, 2004 has been audited by Deloitte
Touche LLP, our independent registered public accounting firm,
as stated in their report which is included herein. 45 Table of Contents REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM To the Board of Directors and Shareholders of Renaissance Learning, Inc. and Subsidiaries We have audited managements assessment, included in the
accompanying Managements Report on Internal Control
Over Financial Reporting, that Renaissance Learning, Inc.
and subsidiaries maintained effective internal control over
financial reporting as of December31, 2004, based on
criteria established in Internal Control Integrated
Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of
the Treadway Commission. The Companys management is
responsible for maintaining effective internal control over
financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness
of internal control over financial reporting. Our responsibility
is to express an opinion on managements assessment and an
opinion on the effectiveness of the Companys internal
control over financial reporting based on our audit. We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the
Public Company Accounting Oversight Board United States. Those
standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control
over financial reporting was maintained in all material
respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of
internal control over financial reporting, evaluating
managements assessment, testing and evaluating the design
and operating effectiveness of internal control, and performing
such other procedures as we considered necessary in the
circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable
basis for our opinions. A companys internal control over financial reporting is a
process designed by, or under the supervision of, the
companys principal executive and principal financial
officers, or persons performing similar functions, and effected
by the companys board of directors, management, and other
personnel to provide reasonable assurance regarding the
reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of
financial statements for external purposes in accordance with
generally accepted accounting principles. A companys
internal control over financial reporting includes those
policies and procedures that 1pertain to the maintenance
of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly
reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the
company; 2provide reasonable assurance that transactions
are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial
statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting
principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company
are being made only in accordance with authorizations of
management and directors of the company; and 3provide
reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of
unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the
companys assets that could have a material effect on the
financial statements. Because of the inherent limitations of internal control over
financial reporting, including the possibility of collusion or
improper management override of controls, material misstatements
due to error or fraud may not be prevented or detected on a
timely basis. Also, projections of any evaluation of the
effectiveness of the internal control over financial reporting
to future periods are subject to the risk that the controls may
become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the
degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may
deteriorate. In our opinion, managements assessment that the Company
maintained effective internal control over financial reporting
as of December31, 2004, is fairly stated, in all material
respects, based on the criteria established in Internal
Control Integrated Framework issued by the Committee
of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Also in
our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects,
effective internal control over financial reporting as of
December31, 2004, based on the criteria established in
Internal Control Integrated Framework issued by the
Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. 46 Table of Contents We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the
