Item 7 Management Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results
of Operations
The following discussion should be read in conjunction with, and is
qualified in its entirety by, the Financial Statements and the Notes thereto and
Selected Financial Data included elsewhere in this Form 10-K. Historical
operating results and percentage relationships among any amounts included in the
Financial Statements are not necessarily indicative of trends in operating
results for any future period.
Overview
The Company core business is the manufacture and sale of high quality,
precision steel balls and rollers. In 1999, balls accounted for approximately
91% of the Company ball and roller net sales, while rollers accounted for the
remaining 9%. Although all of the Company net sales from 1980 through 1986
were exclusively to domestic customers, the Company international sales have
increased significantly since then and represented approximately 47% of net ball
and roller sales in 1999. See Note 9 of the Notes to Financial Statements.
Since the Company was formed, growth factors include its displacement of
captive ball manufacturing divisions of domestic and international bearing
manufacturers as a source of precision balls and increased sales of high
precision balls for quiet bearing applications. Sales of high precision balls
produced by the Company for use in quiet bearing applications has grown to
approximately 85% of total net ball sales. Management believes that the
Company sales growth since its formation has been due to its ability to
capitalize on opportunities in overseas markets and provide precision balls at
competitive prices, as well as its emphasis on product quality and customer
service. The sales decline in the last couple of years has been due in large
part to economic conditions in Asia and South America and a decline in
outsourcing by certain captive producers. Further, the Company was adversely
affected by increased competition from Asian-based competitors who sought to
reduce over capacity.
As a result of changing dynamics in the marketplace, the Company has
developed an extensive new long-term growth strategy. The development of this
strategy entailed the review of the Company core business and strategies for
growth as well as an extensive identification of additional growth opportunities
beyond the core markets that were consistent with the Company strengths and
culture. One industry that was identified through this process was the plastic
injection molding industry.                    -12    On July 4, 1999, the Company acquired substantially all of the assets of
Earsley Capital Corporation, a successor to and formerly known as Industrial
Molding Corporation, a Texas corporation. IMC provides premier full-service
design and manufacture of plastic injection molded components to the bearing,
automotive, electronic, leisure and consumer markets with an emphasis on
value-added products that take advantage of its unique capabilities in product
development, tool design and tight tolerance molding processes.

Year Ended December 31, 1999 Compared to the Year Ended December 31, 1998
Net Sales. The Company net sales increased $123 million, or 168%, from
$730 million in 1998 to $853 million in 1999. The IMC acquisition accounted
for $176 million in additional sales for the twelve-month period in 1999.
Foreign net sales decreased $13 million or 39%, from $337 million in 1998 to
$324 million in 1999. The decrease in foreign net sales was due primarily to
decreased sales volumes with existing customers, largely due to general economic
conditions in Asia and the impact of the relative strength of the U.S. dollar
against world currencies in the first two quarters of the year. This was
partially offset by the addition of $880,000 in foreign sales contributed by the
IMC acquisition. Domestic net sales increased $136 million, or 346%, from
$393 million in 1998 to $529 million in 1999. This increase was primarily due
to the IMC acquisition which contributed $167 million in domestic sales for
1999. This was partially offset by decreased domestic sales primarily to one
customer.
Gross Profit. Gross profit increased by $26 million, or 115% from $227
million in 1998 to $253 million in 1999. The IMC acquisition accounted for $43
million in increased gross profit but was mostly offset by increased costs
associated with capacity under-utilization in the Ball & Roller division due                    -13 to decreased levels of volume during 1999 as well as the short-term impact of
the inventory reduction efforts. As a percentage of net sales, gross profit
decreased from 310% in 1998 to 297% in 1999.
Selling, General and Administrative Expenses. Selling, general and
administrative expenses increased by $958,000, or 162% in 1999 to $69 million
from $59 million in 1998. The acquisition of IMC accounted for $18 million of
the increase offset by decreased spending in the Ball & Roller division. As a
percentage of net sales, selling, general and administrative expenses decreased
slightly to 80% in 1999 from 81% in 1998.
Depreciation and Amortization Expense. Depreciation expense increased $15
million, or 345%, to $61 million in 1999 from $46 million in 1998. The
acquisition of IMC accounted for $12 million of increased depreciation and
amortization expense. The remainder of the increase was due to purchases of
capital equipment at the Company ball and roller facilities. As a percentage
of net sales, depreciation increased to 72% in 1999 from 62% in 1998.
Interest Expense. Interest expense increased $459,000 from $64,000 in 1998
to $523,000 in 1999. The increase was due to increased levels outstanding under
the Company line of credit in 1999. In July of 1999, the Company borrowed
$185 million under the line of credit for the purchase of selected assets of
the Earsley Capital Corporation. See Management Discussion and Analysis of
Financial Condition --Liquidity and Capital Resources.
Net Income. Net income increased $103,000, or 13% from $77 million in
1998 to $78 million in 1999. As a percentage of net sales, net income decreased
to 91% in 1999 from 105% in 1998. The decrease in net income as a percentage
of net sales was due primarily to excess capacity at the Company Ball & Roller
division and a related gross profit margin decrease, increased depreciation
expense and interest expense related to the IMC acquisition. Offsetting these
factors was a slightly lower federal tax rate.
Year Ended December 31, 1998 Compared to the Year Ended December 31, 1997
Net Sales. The Company net sales decreased $22 million, or 30%, from
$752 million in 1997 to $730 million in 1998. Foreign net sales decreased $17
million, or 48%, from $354 million in 1997 to $337 million in 1998. The
decrease in foreign net sales was due primarily to decreased sales volumes to
existing customers, largely due to general economic conditions in Asia and South
America. Domestic net sales decreased $600,000, or 15%, from $399 million in
1997 to $393 million in 1998. This decrease was due primarily to decreased
sales volumes to domestically-based Asian companies.
Gross Profit. Gross profit decreased by $892,000, or 38% from $235
million in 1997 to $227 million in 1998. As a percentage of net sales, gross
profit decreased slightly from 313% in 1997 to 310% in 1998. The decrease in
gross profit is largely due to decreased levels of volume during 1998 as
compared to 1997 and related capacity under-utilization issues at the Company
manufacturing facilities.
Selling, General and Administrative Expenses. Selling, general and
administrative expenses increased by $378,000, or 68% in 1998 to $59 million
from $55 million in 1997. This increase was due primarily to increased expenses
related to the Ireland facility, which began production in the fourth quarter of
1997, as well as increases in 1998 to implement the Company strategic plan. As
a percentage of net sales, selling, general and administrative expenses
increased to 81% in 1998 from 73% in 1997.
Depreciation Expense. Depreciation expense increased $451,000, or 110 to $46 million in 1998 from $41 million in 1997. This increase was due
primarily to purchases of capital equipment related to the new Ireland facility
which began production in the fourth quarter of 1997. As a percentage of sales,
depreciation expense increased to 62% in 1998 from 55% in 1997.                    -14    Net Income. Net income decreased $854,000, or 10% from $85 million in
1997 to $77 million in 1998. As a percentage of net sales, net income decreased
from 113% in 1997 to 105% in 1998. The decrease in net income as a percentage
of net sales was due primarily to excess capacity at the Company manufacturing
facilities, increased selling, general and administrative expenses and the
increase in depreciation expense discussed above. Slightly offsetting these
factors was a lower federal tax rate due to the shifting of sales to the Irish
facility which benefits from a 10% corporate tax rate. The lower federal tax
rate was in turn offset slightly by a decrease in the level of tax benefit from
the Company participation in a shared foreign sales corporation.
Liquidity and Capital Resources
In July 1997, the Company entered into a loan agreement with First
American National Bank First American which provides for a revolving credit
facility of up to $25 million, expiring on June 30, 2000. In December 1999, the
Company extended the terms of the loan agreement with First American to expire
on July 25, 2001. Amounts outstanding under the revolving facility are unsecured
and bear interest at a floating rate equal to, at the Company option, either
LIBOR plus 065% or the Fed Funds effective rate plus 15%. The loan agreement
contains customary financial and operating restrictions on the Company,
including covenants, restricting the Company, without First American consent,
from incurring additional indebtedness from, or pledging any of its assets to,
other lenders and from disposing of a substantial portion of its assets. In
addition, the Company is prohibited from declaring any dividend if a default
exists under the revolving credit facility at the time of, or would occur as a
result of, such declaration. The loan agreement also prohibits sales of property
outside of the ordinary course of business. The loan agreement also contains
customary financial covenants with respect to the Company, including a covenant
that the Company earnings will not decrease in any year by more than fifty
percent of earnings in the Company immediately preceding fiscal year. The
Company, as of March 20, 2000 was in compliance with all such covenants.
The Company arrangements with its domestic customers typically provide
that payments are due within 30 days following the date of the Company
shipment of goods, while arrangements with foreign customers other than foreign
customers that have entered into an inventory management program with the
Company generally provide that payments are due within either 90 or 120 days
following the date of shipment. Under the Company inventory management
program, payments typically are due within 30 days after the product is used by
the customer. The Company net sales historically have not been of a seasonal
nature. However, seasonality has become a factor for the foreign ball and roller
sales in that many foreign customers cease production during the month of
August. The Company also experiences seasonal fluctuation through its IMC
Plastics division which provides several lines of seasonal hardware.
The Company bills and receives payment from some of its foreign customers
in their local currency. To date, the Company has not been materially adversely
affected by currency fluctuations or foreign exchange restrictions. Nonetheless,
as a result of these sales, the Company foreign exchange risk has increased.
Various strategies to manage this risk are under development and implementation,
including a hedging program. In addition, a strengthening of the U.S. dollar
against foreign currencies could impair the ability of the Company to compete
with international competitors for foreign as well as domestic sales.
Working capital, which consists principally of accounts receivable and
inventories, was $229 million at December 31, 1999 as compared to $209 million
at December 31, 1998. The ratio of current assets to current liabilities
decreased from 37:1 at December 31, 1998 to 32:1 at December 31, 1999. Cash
flow from operations increased to $178 million during 1999 from $127 million
during 1998. This increase was primarily attributed to a decrease of $51
million of inventories during 1999 as compared to an increase of $26 million
during 1998.
During 2000, the Company plans to spend approximately $53 million on
capital expenditures. The Company intends to finance these activities with cash
generated from operations and funds available under the credit facility
described above. The Company believes that funds generated from operations and
borrowings from the credit facility will be sufficient to finance the Company
working capital needs and projected capital expenditure requirements through
December 2000.                    -15 Subsequent Events
On January 14, 2000, the Company entered into a principle agreement to
establish a joint venture with General Bearing Corporation. This venture
subsequently closed on March 16, 2000. The new venture, NN General, LLC, will
own a majority position in Jiangsu General Ball & Roller Company, Ltd., a
Chinese precision ball and roller manufacturer located in Rugao City, Jiangsu
Providence China. Through NN General, LLC, the Company will equally share a 60%
interest with General Bearing Company in the Chinese company. The Company
investment includes a cash contribution of $25 million and a loan commitment
for an additional $1 million. The remaining 40% of the Chinese company is owned
by Jiangsu Steel Ball Factory.
On March 12, 2000, the Company experienced a fire at its Erwin, Tennessee
facility. The fire, which was contained to approximately 30% of the production
area, occurred in the early morning hours when only three employees were in the
facility. These employees were immediately evacuated and no one was injured.
Effected production is being shifted to the Company other facilities as
possible as well as the use of other suppliers to protect product supply to
customers. The cause of the fire remains under investigation and management is
continuing to assess damage to the facility. Insurance coverage is available for
the loss.
The Euro
The treaty on European Union provided that an economic and monetary union
be established in Europe whereby a single European currency, the Euro, was
introduced to replace the currencies of participating member states. The Euro
was introduced on January 1, 1999, at which time the value of participating
member state currencies were irrevocably fixed against the Euro and the European
Currency Unit. For the three year transitional period ending December 31, 2001,
the national currencies of member states will continue to circulate but be in
sub-units of the Euro. At the end of the transitional period, Euro bank notes
and coins will be issued, and the national currencies of the member states will
be legal tender no later than June 30, 2002.
The Company currently has operations in Ireland, which is one of the Euro
participating countries, and sells product to customers in many of the
participating countries. The functional currency of the Company Ireland
operations was changed effective September, 1999.
Seasonality and Fluctuation in Quarterly Results
The Company net sales historically have not been of a seasonal nature.
However, as foreign sales have increased as a percentage of total sales,
seasonality has become a factor for the Company in that many foreign customers
cease production during the month of August. For information concerning the
Company quarterly results of operations for the years ended December 31, 1999
and 1998, see Note 13 of the Notes to Financial Statements.
Inflation and Changes in Prices
While the Company operations have not been affected by inflation during
recent years, prices for 52100 Steel and other raw materials purchased by the
Company are subject to change. For example, during 1995, due to an increase in
worldwide demand for 52100 Steel and the decrease in the value of the United
States dollar relative to foreign currencies, the Company experienced an
increase in the price of 52100 Steel and some difficulty in obtaining an
adequate supply of 52100 Steel from its existing suppliers. Typically, the
Company pricing arrangements with its steel suppliers are subject to
adjustment once every six months. In an effort to limit its exposure to
fluctuations in steel prices, the Company has generally avoided the use of
long-term, fixed price contracts with its customers. Instead, the Company
typically reserves the right to increase product prices periodically in the
event of increases in its raw material costs. The Company was able to minimize
the impact on its operations resulting from the 52100 Steel price increases by
taking such measures.                    -16 Cautionary Statements for Purposes of the Safe Harbor Provisions of the
Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995
The Company wishes to caution readers that this report contains, and future
filings by the Company, press releases and oral statements made by the Company
authorized representatives may contain, forward looking statements that involve
certain risks and uncertainties. The Company actual results could differ
materially from those expressed in such forward looking statements due to
important factors bearing on the Company business, many of which already have
been discussed in this filing and in the Company prior filings.
The following paragraphs discuss the risk factors the Company regards as the
most significant, although the Company wishes to caution that other factors that
are currently not considered as significant or that currently cannot be foreseen
may in the future prove to be important in affecting the Company results of
operations. The Company undertakes no obligation to publicly update or revise
any forward looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future
events or otherwise.
Industry Risks. Both the precision ball & roller and precision plastics
industries are cyclical and tend to decline in response to overall declines in
industrial production. The Company sales in the past have been negatively
affected, and in the future very likely would be negatively affected, by adverse
conditions in the industrial production sector of the economy or by adverse
global or national economic conditions generally.
Competition. The precision ball & roller market and the precision plastics
markets are highly competitive, and many of manufacturers in each of the markets
are larger and have substantially greater resources than the Company. The
Company competitors are continuously exploring and implementing improvements
in technology and manufacturing processes in order to improve product quality,
and the Company ability to remain competitive will depend, among other things,
on whether it is able, in a cost effective manner, to keep pace with such
quality improvements. In addition, the Company competes with many of its ball
and roller customers that, in addition to producing bearings, also internally
produce balls and rollers for sale to third parties. The Company faces a risk
that its customers will decide to produce balls and rollers internally rather
than outsourcing their needs to the Company.
Rapid Growth. The Company has significantly expanded its ball and roller
production facilities and capacity over the last several years, and during the
third quarter of 1997 purchased an additional manufacturing plant in Kilkenny,
Ireland. The Company Ball & Roller division currently is not operating at full
capacity and faces risks of further under-utilization or inefficient utilization
of its production facilities in future years. The Company also faces risks
associated with start-up expenses, inefficiencies, delays and increased
depreciation costs associated with its plant expansions.
Raw Material Shortages. Because the balls and rollers manufactured by the
Company have highly-specialized applications, their production requires the use
of very particular types of steel. Due to quality constraints, the Company
obtains the majority of its steel from overseas suppliers. Steel shortages or
transportation problems, particularly with respect to 52100 Steel, could have a
detrimental effect on the Company business.
Risks Associated with International Trade. Because the Company obtains a
majority of its raw materials for the manufacture of balls and rollers from
overseas suppliers and sells to a large number of international customers, the
Company faces risks associated with i adverse foreign currency fluctuations,
ii changes in trade, monetary and fiscal policies, laws and regulations, and
other activities of governments, agencies and similar organizations, iii the
imposition of trade restrictions or prohibitions, iv the imposition of import
or other duties or taxes, and v unstable governments or legal systems in
countries in which the Company suppliers and customers are located. An
increase in the value of the United States dollar relative to foreign currencies
adversely affects the ability of the Company to compete with its foreign-based
competitors for international as well as domestic sales.
Dependence on Major Customers. During 1999, the Company ten largest customers
accounted for approximately 69% of its net sales. Sales to various US and
foreign divisions of SKF, which is one of the largest bearing manufacturers in
the world, accounted for approximately 27% of net sales in 1999, and sales to
FAG accounted for approximately 11% of net sales. None of the Company other
customers accounted for                    -17 more than 10% of its net sales in 1999, but sales to three of its customers each
represented more than 5% of the Company 1999 net sales. The loss of all or a
substantial portion of sales to these customers would have a material adverse
effect on the Company business.
Acquisitions. The Company growth strategy includes growth through
acquisitions. In July 1999, the Company acquired IMC as part of that strategy.
Although the Company believes that it will be able to integrate the operations
of IMC and other companies acquired in the future into its operations without
substantial cost, delays or other problems, its ability to do so will depend on,
among other things, the adequacy of its implementation plans, the ability of its
management to effectively oversee and operate the combined operations of the
Company and the acquired businesses and its ability to achieve desired operating
efficiencies and sales goals. If the Company is not able to successfully
integrate the operations of acquired companies into its business, its future
earnings and profitability could be materially and adversely affected.
Recently Issued Accounting Standards
In June 1998, the FASB issued SFAS No. 133 Accounting for Derivative
Instruments and Hedging Activities which establishes accounting and reporting
standards for derivative instruments and hedging activities and is effective for
the Company 2000 reporting cycle. The adoption of this standard by the Company
is not expected to result in significant adjustments to existing accounting
practices as the Company does not currently hold any derivative financial
instruments or participate in hedging activities.
Item 7A Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk
The Company is exposed to changes in financial market conditions in the
normal course of its business due to its use of certain financial instruments as
well as transacting in various foreign currencies. To mitigate its exposure to
these market risks, the Company has established policies, procedures and
internal processes governing its management of financial market risks.
The Company is exposed to changes in interest rates primarily as a result
of its borrowing activities, which include a $25 million floating rate revolving
credit facility which is used to maintain liquidity and fund its business
operations. At December 31, 1999, the Company had $172 million outstanding
under the revolving credit facility. A one-percent increase in the interest rate
charged on the Company outstanding borrowings under the revolving credit
facility would result in interest expense increasing by approximately $172,000.
The nature and amount of the Company borrowings may vary as a result of future
business requirements, market conditions and other factors.
The Company operating cash flows denominated in foreign currencies are
exposed to changes in foreign exchange rates. Beginning in the 1997 fourth
quarter, upon the commencement of production in its Kilkenny, Ireland facility,
the Company began to bill and receive payment from some of its foreign customers
in their own currency. To date, the Company has not been materially adversely
affected by currency fluctuations of foreign exchange restrictions. However, as
foreign sales approximate 38% of total revenues, management is currently
evaluating various strategies to manage this financial market risk, including
the implementation of a foreign currency hedging program. The Company did not
hold a position in any foreign currency instruments of December 31, 1999.                    -18 Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data

To the Board of Directors and Stockholders
of NN Ball & Roller, Inc.
In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements listed in the accompanying
index present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of NN
Ball & Roller, Inc. and its subsidiaries at December 31, 1999 and 1998, and the
results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in
the period ended December 31, 1999, in conformity with accounting principles
generally accepted in the United States. These financial statements are the
responsibility of the Company management; our responsibility is to express an
opinion on these financial statements based on our audits. We conducted our
audits of these statements in accordance with auditing standards generally
accepted in the United States, which require that we plan and perform the audit
to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free
of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence
supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing
the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, and
evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our
audits provide a reasonable basis for the opinion expressed above. Greensboro, North Carolina

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements
- 
NOTE 1 - THE COMPANY AND IT'S SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
NN Ball & Roller, Inc. the Company is a manufacturer of balls, rollers, and
precision injected molded products. The Company balls and rollers are used
primarily in the domestic and international anti-friction bearing industry. The
ball and roller segment has manufacturing facilities in the United States and
Ireland. The Company precision injection molding segment, which was acquired
during 1999 see Note 2, manufactures components used in the bearing,
automotive, instrumentation, fiber optic, and consumer hardware industries. The
precision injection molding segments manufacturing facility is located in
Texas. Both of the Company segments sell to foreign and domestic customers.
Cash and cash equivalents
The Company considers all highly liquid investments with an original maturity of
three months or less as cash equivalents.
Inventories
Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market. Cost is determined using
the first-in, first-out method.
Property, plant and equipment
Property, plant and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated
depreciation. Expenditures for maintenance and repairs are charged to expense
as incurred. Major renewals and betterments are capitalized. When a major
property item is retired, its cost and related accumulated depreciation or
amortization are removed from the property accounts and any gain or loss is
recorded in income or expense, respectively. The Company reviews the carrying
values of long-lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in
circumstances indicate the carrying amount of an asset may not be
recoverable. In management opinion, no material impairment exists at
December 31, 1999 or 1998.
Depreciation is provided principally on the straight-line method over the
estimated useful lives of the depreciable assets for financial reporting
purposes. Accelerated depreciation methods are used for income tax purposes.
Revenue recognition
The Company generally recognizes a sale when goods are shipped and ownership is
assumed by the customer. The Company has an inventory management program for
certain major ball and roller customers whereby sales are recognized when
products are used by the customer from consigned stock, rather than at the time
of shipment. Inventory on consignment at December 31, 1999 and 1998 was
approximately $2,766,000 and $3,635,000, respectively.
Income taxes
Income taxes are provided based upon income reported for financial statement
purposes. Deferred income taxes reflect the tax effect of temporary differences
between the financial reporting and income tax bases of the Company assets and
liabilities See Note 10.                    25 NN Ball & Roller, Inc.
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements
- 
Net income per common share
Basic earnings per share reflect reported earnings divided by the weighted
average number of common shares outstanding. Diluted earnings per share include
the effect of dilutive stock options outstanding during the year.
Stock incentive plan
The Company uses the intrinsic value method to account for employee stock
options. Accordingly, under this method, the Company has not recorded
compensation expense related to the options. The exercise price of each
option equals the market price of the Company stock on the date of grant.
Principles of consolidation
The Company financial statements include the accounts of NN Ball & Roller,
Inc. and its subsidiaries Industrial Molding Corporation and NN Ball & Roller,
Ltd. All intercompany accounts and investments in subsidiaries are eliminated
upon consolidation.
Foreign currency translation
Assets and liabilities of the Company foreign subsidiary are translated at
current exchange rates, while revenue and expenses are translated at average
rates prevailing during the year. Translation adjustments are reported as a
component of other comprehensive income.
Goodwill
Goodwill, which represents the excess of acquisition costs over the net assets
acquired in a business combination, is amortized on a straight-line method over
a period of 20 years. Periodically, the Company reviews the recoverability of
goodwill and other intangibles. The measurement of possible impairment is based
primarily on the ability to recover the balance of the goodwill from expected
future operating cash flows on an undiscounted basis. In management opinion,
no material impairment exists at December 31, 1999.
Use of estimates in the preparation of financial statements
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted
accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that
affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of
contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and
the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period.
Actual results could differ from those estimates.
Recently issued accounting standards
In June 1998, the FASB issued SFAS No. 133 Accounting for Derivative
Instruments and Hedging Activities which established accounting and reporting
standards for derivative instruments and hedging activities and is effective for
the Company 2000 reporting cycle. The adoption of this standard by the Company
is not expected to result in significant adjustments to existing accounting
practices as the Company does not currently hold any derivative financial
instruments or participate in hedging activities.                    26 NN Ball & Roller, Inc.

NOTE 2 - ACQUISITION
Effective July 4, 1999, the Company acquired substantially all of the assets and
assumed certain liabilities of Earsley Capital Corporation, a Nevada corporation
and successor to and formerly known as Industrial Molding Corporation IMC.
IMC, located in Lubbock, Texas, operates as a premier full-service designer and
manufacturer of precision plastic injection molded components. The Company plans
to continue the operation of the IMC business as a subsidiary entity. The
Company paid consideration of approximately $30 million, consisting of $275
million in cash and 440,038 shares of its common stock, for the net assets
acquired from IMC. Cash used in the acquisition was obtained from the Company
line of credit with First American National Bank. The amount of goodwill
recorded in the transaction was approximately $132 million, which is being
amortized, on a straight-line basis over twenty years.
All IMC profit and loss activity and balance sheet accounts beginning with July
4, 1999 have been included in the Company December 31, 1999 consolidated
financial statements.
The following unaudited pro forma summary presents the financial information as
if the Company acquisition had occurred on January 1, 1999 and 1998. These pro
forma results have been prepared for comparative purposes and do not purport to
be indicative of what would have occurred had the acquisition been made on
January 1, 1999 and 1998, nor is it indicative of future results.

NOTE 6 - CREDIT FACILITY
Effective July 1997, the Company terminated a revolving line of credit with
NationsBank of Tennessee, N.A., which consisted of a $10,000,000 line of
credit, at an interest rate of 725%, and entered a similar agreement with
First American National Bank. Under the agreement, the Company could borrow
up to $25,000,000 through June 30, 2000 at the rate of LIBOR plus 065% or
the Federal Funds effective rate plus 15%, according to the Company
option. During 1999, the Company revised and extended the terms of its
$25,000,000 line of credit with First American National Bank. Under the
revised agreement, outstanding borrowings accrue interest at the rate of

year of service, have attained age twenty-one and have elected to participate in
the plan. A participant may elect to contribute from 1% to 20% of his or her
compensation to the Plan, subject to a maximum deferral set forth in the
Internal Revenue Code. The Company provides a dollar for dollar matching
contribution up to $500 per participant. The employer matching contribution is

the plan, subject to a maximum deferral set forth in the Internal Revenue Code.
The Company matches twenty-five percent of the first six percent of each

On July 31, 1997, one of the Company officers exercised approximately 358,000
stock options at the exercise price of $622 and the market price of $1250 on
the date of exercise. Certain of these options were considered non-qualified
options and, accordingly, the Company recorded compensation expense, for income
tax purposes only, of approximately $2,150,000 in 1997. The reduction in taxes
payable of approximately $789,000 in 1997 was recorded as additional paid-in
capital in the accompanying financial statements.
All options granted in the period January 1, 1999 through December 31, 1999,
except those granted to the Company Board of Directors as described above,
vest ratably over periods ranging from six months to five years, beginning one
year from date of grant. The exercise price of each option equals the market
price of the Company stock on the date of grant, and an option maximum term
is 10 years. All options granted in the period January 1, 1995 through December
31, 1998, except those granted to the Company Board of Directors as described
above, vest 20% annually beginning one year from date of grant. The exercise
price of each option equals the market price of the Company stock on the date
of grant, and an option maximum term is 10 years.
During 1996, the Company adopted the provisions of Statement of Financial
Accounting Standards No. 123, Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation SFAS
123. SFAS 123 encourages but does not require a fair value based method of
accounting for stock compensation plans. The Company has elected to continue
accounting for its stock compensation plan using the intrinsic value based
method and, accordingly, has not recorded compensation expense for each of the
three years ended December 31, 1999. Had compensation cost for the Company
stock compensation plan been determined based on the fair value at the option
grant dates, the Company net income and earnings per share would have been
reduced to the pro forma amounts indicated below                              Year ended December 31,

NOTE 9 - SEGMENT INFORMATION
The Company adopted the provisions of SFAS No. 131, Disclosures about Segments
of an Enterprise and Related Information, effective with its December 31, 1998
reporting and identified its reportable segments based upon the geographic
location of its business units. During 1999, the Company changed the way it
evaluates its business units. Effective in 1999, the Company reportable
segments are based on differences in product lines and are divided between balls
and rollers and plastics. The ball and roller segment comprises three
manufacturing facilities in the eastern United States and one facility located
in Kilkenny, Ireland. All of these facilities are engaged in the production of
precision balls and rollers used primarily in the bearing industry. The plastics
segment is concentrated in one facility located in Lubbock, Texas which
represents the IMC business acquired in July 1999. This facility is engaged in
the production of plastic injection molded products for the bearing, automotive,
instrumentation, fiber optic and consumer hardware markets.
The accounting policies of the segments are the same as those described in the
summary of significant accounting policies. The Company evaluates segment
performance based on profit or loss from operations before income taxes not
including nonrecurring gains and losses. The Company accounts for intersegment
sales and transfers at current market prices; however, the Company did not have
any material intersegment transactions during 1999, 1998 or 1997.                  December 31,      December 31,     December 31,

agreement is effective through October 31, 2004.
NOTE 10 - INCOME TAXES
The Company uses the asset and liability method to account for deferred income
taxes. Under the asset and liability method, deferred income taxes are provided
for the temporary differences between the financial reporting and income tax
bases of the Company assets and liabilities using enacted income tax rates
expected to be in effect when the temporary differences reverse.                    33 NN Ball & Roller, Inc.
