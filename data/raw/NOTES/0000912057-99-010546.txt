NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
SEPTEMBER 30, 1999
1. ORGANIZATION AND OPERATIONS OF THE COMPANY   GaSonics International Corporation the Company is a leading global
supplier of products and services used in the fabrication of advanced integrated
circuits semiconductors or ICs and flat panel displays FPDs. The
Company markets its products in the United States, Europe, and the Asia/Pacific
region primarily to large semiconductor and liquid crystal manufacturing
concerns. The Company is subject to a number of risks including, but not limited
to, volatility in the semiconductor markets and the related demand for
semiconductor equipment and the risk of inventory obsolescence resulting from
new product developments by competitors. See Additional Risk Factors.
2. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES PRINCIPLES OF CONSOLIDATION
The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company
and its wholly-owned subsidiaries and branches after elimination of intercompany
accounts and transactions.
USE OF ESTIMATES
The preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with
generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates
and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and
disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of consolidated
financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during
the reporting period. Actual results could differ materially from those
estimates.
FISCAL YEAR
The Company maintains a fifty-two/fifty-three week fiscal year cycle ending
on the Saturday closest to September 30. Fiscal 1999, fiscal 1998 and fiscal
1997 contain fifty-two weeks. For external reporting purposes, the Company
indicates its fiscal period as ending on September 30.
CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS
For purposes of the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows, the Company
considers all highly liquid investments with an original maturity of 90 days or
less to be cash equivalents.
Cash paid for interest, including amounts paid under capital lease
obligations, and domestic and foreign income taxes were as follows in
thousands                               YEARS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30,

September 30, 1997 related to the Submicron Technologies PLC see Concentration
of Credit Risk below write-off of their uncollectible account. Non-cash
activity included a before tax bad debt expense of $45 million.

2. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES: CONTINUED
INVESTMENTS IN MARKETABLE SECURITIES
Pursuant to the provisions of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards
SFAS No. 115, Accounting for Certain Investments in Debt and Equity
Securities, the Company investments are classified as available-for-sale and
are stated at fair value. Material unrealized gains and losses are recorded as a
separate component of stockholders' equity, net of tax. The Company
investments in debt securities mature at various dates through July 2000.
The fair value of available-for-sale securities was determined based on
quoted market prices at the reporting date for the instruments.
The components of available-for-sale securities by major security type as of
September 30, 1999 and 1998 are as follows in thousands                                             GROSS

$861 million, $611 million and $273 million in fiscal 1999, 1998 and 1997,
respectively. Gross realized gains on those sales were approximately $27,500 8,000 and $3,000 in fiscal 1999, 1998 and 1997, respectively. The Company used
specific identification as the cost basis in computing realized gains.
REVENUE RECOGNITION AND PRODUCT WARRANTY
Revenues from the Company products are generally recognized upon shipment.
The Company provides for the estimated costs of installation and warranty at the
time revenue is recognized. Maintenance and service revenues account for
approximately 15% of net sales and are recognized as the related work is
performed.
MAJOR CUSTOMERS
One customer accounted for approximately 23%, 20% and 10% of net sales for
each of fiscal years 1999, 1998 and 1997, respectively. Two other customers each
accounted for approximately 11% of net sales in fiscal 1997. There was one other
customer in fiscal 1998 that accounted for approximately 11% of net sales.
SOFTWARE DEVELOPMENT COSTS
SFAS No. 86, Accounting for the Costs of Computer Software to be Sold,
Leased or Otherwise Marketed, requires the capitalization of certain computer
software development costs incurred after

technological feasibility is established. Amounts qualifying for capitalization
under the statement are immaterial and have not been capitalized to date.
INVENTORIES
Inventories are stated at the lower of cost first-in, first-out or market
and include material, labor and manufacturing costs. Inventory is valued at
currently adjusted standards which approximate actual costs on a first-in,
first-out basis.
The Company provides inventory reserves for excess, obsolete, damaged or
lost inventory. The process of estimating required inventory reserves is
judgmental and is based on a number of factors which require input and
discussion among various members of management. Such factors include changes in
customer demand, changes in technology and other economic factors.
Inventories consisted of the following in thousands                                SEPTEMBER 30,

PROPERTY AND EQUIPMENT
Property and equipment are stated at cost and are generally depreciated over
the estimated useful lives of the assets four to ten years using the
straight-line method. Leasehold improvements are amortized on a straight-line
basis over the shorter of the useful lives of the assets or the remaining lease
term. Assets acquired under capital leases are recorded at the present value of
the related lease obligations and amortized on a straight-line basis over the
related lease term.

2. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES: CONTINUED
NET INCOME LOSS PER SHARE
Net income loss per share data has been computed using the weighted
average number of shares of common stock outstanding for the Basic net income
loss per share calculation, and using the weighted average number of shares of
common stock and common stock equivalent shares calculated under the treasury
stock method for the Diluted net income loss per share calculation.
FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSLATION
The functional currency of the Company foreign subsidiaries is the U.S.
dollar. Accordingly, foreign translation and exchange gains and losses, which
have not been material, are reflected in the accompanying consolidated
statements of operations.
CONCENTRATION OF CREDIT RISK
Financial instruments that potentially subject the Company to concentration
of credit risk consist principally of temporary cash investments and trade
receivables. The Company has cash investment policies that limit the amount of
credit exposure to any one financial institution evaluated as highly
creditworthy. Concentration of credit risk with respect to trade receivables
exists because the Company revenues are derived primarily from the sale of
photoresist removal equipment to companies in the semiconductor industry. The
Company performs ongoing credit evaluations of its customers and generally does
not require collateral.
A write-off of accounts receivable was recorded in the third quarter of
fiscal 1997 for the uncollectible account receivable due from SubMicron
Technologies PLC in Thailand. The Company recorded a $45 million pre-tax charge
to cover the unpaid balance on accounts receivable, less the value of the
recovered equipment, which the Company resold during fiscal 1998.
RECLASSIFICATIONS
Certain prior year amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current
year presentation.

2. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES: CONTINUED
EFFECT OF RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS
In June 1998, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued SFAS No. 133,
Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities, which requires
companies to record derivative financial instruments on the balance sheet as
assets or liabilities. It establishes accounting and reporting standards for
derivative instruments including standalone instruments, such as forward
currency exchange contracts and interest rate swaps or embedded derivatives and
requires that these instruments be marked-to-market on an ongoing basis. These
market value adjustments are to be included either in the income statement or
stockholders' equity, depending on the nature of the transaction. SFAS No. 133
is effective for fiscal years beginning after June 15, 2000 and cannot be
applied retroactively. The effect of SFAS No. 133 is not expected to be material
to the Company financial statements.

were independent of one another.
Intercompany sales between areas are accounted for based on established
intercompany sales prices.
Operating income loss is revenue less related costs and direct and
allocated operating expenses, excluding interest and, for all areas except the
United States, the unallocated portion of corporate expenses. United States
operating income is net of corporate engineering and development and
administrative expenses.
Corporate assets include assets maintained for general purposes, principally
cash equivalents and marketable securities.
4. SEGMENT REPORTING
In 1999, the Company adopted SFAS No. 131, Disclosures about Segments of an
Enterprise and Related Information. SFAS No. 131 supersedes SFAS No. 14,
Financial Reporting for Segments of a Business Enterprise, replacing the
industry segment approach with the management approach. The management
approach designates the internal organization that is used by management for
making operating decisions and assessing performance as the source of the
Company reportable segments. SFAS No. 131 also requires disclosures about
products and services, geographic areas and major customers. The adoption of
SFAS No. 131 did not affect the Company results of operations or financial
position, but did affect the disclosure of segment information. The Company is
organized on the basis of products and services. All of the Company business
units have been aggregated into one operating segment. The Company service
business is a separate operating segment; however, this segment does not meet
the quantitative thresholds as prescribed in SFAS No. 131. As a result, in the
opinion of management, no additional operating segment information is required
to be disclosed.
5. CHARGES TAKEN DURING THE FISCAL YEAR
The twelve month period ended September 30, 1998 included pre-tax charges of
approximately $17 million, related to costs of reductions in force completed in
June 1998 and September 1998 and costs of facility consolidations. As of
September 30, 1999, $15 million of the $17 million has been paid and $175,000
remains on the Company books as an accrual. Also included in the twelve month
period ended September 30, 1998 are pre-tax charges of approximately
$40 million, related primarily to reserves for potential excess inventory and
accelerated write-downs of certain demonstration equipment. The twelve month
period ended September 30, 1999 included pre-tax charges of approximately
$407,000, related to costs of a reduction in force completed in December 1998.
As of September 30, 1999, $384,000 of the $407,000 has been paid and $23,000
remains on the Company books as an accrual.
6. COMPREHENSIVE INCOME
Effective December 31, 1998 the Company adopted SFAS No. 130 Reporting
Comprehensive Income, which establishes standards for reporting and display of
comprehensive income and its components revenue, expenses, gains and losses in
a full set of general-purpose financial statements. For the twelve months ended
September 30, 1999 and 1998, there were no material items of comprehensive
income loss, thus comprehensive income for these periods did not differ
materially from net income as reported in the accompanying financial statements.
44
7. RECONCILIATION OF EARNINGS AND SHARE AMOUNTS USED IN EARNINGS PER SHARE
CALCULATION
Effective December 31, 1997, the Company adopted SFAS No. 128, Earnings per
Share. Basic earnings loss per common share were computed by dividing net
income loss by the weighted average number of shares of common stock
outstanding during this period. Diluted earnings loss per common share for the
twelve months ended September 30, 1999, 1998 and 1997, were calculated using the
treasury stock method to compute the weighted average common stock outstanding.
As a result, the Company reported earnings per share for fiscal year 1997 was
restated. There has been no impact on reported earnings per share data when
compared to basic and diluted earnings per share calculated under the provisions
of SFAS No. 128 for the twelve month period ended September 30, 1997.                                             PER SHARE

the Agreement with Union Bank of California which expires on March 31, 2000.
There were no borrowings outstanding under the Agreement as of September 30,
1999. Under the line of credit, all borrowings bear interest at the bank LIBOR
rate plus 125% per annum. The line of credit agreement contains certain
covenants, including covenants relating to financial ratios, profitability and
tangible net worth which must be maintained by the Company. In June 1999 Union
Bank of California renewed the Loan Agreement to provide a profitability
covenant that the Company may not incur losses in two consecutive quarters after
December 31, 1999. The Company was in compliance with the financial covenants of
the Agreement as of September 30, 1999.
Under the Agreement, the Company has a provision for standby letters of
credit not to exceed $500,000. As of September 30, 1999, there were letters of
credit outstanding in the amount of $69,163. Available borrowing under the
credit line is reduced by any amounts outstanding under the letter of credit
provision.

8. LINE OF CREDIT AGREEMENT AND CREDIT FACILITY: CONTINUED
The Company wholly-owned subsidiary in Japan, GaSonics International
Japan, K.K. entered into an agreement with the Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi to
secure a credit facility to provide operating capital to fund operations. The
credit facility provides for borrowings up to a maximum of 300 million Japanese
yen equivalent to approximately $29 million in U.S. dollars as of
September 30, 1999, and is secured by a Letter of Guarantee issued by the
Company. The outstanding balance bears interest at 1375% per annum and is due
and payable on demand. This credit facility expires on March 31, 2000. At
September 30, 1999, borrowings under this credit facility agreement were
297 million Japanese yen, which is equivalent to approximately $28 million U.S.
dollars as of that date. The Company intends to enter into a new agreement or
extend the term of the existing credit facility prior to the due date; however,
there can be assurance that such financing will be available when required or,
will be on reasonable terms.
9. INCOME TAXES   The Company accounts for income taxes using an asset and liability approach.

During fiscal 1990, the Company and Integrated Process Equipment Corporation
IPEC entered into an agreement in which the Company received 294,600 shares of
IPEC Class A commons stock in exchange for certain services and technology. In
fiscal 1997, the Company sold 54,673 shares of IPEC common stock and realized an
after tax gain of $790,000 which was reported in other income and expense in
the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Operations. As of September 30,
1997, the Company held no shares of IPEC common stock.
11. STOCK REPURCHASE PROGRAM
On December 16, 1998, the Company Board of Directors authorized a stock
repurchase program. Under this program 500,000 shares of its Common Stock may be
repurchased by the Company in the open market, from time-to-time at market
prices not to exceed $1500 per share using available cash. As of September 30,
1999, the Company had repurchased 200,000 shares of common stock in the open
market at an aggregate cost of approximately $26 million.

12. COMMITMENTS   The Company leases its facilities and certain machinery and equipment under
operating lease agreements that expire at various dates through June 2005.
Minimum commitments under the non-cancelable leases as of September 30, 1999
were as follows in thousands FISCAL YEAR

years ended September 30, 1999, 1998 and 1997, respectively.
The Company lease agreement for one of its facilities provides for the
deferral of three months cash rental payments in fiscal 1990 and subsequent
scheduled rent increases. Rent expense under this agreement is being recognized
on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease. The difference between the
amounts paid and the amounts expensed is classified as deferred rent in the
accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets.
No new capital lease obligations were incurred in fiscal 1999 or 1998.
13. INCENTIVE STOCK OPTION PLANS AND STOCK PURCHASE PLAN   In November 1993, the Company then President and Chief Executive Officer
the President exercised options to purchase an aggregate of 566,665 shares
of common stock at $060 per share, with a 5% interest bearing promissory note
payable to the Company in the amount of $340,000. In January 1994, the Board of
Directors authorized a special bonus program for the President, pursuant to
which $100,000 of the principal of the promissory note would be forgiven upon
his completion of each calendar year of service to the Company from January 1,
1994 through January 1, 1997. Accordingly, the promissory note has been
amortized to compensation expense in the amounts of $65,000 for fiscal 1997 and
$100,000 in fiscal years 1996 and 1995, respectively. The promissory note was
fully amortized at September 30, 1997.
1994 STOCK OPTION/STOCK ISSUANCE PLAN
In fiscal 1994, the Board adopted, and the stockholders subsequently
approved, the 1994 Stock Option/Stock Issuance Plan the 1994 Stock Option
Plan and authorized a total of 1,450,000 shares for issuance under the Plan.
The 1994 Stock Option Plan replaced the Company 1985 Stock Option Plan and the
Company 1988 Stock Option Plan which have both been terminated. During fiscal
years 1998 and 1997, the Company Board of Directors authorized, and the
stockholders subsequently approved, an additional 400,000 and 500,000 shares,
respectively, for issuance under the Plan. During fiscal 1999, there were no new
shares authorized.
The 1994 Stock Option Plan is divided into three separate components:
i the Discretionary Option Grant Program under which key employees including
officers and directors and consultants may, at the discretion of the Plan
Administrator, be granted options to purchase shares of common stock at an
exercise price not less than 85% of the fair market value of such shares on the
grant date                    48
13. INCENTIVE STOCK OPTION PLANS AND STOCK PURCHASE PLAN: CONTINUED
ii the Automatic Option Grant Program under which option grants will
automatically be made at periodic intervals to the nonemployee Board members to
purchase shares of common stock at an exercise price equal to 100% of the fair
market value of the option shares on the grant date, and iii the Stock Issuance
Program under which key employees including officers and directors and
consultants may be issued shares of common stock directly, either through the
purchase of such shares at a price not less than 85% of their fair market value
at the time of issuance or as a bonus tied to the performance of services or the
Company attainment of financial objectives. In no event may the aggregate
number of shares of common stock for which any individual participating in the
1994 Plan may be granted stock options and direct stock issuances exceed 825,000
shares over the term of the Plan. Options granted under the Discretionary and
Automatic Option Grant Programs have a maximum term of ten years and generally
vest over periods of one to five years from the date of grant, at the discretion
of the Plan Administrator. There were no stock issuances under the 1994 Stock
Option Plan in fiscal years 1999, 1998 and 1997.
In August 1996, holders of the Company options were given the opportunity
to exchange previously granted stock options for new common stock options.
Option holders, excluding non-employee directors of the Company, who held an
outstanding stock option with an exercise price in excess of $725 per share
were granted a new option with an exercise price of $725 per share, the market
price of the common stock on that date, in exchange for his or her higher-priced
option. Each optionee was given the choice of accepting the new option with a
new four year vesting schedule and having the higher-priced option canceled or
rejecting the new option and retaining the higher-priced option with its
original vesting schedule. Under the terms of the new options, one-quarter of
the shares vest one year from the date of grant and the remaining shares vest in
36 monthly installments. Options to purchase 416,725 shares were so exchanged.
In November 1998, holders of the Company options were given the
opportunity to exchange previously granted stock options for new common stock
options. Option holders, excluding non-employee directors of the Company, who
held an outstanding stock option with an exercise price in excess of $5625 per
share were granted a new option with an exercise price of $5625 per share, the
market price of the common stock on that date, in exchange for his or her
higher-priced option. Each optionee was given the choice of accepting the new
option with a new four year vesting schedule and having the higher-priced option
canceled or rejecting the new option and retaining the higher-priced option with
its original vesting schedule. Under the terms of the new options, one-quarter
of the shares vest one year from the date of grant and the remaining shares vest
in 36 monthly installments. Options to purchase 960,131 shares were so
exchanged.

The Company 1994 Employee Stock Purchase Plan the Purchase Plan was
adopted by the Board of Directors on January 27, 1994 and approved by the
stockholders in March 1994. The Purchase Plan is designed to allow eligible
employees of the Company to purchase shares of common stock, at semi-annual
intervals, through their periodic payroll deductions under the Purchase Plan.
The Company had initially reserved 300,000 shares of Common Stock for issuance
under the Purchase Plan. The Company Board of Directors authorized, and the
stockholders subsequently approved, an additional 400,000 shares of Common Stock
under the Purchase Plan in each of fiscal years 1997 and 1996.

13. INCENTIVE STOCK OPTION PLANS AND STOCK PURCHASE PLAN: CONTINUED
Participants in the Purchase Plan may purchase shares at 85% of the lower of
i the fair market value of the common stock on the participant entry date
into the offering period or ii the fair market value on the semi-annual
purchase date. The Purchase Plan will in all events terminate on December 31,
2003.
Of the 1,100,000 shares reserved for the 1994 Employee Stock Purchase Plan,
826,235 shares were purchased as of September 30, 1999.
STOCK BASED COMPENSATION EXPENSE
In October 1995, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued SFAS
No. 123, Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation, which establishes a fair
value based method of accounting for stock-based compensation plans and requires
additional disclosures for those companies who elect not to adopt the new method
of accounting. The Company adopted SFAS No. 123 in fiscal 1997, and in
accordance with the provisions of SFAS No. 123, the Company applies APB Opinion
25 and related interpretations in accounting for its stock option and stock
purchase plans.
The Company stock plans, as described above, are accounted for under APB
Opinion No. 25. Because the FASB Statement No. 123 method of accounting has not
been applied to options granted prior to October 1, 1995, the resulting pro
forma compensation cost may not be representative of that to be expected in
future years. Had compensation cost for these plans been determined consistent
with Statement No. 123, the Company consolidated net income and earnings per
share would have been reduced to the following pro forma amounts                               1999    1998    1997

14. EMPLOYEE BENEFIT PLANS   The Company maintains a 401k benefit plan covering all employees meeting
certain requirements. The plan includes a deferred compensation arrangement
permitting elective contributions to be made by the participants. Company
contributions are made at the discretion of the Board of Directors. Company
contributions were approximately $437,000, $506,000 and $476,000 in fiscal 1999,
1998 and 1997, respectively.
