Darling International Inc. We have audited the consolidated financial statements of Darling International
Inc. and subsidiaries as listed in the accompanying index. In connection with
our audits of the consolidated financial statements, we also have audited the
financial statement schedule as listed in the accompanying index. These
consolidated financial statements and financial statement schedule are the
responsibility of the Company management. Our responsibility is to express an
opinion on these consolidated financial statements and financial statement
schedule based on our audits.
We conducted our audits in accordance with generally  accepted auditing
standards. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material
misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting
the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes
assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by
management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.
We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present
fairly,  in all material  respects,  the financial  position of Darling
International Inc. and subsidiaries as of January 3, 1998 and December 28, 1996,
and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the years
in the three-year period ended January 3, 1998, in conformity with generally
accepted accounting principles. Also in our opinion, the related financial
statement schedule, when considered in relation to the basic consolidated
financial statements taken as a whole, presents fairly, in all material
respects, the information set forth therein.                         KPMG Peat Marwick LLP Dallas, Texas

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements
January 3, 1998 and December 28, 1996
1  GENERAL
a NATURE OF OPERATIONS
Darling International Inc. the Company believes it is the largest
independent recycler of food processing by-products in the United
States, operating a fleet of vehicles, through which it collects
animal  by-products,  used  restaurant cooking oil, and bakery
by-products from butcher shops, grocery stores, independent meat and
poultry processors, restaurants, and bakeries nationwide. The Company
processes raw materials through facilities located throughout the
United States into finished products, such as tallow, meat and bone
meal, yellow grease, and dried bakery product. The Company sells its
finished products domestically and internationally to producers of
soap, cosmetics, rubber, pet food and livestock feed for use as
ingredients in such products.
b SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
1 Basis of Presentation
The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of
the Company and its subsidiaries. All significant intercompany
balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.
2 Fiscal Year
The Company has a 52/53 week fiscal year ending on the Saturday
nearest December 31. Fiscal years for the consolidated financial
statements included herein are for the 53 weeks ended January 3,
1998, the 52 weeks ended December 28, 1996, and the 52 weeks
ended December 30, 1995.
3 Inventories
Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market. Cost is
determined using the first-in, first-out FIFO method.
4 Property, Plant and Equipment
Historically, property, plant and equipment are recorded at
cost. Depreciation is computed by the straight-line method over
the estimated  useful lives of assets:  1 Buildings and
improvements - 24 to 30 years, 2 Machinery and equipment - 3 to
8 years, and 3 Vehicles - 4 to 6 years. In accordance with
Fresh Start Reporting see Note 3, property,  plant and
equipment were restated to their approximate fair value as of
January 1, 1994. Subsequent additions are recorded at cost.
Maintenance and repairs are charged to expense as incurred and
expenditures  for  major  renewals  and  improvements  are
capitalized.
5 Collection Routes and Contracts
Collection  routes,  restrictive  covenants and  consulting
agreements are recorded at cost and are amortized using the
straight-line method over periods ranging from 3 to 15 years.
6 Goodwill
Goodwill, which represents the excess of purchase price over
fair value of net assets  acquired,  is  amortized on a
straight-line basis over the expected periods to be benefited,
not exceeding 30 years.  Annually,  the Company makes an
assessment to determine the recoverability of this intangible
asset.      7 Environmental Expenditures
Environmental expenditures incurred to mitigate or prevent
environmental contamination that has yet to occur and that
otherwise may result from future operations are capitalized.
Expenditures that relate to an existing condition caused by past
operations and that do not contribute to current or future
revenues  are  expensed  or  charged  against  established
environmental  reserves.  Reserves  are  established  when
environmental  assessments and/or clean-up requirements are
probable and the costs are reasonably estimable.
8 Income Taxes
The Company accounts for income taxes using the asset and
liability method. Under the asset and liability method, deferred
tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax
consequences attributable to differences between the financial
statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities
and their respective tax bases.  Deferred tax assets and
liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to
apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary
differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect
on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates
is recognized in income in the period that includes the
enactment date.
9 Earnings Per Common Share
In February 1997, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued
Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 128, Earnings
Per Share SFAS No. 128. SFAS No. 128 revised the previous
calculation methods and presentations of earnings per share and
requires that all prior-period earnings loss per share data be
restated. The Company adopted SFAS No. 128 in the fourth quarter
of 1997 as required by this Statement.
Basic earnings per common share are computed by dividing net
earnings attributable to outstanding common stock by the weighted
average number of common stock shares outstanding during the
year. Diluted earnings per common share are computed by dividing
net earnings attributable to outstanding common stock by the
weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the
year increased by dilutive common equivalent shares stock
options determined using the treasury stock method, based on the
average market price exceeding the exercise price of the stock
options. All prior-period earnings per share amounts have been
restated in accordance with SFAS No. 128.
The weighted average common shares used for basic earnings per
common share was 15,519,000, 15,375,000 and 15,138,000 for 1997,
1996 and 1995 respectively. The effect of dilutive stock options
added 942,000, 1,299,000 and 828,000 shares for 1997, 1996 and
1995 respectively for the computation of diluted earnings per
common share.
10 Stock Option Plans
Prior to January 1, 1996, the Company accounted for its stock
option plan in accordance with the provisions of Accounting
Principles Board APB Opinion No. 25, Accounting for Stock
Issued to Employees, and related interpretations. As such,
compensation expense would be recorded on the date of grant only
if the current market price of the underlying stock exceeded the
exercise price. On January 1, 1996, the Financial Accounting
Standards Board issued SFAS No. 123, Accounting for Stock-Based
Compensation, which permits entities to recognize as expense
over the vesting period the fair value of all stock-based awards
on the date of grant. Alternatively, SFAS No. 123 allows
entities to continue to apply the provisions of APB Opinion No.
25 and provide pro forma net income and pro forma earnings per
share disclosures for employee stock option grants made in 1995
and future years as if the fair-value-based method defined in
SFAS No. 123 had been applied. The Company has elected to
continue to apply the provisions of APB Opinion No. 25 and
provide the pro forma disclosure provisions of SFAS No. 123.      11 Statements of Cash Flows
The Company considers all short-term highly liquid instruments,
with an original maturity of three months or less, to be cash
equivalents.
12 Supplemental Schedule of Non-Cash Investing and Financing 
Activities
During the year ended December 28, 1996, non-cash investing and
financing activities included the purchase of 100% of the common
stock of Standard Tallow for $10,400,000. Assets acquired,

Bank debt incurred                29,600
Cash receivedpaid upon purchase      $  3,526
13 Use of Estimates
The preparation of the consolidated financial statements in
conformity with generally  accepted  accounting  principles
requires management to make estimates and assumptions that
affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and
disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of
the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts
of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual
results could differ from those estimates.      14 Impairment of Long-Lived Assets and Long-Lived Assets To Be 
Disposed Of
The Company adopted the provisions of SFAS No. 121, Accounting
for the Impairment of Long-Lived Assets and for Long-Lived
Assets to Be Disposed Of, on December 31, 1995. This Statement
requires that long-lived  assets and certain  identifiable
intangibles be reviewed for impairment whenever events or
changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an
asset may not be recoverable. Recoverability of assets to be
held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount
of an asset to future net cash flows expected to be generated by
the asset. If such assets are considered to be impaired, the
impairment to be recognized is measured by the amount by which
the carrying amount of the assets exceed the fair value of the
assets. Assets to be disposed of are reported at the lower of
the carrying amount or fair value less costs to sell. Adoption
of this Statement did not have a material impact on the
Company  financial position,  results of operations,  or
liquidity.
15 Financial Instruments
The carrying amount of cash and cash equivalents, accounts
receivable, accounts payable and accrued expenses approximates
fair value due to the short maturity of these instruments. The
carrying amount of $70,000,000 of outstanding borrowings under
the Credit  Agreement  at  January 3, 1998,  approximated
$71,800,000 since these borrowings bear interest at a fixed rate
pursuant to an interest rate swap.
The carrying amount of the balance of outstanding borrowings
under the Credit Agreement at January 3, 1998 and December 28,
1996 approximated fair value since the borrowings bear interest
at current market rates.
The fair market value of the Subordinated Notes approximated
$73,000,000 at December 28, 1996. The fair value of the
Subordinated Notes was estimated based on current borrowing
rates available for financings with non-rated, non-investment
grade bonds with similar terms and maturities.
16  Derivative Instruments
The Company use of derivative instruments is limited to
interest rate swaps which are entered into with the intent of
managing overall borrowing costs. The Company does not use
derivative instruments for trading purposes.
The Company has entered into interest rate swaps to effectively
fix the interest rate of a portion of its long term debt. The
notational amount of the swaps fixes approximately 48% of total
long term debt at January 3, 1998, at an underlying rate of
785%. These swaps settle at maturity, June 27, 2002. The
Company  credit risk related to interest rate swaps is
considered minimal due to strong creditworthy counterparties,
settlement on a net basis, and short durations. 2  ACQUISITIONS
During Fiscal 1997, as part of the Company strategy to expand its
presence in the grease trap business, the Company made the following
acquisitions: Enduro, Midwest Recycling, and Torvac, totaling $117
million which included goodwill acquired of $22 million.    On August 30, 1996, the Company acquired 100% of the outstanding capital
stock of IPC in accordance with a Stock Purchase Agreement dated August
30, 1996, between the Company, IPC and the stockholders of IPC the
Sellers. IPC processes by-products collected from bakeries, pasta
manufacturers, confectioners and snack food producers for sale to the
animal feed industry. The purchase price for the capital stock of IPC was
$30,000,000. The purchase price was paid in cash and was determined by
agreement between the Company and the Seller. The Company funded $296
million of the purchase price with funds financed under the Acquisition
Facility pursuant to the Credit Agreement among the Company, The First
National Bank of Boston, as agent, and Harris Trust and Savings Bank, as
co-agent. The remaining $400,000 of the purchase price was funded out of
cash on hand. In connection with the acquisition, the Company also paid
approximately $28 million in full payment and retirement of certain
indebtedness of IPC. The Company used cash on hand to fund the repayment
of such indebtedness.
The IPC acquisition was accounted for under the purchase method of
accounting in accordance with Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 16
and operations since the acquisition date have been included in the
consolidated  statements of  operations.  The excess of the total
acquisition cost over the recorded value of assets acquired was allocated
to goodwill in the amount of $159 million and will be amortized over 30
years.
The pro forma results of operations which follow assume that the IPC
acquisition had occurred at the beginning of each period presented. In
addition to combining the historical results of operations of the two
companies, the pro forma calculations include adjustments for the
estimated effect on the Company historical results of operations for
depreciation and amortization and interest related to the acquisition.

On October 22, 1993, the Company entered into a settlement agreement
providing for a restructure of the Company debt and equity and
resolution of a class action lawsuit the Settlement. On December
29, 1993 the Effective Date, the Settlement was consummated and
became binding on all original note holders.
The Settlement was accomplished pursuant to a court order which was
tantamount to a prepackaged bankruptcy despite the fact that the
Settlement did not occur under the Bankruptcy Code. Accordingly, the
Company has accounted for the Settlement using Fresh Start Reporting
as of January 1, 1994 in accordance with Statement of Position 90-7,
Financial Reporting by Entities In Reorganization Under the United
States Bankruptcy Code SOP 90-7 issued by the American Institute
of Certified Public Accountants.     Using a valuation of the Company performed by an independent appraiser,
the Company determined the total reorganization value of all its assets
to be approximately $236,294,000 as of January 1, 1994. The historical
values of the Company liabilities, other than deferred income taxes,
approximated fair value at January 1, 1994. Deferred income taxes were
recorded in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles.
The Company accumulated deficit was eliminated as of January 1, 1994. 4  INVENTORIES

CREDIT AGREEMENT
Effective June 5, 1997, the Company entered into a Credit Agreement the
Credit Agreement which provides for borrowings in the form of a
$50,000,000 Term Loan, and a $175,000,000 Revolving Credit. Facility. As
of January 3, 1998, the Company was in compliance with all provisions of
the Credit Agreement.
The Term Loan provides for $50,000,000 of borrowing. The Term Loan bears
interest, payable monthly, at LIBOR 59375% at January 3, 1998 plus a
margin the Credit Margin 125% at January 3, 1998 which floats
based on the achievement of certain financial ratios. The Term Loan is
payable by the Company in quarterly installments of $1,250,000 commencing
on June 30, 1997 through March 31, 1999, $2,500,000 commencing on June
30, 1999 through March 31, 2002; and an installment of $10,000,000 due on
June 5, 2002. As of January 3, 1998, $46,250,000 was outstanding under
the Term Loan Facility.
The Revolving Credit Facility provides for borrowings up to a maximum of
$175,000,000 with sublimits available for letters of credit and a
swingline. Outstanding borrowings on the Revolving Credit Facility bear
interest, payable monthly, at various LIBOR rates ranging from 58125%
to 59648% at January 3, 1998 plus the Credit Margin as well as portions
at a Base Rate 850% at January 3, 1998 or, for swingline advances, at
the Base Rate. Additionally, the Company must pay a commitment fee equal
to 025% per annum on the unused portion of the Revolving Credit
Facility. The Revolving Credit Facility matures on June 5, 2002. As of
January 3, 1998, $100,875,000 was outstanding under the Revolving Credit
Facility. As of January 3, 1998, the Company had outstanding irrevocable
letters of credit aggregating $8,401,000.
The Company has only very limited involvement with derivative financial
instruments and does not use them for trading purposes. The interest rate
swap agreement is used to reduce the potential impact of increases in
interest rates on floating-rate long-term debt. At January 3, 1998, the
Company was party to three interest rate swap agreements, each with a
term of five years all maturing June 27, 2002. Under terms of the swap
agreement, the interest obligation on $70 million of Credit Agreement
floating-rate debt was exchanged for fixed rate contracts which bear
interest, payable quarterly, at an average rate of 66% plus a credit
margin.
The Credit Agreement contains certain terms and covenants, which, among
other matters, restrict the incurrence of additional indebtedness, the
payment of cash dividends and the annual payment of capital expenditures,
and requires the maintenance of certain minimum financial ratios. As of
January 3, 1998, no cash dividends could be paid to the Company
stockholders pursuant to the Credit Agreement.
SUBORDINATED NOTES
On June 27, 1997, the Company redeemed Subordinated Notes with a face
amount of $69,976,000, using proceeds from the Revolving Credit Facility.

The portion of the deferred tax assets and liabilities expected to be
recognized in Fiscal 1998 has been recorded at January 3, 1998, in the
accompanying consolidated balance sheet as a net current deferred income
tax asset of $4,006,000. The remaining non-current deferred tax assets
and liabilities have been recorded as a net deferred income tax liability
of $25,814,000 at January 3, 1998 in the accompanying consolidated
balance sheet.
The valuation allowance for deferred tax assets as of January 3, 1998 and
December 28, 1996 was $19,472,000. The net changes in the total valuation
allowance for the year ended December 28, 1996 was a decrease of
$930,000. The Company believes that the remaining net deferred tax assets
at January 3, 1998 and December 28, 1996 will be realized primarily
through future reversals of existing taxable temporary differences.
At January 3, 1998, the Company had net operating loss carryforwards for
federal income tax purposes of approximately $75,215,000 which are
available to offset future federal taxable income through 2008. The
availability of the net operating loss carryforwards to reduce future
taxable income is subject to various limitations. As a result of the
change in ownership, the Company believes utilization of its net
operating loss carryforwards is limited to $3,400,000 per year for the
remaining life of the net operating losses. The Company also has
approximately  $3,896,000 of foreign tax credits and approximately
$313,000 of capital loss carry forwards which are available to reduce
future federal income taxes, if any, through 1998.
The Company reports tax benefits utilized related to the January 1,
1994 valuation allowance $906,000 in 1996 and $211,000 in 1995 as a
direct addition to additional paid-in capital. 12  STOCKHOLDERS' EQUITY
a  COMMON EQUITY
On October 28, 1997, the Stockholders of the Company approved a
three-for-one stock split. As a result, all references to shares
or per share data have been retroactively restated to reflect the
three-for-one stock split.
b  STOCK OPTIONS
At December 29, 1993, the Company granted options to purchase
384,615 shares of the Company common stock to the former owners
of the Redeemable Preferred Stock. The options have a term of ten
years from the date of grant and may be exercised at a price of
$345 per share approximated market value at the date of grant.
The 1993 Flexible Stock Option Plan and the 1994 Employee Flexible
Stock Option Plan provide for the granting of stock options to key
officers  and  salaried  employees  of the Company and its
subsidiaries. Options to purchase common stock were granted at a
price approximating fair market value at the date of grant.
Options granted under the plans expire ten years from the date of
grant. Vesting occurs on each anniversary of the grant date as
defined in the specific option agreement. The plans also provide
for the acceleration by one year of vesting of all non-vested
shares upon the termination of the employee employment in
certain circumstances or upon a change in management control.
The Non-Employee Directors Stock Option Plan provides for the
granting of options to non-employee directors of the Company. As
of January 3, 1998, options to purchase 327,000 shares of common
stock had been granted pursuant to this plan. The options have a
term of ten years from the date of grant and may be exercised at a
price of $333 - $9042 per share approximated market value at
the date of grant. The options vest 25% six months after the
grant date and 25% on each anniversary date thereafter.
The per share weighted average fair value of stock options granted
during  1997,  1996 and 1995 was $734,  $463 and $274,
respectively, on the date of grant using the Black Scholes
option-pricing model with the following weighted assumptions                         1997     1996    1995
Expected dividend yield    00%     00%    00%

Expected life        10 years   10 years  10 years
Expected volatility     412-443   620    559        The Company applies APB Opinion No. 25 in accounting for its Plans
and, accordingly, no compensation cost has been recognized for its
stock options in the financial statements as stock options were
granted at market value on the grant date. Had the Company
determined compensation cost based on the fair value at the grant
date for its stock options under SFAS No. 123, the Company net
earnings would have been reduced to the pro forma amounts
indicated below in thousands, except per share                             1997   1996   1995

Basic earnings
per common share  As reported   $035  $050   $095
Pro forma    $028  $046   $095
Pro forma net earnings reflects only options granted in 1997, 1996
and 1995. Therefore, the full impact of calculating compensation
cost for stock options under SFAS No. 123 is not reflected in the
pro forma net income amounts presented above because compensation
cost is reflected over the options vesting period and compensation
cost for options granted prior to January 1, 1995 are not
considered.

The Company has retirement and pension plans covering substantially all
of its employees. Most retirement benefits are provided by the Company
under separate final-pay noncontributory pension plans for all salaried
and hourly employees excluding those covered by union-sponsored plans
who meet service and age requirements. Benefits are based principally on
length of service and earnings patterns during the five years preceding
retirement.
The Company funding policy for those plans is to contribute annually
not less than the minimum amount required nor more than the maximum
amount that can be deducted  for  federal  income tax  purposes.
Contributions are intended to provide not only for benefits attributed to
service to date but also for those expected to be earned in the future.
The following table sets forth the plans' funded status and amounts
recognized in the Company consolidated balance sheets based on the
measurement date October 1, 1997 and 1996 in thousands                                 January 3, 1998         December 28, 1996

provide defined benefits to certain employees covered by labor contracts.
These plans are not administered by the Company and contributions are
determined in accordance with provisions of negotiated labor contracts.
Information with respect to the Company proportionate share of the
excess, if any, of the actuarially computed value of vested benefits over
these pension plans' net assets is not available. The cost of such plans
amounted to $1,529,000, $1,333,000, and $1,288,000, for the years ended
January 3, 1998, December 28, 1996, and December 30, 1995, respectively. 14  NET SALES
The Company has no material foreign operations, but exports a portion of
its products to customers in various foreign countries. Total export
sales were $101,040,000, $119,055,000, and $169,829,000, for the years
ended January 3, 1998, December 28, 1996, and December 30, 1995,
respectively.
Concentration of credit risk is limited due to the Company diversified
customer base and the fact that the Company sells commodities. No single
customer accounted for more than 10% of the Company net sales in 1997,
1996, and 1995. 15 CONTINGENCIES
a  ENVIRONMENTAL
Blue Earth
In July 1997, the Company, the United States Attorney for the District of
Minnesota, and the State of Minnesota received Court approval of the
proposed settlement to resolve the government criminal claims relating
to environmental law violations at the Company Blue Earth rendering
plant. The specific violations are contained in the Indictment against the
Company filed on December 16, 1996, and the Plea Agreement accepted in
July 1997. These violations relate to improper sampling, testing, and
reporting of waste contaminants in order to conceal discharges in excess
of the permitted levels. The Court approved the Plea Agreement under which
Darling has paid $27 million in criminal fines and penalties, as well as
$10 million in restitution and remediation. A consent Decree the
Decree to resolve all state and federal civil and administrative claims
related to the Blue Earth allegations was approved by the Court in
September 1997. Pursuant to the Decree Darling paid $300,000 in civil and
administrative penalties, and is undertaking other requirements of the
Decree. The Company recorded a provision for loss contingency of $61
million during Fiscal 1996 to cover the expected cost of the settlement as
well as legal, environmental and other related costs.    Chula Vista
The Company is the owner of an undeveloped property located in Chula
Vista, California the Site. A rendering plant was operated on the Site
until 1982. From 1959 to 1978, a portion of the Site was used as an
industrial waste disposal facility which was closed pursuant to Closure
Order No. 80-06 issued by the State of California Regional Water Quality
Control Board for the San Diego Region the RWQCB. The Site has been
listed by the State of California as a site for which expenditures for
removal and remedial actions may be made by the State pursuant to the
California Hazardous Substances Account Act, California Health & Safety
Code Section 25300 et seq. Technical consultants retained by the Company
have conducted various investigations of the environmental conditions at
the Site, and in 1996, requested that the RWQCB issue a no further
action letter with respect to the Site. The RWQCB has not yet taken any
formal action in response to such request.
Underground Storage Tanks
The Company processing operations do not produce hazardous or toxic
wastes; however, the Company does operate underground fuel storage tanks
UST  that are subject to federal,  state and local laws and
regulations. As of January 3, 1998, the Company has removed or closed 177
of its 183 UST. b LITIGATION
Petruzzi
An antitrust class action suit was filed in 1986 by Petruzzi IGA
Supermarkets in the United States District Court for the Middle District of
Pennsylvania the Class Action Suit seeking damages from the Company. On
September 14, 1995, the Company entered into a settlement agreement
providing for the disposal of all claims in the Class Action Suit. The
settlement was approved by the District Court on December 20, 1995. On
August 18, 1997 the District Court awarded plaintiffs attorney fees of
$13 million from the Company which was paid on October 3, 1997.
Other Litigation
The Company is also a party to several other lawsuits, claims and loss
contingencies incidental to its business, including assertions by certain
regulatory agencies related to the release of unacceptable odors from some
of its processing facilities.
The Company purchases its workers compensation, auto and general liability
insurance on a retrospective basis. The Company accrues its expected
ultimate costs related to claims occurring during each fiscal year and
carries this accrual as a reserve until such claims are paid by the
Company.
The Company has established loss reserves for insurance, environmental and
litigation matters as a result of the matters discussed above. Although the
ultimate liability cannot be determined with certainty, management of the
Company believes that reserves for contingencies are reasonable and
sufficient based upon present governmental regulations and information
currently available to management. The Company estimates the range of
possible losses related to environmental and litigation matters, based on
certain assumptions, is between $43 million and $133 million at January
3, 1998.  The accrued  expenses  and other  noncurrent  liabilities
classifications in the Company consolidated balance sheets include
reserves for insurance, environmental and litigation contingencies of $157
million and $208 million at January 3, 1998 and December 28, 1996,
respectively. There can be no assurance, however, that final costs will not
exceed current estimates.  The Company believes that any additional
liability relative to such lawsuits and claims which may not be covered by
insurance would not likely have a material adverse effect on the Company
financial position, although it could potentially have a material impact on
the results of operations in any one year. 16 QUARTERLY FINANCIAL DATA UNAUDITED AND IN THOUSANDS EXCEPT PER SHARE
