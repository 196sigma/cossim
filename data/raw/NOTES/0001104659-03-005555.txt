31 Report of Independent Auditors The Board of Directors and Shareholders Sanchez Computer Associates, Inc. We
have audited the 2002 consolidated financial statements of Sanchez Computer
Associates, Inc. and subsidiaries as listed in the accompanying index. In connection with our audit of the 2002
consolidated financial statements, we also have audited the 2002 consolidated
financial statement schedule as listed in the accompanying index. These consolidated financial statements and
consolidated financial statement schedule are the responsibility of the
Companys management. Our responsibility
is to express an opinion on these consolidated financial statements and
consolidated financial statement schedule based on our audit. The 2001 and 2000 consolidated financial
statements and consolidated financial statement schedule of Sanchez Computer
Associates, Inc. and subsidiaries as listed in the accompanying index were
audited by other auditors who have ceased operations. Those auditors expressed an unqualified opinion on those
consolidated financial statements and consolidated financial statement
schedule, before the revisions and restatement described in Note 2 to the
consolidated financial statements, in their reports dated February 5, 2002. We
conducted our audit in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in
the United States of America. Those
standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable
assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material
misstatement. An audit includes
examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in
the financial statements. An audit also
includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates
made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audit provides a
reasonable basis for our opinion. In
our opinion, the 2002 consolidated financial statements referred to above
present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Sanchez
Computer Associates, Inc. and subsidiaries as of December 31, 2002, and the
results of their operations and their cash flows for the year then ended, in
conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States
of America. Also in our opinion, the related
2002 consolidated financial statement schedule, when considered in relation to
the basic consolidated financial statements taken as a whole, presents fairly in all material respects, the information set forth therein. As
discussed above, the 2001 and 2000 consolidated financial statements of Sanchez
Computer Associates, Inc. and subsidiaries as listed in the accompanying index
were audited by other auditors who have ceased operations. As described in Note 2, these consolidated
financial statements have been revised to include the transitional disclosures
required by Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 142, Goodwill
and Other Intangible Assets, which was adopted by the Company as of
January 1, 2002. In our opinion, the
disclosures for 2001 and 2000 in Note 2 are appropriate. In addition, as described in Note 2, the
2001 and 2000 consolidated financial statements were restated to record
reimbursements received for out-of-pocket expenses incurred as revenue in
accordance with Emerging Issues Task Force Issue No. 01-14, Income Statement
Characterization of Reimbursements Received for 'Out-of-Pocket' Expenses
Incurred. We audited the adjustments
that were applied to restate the 2001 and 2000 consolidated financial
statements. In our opinion, such
adjustments are appropriate and have been properly applied. However, we were not engaged to audit review, or apply any procedures to the 2001 and 2000 consolidated financial
statements of Sanchez Computer Associates, Inc. and subsidiaries other than
with the respect to such disclosures and adjustments and, accordingly, we do
not express an opinion or any other form of assurance on the 2001 and 2000
consolidated financial statements taken as a whole.

Philadelphia, Pennsylvania February 6, 2003 32 The following report is a copy of a
previously issued Arthur Andersen LLP Andersen Report, and the report has not
been re-issued by Andersen. The prior

consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2000 and the consolidated
statements of operations, shareholders equity, and cash flows for the year

financial statements. To Sanchez Computer Associates, Inc. We have audited the
accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Sanchez Computer Associates, Inc.
a Pennsylvania corporation and subsidiaries as of December 31, 2001 and 2000 and the related consolidated statements of operations, shareholders equity and
cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31 2001. These financial statements are
the responsibility of the Companys management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial
statements based on our audits. We conducted our audits in
accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in the United

plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the
financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test
basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial
statements. An audit also includes
assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by
management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement
presentation. We believe that our
audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. In our opinion, the

respects, the financial position of Sanchez Computer Associates, Inc. and
subsidiaries as of December 31, 2001 and 2000, and the results of their
operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended

37 Sanchez Computer Associates Inc. Notes to Consolidated
Financial Statements 1 Description of Business Sanchez
Computer Associates Inc. is a global leader in developing and marketing
scalable and integrated software and services that provide banking, customer
integration, brokerage, wealth management and outsourcing solutions to
approximately 400 financial institutions in 21 countries. Sanchezs corporate headquarters is located
in Malvern, Pennsylvania. The Companys
outsourcing data and operations service center is located in Seven Fields Pennsylvania. Beginning with the first
quarter of January 2003, Sanchez organized into divisions and initiated new
segment reporting based on those divisions.
Sanchezs divisional segments are banking solutions, wealth management outsourcing and global services. The
Companys products include an integrated banking platform. The banking platform products include: Sanchez Profile, the highly flexible, multi-currency multi-language, customer-centric, core banking and transaction processing application Sanchez Xpress, an enterprise customer and transaction management system, which
empowers CRM and delivers business integration; Sanchez Webclient, a Web-based Internet customer front-end processor; Sanchez WebCSR, a browser-based
integrated customer servicing application that can be deployed across multiple
retail delivery channels such as branches and call centers; and Sanchez CRM, a
Web-based customer relationship management system, available as a stand-alone
application or integrated with Sanchezs banking platform. The Companys outsoucing offering is
operated by Sanchez Data Systems, Inc. SDSI, which uses the Sanchez
integrated banking platform as the basis for a complete outsourced direct
banking solution under the Sanchez e-PROFILE brand. The Sanchez e-PROFILE solution provides an integrated end-to-end
operations and technology platform that enables financial services companies to
offer comprehensive on-line financial services to their customers. The Company also offers Sanchez Wealthware a group of integrated, full-functioned, multi-channel wealth management
applications that satisfy the real-time, straight through processing
requirements of brokers, bankers and insurance agents. The product includes application solutions
for equities, options, fixed-income securities, mutual fund securities and wrap
account processing. 2 Significant Accounting Policies Principles of ConsolidationThe
consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its
subsidiaries. All significant
intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. Use of Management EstimatesThe preparation
of consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles
generally accepted in the United States requires management to continuously
make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of certain
assets, liabilities, and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the
date of the financial statements and the reported revenues and expenses during
the period. Actual results could differ
from these estimates. The most
significant estimates are the measurement of the percentage-of-completion for
revenue recognition, estimated lives of processing relationships, the valuation
of goodwill and intangibles and allowance for doubtful accounts. Revenue RecognitionThe Company generally
recognizes product revenues, which include software license fees and product
enhancement fees, using the percentage-of-completion method over a period of
time that commences with the execution of the license agreement and ends with
the completion of the enhancements or implementation. If the customer does not request enhancements and or
implementation services, the Company generally recognizes the license fee from
these products upon delivery, provided that the other undelivered services are
not essential to the functionality of the software. The Company does not recognize any license fees unless persuasive
evidence of an arrangement exists, the license amount is fixed and determinable
and collectability is probable. The
Companys software licensing agreements generally provide for a warranty
period. If a warranty period is provided
to a customer, the portion of the license fee associated with the warranty period
is unbundled from the license fee and is recognized ratably over the warranty
period. Service
revenues, which include client implementation and consulting fees, are
typically recognized when the services are performed or on the
percentage-of-completion method, depending on the contract terms. In accordance with Securities and Exchange
Commission SEC SAB No. 101 Revenue Recognition in Financial Statements revenue from implementation services and initial product licenses sold upfront
for outsourced clients are recognized ratably over the expected term of the
processing contract, ranging from 1 to 4 years. Implementation fees for SDSI clients that do not ultimately
execute processing agreements are recognized in the period during which the
project is terminated, the amount determinable and collection probable. Direct costs related to implementation
services for SDSI clients are deferred and recognized ratably over the expected
life of the processing arrangement or expensed as incurred, consistent with the
related revenue recognition. Revenue
from software maintenance contracts is recognized ratably over the term of the
maintenance contract. 38 Effective
January 1, 2002, the Company adopted Emerging Issues Task Force EITF Issue
No. 01-14, Income Statement Characterization of Reimbursements Received for
Out of Pocket Expenses Incurred, which requires that customer reimbursements
received for direct costs paid to third parties and related expenses be
characterized as revenue. Comparative
financial statements for 2001 and 2000 have been reclassified to provide
consistent presentation. In accordance
with EITF No. 01-14, the Company has presented customer reimbursement revenue
and expenses of $54 million, $49 million and $61 million for the years ended
December 31, 2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively. Also as a result of the adoption of EITF No. 01-14, the Company
has presented deferred revenue and expense balances of $23 million and $18
million on its December 31, 2002 and 2001, balance sheets, respectively. Customer reimbursements primarily represent
direct costs paid to third parties primarily for travel, postage and data
communication costs. The adoption of
EITF No. 01-14 did not impact the Companys financial position, operating
income or net income. Cash
and Cash EquivalentsCash
and cash equivalents consist of cash and highly liquid investments with
maturities of three months or less from the date of purchase and whose carrying
amount approximates market value due to the short maturity of the
investments. The Company maintains a
centralized cash management program whereby its excess cash balances are
invested in high quality short-term money market instruments. Cash balances in the Companys accounts may
exceed federally insured limits. Accounts
ReceivableThe
majority of the Companys receivables are due from financial service
organizations located throughout the United States, Europe and Canada. The Company determines the allowances based
on a specific review of its accounts receivable. From time to time, our clients dispute the amounts due to us and
in other cases our clients experience financial difficulties and cannot pay on
a timely basis. In certain instances these factors ultimately result in uncollectable accounts. The determination of the appropriate reserve
needed for uncollectable accounts involves significant judgment. A change in the factors used to evaluate
collectability could result in a significant change in the reserve need. Such factors include changes in the
financial condition of our customers as a result of industry, economic or
customer-specific factors, the ultimate settlement of disputes and, in certain
cases, the decisions of third party arbitrators or courts. Contracts in ProcessContracts in process represent revenues
recognized in excess of amounts invoiced, primarily related to contracts
accounted for using the percentage of completion method in the accompanying
consolidated balance sheets. InvestmentsThe Company has certain investments in
technology service firms which are accounted for on the cost method as the
Company does not have significant influence over its investees. Through December 31, 2002, the Company has
invested $20 million in a newly formed venture fund that invests in early
stage technology companies. The Company
accounts for its investment in the fund using the consolidation method whereby
the Company includes the profits and losses, and balance sheet of the fund, and
then records a minority interest to reduce the Companys interest due to
outside limited partners. Property
and EquipmentProperty
and equipment is carried at cost, except for assets under capital leases, which
are recorded at the present value of future lease payments. Expenditures for major renewals improvements and betterments are capitalized and minor repairs and maintenance
are charged to expense as incurred.
When assets are sold, the related cost and accumulated depreciation are
removed from the accounts and any gain or loss from such disposition is
included in operations. Depreciation
and AmortizationDepreciation
and amortization are provided over the estimated useful lives of the related
assets using the straight-line method.
Equipment and furniture and fixtures typically have useful lives of
three and five years, respectively. The
useful life of leasehold improvements is the lesser of the lease term or 5
years. Capitalized
Software CostsCertain
development costs of the Companys software products are capitalized subsequent
to the establishment of technological feasibility and up to the time the
product becomes available for general release.
Amortization is provided on a product-by-product basis at the greater of
the amount computed using a the ratio of current revenues for a product to
the total of current and anticipated future revenues or b the straight-line
method over the remaining estimated economic life of the product. Generally, an original estimated economic
life of four years is assigned to capitalized software development costs. All
costs of software program maintenance are charged to expense as incurred. 39 There were no capitalized
software costs during 2002, 2001 and 2000.
Accumulated amortization was $27 million and $24 million as of
December 31, 2002 and 2001, respectively. Amortization of capitalized software
costs amounted to $315,000, $442,000 and $592,000 in 2002, 2001, and 2000 respectively. All capitalized software costs are written down to net realizable
value when the carrying amount is in excess thereof. No write-downs were required for 2002, 2001 or 2000. At December 31, 2002 and 2001, the net
capitalized software balance was $144,000 and $459,000, respectively and is
included in other non-current assets. Impairment of Long-Lived AssetsThe Company
follows the provisions of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards SFAS
No. 144, Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets which requires that an impairment loss to write down long-lived assets including intangible assets, to their fair value should be recorded when
indications of impairment are present and the undiscounted cash flows estimated
to be generated by those assets are less than the assets carrying amount. Management believes that no long-lived
assets were impaired as of December 31, 2002 and 2001. Intangible AssetsIntangible assets consist of customer
lists, acquired technology, and other assets which are primarily related to the
acquisition of Spectra Note 3, and are accounted for under SFAS No. 142 Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets. GoodwillEffective January 1, 2002 the Company adopted the provisions of SFAS No. 143, Goodwill and Other
Intangible Assets. SFAS No. 142
addresses the financial accounting and reporting for acquired goodwill and
other intangible assets and supercedes APB Opinion No. 17, Intangible
Assets. Under SFAS No. 142, goodwill
and other intangible assets with indefinite lives are not amortized but are
subject to tests for impairment at least annually. In accordance with the provisions of SFAS No. 142, the Company
ceased the amortization of goodwill effective January 1, 2002. Prior to the adoption of SFAS No. 142, the
Company amortized goodwill over 10 years.
Amortization expense was $127,000 for each of the years ended December
31, 2001 and 2000. The
following table illustrates adjusted net earnings loss and basic and diluted
earnings loss per share as if SFAS No. 142 was adopted as of January 1, 2000

At
December 31, 2002, goodwill consists of $899,000 from the Companys acquisition
of SDSI in 1999 and $230 million from the Companys acquisition of Spectra in
July 2002 Note 3. In accordance with
the provisions of SFAS No. 142, the Company was required to perform a
transitional goodwill impairment test by June 30, 2002. In addition, SFAS No. 142 requires that the
Company perform an impairment test annually or more frequently if events or
circumstances indicate that the value of goodwill might be impaired. The Company performs its annual impairment
test as of September 30. No goodwill
impairments were recorded as a result of the SFAS No. 142 transitional or
annual impairment test. When
it is determined that the carrying value of goodwill may not be recoverable measurement of any impairment will be based on a projected discounted cash flow
method using a discount rate commensurate with the risk inherent in the current
business model. Deferred RevenueDeferred revenues
represent amounts collected from or invoiced to customers in excess of revenue
recognized. Deferred revenues consist
of prepaid maintenance and license milestone amounts which are typically expected
to be recognized within one year. In
addition, a substantial amount of the fees invoiced during the implementation
phase related to our outsourcing customers are deferred, along with their
associated costs, in accordance with SAB 101.
These amounts are recognized over the expected life of the outsourcing
relationship. 40 Comprehensive IncomeComprehensive
income consists of net earnings, adjusted for other increases and decreases
affecting stockholders equity that are excluded from the determination of net
earnings. Income TaxesThe Company
accounts for income taxes following the provisions of SFAS No. 109, Accounting
for Income Taxes. SFAS No. 109
requires deferred tax assets or liabilities to be recognized for the estimated
future tax effects of net operating loss and credit carryforwards as well as
temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax basis of assets
and liabilities based on the enacted tax law and statutory tax rates applicable
to the periods in which the temporary differences are expected to affect
taxable income. Additionally, the
benefits of utilizing the Company deferred tax assets are recognized to the
extent management of the Company believes that it is more likely than not that
the benefits will be realized in future periods. Earnings Per ShareThe Company
follows SFAS No. 128, Earnings per Share, which requires presentation of two
amounts, basic and diluted earnings loss per share. Basic
earnings loss per share has been calculated as net earnings loss divided by
weighted-average common shares outstanding, while diluted earnings loss per
share has been computed as net earnings loss divided by weighted-average
common and diluted shares outstanding which includes the dilutive effect of
stock options. The
following table provides a reconciliation of weighted average common shares
outstanding to weighted-average common and diluted shares outstanding in
thousands

At

include options to purchase 6,093,707 and 4,050,795 shares of common stock
respectively. All potentially dilutive
common stock equivalents were excluded from the calculation of net loss per
share for the year ended December 31, 2000 as their effect was anti-dilutive as
a result of the net loss incurred for the period. Translation of Foreign Financial StatementsAssets
and liabilities of the Companys foreign subsidiaries are translated at the
exchange rate as of the end of each reporting period. The income statement is translated at the average exchange rate
for the period. Gains or losses from
translating foreign currency financial statements are accumulated in a separate
component of shareholders equity. Stock-Based CompensationThe Company applies
APB Opinion No. 25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees, and related
interpretations for stock options and other stock-based awards while disclosing
pro forma net earnings loss and net earnings loss per share as if the fair
value method had been applied in accordance with SFAS No. 123, Accounting for
Stock-Based Compensation. Had
compensation cost for the Companys stock options plans been determined based
upon the fair value of the options at the date of grant, as prescribed under
SFAS No. 123, the Companys net earnings loss and basic and diluted net
earnings loss per share would have been adjusted to the following pro forma
amounts in thousands 41

Recent
Accounting PronouncementsIn July 2002, the FASB issued SFAS No. 146 which addresses the
financial accounting and reporting of expenses related to restructurings
initiated after 2002, and applies to costs associated with an exit activity
including a restructuring or with a disposal of long-lived assets. Those activities can include eliminating or
reducing product lines, terminating employees and contracts, and relocating plant
facilities or personnel. Under SFAS No.
146, a company will record a liability for a cost associated with an exit or
disposal activity when the liability is incurred and can be measured at fair
value. The provisions of SFAS No. 146
are effective prospectively for exit or disposal activities initiated after
December 31, 2002. In December 2002, the FASB issued SFAS
No. 148, which amends SFAS No. 123, to provide alternative methods of
transition for a voluntary change to the fair method of accounting for
stock-based employee compensation. In
addition, SFAS No. 148 amends the disclosure requirements of SFAS No. 123 to
require prominent disclosures in both annual and interim financial
statements. Certain of the disclosure
modifications are required for fiscal years ending after December 15, 2002. The
EITF recently reached a consensus on EITF Issue No. 00-21, which provides
accounting guidance for customer solutions where delivery or performance of
products, services and/or performance may occur at different points in time or
over different periods of time.
Companies are required to adopt this consensus for fiscal periods
beginning after June 15, 2003. The
Company believes the adoption of EITF Issue No. 00-21 will not have a material
impact on the Companys financial position, results of operations, or
liquidity. Fair Value of Financial InstrumentsThe Company
believes that the fair value of its financial instruments, which include cash
and cash equivalents, accounts receivable and accounts payable, approximate
fair value. ReclassificationsCertain prior
period amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current presentation. 3 Acquisitions and Intangible Assets Acquisitions On
July 3, 2002, Sanchez completed its acquisition, by way of a plan of
arrangement the Arrangement, of all of the outstanding common shares of
Spectra, a leading provider of comprehensive wealth management solutions. Under the terms of the Arrangement, Sanchez
acquired all of the common shares of Spectra and Eclipse VII Holdings Inc., an
entity whose only asset of which was Spectra common shares, for approximately 259 million in cash net of cash acquired and including transaction costs plus 583,813 shares of Sanchez common stock with a fair value of approximately 30 million. Leading up to the
acquisition, the Company participated in arms length negotiations, performed
due diligence, obtained a fairness opinion on the valuation of
Spectra and used industry comparables to determine a purchase price. With the acquisition of
Spectra, the Company has positioned itself to be able to provide a complete
banking and brokerage platform that satisfies the industrys growing global
requirements for an integrated banking and wealth management solution. The Companys results of operations for the
year ended December 31, 2002 include the results of operations for Spectra from
July 3, 2002, the date of acquisition, through December 31, 2002. 42

2001expected dividend yield of 0%, risk-free interest rate of 263% to
450%, expected volatility of 95%, and an average expected life of five
years. 2000expected dividend yield of
0%, risk-free interest rate of 497% to 631%, expected volatility of 50%, and

The Company entered into a
consulting agreement effective November 8, 1999 under which the Company was
required to pay a total of $33 million for consulting services, plus
expenses. The services related to the
development of the SDSI business, including designing a model to scale the
business, analyzing and prioritizing target client segments and markets analyzing the Companys pricing model and designing performance metrics and
measurement processes, providing management support and vendor assessments and
certain marketing and other business development services. The fee was payable
in cash plus SDSI common stock. The
number of shares to be issued was based on the initial public offering price of
the SDSI common stock, however, SDSIs initial public offering was not
consummated by November 1, 2000 and, as a result, the consultant exercised its
right to require Sanchez to pay for the stock-based portion of the fee in
shares of Sanchez common stock.
Accordingly, in November 2000, the Company issued 181,483 shares of its
common stock to the consultant with a fair value of $28 million. Total expenses under this agreement including the cash portion, were allocated ratably to sales and marketing product development and general and administrative expense based on the
services performed under the agreement and the areas that benefited from the
services. 46 In
March 2000, the Company sold 108,590 shares of SDSI common stock for $2762 per
share to an accredited investor for cash of $3 million. In July 2000, the Company sold 108,980
shares of SDSI common stock to an SDSI customer for cash of $3 million, which
represented the fair value of the stock based on cash transactions in the same
class of stock with unrelated third-party financial investors. The Company also issued a warrant to the
customer, which enabled the customer to purchase additional shares of SDSI
common stock in the event of an SDSI public offering. There was no accounting for the warrant because there was no
measurement date prior to an SDSI public offering. Under the terms of the stock purchase agreements with the
investor and the customer, the parties had the right to require the Company to
issue shares of common stock equal to the purchase price divided by the average
market price of the Companys common stock for 15 days prior to the anniversary
of the closing. The investor exercised
their conversion rights in the first quarter of 2001 whereby the Company issued
285,827 shares of its common stock in exchange for all of the shares of SDSI
common stock held by the parties. The
customer exercised their conversion rights in the second quarter of 2001
whereby the Company issued 233,973 shares of its common stock in exchange for
all of the shares of SDSI common stock held by the parties. None of the SDSI loss for the year ended
December 31, 2000 was allocated to the minority stockholders because of their
conversion rights. 9 Income Taxes The

At December 31, 2002, the Company has a U.S.
federal net operating loss carry forward of $16 million, which is limited due
to certain ownership changes which occurred in the past three years. Additionally, the Company has net foreign
deferred tax assets of approximately $46 million at December 31, 2002, which
are comprised mainly of a net operating loss in Canada, for which a full
valuation allowance is recorded. To the
extent that these amounts are used to reduce future taxable income, such
amounts will reduce goodwill. The
Company also has net state deferred tax assets of approximately $16 million
for which a full valuation allowance is recorded as of December 31, 2002 based
on the Company estimates about future state taxable income. 10 Commitments

expense for the years ended December 31, 2002 and 2001 and 2000 was
approximately $29 million, $29 million, and $22 million, respectively. During
the year ended December 31, 2002, the Company prevailed in its arbitration
claim with 1stWebbankdirect and was awarded $17 million. In February 2001, SDSI filed for arbitration in response to 1stWebbankdirects
October 2000, termination of its processing agreement in connection with the
consolidation of its e-banking platforms.
SDSI was seeking payment
of all outstanding receivables from this customer. 1stWebbankdirect
counterclaimed and was seeking a refund of the implementation fees they paid
for the project. As a result of this settlement, the company recognized
approximately $32 million in revenues and $29 million in cost, previously
deferred in accordance with SAB No. 101 related to this client during year
ended December 31, 2002. Also
during the year ended December 31, 2002, the Company settled an outstanding
receivable dispute with an unannounced client that had been previously
disclosed in the Companys periodic filings.
As a result of this settlement, the Company recognized approximately 31 million in revenue and approximately $23 million in costs previously deferred
in accordance with SAB No. 101 related to this client during the year ended
December 31, 2002. 11 Related Party Transactions The
Company entered into an agreement in 1999 with Devon Air Services, a charter
airline company owned by Michael Sanchez, the Sanchez Chairman of the Board. During the years ending December 31, 2002 2001 and 2000, the Company incurred expenses under this agreement of $120,000 191,000 and $131,000, respectively. On
August 13, 2002, Mr. Michael Sanchez, the Companys Chairman of the Board repaid two loans and interest in full that were previously outstanding with the
Company. During 2001 and the first
quarter of 2002, the Company had made two loans to Mr. Sanchez which totaled 11 million. Mr. Sanchez was
personally liable for these loans, which were secured by collateral. The loans to Mr. Sanchez bore an interest at
a rate of 358% per annum and 273% per annum.
We were advised that Mr. Sanchez used a portion of the loan proceeds to
partially repay certain indebtedness obtained for personal purposes and secured
by his shares of Company stock. Mr. 48 Sanchezs loans from the Company were
ratified and approved by our board of directors, with Mr. Michael Sanchez and
Mr. Frank Sanchez abstaining in such actions.
Both loans were full recourse loans. On
July 3, 2002, in connection with the acquisition of Spectra, the Company loaned
Mr. John McLeod, President of the Companys Wealth Management Division approximately $314,000. This loan is
secured by the pledge of 100,000 shares of Sanchez common stock. The loan contains an interest rate as
prescribed by the Canadian Customs and Revenue Agency Base Rate. This rate shall be adjusted
quarterly to the extent such Base Rate changes. At the time of the loan the Base Rate was 3%. The loan has a term of three years
commencing July 3, 2002 with six semi-annual payments, the first of which was
due on January 3, 2003. In January
2003, Mr. McLeod made the first of his six semi-annual payments. During
2001, the Company loaned $130,000 to Mr. Todd Pittman, the Companys Chief
Financial Officer, for the purchase of Company stock. The three-year loan, for
which Mr. Pittman is personally liable, is secured by the Company stock
purchased by Mr. Pittman, and bears interest at a rate of 463% per annum. On September 30, 2002, Mr. Pittman repaid
approximately $11,000 in principal and has a balance, including interest, of 120,279 as of December 31, 2002. In
addition, Mr. Pittman made a payment of approximately $6,000 in February 2003. In
accordance with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, the Company has adopted a
policy not to grant any new loans or materially modify or extend any existing
loans to officers or directors of the Company and the audit committee must
review and approve any related party transactions involving SEC reporting
officers. 12 Profit
Sharing Trust Plan The Company maintains a
Profit Sharing Trust Plan the Plan which permits eligible participating
members to contribute up to 20% of their gross earnings. The Company will typically make a
contribution equal to 100% of the first 3% which an employee contributes subject to a statutory cap, and may also make additional voluntary
contributions. During the last five
months of 2002, the Company temporarily reduced its contributions to 100% of
the first 15% which an employee contributes.
The Company expensed $584,000, $649,000, and $531,000 related to the
Plan during the years ended December 31, 2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively. 13 Revolving Line of Credit On July 3, 2002, the Company secured a 20 million revolving line of credit.
There have been no borrowings under this facility through December 31 2002. Borrowings under the facility
bear interest at either a Base Rate Option, defined as either the prime rate or
