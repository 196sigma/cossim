CHORDIANT SOFTWARE, INC.  NOTES
TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  NOTE 1THE COMPANY
We Chordiant Software, Inc. are an enterprise software
vendor that offers software solutions for global business-to-consumer companies that seek to improve the quality of their customer interactions and to reduce costs through increased employee productivity and process efficiencies. We concentrate on
serving global customers in retail financial services, communications and consumer direct industries. We were incorporated in California in March 1991 and reincorporated in Delaware in October 1997.  We deliver a complete customer solution that includes software applications
and tools and services that enable businesses to integrate their customer information and corporate systems so that they can have an accurate, real-time view of their customers across multiple forms of customer interaction.  We believe our solutions offer great flexibility to businesses to set
business policies and processes to control the quality of servicing, fulfillment and marketing to their customers. Our solutions enable companies to control and change their business policies and processes. We believe that we are leaders in
providing business process driven solutions for customer management.  Our software solutions and architecture are based on leading industry standards that are widely adopted by business customers in the industries we serve. We believe these solutions are capable of being the foundation for contemporary
distributed computing environments required by global business-to-consumer enterprises.  We have incurred losses and negative cash flows from operating activities during each fiscal year since inception. As of September 30, 2004 we had an accumulated deficit of $1893 million. For the nine months ended
September 30, 2004, we incurred a net loss of approximately $04 million and negative cash flows from operations of approximately $44 million. Our cash balances may decline further although we believe that the effects of our strategic actions
implemented to improve revenue as well as control costs will be adequate to generate sufficient positive cash flows from operations to fund our operations. Failure to generate sufficient revenues or control spending could adversely affect our
ability to achieve our business objectives.  NOTE 2SUMMARY OF
SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES  Change in Year End  On December 29, 2004, Chordiant Softwares Board of Directors approved
a change in the Companys fiscal year end from December 31 to September 30. The nine month results now being reported by the Company relate to the transitional period ended September 30, 2004. Comparative information for the nine months ended
September 30, 2003 is included in the previously filed unaudited Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended September 30, 2003.  The following table presents certain comparative transition period financial information for the nine months ended September 30, 2004 and 2003
respectively.

Restatement  On March 14, 2005, we filed a Form 8-K announcing that the Company was restating its quarterly financial statements. As previously disclosed, on December
29, 2004, the Board of Directors of Chordiant approved a change in Chordiants fiscal year end from December 31st to September 30th, retroactive to September 30, 2004. In the course of preparing the 2004 financial results for the new fiscal
year ended September 30, 2004, the Company identified certain errors in the financial statements for the previously reported quarters and year-to-date periods ended March 31, 2004, June 30, 2004 and September 30, 2004. The Company evaluated the
errors in accordance with the quantitative and qualitative guidance set forth in Securities and Exchange Commission SEC Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 99.  On March 8, 2005, management concluded that the Company should restate the Companys financial statements for the quarters ended March 31, 2004, June
30, 2004 and September 30, 2004 due to the aggregate number of errors identified in the previously issued interim financial statements and the relative percentages represented by certain of those errors in the quarters to be restated. These errors
are primarily related to expense and revenue timing errors, the valuation of a guarantee, errors related to prepaid account balances, and errors relating to estimates used to compute stock offering costs, warrant valuations and stock based
compensation. In addition, certain auction rate securities have been reclassified from cash equivalents to short-term marketable securities. During 2004 the Company had historically classified these instruments as cash equivalents. Auction rate
securities have interest rate resets through a modified Dutch auction, at predetermined short term intervals. The Company had historically classified these instruments as cash equivalents based on the ability to liquidate the investments. At
September 30, 2004 $40 million was reclassified.  On March 10,
2005, senior management of the Company met with the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors of the Company to discuss managements conclusion. The Audit Committee concurred with managements conclusion to restate the Companys
financials for the quarters ended March 31, 2004, June 30, 2004 and September 30, 2004.  The financial information as of September 30, 2004 and for the nine months then ended, and for the unaudited periods of 2004 included herein are labeled restated as they have been revised from the amounts
previously filed with the SEC for the periods March 31, 2004, June 30, 2004 and September 30, 2004 on Form 10-Qs. We have not amended, and we do not expect to amend, our Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q for the interim quarters ended March 31,
2004, June 30, 2004 and September 30, 2004, which are affected by the Restatement. See Note 18 of the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion and presentation of the restated interim period financial statements.  Reclassifications  Certain reclassifications have been made to prior year balances to conform to the current year presentation. For balance
sheet reporting purposes, certain accounts receivable balances, principally consisting of unbilled license fees, have been netted against the corresponding deferred revenue balance. Amortization of intangibles related to developed technologies
acquired previously reported in operating expenses has been reclassified to cost of revenues. Restricted cash balances of $02 million previously included in other assets have also been reclassified. 
56 Table of Contents CHORDIANT SOFTWARE, INC.  NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTSContinued 
Principles of consolidation  The accompanying consolidated financial statements include our accounts and those of our wholly-owned subsidiaries. All
significant intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated in consolidation.  Use of estimates  The
preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities,
disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods.  On an on-going basis, we evaluate the estimates, including those related to our allowance for doubtful accounts, valuation
of goodwill and intangible assets, valuation of deferred tax assets, restructuring costs, contingencies and the estimates associated with the percentage-of-completion method of accounting for certain of our revenue contracts. We base our estimates
on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily
apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.  Cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities  The Company considers all highly liquid investments with a maturity of three months or less from their date of purchase to be cash equivalents. Highly
liquid investments with maturities greater than three months are classified as short-term marketable securities. At September 30, 2004, all of the Companys marketable securities are classified as available-for-sale. In accordance with
Statement of Financial Accounting Standards SFAS No. 115, Accounting for Certain Investments in Debt Equity Securities, available-for-sale securities are carried at fair value with unrealized gains and losses included as a separate
component of stockholders equity, net of any tax effect. Realized gains and losses and declines in value judged by management to be other than temporary on these investments are included in interest income and expense. For the purposes of
computing realized gains and losses, cost is identified on a specific identification basis. Unrealized gains and losses for the nine months ended September 30, 2004 were insignificant. At September 30, 2004 the Company had invested excess cash in
marketable securities consisting of auction rate securities. These securities have long-term underlying contracted maturities for up to thirty nine years, however the market is highly liquid and the interest rate resets every 7, 28 or 35 days.
The portfolio of marketable securities including cash and
cash equivalents consisted of the following in thousands:  September30,2004

57 Table of Contents CHORDIANT SOFTWARE, INC.  NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTSContinued 
Restricted cash  At September 30, 2004 and December 31, 2003, we had short-term investments that met the qualifications to be considered cash equivalents, except they were
restricted from withdrawal. These balances include $15 million that serves as a security deposit on a post-contract customer support transaction expiring on December 31, 2005. Accordingly, this investment was classified as a non-current asset on
the balance sheet at September 30, 2004 and December 31, 2003. At September 30, 2004 and December 31, 2003, we also had additional interest bearing certificates of deposit classified as restricted cash serving as collateral for a letters of credit
securing certain lease obligations.  September30,2004
December31,2003 Restated Restricted cashcurrent Certificates of deposit 279 226 Restricted cashnon current Certificates of deposit 2,057 2,101  Fair value of financial instruments
Our financial instruments, including cash and cash
equivalents, short-term investments, accounts receivable, accounts payable and borrowings are carried at cost, which approximates fair value because of the short-term nature of those instruments. The reported amounts of borrowings approximate fair
value because of the market value interest rates that these debts bear.  During the years ended September 30, 2004 and December 31, 2003, we did not enter into any foreign currency forward exchange contracts.  Revenue recognition  We derive revenues from licenses of our software and related services, which include assistance in implementation, customization and integration,
post-contract customer support, training and consulting. The amount and timing of our revenue is difficult to predict and any shortfall in revenue or delay in recognizing revenue could cause our operating results to vary significantly from year to
year and could result in operating losses.  At the time of
entering into a transaction, we assess whether any services included within the arrangement require us to perform significant implementation or customization essential to the functionality of our products. For contracts involving significant
implementation or customization essential to the functionality of our products, we recognize the license and professional consulting services revenues using the percentage-of-completion method using labor hours incurred as the measure of progress
towards completion as prescribed by Statement of Position SOP No. 81-1, Accounting for Performance of Construction-Type and Certain Product-Type Contracts. The progress toward completion is measured based on the
go-live date. We define the go-live date as the date the essential product functionality has been delivered or the application enters into a production environment or the point at which no significant additional Chordiant
supplied professional services resources are required. Estimates are subject to revisions as the contract progresses to completion. We account for the change in estimate when the information becomes known in the period the change was identified.
Provisions for estimated contract losses are recognized in the period in which the loss becomes probable and can be reasonably estimated. When we sell additional licenses related to the original licensing agreement, revenue is recognized 
58 Table of Contents CHORDIANT SOFTWARE, INC.  NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTSContinued 
either upon delivery if the project has reached the go-live date, or if the project has not reached the go-live date, revenue is recognized under the
percentage-of-completion method. We classify revenues from these arrangements as license and service revenues based upon the estimated fair value of each element.  On contracts for products not involving significant implementation or customization essential to the product functionality,
we recognize license revenues when there is persuasive evidence of an arrangement, the fee is fixed or determinable, collection of the fee is probable and delivery has occurred as prescribed by SOP No. 97-2, Software Revenue Recognition,
as amended.  We assess collection based on a number of factors,
including past transaction history with the customer and the credit-worthiness of the customer. We generally do not request collateral from our customers. If we determine that collection of a fee is not probable, we defer the fee and recognize
revenue at the time collection becomes probable, which is generally upon receipt of cash.  For arrangements with multiple elements, we recognize revenue for services and post-contract customer support based upon vendor specific objective evidence VSOE of fair value of the respective elements.
VSOE of fair value for the services element is based upon the standard hourly rates we charge for the services when such services are sold separately. VSOE of fair value for annual post-contract customer support is generally established with the
optional substantive stated future renewal rates included in the contracts. When contracts contain multiple elements, and VSOE of fair value exists for all undelivered elements, we account for the delivered elements, principally the license portion,
based upon the residual method as prescribed by SOP No. 98-9, Modification of SOP No. 97-2 with Respect to Certain Transactions.  In situations in which we are obligated to provide unspecified additional software products in the future, we recognize revenue as a subscription ratably
over the term of the commitment period.  For all sales we use
either a signed license agreement or a binding purchase order as evidence of an arrangement. Sales through our third party systems integrators are evidenced by a master agreement governing the relationship together with binding purchase orders on a
transaction-by-transaction basis. Revenues from reseller arrangements are recognized on the sell-through method, when the reseller reports to us the sale of our software products to end-users. Our agreements with customers and resellers
do not contain product return rights.  We recognize revenue for
post-contract customer support ratably over the support period which ranges from one to three years. Our training and consulting services revenues are recognized as such services are performed.  Concentrations of credit risk  Financial instruments that potentially subject us to concentrations of
credit risk consist of cash, cash equivalents, short-term investments, restricted cash and accounts receivable. To date, we have invested excess funds in money market accounts and marketable securities consisting of auction rate securities. We have
cash equivalents and investments with various high quality institutions domestically and internationally.  Our accounts receivable are derived from revenues earned from customers located in North America, Europe, and elsewhere in the world. We perform ongoing
credit evaluations of our customers financial condition and, generally, require no collateral from our customers. We maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts when deemed necessary. To date, bad debts have not been material and have been
within management expectations.

Costs incurred in the research and development of new
products and enhancements to existing products are charged to expense as incurred until the technological feasibility of the product or enhancement has been established. Technological feasibility of the product is determined after the completion of
a detailed program design and a determination has been made that any uncertainties related to high-risk development issues have been resolved. If the process of developing the product does not include a detail program design, technological
feasibility is determined only after completion of a working model. After establishing technological feasibility, additional development costs incurred through the date the product is available for general release to customers is capitalized and
amortized over the estimated product life.  When technological
feasibility is established through the completion of a working model the period of time between achieving technological feasibility and the general release of new products is generally short and software development costs qualifying for
capitalization are insignificant. During the quarter ended September 30, 2004, technological feasibility for an acquired banking product was established through the completion of a

detailed program design. Costs aggregating $05 million associated with this product have been capitalized and included in Other Assets as of September 30,
2004. No amortization expense relating to this product has been recorded as the product development was still in progress at September 30, 2004. Amortization in future periods will be calculated as the greater of a the ratio that current gross
revenue for the product bears to the total of current and anticipated future gross revenue for the product or b the straight-line method over the remaining estimated economic life of the product.  Property and equipment  Property and equipment are recorded at cost. Depreciation is computed using the straight-line method based upon the
estimated useful lives of assets, which range from three to seven years. Amortization of leasehold improvements is calculated using the straight-line method over the shorter of the economic life of the asset or the lease term. Purchased internal-use
software consists primarily of amounts paid for perpetual licenses to third party software applications, which are amortized over their estimated useful life, generally three years. Depreciation and amortization expense was approximately $12
million, $26 million and $38 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2004 and the years ended December 31, 2003 and 2002, respectively.  Property and equipment included approximately $05 million of assets under capital leases at September 30, 2004. Accumulated amortization under these
leases at September 30, 2004 was less than $01 million.

issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards SFAS No. 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, which was effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2001. SFAS No. 142 requires, among other things, the
discontinuance of goodwill amortization. In addition, the standard includes provisions upon adoption for the reclassification of certain existing recognized intangibles as goodwill, reassessment of the useful lives of existing recognized
intangibles, reclassification of certain intangibles out of previously reported goodwill and the testing for impairment of existing goodwill and other intangibles. As of January 1, 2002, we adopted SFAS 142 and have ceased to amortize goodwill.
61 Table of Contents CHORDIANT SOFTWARE, INC.  NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTSContinued 
We are required to perform an impairment review of our goodwill balance on at least an annual basis.
This impairment review involves a two-step process as follows:  Step 1We compare the fair value of our reporting units to the carrying value, including goodwill, of each of those units. For each reporting unit where the carrying value, including goodwill, exceeds the
units fair value, we proceed on to Step 2. If a units fair value exceeds the carrying value, no further work is performed and no impairment charge is necessary.  Step 2We perform an allocation of the fair value of the reporting unit to our identifiable tangible
and non-goodwill intangible assets and liabilities. This derives an implied fair value for the reporting units goodwill. We then compare the implied fair value of the reporting units goodwill with the carrying amount of the reporting
units goodwill. If the carrying amount of the reporting units goodwill is greater than the implied fair value of its goodwill, an impairment charge would be recognized for the excess.  We determined that we have one reporting unit. We completed our annual
goodwill impairment review for the period including September 30, 2004 and performed Step 1 of the goodwill impairment analysis required by SFAS No. 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, and concluded that goodwill was not impaired
as of September 30, 2004 using the methodology described above. Accordingly, Step 2 was not performed. We will continue to test for impairment on an annual basis and on an interim basis if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more
likely than not reduce the fair value of our reporting units below their carrying amount.  Intangible assets  Purchased technology and other identifiable intangible assets are carried at cost less accumulated amortization. The Company amortizes other identifiable intangibles on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives. The range of
estimated useful lives on the Companys identifiable intangibles is one to three years refer to Note 5. Acquired in-process technology is expensed during the period of acquisition.  We account for finite-lived intangibles and long-lived assets in accordance with SFAS No. 144, Accounting for the
Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets. Under this standard, the Company reviews finite-lived intangibles or long-lived assets to be held and used for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value
of such assets may not be recoverable. Factors which are considered important that could trigger an impairment include, but are not limited to, the following:  Significant underperformance relative to expected historical or projected future operating results;  Significant changes in the manner of our use of the acquired assets or the strategy for our overall business;  Significant negative industry or economic trends;  Significant decline in our stock price for a sustained period;  Market capitalization relative to net book value; and  A current expectation that, more likely than not, a long-lived asset will be sold or otherwise disposed of significantly before the end of its previously estimated useful life.
Based upon the existence of one or more of the
above indicators of impairment, we measure impairment based on a projected discounted cash flow method using a discount rate determined by our management to be commensurate with the risk inherent in our current business model.

Royalties  We have certain royalty commitments associated with the shipment and licensing of certain products. Royalty expense is generally based on a percentage of
the underlying revenue. Royalty expense was approximately $13 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2004 and $14 million and $16 million for the years ended December 31, 2003 and 2002, respectively.  Accrued expenses  Accrued expenses consist of the following in thousands:  September30,2004

Advertising costs are charged to sales and marketing expense as incurred.
Advertising costs for the nine months ended September 30, 2004 and for the years ended December 31, 2003, and 2002 totaled approximately $01 million, $02 million and $13 million, respectively.  Stock-based compensation  We account for stock-based employee compensation arrangements in accordance
with provisions of Accounting Principles Board Opinion APB No. 25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees, FASB Interpretation No. 44 FIN 44, Accounting for Certain Transactions Involving Stock Based
Compensationan Interpretation of APB No. 25, and related interpretations and comply with the disclosure provisions of SFAS No. 123, Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation. Under APB No. 25 and FIN 44, compensation expense is
based on the difference, if any, on the date of the grant, between the fair value of our stock and the exercise price of the stock option being granted. Stock-based compensation is amortized in accordance with FIN 28 using the multiple option
approach. SFAS No. 123 defines a fair value based method of accounting for an employee stock option or similar equity instrument.  We account for equity instruments issued to non-employees in accordance with the provisions of SFAS No. 123 and EITF Issue No. 96-18, Accounting for
Equity Instruments That Are Issued to Other Than Employees for Acquiring, or in Conjunction with Selling Goods or Services.  We have adopted the disclosure requirements of SFAS No. 148, Accounting for Stock-Based CompensationTransition and Disclosure during the
quarter ended March 31, 2003. SFAS No. 148 amends SFAS No. 123, Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation, to provide alternative methods of transition for a voluntary change to the fair value based method of accounting for stock-based
compensation and also amends the disclosure requirements of SFAS 123 to require prominent disclosures in both annual and interim financial statements about the methods of accounting for stock-based employee compensation and the effect of the method
used on reported results. As permitted by SFAS 148 and SFAS 123, we continue to apply the accounting 
63 Table of Contents CHORDIANT SOFTWARE, INC.  NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTSContinued 
provisions of APB Opinion No. 25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees. We generally grant stock options at exercise prices equal to the fair
market value of the underlying stock on the date of grant and, therefore, under APB Opinion No. 25, no compensation expense is recognized in the statements of operations. Had we recorded compensation expense based on the estimated grant date fair
value, as defined by SFAS No. 123, for awards granted under our stock option plans and stock purchase plan, our net loss and loss per share would have been increased to the pro forma amounts below in thousands, except per share amounts:

purchase plan during the nine months ended September 30, 2004 and years ended December 31, 2003 and 2002 was $038, $032 and $111, respectively.  Because the determination of the fair value of all options granted after we became a public entity includes an expected volatility factor in addition to
the other factors described in the table above and because additional option grants are expected to be made each year, the above pro forma disclosures are not representative of the pro forma effects of option grants on reported results for future

The functional currency of our foreign entities is their
respective local currency. Foreign currency assets and liabilities are translated at the current exchange rates at each balance sheet date. Revenues and expenses are translated at weighted average exchange rates in effect during the year. The
related unrealized gains and losses from foreign currency translation are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income loss as a separate component of stockholders equity. Net gains and losses resulting from foreign exchange
transactions are included in other income, net and have not been significant for all periods presented.  Income taxes  Income
taxes are accounted for using an asset and liability approach, which requires the recognition of taxes payable or refundable for the current period and deferred tax liabilities and assets for the future tax consequences of events that have been
recognized in our financial statements or tax returns. The measurement of current and deferred tax liabilities and assets is based on provisions of the enacted tax law; the effects of future changes in tax laws or rates are not anticipated. The
measurement of deferred tax assets is reduced, if necessary, by the amount of any tax benefits that, based on available evidence, are not expected to be realized.  Net loss per share  Basic and diluted net loss per share is computed by dividing the net loss for the period by the weighted average number of shares of common stock
outstanding during the period excluding common stock subject to repurchase. The calculation of diluted net loss per share excludes potential common shares as their effect is anti-dilutive. Potential common shares consist of common shares issuable
upon the exercise of stock options, warrants using the treasury stock method and restricted stock.

PRONOUNCEMENTS  In December 2004, the Financial Accounting
Standards Board FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards SFAS No. 123 Revised 2004, Share-Based Payment SFAS 123R. This standard requires expensing of stock options and other
share-based payments and supersedes SFAS No. 123, which had allowed companies to choose between expensing stock options or showing proforma disclosure only. This standard is effective for the Company as of July 1, 2005 and will apply to all awards
granted, modified, cancelled or repurchased after that date as well as the unvested portion of prior awards. The Company will adopt the standard as of the effective date and it is expected to have a material effect on the financial statements.
In April 2004, the Emerging Issues Task Force
EITF issued Statement No. 03-06 Participating Securities and the Two-Class Method Under FASB Statement No. 128, Earnings Per Share EITF 03-06. EITF 03-06 addresses a number of questions regarding the
computation of earnings per share by companies that have issued securities other than common stock that contractually entitle the holder to participate in dividends and earnings of the company when, and if, it declares dividends on its common stock.
The issue also provides further guidance in applying the two-class method of calculating earnings per share, clarifying what constitutes a participating security and how to apply the two-class method of computing earnings per share once it is
determined that a security is participating, including how to allocate undistributed earnings to such a security. EITF 03-06 is effective for fiscal periods beginning after March 31, 2004. The adoption of this statement did not have any effect on
the Companys calculation of EPS. 
66 Table of Contents CHORDIANT SOFTWARE, INC.  NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTSContinued 
In December 2004, the FASB issued SFAS No. 153 FAS 153, Exchange of Nonmonetary Assets an
amendment of APB Opinion No. 29, which amends Opinion 29 to eliminate the exception for nonmonetary exchanges of similar productive assets and replaces it with a general exception for exchanges of nonmonetary assets that do not have commercial
substance. FAS 153 defines a nonmonetary exchange as having commercial substance if the future cash flows of the entity are expected to change significantly as a result of the exchange. This Statement is effective for nonmonetary asset exchanges
occurring in fiscal periods beginning after June 15, 2005 and shall be applied prospectively. The Company will adopt FAS 153 in fiscal 2005 and its adoption is not expected to have a material effect on the Companys financial position or
financial statements.  In December 2004, the FASB issued FASB
Staff Position No. FAS 109-2 FAS 109-2, Accounting and Disclosure Guidance for the Foreign Earnings Repatriation Provision within the American Jobs Creations Act of 2004. FAS 109-2 provides guidance under FASB Statement No.
109, Accounting for Income Taxes, with respect to recording the potential impact of the repatriation provisions of the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004 the Jobs Act on enterprises income tax expense and deferred tax
liability. The Jobs Act was enacted on October 22, 2004. FAS 109-2 states that an enterprise is allowed time beyond the financial reporting period of enactment to evaluate the effect of the Jobs Act on its plan for reinvestment or repatriation of
foreign earnings for purposes of applying FASB Statement No. 109. The Company has not yet completed evaluating the impact of the repatriation provisions, however it does not anticipate the adoption will have a material impact on its consolidated
financial statements.  In March 2004, the FASB issued EITF
Issue No. 03-1 EITF 03-1, The Meaning of Other-Than-Temporary Impairment and Its Application to Certain Investments which provided new guidance for assessing impairment losses on investments. Additionally, EITF 03-1
includes new disclosure requirements for investments that are deemed to be temporarily impaired. In September 2004, the FASB delayed the accounting provisions of EITF 03-1; however the disclosure requirements remain effective for annual periods
ending after June 15, 2004. The Company will evaluate the impact of EITF 03-1 once final guidance is issued, however it does not anticipate the adoption will have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements.  NOTE 4ACQUISITIONS  During 2002 and 2001, we completed the following acquisitions that were
accounted for using the purchase method of accounting:  On April 1, 2002, we acquired OnDemand a provider of relationship management software located in Palo Alto, California.  On May 29, 2001, we acquired certain intellectual property assets and technology of the AoNet J2EE Workflow Server from ASP Outfitter, Inc.  On May 17, 2001, we acquired certain assets associated with the Dialog Server product suite from ActionPoint, Inc., as a result of which certain members of the Dialog Server
development, support, sales and marketing team from ActionPoint became our employees.  On March 27, 2001, we acquired Prime Response, Inc., an integrated marketing software solutions company headquartered in Boston, MA.

The value of the purchased in-process research and development was determined by estimating the
projected net cash flows related to the product under development, determined based upon our estimates of costs to complete the development of the technology and the future revenue to be earned upon commercialization of the products. The estimated
stage of completion expressed as a percentage of completion was calculated and then applied to the net cash flow for the product. Discount rates of 30%, 40%, 25% and 35% were applied to the projected cash flows of the in-process research and
development to determine their net present value for the OnDemand, ASP Outfitter AoNet, ActionPoint Dialog Server and Prime Response products under development, respectively. OnDemands in-process research and development efforts consisted
of one project for which the estimated state of completion was approximately 25%. In-process research and development efforts associated with the acquisition from ASP Outfitter consisted of one project for which the estimated state of completion was
approximately 50%. In-process research and development efforts associated with the Dialog Server assets acquired from ActionPoint consisted of one project for which the estimated state of completion was approximately 75%. Prime Responses
in-process research and development efforts consisted of three projects for which the estimated states of completion were approximately 47%, 21% and 79%. The value attributed to in-process research and development was charged to expense in the
period the acquisitions were consummated. The in-process research and development efforts from all of the above 2002 and 2001 acquisitions were completed as of December 31, 2003 and no significant developments occurred that resulted in material
changes to the original assumptions used to record the acquisitions.  The value allocated to the assembled workforce was determined by estimating the cost involved in assembling a new workforce including costs of salaries, benefits, training and recruiting. Workforce in place is amortized on a straight-line
basis over the estimated period of benefit, which is between two and three years. On January 1, 2002, we reclassified the value allocated to workforce in place along with its related accumulated amortization to existing goodwill in accordance with
SFAS 142 See Note 5.  The excess of purchase price over
tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed was recorded as goodwill and was being amortized over a three year period on a straight-line basis. Beginning on January 1, 2002, our unamortized balance of goodwill was no
longer amortized, but will continue to be subject to a periodic impairment assessment in accordance with SFAS 142 See Note 5.  The following unaudited pro forma consolidated financial information reflects the results of operations for the year ended December 31, 2002, as if the
acquisition of OnDemand had occurred at the beginning of 2002, after giving effect to purchase accounting adjustments. These pro forma results have been prepared for comparative purposes only, do not purport to be indicative of what operating

69 Table of Contents CHORDIANT SOFTWARE, INC.  NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTSContinued 
also requires purchased intangible assets other than goodwill to be amortized over their useful lives unless these lives are determined to be indefinite. We
ceased amortizing goodwill totaling approximately $207 million as of the beginning of fiscal 2002. Our purchase of OnDemand increased our goodwill by $42 million to $249 million at December 31, 2002.  There were no changes in the carrying amount of goodwill for the nine months
ended September 30, 2004 or for the year ended December 31, 2003.  The components of intangible assets, excluding goodwill, are as follows in thousands:  September 30, 2004

September 30, 2004 and the years ended December 31, 2003 and 2002, respectively. Estimated future amortization expense related to existing intangible assets is $02 million in 2005, at which time the assets will be fully amortized.  NOTE 6RESTRUCTURING  Restructuring Costs  During the nine months ended September 30, 2004, we announced plans to reallocate staff between our North American and
European operations in order to better support our growth in North America. This restructuring plan included a reduction in workforce.  During fiscal years 2003 and 2002, based upon our continued evaluation of economic conditions in the information technology industry and our expectations
regarding revenue levels, we restructured several areas of the Company to reduce expenses and improve our revenue per employee. This restructuring program included a worldwide workforce reduction and consolidation of excess facilities and certain
business functions. We believe that these reductions and realignments have resulted and will continue to result in a more responsive management structure.  We aligned our research and development spending with anticipated revenues in 2002 and 2003 after consolidating five acquisitions and integrating the
various technologies into Chordiant solutions. We anticipate that we will continue to devote adequate resources to develop new products and new versions of Chordiant solutions. 
70 Table of Contents CHORDIANT SOFTWARE, INC.  NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTSContinued 
We also aligned our sales and marketing resources and expense levels with anticipated revenues as we
entered fiscal year 2003. We made decisions to abandon certain vertical markets and focus our sales and marketing resources with our business alliance partners in particular vertical markets such as retail banking, insurance, consumer financial
services, telecommunications and consumer direct industries.  As part of the fiscal year 2003 restructuring, we entered into an agreement with Ness Technologies Inc., Ness Global Services, Inc. and Ness Technologies India, Ltd. collectively, Ness, effective December 15, 2003 wherein Ness
will provide our customers with technical product support through a worldwide 24x7 help desk facility, a sustaining engineering function which serves as the interface between technical product support and our internal engineering organization,
product testing services, and product development services collectively, the Services. The agreement has an initial term of three years and may be extended for additional one year terms at our discretion. Under the terms of the
agreement, we pay for services rendered on a monthly fee basis, including the requirement to reimburse Ness for approved out-of-pocket expenses. The agreement may be terminated for convenience by the Company, subject to the payment of a termination
fee that declines over time. At September 30, 2004 the estimated fee was $04 million. The maximum termination fee is initially equal to three months of fees, declining to zero after 30 months.  In fiscal year 2004, we significantly increased our activity with Ness as we
were reducing our workforce. Severance costs associated with the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2003 employee reductions were accounted for in accordance with SFAS No. 112, Employers Accounting for Post-Employment Benefits. Other
one-time benefit arrangements are accounted for in accordance with SFAS No. 146, Accounting for Costs Associated with Exit or Disposal Activities. 
Workforce reduction  During the nine months ended September 30, 2004, we recorded a workforce reduction expense of $02 million relating to severance and benefits. 
The restructuring program implemented during the years ended December 31,
2003 and 2002 resulted in the reduction of 74 and 108 regular employees, respectively. All areas of the Company were affected by these restructurings. We recorded a total workforce reduction expense relating to severance and benefits of
approximately $20 million and $38 million for years ended December 31, 2003 and 2002, respectively.  Consolidation of excess facilities  We accrued lease costs related to excess facilities of $02 million and $28 million during the years ended December 31, 2003 and December 31, 2002, respectively, pertaining to the consolidation of excess facilities
relating to lease terminations and non-cancelable lease costs. This expense included estimated sub-lease income based on current comparable rates for leases in the respective markets. If facilities rental rates continue to decrease in these markets
or if it takes longer than expected to sublease these facilities, the maximum amount by which the actual loss could exceed the original estimate is approximately $13 million.

Provision adjustments relate to a changes in estimates.  As of September 30, 2004, $34 million related to the restructuring reserve is included in the accrued expenses line item on the balance sheet. Amounts
related to net lease expenses due to the consolidation of facilities are payable over the lease terms through fiscal 2011. However, management will seek ways to exit the facilities earlier if economically feasible. Included in the facilities reserve
is a note payable associated with the buyout of an office lease located in New York city. The amount of the note payable is $02 million and it is payable through quarterly installments through June 2011. The remaining accrual primarily relates to
the termination and/or sublease of our excess facilities and to severance and other benefits for impacted employees.  NOTE 7RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS  In January 2004, Samuel T. Spadafora, one of our directors and executive officers, acquired 155,481 shares of common stock of the Company upon exercise of
options. The aggregate amount paid to the Company upon exercise was $01 million.  During 2002, two of our executives exercised 285,000 stock options in exchange for notes receivable the Notes of $05 million. The Notes were full-recourse collateralized by the underlying stock. The
Notes were due in February and March 2003 and accrued interest between 60% and 65% per annum, which was deemed market rates for the individuals. Both notes were paid in full during the quarter ended March 31, 2003.  In 1999, two former executives exercised 288,000 stock options covering an
aggregate of 288,000 shares of our common stock in exchange for notes receivables in the amount of $04 million and $01 million. The notes were full-recourse collateralized by the underlying stock. The notes were assessed by us to be fully
collectible, based on our understanding of the financial standing of the individuals. We perform periodic reviews of the recoverability of our outstanding notes receivables. In 2002, we determined that collection of these two notes was no longer
probable although we would still actively pursue collection of both notes. As a result, we recorded an impairment charge of $05 million as stock compensation expense. In December 2003, we were successful in obtaining a payment of $04 million from
one former executive for his outstanding note receivable plus interest. The principal portion was $04 million of the total payment and was recorded as a credit to compensation expense. 
72 Table of Contents CHORDIANT SOFTWARE, INC.  NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTSContinued 
NOTE 8BORROWINGS  Notes payable  Borrowings consisted of several notes payable for equipment leases assumed by Chordiant upon the acquisition of OnDemand. Interest rates ranged from
1286% to 1561%. We paid off all outstanding note payable balances in December 2003.  Revolving line of credit  Our two-year line of
credit with Comerica Bank, effective from March 28, 2003, is comprised of a $50 million accounts receivable line and a $25 million equipment line. The terms of the line of credit require us to maintain a minimum of $5 million in Comerica Bank
accounts at all times, a minimum quick ratio of 200 to 100, a tangible net worth of at least $150 million plus 60% of the proceeds of any equity offerings and subordinated debt issuances subsequent to the effective date of the line of credit
agreement, and certain other covenants. All assets of the Company have been pledged as collateral on the credit facility. As of September 30, 2004 the Company was in compliance with the respective debt covenants, with the exception of filing its
Forms 10-Q and 10-K within time periods prescribed by the bank. The Company obtained a waiver relating to this covenant.  The accounts receivable line of credit contains a provision for a sub-limit of up to $20 million for issuances of standby commercial letters of credit.
As of September 30, 2004, we had utilized $11 million of the $20 million standby commercial letter of credit limit of which $07 million serves as collateral for computer equipment leases for our outsourcing partner in India see Note 9. The
accounts receivable line of credit also contains a provision for a sub-limit of up to $20 million for issuance of foreign exchange forward contracts. As of September 30, 2004, we had not entered into any foreign exchange forward contracts.
Borrowings under the accounts receivable line of credit bear
interest at the lending banks prime rate plus 05%. Advances are available on a non-formula basis up to $20 million non-formula portion; however, if advances exceed $20 million, then subsequent advances cannot exceed 80% of eligible
accounts receivable balances, and the bank would hold a security interest in those accounts receivable. As of September 30, 2004, there was no outstanding balance on our accounts receivable line of credit.  Borrowings under the $25 million equipment line bear interest at the lending
banks prime rate plus 10%, and the bank would hold a security interest in the equipment. In March 2003, we borrowed $25 million against the equipment line of credit. We paid off the outstanding line of credit balance in December 2003. As of
September 30, 2004 there was no outstanding balance on our equipment line of credit and the ability to use the line to purchase equipment had expired.

NOTE 9COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES  We lease our facilities and some equipment under non-cancelable operating leases that expire on various dates through 2011.
Rent expense is recognized ratably over the lease term. In addition, the Company has entered into non-cancelable capital leases having expiration dates through 2007. Future minimum lease payments as of September 30, 2004 are as follows in

nine months ended September 30, 2004 and for the years ended December 31, 2003 and 2002 totaled $19 million, $28 million and $29 million, respectively. Certain operating leases included in the table above are part of our restructuring activities
and lease payments on such leases are charged against the restructuring accrual.  In conjunction with our agreement with Ness see Note 6, Ness may procure equipment to be used in performance of the Services, either through leasing arrangements or direct cash purchases, for which we are obligated
under the agreement to reimburse them. In connection with the procurement of equipment, Ness Technologies India has entered into a 36 month equipment lease agreement with IBM India and, in connection with the lease agreement we have issued a standby
letter of credit in the amount of $07 million in guarantee of Ness Technologies India, Ltds financial commitments under the lease. Over the term of the lease, our obligation to reimburse Ness is approximately equal to the amount of the
guarantee.  We have evaluated the obligation under the standby
letter of credit and, pursuant to the requirements as set forth under FASB Interpretation No. 45, Guarantors Accounting and Disclosure Requirements for Guarantees, Including Indirect Guarantees of Indebtedness of Others, a $01 million
liability equal to the estimated fair value of the guarantee was recorded at September 30, 2004.  Indemnification  As
permitted under Delaware law, we have agreements whereby we indemnify our officers, directors and certain employees for certain events or occurrences while the employee, officer or director is, or was serving, at our request in such capacity. The
term of the indemnification period is for the officers or directors lifetime. The maximum potential amount of future payments we could be required to make under these indemnification agreements is unlimited; however, we have a Director
and Officer insurance policy that limits our exposure and 
74 Table of Contents CHORDIANT SOFTWARE, INC.  NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTSContinued 
may enable us to recover a portion of any future amounts paid. As a result of our insurance policy coverage, we believe the estimated fair value of these
indemnification agreements is minimal. Accordingly, we have no liabilities recorded for these agreements as of September 30, 2004.  We enter into standard indemnification agreements in our ordinary course of business. Pursuant to these agreements, we indemnify, defend, hold harmless,
and agree to reimburse the indemnified party for losses suffered or incurred by the indemnified party, generally our business partners or customers, in connection with any patent, copyright or other intellectual property infringement claim by any
third party with respect to our products. The term of these indemnification agreements is generally perpetual after execution of the agreement. The maximum potential amount of future payments we could be required to make under these indemnification
agreements is unlimited. We have never incurred costs to defend lawsuits or settle claims related to these indemnification agreements. As a result, we believe the estimated fair value of these agreements is minimal. Accordingly, we have no
liabilities recorded for these agreements as of September 30, 2004.  We enter into arrangements with our business partners, whereby the business partner agrees to provide services as a subcontractor for our implementations. We may, at our discretion and in the ordinary course of business, subcontract the
performance of any of our services. Accordingly, we enter into standard indemnification agreements with our customers, whereby we indemnify them for other acts, such as personal property damage, of our subcontractors. The maximum potential amount of
future payments we could be required to make under these indemnification agreements is unlimited; however, we have general and umbrella insurance policies that may enable us to recover a portion of any amounts paid. We have not incurred significant
costs to defend lawsuits or settle claims related to these indemnification agreements. As a result, we believe the estimated fair value of these agreements is minimal. Accordingly, we have no liabilities recorded for these agreements as of September
30, 2004.  When, as part of an acquisition, we acquire all of
the stock or all of the assets and liabilities of a company, we may assume the liability for certain events or occurrences that took place prior to the date of acquisition. The maximum potential amount of future payments we could be required to make
for such obligations is undeterminable at this time. All of these obligations were grandfathered under the provisions of FIN 45 as they were in effect prior to March 31, 2003. Accordingly, we have no amounts recorded for these contingent liabilities
as of September 30, 2004.  We warrant that our software
products will perform in all material respects in accordance with our standard published specifications and documentation in effect at the time of delivery of the licensed products to the customer for a specified period of time. Additionally, we
warrant that our maintenance and consulting services will be performed consistent with generally accepted industry standards. If necessary, we would provide for the estimated cost of product and service warranties based on specific warranty claims
and claim history, however, we have not incurred significant expense under our product or services warranties to date. As a result, we believe the estimated fair value on these warranties is minimal. Accordingly, we have no amounts recorded for
these contingent liabilities as of September 30, 2004.  NOTE
10LITIGATION  Beginning in July 2001, we and certain
of our officers and directors Individuals were named as defendants in a series of class action shareholder complaints filed in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York, now consolidated under the caption,
In re Chordiant Software, Inc. Initial Public Offering Securities Litigation, Case No. 01-CV-6222. In the amended complaint, filed in April 2002, the plaintiffs allege that we, the Individuals, and the underwriters of our initial public offering
IPO violated 
75 Table of Contents CHORDIANT SOFTWARE, INC.  NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTSContinued 
section 11 of the Securities Act of 1933 and section 10b of the Exchange Act of 1934 based on allegations that the our registration statement and
prospectus failed to disclose material facts regarding the compensation to be received by, and the stock allocation practices of, our IPO underwriters. The complaint also contains claims against the Individuals for control person liability under
Securities Act section 15 and Exchange Act section 20. The plaintiffs seek unspecified monetary damages and other relief. Similar complaints were filed in the same court against hundreds of other public companies Issuers that conducted
IPOs of their common stock in the late 1990s or in the year 2000 collectively, the IPO Lawsuits.  In August 2001, all of the IPO Lawsuits were consolidated for pretrial purposes before United States Judge Shira Scheindlin of the Southern District of
New York. In July 2002, we joined in a global motion to dismiss the IPO Lawsuits filed by all of the Issuers among others. In October 2002, the Court entered an order dismissing the Individuals from the IPO Cases without prejudice, pursuant to an
agreement tolling the statute of limitations with respect to the Individuals. In February 2003, the court issued a decision denying the motion to dismiss the Section 11 claims against Chordiant and almost all of the other Issuers and denying the
motion to dismiss the Section 10b claims against Chordiant and many of the Issuers.  In June 2003, Issuers and plaintiffs reached a tentative settlement agreement that would, among other things, result in the dismissal with prejudice of all claims against the Issuers and Individuals in the IPO
Lawsuits, and the assignment to plaintiffs of certain potential claims that the Issuers may have against the underwriters. The tentative settlement also provides that, in the event that plaintiffs ultimately recover less than a guaranteed sum of $1
billion from the IPO underwriters, plaintiffs would be entitled to payment by each participating Issuers insurer of a pro rata share of any shortfall in the plaintiffs guaranteed recovery. In September 2003, in connection with the
possible settlement, those Individuals who had entered tolling agreements with plaintiffs described above agreed to extend those agreements so that they would not expire prior to any settlement being finalized. In June 2004, Chordiant and almost
all of the other issuers entered into a formal settlement agreement with the plaintiffs. On February 15, 2005, the Court issued a decision certifying a class action for settlement purposes, and granting preliminary approval of the settlement subject
to modification of certain bar orders contemplated by the settlement. In addition, the settlement is still subject to statutory notice requirements as well as final judicial approval. This action may divert the efforts and attention of our
management and, if determined adversely to us, could have a material impact on our business, results of operations, financial condition or cash flows.  A former sales employee of the Companys subsidiary in France filed a lawsuit against the Company claiming his termination was an unfair dismissal.
The former employee offered to settle his claims against the Company in return for the Companys payment of 75,000. The Company estimates that its range of possible loss is from no loss to the full amount the court could award the
plaintiff. The Company believes it has valid defenses for such claims and intends to vigorously defend itself in the matter.  In March 2005, the Company settled an employment litigation claim in the amount of $50,000. This amount was accrued for at September 30, 2004. 
We are also subject to various other claims and legal actions arising in
the ordinary course of business. The ultimate disposition of these various other claims and legal actions is not expected to have a material effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. However, litigation is
subject to inherent uncertainties.

NOTE 11INCOME TAXES  The components of net loss before taxes are as follows in thousands:  September30,2004 December 31 2003 2002 Restated United States 13,448 13,725 26,668 Foreign 13,447 2,128 5,503 1 15,853 32,171  Our provision for
income taxes was $04 million, $06 million and $02 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2004 and for the years ended December 31, 2003 and 2002, respectively. The decrease in the provision for the nine months ended September 30, 2004
when compared to fiscal year 2003 is due to a decrease in state tax expense resulting from a greater portion of state earnings being taxed in jurisdictions with lower tax rates. The increase in the provision for fiscal year 2003 when compared to
fiscal year 2002 was due to an increase in earnings from our foreign subsidiaries.  Deferred tax assets consist of the following in thousands:  September30,2004 December31,2003 Restated Net operating loss carryforwards 52,666 49,544 Accrued expenses and provisions 2,982 2,444 Tax credit carryforwards 6,665 6,910 Deferred revenue 3,056 895 Depreciation and amortization 2,723 8,036 Gross deferred tax assets 62,646 67,829 Deferred tax valuation allowance 62,646 67,829 Net deferred tax assets    The valuation
allowance decreased by $52 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2004, and increased $27 million and $72 million and for the years ended December 31, 2003 and 2002, respectively.  We provide a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets when it is more
likely than not that the net deferred tax assets will not be realized. Based on a number of factors, including the lack of a history of profits, future projected taxable income and the fact that the market in which we compete is intensely
competitive and characterized by rapidly changing technology, we believe that there is sufficient uncertainty regarding the realization of deferred tax assets such that a full valuation allowance has been provided. At September 30, 2004, we had
approximately $1502 million and $264 million of net operating loss carryforwards for federal and state purposes, respectively. Approximately $330 million of the net operating loss carryforwards, representing net operating loss carryforwards
acquired through our acquisition of Prime Response, are subject to change in control limitations, and, if utilized beyond such limitations will reduce goodwill and intangibles recorded at the date of acquisition before reducing the tax provision.
Approximately $34 million of the net our operating loss carryforwards are related to stock option deductions which, if utilized, will be accounted for as an addition to equity rather than as a reduction of the provision for income taxes. These
carryforwards are available to offset future federal and state taxable income and begin to expire in 2010 and 2004, respectively. At September 30, 
77 Table of Contents CHORDIANT SOFTWARE, INC.  NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTSContinued 
2004, there are approximately $31 million of federal credits that begin to expire in 2010. The California state credits of approximately $35 million do not
expire.  Under the Tax Reform Act of 1986, the amounts of and
the benefit from net operating losses that can be carried forward may be impaired or limited in certain circumstances. Events that may cause limitations in the utilization of net operating losses include a cumulative stock ownership change of more
than 50% over a three-year period and other events. We have not yet determined whether or not operating loss benefits are impaired or limited.  The provision for income taxes differs from the amount computed by applying the statutory federal income tax as follows in thousands:   Years Ended December 31 2003 2002 Restated Book loss 1 15,853 32,171 Federal 4,804 10,938 State 110 911 1,930 Goodwill Stock-based compensation 121 2,938 1,192 RD 1,403 In process RD 339 Other 53 142 120 Foreign tax 295 211 150 Valuation allowance 105 2,974 12,620 Provision for income taxes 442 550 150  NOTE 12COMMON STOCK
In January 2004, we sold 4,854,368 shares of our common
stock to Acqua Wellington Opportunity I Limited for an aggregate purchase price of approximately $250 million which will be used for working capital and other general corporate purposes.  During 2002, we sold 479,100 shares of our common stock to Canadian Imperial Holdings, Inc. for an aggregate purchase price
of $30 million for which the principal purpose of the offering was for working capital and other general corporate purposes.  There were no repurchases of our common stock during the nine months ended September 30, 2004 and the fiscal year ended December 31, 2003. Cancellations
of issued but unvested restricted stock were 235,000 and 640,000 during the nine months ended September 30, 2004 and the year ended December 31, 2003, respectively.  NOTE 13STOCK OPTION EXCHANGE  On August 23, 2002, we implemented a stock option exchange program the Program. Under the Program, holders of outstanding options with an
exercise price of $300 or greater per share the Eligible Options were given the choice of retaining their options or canceling the options in exchange for i restricted 
78 Table of Contents CHORDIANT SOFTWARE, INC.  NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTSContinued 
shares of common stock Restricted Stock to be issued as soon as possible after the expiration of the Program period and/or ii replacement
options issuable six 6 months and one 1 day following the cancellation of the Program Replacement Options at the closing market price on that date. The Program, as amended, also provided our Chief Executive Officer and Chief
Financial Officer of the Company, if they participated in the Program, with a Separate Restricted Stock Agreement the CEO and CFO Agreement, which includes specific vesting provisions based on achieving certain financial performance
goals. There were 11,668,875 options subject to the Program, which closed on October 9, 2002.  Employees tendered 8,109,640 stock options and received 2,780,967 shares of Restricted Stock pursuant to the Program. In addition, employees tendered 672,948 stock options, which were cancelled and to the extent an
employee was still with the Company were replaced six 6 months and one 1 day following the expiration of the Program. The tendered stock options represented approximately 59% of our total outstanding stock options as of the expiration date of
the Program. In addition, in October 2002, we issued 3,706,745 shares of Restricted Stock to our employees residing in the United Kingdom, including to our Chief Executive Officer. The Restricted Stock issued to our Chief Executive Officer is
subject to the CEO and CFO Agreement. In November 2003, our then acting Chief Financial Officer left our employ and, as a result, the Company is no longer subject to stock-based compensation expense related to the vesting of his restricted stock. In
connection with the termination, we accelerated the vesting of 154,723 shares of restricted stock resulting in a compensation expense of $06 million.  The Program has been accounted for under the guidance of Emerging Issues Task Force EITF Issue No. 00-23, Issues Related to the Accounting for
Stock Compensation under APB Opinion No. 25, and Interpretation No. 44, Accounting for Certain Transactions Involving Stock Compensationan Interpretation of APB Opinion No. 25. Because we offered to cancel existing fixed
stock options in exchange for a grant of restricted stock, the Eligible Options became subject to variable accounting treatment at the commencement date of the Program and for those options that are retained by employees because the offer was
declined, variable accounting will continue until the awards are exercised, forfeited or expire. A total of 2,886,287 Eligible Options that were not tendered will remain subject to variable accounting. For the nine months ended September 30, 2004
and the year ended December 31, 2003, $04 and $84 million was recorded as stock-based compensation benefit expense, respectively. The remaining unearned stock-based compensation expense amounted to approximately $15 million at December 31,
2003. The compensation expense on variable options will be re-measured at the end of each operating period until the options are exercised, forfeited or have expired. Depending upon movements in the market value of our common stock, this accounting
treatment may result in significant additional stock-based compensation charges or benefits in future periods.  As part of the Program implemented in 2002, we issued 499,068 replacement options at the current market value of $088 per share on April 11, 2003 to
employees.  NOTE 14STOCK OPTION PLANS  1999 Equity Incentive Plan  Our 1999 Equity Incentive Plan the 1999 Plan provides for the
grant to employees of incentive stock options within the meaning of Section 422 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 and for grants to employees, directors and consultants of nonstatutory stock options and stock purchase rights. Unless terminated
sooner, the 1999 Plan will terminate automatically in 2009. A total of 20,000,000 shares of Common Stock have been reserved for issuance under the 1999 Plan. The 1999 Plan is administered by the Board of Directors, or a committee of the Board of
Directors to which it has delegated this power, and provides generally that the option price shall not be less than the fair market value of the shares on the date of grant and that no portion may be exercised beyond ten years from that date. Under
the 1999 Plan, stock options vest over a period that is limited to 
79 Table of Contents CHORDIANT SOFTWARE, INC.  NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTSContinued 
five years, but are typically granted with a four-year vesting period. Each option outstanding under the 1999 Plan may be exercised in whole or in part at
any time. Exercised but unvested shares are subject to repurchase by us at the initial exercise price.  1999 Non-Employee Directors Option Plan  In November 1999, the 1999 Non-Employee Director Stock Option Plan was adopted by the Board of Directors and became effective on the date of the initial public offering. The Non-Employee Director Stock Option Plan
provides for the automatic grant of a nonstatutory option to purchase 25,000 shares of Common Stock to each new non-employee director who becomes a director after the date of our initial public offering on the date that such person becomes a
director. Each current and future non-employee director will automatically be granted an additional nonstatutory option to purchase 7,500 shares on the day after each of our annual meetings of the stockholders. Each director who is a member of a
board committee will automatically be granted an additional nonstatutory option to purchase 5,000 shares on the day after each of our annual meetings of the stockholders. A total of 1,168,000 shares of Common Stock have been reserved for issuance
under the director plan. The amount reserved under the 1999 Non-Employee Stock Option Plan automatically increases on October 1st of each year by the greater of 1 05% outstanding shares on such date or 2 the number of shares subject to stock
awards made under the director plan during the prior twelve month period. However, the automatic increase is subject to reduction by the Board of Directors. Under the terms of the plan option prices shall not be less than the fair market value of
the shares on the date of grant and that no portion may be exercised beyond ten years from that date.  2000 Nonstatutory Equity Incentive Plan  In March of 2000 the Board adopted our 2000 Nonstatutory Equity Incentive Plan the 2000 Plan. Stockholder approval of this plan is not required and has not been obtained by us. The 2000 Plan was in
effect as of December 31, 2003. In April 2002 and October 2002, the Board approved increases to the number of shares reserved under the 2000 Plan from 900,000 shares to 2,400,000 shares and then to 4,400,000 shares, also without stockholder approval
as such approval was not required by the 2000 Plan or by applicable law. The 2000 Plan does not have a termination date, and will continue indefinitely until suspended or terminated by the Board. The 2000 Plan provides for the grant of nonstatutory
stock options and the issuance of restricted stock and stock bonuses to our employees other than officers, directors, or beneficial owners of ten percent 10% or more of our common stock and consultants who meet certain eligibility requirements.
As of September 30, 2004, under the 2000 Plan there were 4,400,000 shares authorized for issuance, 2,493,000 shares of which were subject to outstanding stock option grants, 219,000 shares of unvested restricted stock and unvested stock bonuses
outstanding, and 132,000 shares available for future grant and issuance plus any shares that might be returned to the 2000 Plan in the future as a result of cancellations or expirations of granted options and the repurchase of unvested restricted
stock and stock bonuses. The terms and price of nonstatutory stock options granted under the 2000 Plan are determined by the Board or a committee of the Board and are set forth in each optionees option agreement. The exercise price of
nonstatutory stock options granted under the 2000 Plan has been 100% of the fair market value on the date of grant, and the term of the options has been ten years. Generally, stock options under the 2000 Plan vest over a period of four years in
equal monthly installments with 25% of the shares vesting after one year, and the remainder vesting in equal monthly installments over the remaining three years. In the future, stock options may have the same or different vesting terms as determined
by the Board or a committee of the Board. The Board or a committee of the Board sets the terms of stock bonuses and rights to purchase restricted stock.

NOTE 15WARRANTS  On August 12, 2002, we entered into an agreement with IBM to market our products and services to customers. We issued a
fully vested and exercisable warrant to purchase up to 02 million shares of common stock. The exercise price is set at $225 per share. The warrant expires on August 12, 2007. The warrant was valued at $01 million based on the Black-Scholes model
using the following assumptions: volatility: 105%, risk-free rate: 322% and fair market value of our common stock at the grant date: $084. The value of the warrant was recorded as a prepaid expense and was offset against revenue during 2003 upon
the completion of an IBM revenue generating transaction.  In
September 2001, we issued a warrant to Accenture plc to purchase up to 06 million shares of common stock. The warrant will vest based on achieving designated sales targets. As of September 30, 2004, no warrants had vested. The exercise price is set

NOTE 18RESTATEMENT OF QUARTERLY RESULTS OF OPERATIONS UNAUDITED  On March 14, 2005, we filed a Form 8-K announcing that the Company was
restating its quarterly financial statements. As previously disclosed, on December 29, 2004, the Board of Directors of Chordiant approved a change in Chordiants fiscal year end from December 31st to September 30th, retroactive to September 30,
2004. In the course of preparing the 2004 financial results for the new fiscal year ended September 30, 2004, the Company identified certain errors in the financial statements for the previously reported quarters and year-to-date periods ended March
31, 2004, June 30, 2004 and September 30, 2004. The Company evaluated the errors in accordance with the quantitative and qualitative guidance set forth in SEC Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 99.  On March 8, 2005, management concluded that the Company should restate the
Companys financial statements for the quarters ended March 31, 2004, June 30, 2004 and September 30, 2004 due to the aggregate number of errors identified in the previously issued interim financial statements and the relative percentages
represented by those errors in the quarters to be restated. These errors are primarily related to expense and revenue timing errors, the valuation of a guarantee, errors related to prepaid account balances, and errors relating to estimates used to
compute stock offering costs, warrant valuations and stock based compensation.  On March 10, 2005, senior management of the Company met with the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors of the Company to discuss managements conclusion. The Audit Committee concurred with managements
conclusion to restate the Companys financials for the quarters ended March 31, 2004, June 30, 2004 and September 30, 2004.  The financial information as of September 30, 2004 and for the nine months then ended, and for the unaudited periods of 2004 included herein are labeled
restated as they have been revised from the amounts previously filed with the SEC for the periods March 31, 2004, June 30, 2004 and September 30, 2004 on Form 10-Qs. We have not amended, and we do not expect to amend, our Quarterly

NOTE 19SUBSEQUENT EVENTS  Acquisition of KiQ  On December 21, 2004 we acquired KiQ Limited, a privately held United Kingdom software company KiQ for an aggregate purchase price of
approximately $20 million, which was comprised of $97 million in cash, 4,352,084 shares of common stock valued at $94 million in our common stock and approximately $09 million in associated transaction costs.  Related Parties  In January 2005, Charles E. Hoffman became a director of the Company. Mr. Hoffman is the President and Chief Executive
Officer of Covad Communications Group, Inc. Covad, a customer of ours. Pursuant to software license and services agreements, revenue from Covad was approximately $38 million for the nine month period ended September 30, 2004 and
accounts receivable at that date were approximately $06 million.  In January 2005, David A. Weymouth became a director of the Company. Mr. Weymouth is the Corporate Responsibility Director of Barclays Group, a customer of ours. Pursuant to software license agreements, software
maintenance agreements, and professional services agreements, revenue from Barclays Group was approximately $70 million for the nine month period ended September 30, 2004 and accounts receivable at that date were approximately $05 million.
Delinquent SEC Filings  Subsequent to September 30, 2004 the Company failed to file certain required
reports with the SEC on a timely basis. As a result, the NASDAQ Listing Qualifications Department notified us that we were not in compliance with the requirements of NASDAQ Marketplace Rule 4310c14, affixed an E to the end of our
trading symbol, and began delisting proceedings. We appealed this delisting proceedings and have scheduled a hearing with NASDAQ. The outcome of this hearing is not known.  Suspension of Employee Stock Purchase Plan 
In conjunction with the failure to file timely SEC reports, the Company has suspended the sale of stock under the Employee Stock Purchase Plan. Funds
withheld from employee payroll, normally resulting in proceeds to the Company for newly issued shares, has been refunded to employees for the last offering period ended February 15, 2005.  Potential Damages Associated With Failure to File  In conjunction with the failure to file timely SEC reports, the Companys Form S-3 Registration Statement relating to
the January 2004 sale of common stock to Acqua Wellington Opportunity I Limited Acqua Wellington is no longer effective.  At the time the shares were sold, Acqua Wellington was granted certain registration rights that included provisions requiring the Company to maintain an
effective registration statement until January 2006 or until Aqua Wellington disposed of all acquired shares, which ever period is earlier. As of February 2005, the Company failed to maintain an effective registration statement and may be subject to
certain penalties of up to $500,000 per month through January 2006. Currently, the Company is unable to estimate the possible timing and amount of damages that may be payable, if any.

CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES  a Managements responsibility for financial statements  Our management is responsible for the integrity and objectivity of all information presented in this transitional report.
The consolidated financial statements were prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America and include amounts based on managements best estimates and judgments. Management believes the
consolidated financial statements fairly reflect the form and substance of transactions and that the financial statements fairly represent the Companys financial position and results of operations.  The Audit Committee of the Board of Directors, which is composed solely of
independent directors, meets regularly with our independent registered public accounting firm, PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, and representatives of management to review accounting, financial reporting, internal control and audit matters, as well as
the nature and extent of the audit effort. The Audit Committee is responsible for the engagement of the independent auditors. The independent auditors have free access to the Audit Committee.  b Evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures  In February 2005, we conducted an evaluation under the supervision and with
the participation of our management, including our Chairman of the Board, Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures as defined in Rules 13a-15e
under the Exchange Act as at September 30, 2004 and March 3, 2005. Based upon that evaluation, our Chairman of the Board, Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer determined that as a result of errors identified in the financial
statements for the previously reported quarters and year-to-date periods ended March 31, 2004, June 30, 2004 and September 30, 2004, our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective to ensure that material information required to be
disclosed by us in the reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported as and when required and resulted in the restatement of the financial statements for such periods.  In light of this determination and as part of the work undertaken in
connection with this report, we have applied compensating procedures and processes as necessary to ensure the reliability of our financial reporting. Accordingly, management believes, based on its knowledge, that i this report does not contain any
untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact necessary to make the statements made, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading with respect to the period covered by this report and ii the
financial statements, and other financial information included in this report, fairly present in all material respects our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows as at, and for, the periods presented in this report.  This new determination is in contrast to the previous evaluation carried out
under the supervision and with the participation of management, including the Chief Executive Officer and former interim Chief Financial Officer. In particular, this determination differs from that stated in our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the
quarter ended September 30, 2004 that our disclosure controls and procedures were so effective as at September 30, 2004.  c Changes in internal controls  In this report, unless otherwise indicated, a significant deficiency is defined as a control deficiency, or combination of deficiencies, that
adversely affects the companys ability to initiate, authorize, record, process or report external financial data reliably in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles such that there

is more than a remote likelihood that a misstatement of the companys financial statements that is more than inconsequential will not be prevented or
detected. A material weakness is a significant deficiency, or combination of significant deficiencies, that results in more than a remote likelihood that a material misstatement of the financial statements will not be prevented or
detected.  Material Weakness Reported for the
Quarter ended June 30, 2004  As previously disclosed in our
quarterly report on Form 10-Q filed on August 16, 2004, in July 2004, PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP PwC, our independent public accounting firm, informed our Audit Committee of possible revenue recognition problems for the quarter ended
June 30, 2004 arising out of two contracts involving the sale of our enterprise solutions software. The issue with one of the contracts related to the timing of the execution of the contract and the issue with the other contract involved percentage
of completion accounting. Our Audit Committee initiated an investigation and also engaged outside legal counsel to assist in the investigation. The investigation was conducted to i identify whether any revenue recognition issues existed at
Chordiant generally, and ii review the business practices of our employees as they relate to procedures and controls applicable to the execution of our contracts. Through this investigation, management and our Audit Committee determined that a
material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting existed relating to our revenue recognition controls.  As a result, the Audit Committee made a series of recommendations to management that it believed would address the material weakness identified, which we
endorsed. Although we knew it would take some time to fully implement such recommendations, we have made substantial progress on the implementation of the recommendations relating to the material weakness in our revenue recognition controls,
including the following measures:  On September 17, 2004, Charles Swan was appointed the Interim Chief Financial Officer and Principal Accounting Officer while we searched for a permanent chief financial officer.
Subsequent to the end of our fiscal year ended September 30, 2004, on November 17, 2004, George de Urioste was hired as our new Chief Operating Officer, and effective January 1, 2005, was also appointed the Chief Financial Officer and Principal
Accounting Officer. Effective March 8, 2005, Mr. Swan was no longer employed at the Company.  We have appointed a financial director as our Corporate Controller.  We have hired a full-time accounting employee to the newly-created position of Revenue Recognition Manager. This employee has significant experience and specialized expertise with
revenue recognition issues involving enterprise software companies.  We hired full-time employees to serve in the newly-created positions of Assistant Controller and Senior Accountant.  We have appointed our General Counsel to the additional role of Chief Compliance Officer.  We have hired an experienced employee to the newly-created position of Senior Contracts Manager.  We have amended our Code of Conduct the Code in the following respects:  The Code specifies that only members of the finance department will determine when or whether revenue will be recognized.  The Code prohibits any person from exerting pressure on any member of the finance department to book or recognize revenue to achieve revenue targets. The changes to the Code
clarify, however, that neither a supplying information at the request of the finance department, the audit committee of the Board of Directors, or the independent auditors, nor b requesting an understanding from a member of the finance
department of the revenue recognition implications of a potential or actual transaction, will be deemed a violation of the Code. 
97 Table of Contents The Code provides that all inquiries or calls from financial analysts must be referred to the Chairman, Chief Executive Officer, President, Chief Operating Officer, Chief Financial
Officer or Director of the investor relations.  The Code provides that the Board of Directors or an authorized committee may grant a waiver under the Code to a member of the Board of Directors  The Code specifically prohibits the predating of contracts.  Our Chief Executive Officer sends a quarterly email to all employees reminding them of our code of conduct and how they can anonymously report violations of the code of conduct.
The Board, management, finance staff and persons performing investor relations functions have received training on the current requirements for reporting and disclosure.
Our signature policy has been revised to limit contract signing authority for revenue-related contracts.  We converted to a new financial information system.  Material Weakness Reported for the Quarter ended September 30, 2004  As we reported in a report filed on Form 8-K on January 4, 2005, the Board of Directors approved a change in our fiscal year
end from December 31st to September 30th.  In the process of
managements work to comply with Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 SOX, management identified approximately 200 processes at Chordiant that must be documented and ultimately tested to determine whether a significant
deficiency or material weakness in internal control over financial reporting exists. In December 2004, following a review by the Audit Committee of the progress in complying with Section 404, management concluded that it would not complete
documenting Chordiants internal control over financial reporting by December 31, 2004, and that it was unlikely that the Company could complete its assessment of design and operating effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting
by April 30, 2005, the extended time period allowed by the SEC to complete this assessment. If that were to occur, Chordiant would not be in a position to file, on a timely basis, its annual report on Form 10-K, managements annual report on
internal control over financial reporting and the related auditors attestation report, each as required by Item 308a of Regulation S-K, and Item 308b of Regulation S-K, for the fiscal year ended on December 31, 2004. Due to the application
of the SECs current rules, Chordiant would not have been able to file an annual report on Form 10-K with managements annual report on internal control over financial reporting and the related auditors attestation report until the
end of its 2005 calendar year. Absent relief from the SEC, Chordiant would have been faced with failing to comply with Section 13 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 during that period of time, which would have resulted in numerous adverse
consequences to Chordiant.  As the Board of Directors did not
make the decision to change the year end until December 29, 2004, we filed a quarterly report on Form 10-Q on November 9, 2004 for the quarter ended September 30, 2004. In that report for the quarter ended September 30, 2004, we reported that in
October 2004, PwC informed Chordiant and our Audit Committee that the following material weakness arose in the quarter ended September 30, 2004 with respect to our internal control over financial reporting relating to staffing of our finance
department and the fact that many finance employees are new hires: 1 inadequate staffing and supervision leading to untimely identification and resolution of certain accounting matters, 2 failure of financial reporting controls in preventing or
detecting misstatements of accounting information that resulted in certain adjustments to the financial statements and 3 incomplete or inadequate account analysis, account reconciliations and consolidation procedures. We agreed with PwCs
assessment. 
98 Table of Contents
Since October 2004, we have taken the following steps to remediate the material weakness:  In the aggregate, we have hired five individuals to replace the members of the finance team that resigned and added six new members to the finance team to provide additional
resources in the department, including two additional senior accountants, one to concentrate on accounting for consulting services revenue and expenses and one concentrating on general accounting matters. The Companys staff now includes four
certified public accountants and two chartered accountants in financial operations.  As discussed above, we hired a permanent chief operating officer and chief financial officer.  Our chief operating officer and chief financial officer has been delegated the responsibility for the Companys compliance with SOX, including section 404. In addition:
We have appointed a project leader for the SOX program on a company-wide basis and individual project managers for international operations and information technology.
We have initiated weekly conference calls involving our lead independent director, chairman of the board of directors, chief executive officer, chief operating officer/chief
financial officer, and the SOX project team to review progress against the implementation plan for section 404 and section 406 compliance.  We implemented an automated system to allow our professional services consultants to report their hours and expenses relating to their services electronically. This system is on
line for our North American operations for both hours and expenses and for non-North American operations for expenses.  Management will continue its efforts and management and the Audit Committee will continue to monitor the effectiveness of our internal control over
financial reporting, including those pertaining to revenue recognition, and staffing of our finance team, on an ongoing basis and will take further action, as appropriate. While neither material weakness has been fully remediated, management
believes significant progress has been made to do so.  Other
than as described above, there have been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the quarter ended September 30, 2004 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over
financial reporting.
