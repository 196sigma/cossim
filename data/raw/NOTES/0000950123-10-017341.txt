ITEM 8.  CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA UniSource Energy Managements Report on Internal Controls Over Financial Reporting UniSource Energy Corporations management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate
internal control over financial reporting. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control
over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any
evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become
inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or
procedures may deteriorate. Management assessed the effectiveness of the UniSource Energy Corporations internal control over
financial reporting as of December31, 2009. In making this assessment, management used the
criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission COSO
in Internal Control Integrated Framework. Based on managements assessment using those criteria, management has concluded that, as of
December31, 2009, UniSource Energy Corporations internal control over financial reporting was
effective. Tucson Electric Power Company Managements Report on Internal Controls Over Financial Reporting Tucson Electric Power Companys management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate

inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or
procedures may deteriorate. Management assessed the effectiveness of Tucson Electric Power Companys internal control over

registered public accounting firm regarding internal control over financial reporting.
Managements report was not subject to attestation by Tucson Electric Power Companys registered
public accounting firm pursuant to temporary rules of the SEC that permit Tucson Electric Power
Company to provide only managements report in this annual report. K-83 Table of Contents Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of
UniSource Energy Corporation In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements listed in the index appearing under a1 present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of UniSource Energy
Corporation and its subsidiaries at December31, 2009 and December31, 2008, and the results of
their operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December31,
2009 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.
In addition, in our opinion, the financial statement schedule listed in the index appearing under
a2 presents fairly, in all material respects, the information set forth therein when
read in conjunction with the related consolidated financial statements. Also in our opinion, the
Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting
as of December31, 2009, based on criteria established in Internal Control Integrated Framework
issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission COSO. The
Companys management is responsible for these financial statements and financial statement
schedule, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its
assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the
accompanying Managements Report on Internal Controls Over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility
is to express opinions on these financial statements, on the financial statement schedule, and on
the Companys internal control over financial reporting based on our integrated audits. We
conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight
Board United States. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement and
whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material
respects. Our audits of the financial statements included examining, on a test basis, evidence
supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting
principles used and significant estimates made by management, and evaluating the overall financial
statement presentation. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining
an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material
weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal
control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other procedures as
we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis
for our opinions. As described in Note 9 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company changed the manner in
which it accounts for uncertain tax positions as of January1, 2007. A companys internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable
assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial
statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A
companys internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that i
pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the
transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; iiprovide reasonable assurance that
transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance
with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company
are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company;
and iiiprovide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized
acquisition, use, or disposition of the companys assets that could have a material effect on the
financial statements. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or
detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are
subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that
the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

2/19/10 NOTE 1. NATURE OF OPERATIONS AND SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES NATURE OF OPERATIONS UniSource Energy Corporation UniSource Energy is a holding company that has no significant
operations of its own. Operations are conducted by UniSource Energys subsidiaries, each of which
is a separate legal entity with its own assets and liabilities. UniSource Energy owns 100% of
Tucson Electric Power Company TEP, UniSource Energy Services, Inc. UES, Millennium Energy
Holdings, Inc. Millennium and UniSource Energy Development Company UED. TEP, a regulated public utility, is UniSource Energys largest operating subsidiary and represented
approximately 81% of UniSource Energys assets as of December31, 2009. TEP generates, transmits
and distributes electricity to approximately 402,000 retail electric customers in a 1,155 square
mile area in Southern Arizona. TEP also sells electricity to other utilities and power marketing
entities primarily located in the Western U.S. In addition, TEP operates Springerville Unit 3 on
behalf of Tri-State Generation and Transmission Association, Inc. Tri-State and beginning in
December2009 Springerville Unit 4 on behalf of Salt River Project Agriculture Improvement and
Power District SRP. UES holds the common stock of UNS Gas, Inc. UNS Gas and UNS Electric, Inc. UNS Electric. UNS
Gas is a gas distribution company with 146,000 retail customers in Mohave, Yavapai, Coconino, and
Navajo counties in Northern Arizona, as well as Santa Cruz County in South Central Arizona. UNS
Electric is an electric transmission and distribution company with approximately 90,000 retail
customers in Mohave and Santa Cruz counties. Millennium invests in unregulated businesses. In June2009, Millennium sold its 50% equity
interest in Carboelectrica Sabinas, S. de R.L. de C.V. See Note 15. Our business is comprised of three reporting segments TEP, UNS Gas and UNS Electric. References to we and our are to UniSource Energy and its subsidiaries, collectively. BASIS OF PRESENTATION We account for our investments in subsidiaries using the consolidation method when we hold a
majority of a subsidiarys voting stock and we can exercise control over the subsidiary. The
accounts of the subsidiary and parent are combined, and intercompany balances and transactions are
eliminated. Intercompany profits on transactions between regulated entities are not eliminated. We use the equity method to report corporate joint ventures, partnerships, and affiliated company
investments when we can demonstrate the ability to exercise significant influence over the
operating and financial policies of an investee company. Equity method investments are recorded at
cost and appear on a single line item on the balance sheet and net income lossfrom the entity is
reflected in Other Income on the income statements. Quarterly, we review the equity investments
and where there is an other-than-temporary impairment, we recognize the loss in earnings. K-98 Table of Contents UNISOURCE ENERGY, TEP AND SUBSIDIARIES
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS continued DRAFT Audit Committee
2/19/10 USE OF ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES We make estimates and assumptions to prepare financial statements under accounting principles
generally accepted in the U.S. GAAP. These estimates and assumptions affect   
A portion of the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the dates of the
financial statements   
Our disclosures about contingent assets and liabilities at the dates of the financial
statements; and   
A portion of revenues and expenses reported during the periods presented. Because these estimates involve judgments, the actual amounts may differ from the estimates. ACCOUNTING FOR RATE REGULATION TEP, UNS Gas and UNS Electric generally use the same accounting policies and practices used by
unregulated companies. However, sometimes regulatory accounting requires rate-regulated companies
to apply special accounting treatment to show the effect of rate-regulation. For example, the ACC
can determine that TEP, UNS Gas or UNS Electric are allowed to recover certain expenses, but at a
designated time in the future. In this situation, TEP, UNS Gas and UNS Electric defer these items
and show them as regulatory assets on the balance sheet until they are allowed to charge their
customers. TEP, UNS Gas and UNS Electric then amortize these items as expenses as they recover
these charges from customers. Similarly, certain revenue items may be deferred as regulatory
liabilities, which are also eventually amortized to the income statement as rates to customers are
reduced. We evaluate our regulatory assets each period and believe recovery is probable. Beginning in December2008, as a result of the 2008 TEP Rate Order, TEP reapplied regulatory
accounting to its generation operations. See Note 2. The conditions a rate-regulated company must satisfy to apply regulatory accounting policies and
practices include   
An independent regulator sets rates   
The regulator sets the rates to recover the specific enterprises costs of providing
service; and   
The service territory lacks competitive pressures to reduce rates below the rates set by
the regulator. CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS We define Cash and Cash Equivalents as cash unrestricted demand deposits and all highly liquid
investments purchased with an original maturity of three months or less. K-99 Table of Contents UNISOURCE ENERGY, TEP AND SUBSIDIARIES
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS continued DRAFT Audit Committee
2/19/10 UTILITY PLANT TEP, UNS Gas and UNS Electric report utility plant at cost. Costs included in utility plant are
materials and labor, contractor services, construction overhead where applicable, and an
Allowance for Funds Used During Construction AFUDC. Costs to replace major units of property are included in utility plant. The cost of planned major
maintenance activities, including scheduled overhauls at TEPs generation plants, is recorded as
the costs are actually incurred. Replacement of capital equipment included in plant maintenance
activities is capitalized to utility plant. TEP, UNS Gas and UNS Electric charge the cost of
repairs and minor replacements to Other Operations and Maintenance expense. When a unit of regulated property is retired, the original cost plus removal costs less any salvage
value is credited or charged to accumulated depreciation. Prior to December2008, before TEP
reapplied regulatory accounting to its generation operations, interim retirements of unregulated
generation plant, together with the cost of removal less salvage, were charged to accumulated
depreciation. AFUDC and Capitalized Interest AFUDC, which reflects the cost of debt or equity funds used to finance construction, is capitalized
as part of the cost of regulated utility plant. AFUDC applies to all regulated operations that
follow regulatory accounting. AFUDC amounts capitalized are included in rate base for establishing
utility rates. For operations that do not apply regulatory accounting, interest related only to
debt is capitalized as a cost of construction. The interest capitalized that relates to debt
reduces Other Interest Expense on the income statement. The cost capitalized that relates to
equity funds is recorded as Other Income. Beginning in December2008, when TEP reapplied
regulatory accounting to its generation operations, TEP began capitalizing costs that relate to
equity funds. See Note 2.

2/19/10 Depreciation TEP, UNS Gas, UNS Electric and UED compute depreciation for owned utility plant on a group method
straight-line basis at rates based on the economic lives of the assets. See Note 5. The ACC
approves depreciation rates for all utility plant, except that of UED and the transmission assets
of TEP which are subject to FERC jurisdiction. Depreciation rates are based on average useful lives
and reflect estimated removal costs, net of estimated salvage value for interim retirements. Prior
to December2008, before TEP reapplied regulatory accounting to its generation operations, the
depreciable lives for TEPs generation assets were based on remaining useful lives. We have
summarized the average annual depreciation rates for all utility plants below.

Computer Software Costs TEP, UNS Gas and UNS Electric capitalize costs incurred to purchase and develop computer software
for internal use and amortize those costs over the estimated economic life of the product. If the
software is no longer useful, we immediately charge capitalized computer software costs to expense.
TEP amortized capitalized computer software costs of $8million in 2009, $7million in 2008, and
$9million in 2007. TEP Utility Plant under Capital Leases TEP financed the following generation assets with capital leases: Springerville Common Facilities,
Springerville Unit 1, Springerville Coal Handling Facilities, and Sundt Unit 4. The following

INVESTMENTS IN LEASE DEBT AND EQUITY TEP has investments in lease debt in two of TEPs capital leases: Springerville Unit 1 and
Springerville Coal Handling Facilities. TEPs investments in lease debt are considered to be
held-to-maturity investments because TEP has the ability and intent to hold until maturity. TEP
records these investments at amortized cost and recognizes interest income. See Note 6. These
investments do not reduce the capital lease obligations reflected on the balance sheet because
there is no legal right of offset. TEP makes lease payments to a trustee who then distributes the
payments to debt and equity holders. TEP accounts for its 14% equity interest in the Springerville Unit 1 lease trust using the equity
method. K-101 Table of Contents UNISOURCE ENERGY, TEP AND SUBSIDIARIES
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS continued DRAFT Audit Committee
2/19/10 JOINTLY-OWNED FACILITIES TEP has investments in several plants and transmission facilities jointly owned with other
utilities. These projects are accounted for on a proportionate consolidation basis. See Note 5. ASSET RETIREMENT OBLIGATIONS TEP records a liability for the estimated present value of a conditional asset retirement
obligation as follows   
When it is able to reasonably estimate the fair value of any future obligation to retire
as a result of an existing or enacted law, statute, ordinance or contract; or   
If it can reasonably estimate the fair value. When the liability is initially recorded at net present value, TEP capitalizes the cost by
increasing the carrying amount of the related long-lived asset. Over time, TEP adjusts the
liability to its present value by recognizing accretion expense each period in other operations and
maintenance expense, and the capitalized cost is depreciated in depreciation and amortization
expense over the useful life of the related asset. Upon retirement of the asset, TEP either
settles the obligation for its recorded amount or incurs a gain or loss if the actual costs differ
from the recorded amount. Beginning in December2008, when TEP reapplied regulatory accounting to its generation operations,
TEP began recording cost of removal for its generation assets that is recoverable through rates
charged to customers. See Note 2. TEP, UNS Gas and UNS Electric record cost of removal for their
transmission and distribution assets through depreciation rates and recover those amounts in rates
charged to their customers. There are no legal obligations associated with these assets. TEP, UNS
Gas and UNS Electric have recorded their obligation for estimated costs of removal as regulatory
liabilities. EVALUATION OF ASSETS FOR IMPAIRMENT TEP, UNS Gas and UNS Electric evaluate their Utility Plant and other long-lived assets for
impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate that the value of the assets may be impaired.
If the fair value of the asset, determined based on the undiscounted expected future cash flows, is
less than the carrying value of the asset, an impairment charge would be recorded. Millennium evaluates its investments for impairment at the end of each quarter. If the decline in
fair value is judged to be other-than-temporary, an impairment loss would be recorded. DEFERRED FINANCING COSTS We defer costs related to the issuance of debt. We amortize on a straight-line basis over the life
of the debt as this approximates the effective interest method. These costs include underwriters
commissions, discounts or premiums, and other costs such as legal, accounting and regulatory fees
and printing costs. TEP, UNS Gas and UNS Electric defer and amortize the gains and losses on reacquired debt associated
with their regulated operations to interest expense over the remaining life of the original debt.
Prior to December2008, when TEP reapplied regulatory accounting to its generation operations, TEP
recognized gains and losses on reacquired debt, including unamortized debt issuance costs,
associated with its generation operations, as incurred. UTILITY OPERATING REVENUES TEP, UNS Gas and UNS Electric record utility operating revenues when services are provided or
commodities are delivered to customers. Operating revenues include unbilled revenues which are
earned service has been
provided but not billed by the end of an accounting period. K-102 Table of Contents UNISOURCE ENERGY, TEP AND SUBSIDIARIES
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS continued DRAFT Audit Committee
2/19/10 Amounts delivered are determined through systematic monthly readings of customer meters. At the
end of the month, the usage since the last meter reading is estimated and the corresponding
unbilled revenue is calculated. Unbilled revenue is estimated based on daily generation or
purchased volumes, estimated customer usage by class, estimated line losses and estimated average
customer rates. Accrued unbilled revenues are reversed the following month when actual billings
occur. The accuracy of the unbilled
revenue estimate is affected by factors that include fluctuations in energy demands, weather, line
losses, and changes in the composition of customer classes. Effective in January2009, as a result of the 2008 TEP Rate Order, TEP has a rate-adjustment
mechanism that provides for the recovery of fuel and purchased energy cost. UNS Gas and UNS
Electric also have rate-adjustment mechanisms in place that allow for a revenue surcharge or
surcredit that adjusts the customers base rate for delivered purchased power or gas to collect
or return under- or over- recovery of costs. These rate-adjustment mechanisms are revised
periodically and may increase or decrease the level of costs recovered through base rates for any
difference between the total amount collected under the clauses and the recoverable costs incurred.
See Note 2. TEPs wholesale revenue and purchased power costs from settled energy contracts that are not
physically delivered are reported on a net basis in Electric Wholesale Sales. The corresponding
cash receipts and payments are recorded in the statement of cash flows as Cash Receipts from
Electric Wholesale Sales and Purchased Energy Costs Paid, respectively. We record an Allowance for Doubtful Accounts to reduce accounts receivable for revenue amounts that
are estimated to be uncollectible. TEP, UNS Gas and UNS Electric establish an allowance for
doubtful accounts based on historical collection experience and any specific customer collection
issues that are identified. TEPs Allowance for Doubtful Accounts was $4million at December31,
2009, and $17million at December31, 2008. See Note 4. UNS Gas and UNS Electrics combined
Allowance for Doubtful Accounts was $2million at December31, 2009 and $3million at December31,
2008. TEP recognizes revenue from operating Springerville Unit 3 and Unit 4 as contract services and
materials are provided. Expenses are recorded in the respective line item of the income statement
based on the nature of service or materials provided. INVENTORY TEP records fuel inventory, primarily coal, at weighted average cost. TEP uses full absorption
costing, under which all handling and procurement costs are included in the cost of the inventory.
Examples of these costs include direct material, direct labor, overhead costs and transportation
costs. See Note 4 regarding fuel purchase contracts. Materials and supplies inventories are recorded at cost. Materials and supplies consist of
transmission and distribution line construction and repair materials and generating station and
transmission and distribution substation repair materials. FUEL AND PURCHASED ENERGY COSTS TEP and UNS Electric Purchased Power and Fuel Adjustment Clause PPFAC As a result of the 2008 TEP Rate Order, TEP began deferring differences between purchased energy
costs and the recovery of such costs in rates effective January1, 2009. UNS Electric also defers
differences between purchased energy costs and the recovery of such costs in rates. Where
applicable, fuel cost over-recoveries the excess of fuel costs recovered in base rates over fuel
costs incurred are deferred as current regulatory liabilities and under-recoveries the excess of
fuel costs incurred over fuel costs recovered in base rates are deferred as current regulatory
assets. The 2008 TEP Rate Order required TEP to credit, with interest, $58million of Fixed CTC
true-up revenues charged to customers from May2008 to November 2008, through the PPFAC. See
Note 2. K-103 Table of Contents UNISOURCE ENERGY, TEP AND SUBSIDIARIES
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS continued DRAFT Audit Committee
2/19/10 UNS Gas Purchased Gas Adjustor PGA UNS Gas defers differences between gas purchase costs and the recovery of such costs in base rates
under a Purchased Gas Adjustor PGAmechanism. The PGA mechanism addresses the volatility of
natural gas prices and allows UNS Gas to recover its commodity costs through a price adjustor. The
PGA factor, computed monthly, is a calculation of the twelve-month rolling weighted average gas
cost, and automatically adjusts monthly, subject to limitations on how much the price per therm may
change in a twelve-month period. The difference between the actual cost of UNS Gas gas supplies
and transportation contracts and that cost which is currently allowed by the ACC is deferred and recovered or
repaid through the PGA mechanism. When under-or over-recovery trigger points are met, UNS Gas may
request a PGA surcharge or surcredit with the goal of collecting or returning the amount deferred
from or to customers, with interest, over a twelve-month period. See Note 2. INCOME TAXES Due to the differences between GAAP and income tax laws, many transactions are treated differently
for income tax purposes than they are in the financial statements. This difference is accounted
for by recording deferred income tax assets and liabilities on our balance sheets. These assets
and liabilities are recorded using current income tax rates, which are expected to be in effect
when the deferred tax assets and liabilities are realized or settled. Tax benefits are recognized in the financial statements when it is more likely than not that a tax
position will be sustained upon examination by the tax authorities based on the technical merits of
the position. The tax benefit recorded is the largest amount that is more than 50% likely to be
realized upon ultimate settlement with the tax authority. In calculating the benefit to be
recognized we assume the tax authorities have full knowledge of the position and all relevant
facts. Interest Expense includes interest accrued by UniSource and TEP on tax positions taken on
tax returns which have not been reflected in the financial statements. Prior to 1990, we flowed through to ratepayers certain accelerated tax benefits related to utility
plant as the benefits were recognized on the income tax return. Income Taxes Recoverable Through
Future Rates on the balance sheet reflects the future revenues due us from ratepayers as these tax
benefits reverse. See Notes 2 and 9. Federal and state income tax credits are treated as a reduction to income tax expense in the year
the credit arises. Consolidated income tax liabilities are allocated to subsidiaries based on their taxable income as
reported in the consolidated tax return. TAXES OTHER THAN INCOME TAXES TEP, UNS Gas and UNS Electric act as conduits or collection agents for sales tax, utility taxes,
franchise fees and regulatory assessments. We record liabilities payable to governmental agencies
as customers are billed for these taxes and assessments. These amounts are not reflected in the
income statement. EMISSION ALLOWANCES The Environmental Protection Agency EPAissues emission allowances to qualifying utilities based
on past operational history. Each allowance permits emission of one ton of sulfur dioxide
SO2 in its vintage year or a subsequent year. TEP receives an allotment of these
SO2 emission allowances annually; UNS Electric and UED do not receive SO2
emission allowances since neither has coal-fired generation. When issued from the EPA, these
SO2 emission allowances have no book value for accounting purposes but may be sold if
TEP does not need them for operations. TEP may also purchase additional SO2 emission
allowances if needed. Purchased SO2 emission allowances are recorded at cost.
Beginning in January2009, as a result of the 2008 TEP Rate Order, TEP will credit 50% of the gains
from the sales of SO2 emission allowances to the PPFAC. The remaining 50% of gains from
sales of excess SO2 emission allowances will be reflected as a reduction of
Other Operations and Maintenance expense on TEPs income statement when title passes and in the
operating activities section of the statement of cash flows. 100% of gains from sales of excess
SO2 emission allowances were reflected as a reduction of Other Operations and
Maintenance expense in 2007 and 2008. No allowances were sold in 2009. K-104 Table of Contents UNISOURCE ENERGY, TEP AND SUBSIDIARIES
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS continued DRAFT Audit Committee
2/19/10 RENEWABLE ENERGY STANDARDS TARIFF RESTAND RENEWABLE ENERGY CREDITS RECs Arizona adopted a mandatory renewables portfolio standard that requires TEP and UNS Electric to
engage in renewable energy activities, allowing cost recovery under REST. Arizona uses RECs as a
form of measurement of compliance to the REST requirements encouraging construction and consumption
of renewable energy. RECs are created each time one KWh of renewable energy is generated or when
qualifying renewable equipment is manufactured. An escalating percentage of retail electric sales
determine the annual REC requirement. RECs may be used to satisfy compliance requirements anytime
after creation with no expiration date. We have the option of generating our own RECs, or
purchasing RECs which are usually bundled with renewable power purchases. RECs may be sold if we
do not need them for operations. DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS Risks and Overview TEP, UNS Gas and UNS Electric are exposed to energy price risk associated with their gas and
purchased power requirements, volumetric risk associated with their seasonal load and operational
risk associated with their power plants, transmission and transportation systems. The energy price
risk is mitigated through the PPFAC and PGA mechanisms which provide an adjustment to TEP, UNS Gas
and UNS Electrics retail rates to recover the actual costs of purchased power, gas, transmission
and transportation. TEP, UNS Gas and UNS Electric further reduce their energy price risk through a
variety of derivative and non-derivative instruments. The objectives for entering into such
contracts include: creating price stability for TEP, UNS Gas and UNS Electric; to ensure TEP, UNS
Gas and UNS Electric can meet their load and reserve requirements; and reducing TEP, UNS Gas and
UNS Electrics exposure to price volatility that may result from delayed recovery under the PPFAC
or PGA. See Note 2 for further information regarding regulatory matters. We consider the effect of counterparty credit risk in determining the fair value of derivative
instruments that are in a net asset position, after incorporating collateral posted by
counterparties, and allocate the credit risk adjustment to individual contracts. We also consider
the impact of our own credit risk, after considering collateral posted, on instruments that are in
a net liability position and allocate the credit risk adjustment to all individual contracts. Although TEPs gains and losses on trading activities, if any, are recorded on a net basis in the
income statement, we report the related cash receipts and cash payments separately in the statement
of cash flows. We present cash collateral and derivative assets and liabilities, associated with
the same counterparty, separately in our financial statements and we bifurcate all derivatives into
their current and long-term portions on the balance sheet. K-105 Table of Contents UNISOURCE ENERGY, TEP AND SUBSIDIARIES
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS continued DRAFT Audit Committee
2/19/10 Cash Flow Hedges TEP hedges the cash flow risk associated with unfavorable changes in the variable interest rates
related to LIBOR on the Springerville Common Facilities Lease. TEP accounts for cash flow hedges
as follows   
The effective portion of the changes in the fair value of TEPs interest rate swaps and
TEPs six-year power purchase swap agreement are recorded in AOCI and the ineffective
portion, if any, is recognized in earnings.   
When TEP determines a contract is no longer effective in offsetting the changes in cash
flow of a hedged item, TEP recognizes the changes in fair value in earnings. The
unrealized gains and losses at that time remain in AOCI and are reclassified into earnings
as the underlying hedged transaction occurs. We formally assess, both at the hedges inception and on an ongoing basis, whether the derivatives
have been and are expected to remain highly effective in offsetting changes in the cash flows of
hedged items. We discontinue hedge accounting when: 1the derivative is no longer effective in
offsetting changes in the fair value or cash flows of a hedged item; 2the derivative expires or
is sold, terminated, or exercised; 3it is no longer probable that the forecasted transaction
will occur; or 4we determine that designating the derivative as a hedging instrument is no
longer appropriate. Mark-to-Market   
TEP   
TEPs non-trading hedges, such as forward power purchase contracts indexed to gas, short-term
forward power sales contracts, or call and put options gas collars, that did not qualify for
cash flow hedge accounting treatment or did not qualify for the normal scope exception, are
considered mark-to-market transactions. TEP hedges a portion of its monthly natural gas
exposure for plant fuel, gas-indexed purchased power and spot market purchases with fixed price
contracts for a maximum of three years. Beginning in December2008, as a result of the 2008 TEP
Rate Order, which permits recovery in the PPFAC of hedging transactions, unrealized gains and
losses are recorded as either a regulatory asset or regulatory liability only to the extent they
qualify for recovery under the PPFAC mechanism.   
TEP enters into certain energy-related derivatives for trading purposes which are forward power
purchase and sale contracts entered into purely to profit from market price changes. The net
trading activities represent a very small portion less than 1% of TEPs revenue from wholesale
sales in 2007 and 2008. In 2009, TEP had no trading activity. As unrealized gains and losses
resulting from changes in the market prices of trading derivatives are not recoverable in the
PPFAC, unrealized gains and losses are recorded in the income statement in Electric Wholesale
Sales.   
UNS Electric   
UNS Electric hedges a portion of its purchased power exposure to fixed price and natural
gas-indexed contracts with forward power purchases or financial gas swaps. In April2009, UNS
Electric also began using call and put options, creating price stability and reducing exposure
to price volatility that may result in delayed recovery under the PPFAC.   
UNS Gas   
UNS Gas enters into derivatives such as forward gas purchases and gas swaps, creating price
stability and reducing exposure to natural gas price volatility that may result in delayed
recovery under the PGA. Beginning in December2008, unrealized gains and losses are recorded as
either a regulatory asset or regulatory liability, as the UNS Gas PGA mechanism permits the
recovery of the prudent cost of hedging contracts. K-106 Table of Contents UNISOURCE ENERGY, TEP AND SUBSIDIARIES
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS continued DRAFT Audit Committee
2/19/10 Normal Purchase and Normal Sale UNS Gas, UNS Electric and TEP enter into forward energy purchase and sales contracts, including
call options, to support the current load forecast and contracts entered into with a counterparty
with load serving requirements or generating capacity. These contracts are not required to be
marked-to-market and are accounted for on an accrual basis. On an ongoing basis we evaluate our
counterparties for non-performance risk to ensure it does not impact our ability to obtain the
normal scope exception. 2007 and 2008 Accounting Summary Prior to December2008, we recorded unrealized gains and losses on derivative instruments as
follows   
TEPs interest rate swaps, TEPs forward contracts to sell excess capacity, and TEP and
UNS Gas forward gas swaps were recorded in AOCI   
TEPs non-trading hedges such as forward power purchase contracts indexed to gas, and
TEPs forward purchase and sale trading contracts were recorded in the income statement;
and   
All other commodity contracts were reflected on the balance sheet as either regulatory
assets or regulatory liabilities. SHARE-BASED COMPENSATION UniSource Energy has a stock-based long-term incentive plan. UniSource Energy measures the cost of
employee services received in exchange for an award of equity instruments based on the grant-date
fair value of the award with some limited exceptions. Compensation costs are recognized over the
period during which an employee is required to provide service in exchange for the award which
typically is the vesting period. Compensation cost is not recognized for anticipated forfeitures
of equity instruments prior to vesting. Our share-based compensation plans are described more
fully in Note 11. RECLASSIFICATIONS AND OTHER ADJUSTMENTS Springerville Unit 1 In 2006, we recorded an investment in 1414% of Springerville Unit 1 lease equity transaction as a
lease restructuring. We subsequently determined that the transaction was best characterized as a
purchase of an interest in a trust accounted for using equity method accounting. As a result, at
June30, 2009, UniSource Energy and TEP recorded a net increase to Net Income of less than $05million,
after tax. The net adjustment recorded in June2009 included additional depreciation expense of $4
million; a reduction of interest expense on capital leases of $2million; and $3million of equity
in earnings which is included in Other Income on the income statement. In addition, UniSource
Energy and TEP recorded a $19million increase to capital lease assets, a $4million increase to
accumulated amortization, a $3million increase to capital lease obligations, and an $11million
decrease to investment in lease debt. Renewable Energy and Demand Side Management DSMRevenues UniSource Energy and TEP reclassified renewable revenue of $5million and $3million in 2008, and
$7million and $5million in 2007, respectively, from Other Revenue to Electric Retail Sales in the
Statements of Income. These reclassifications had no effect on Net Income. K-107 Table of Contents UNISOURCE ENERGY, TEP AND SUBSIDIARIES
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS continued DRAFT Audit Committee
2/19/10 Dividend Equivalents In September2009, UniSource Energy and TEP recorded dividends of $09million and $08million,
respectively, for dividend equivalents that should have been recorded between 2005 and 2008. Other In June2009, TEP recorded approximately $1million $06million after-tax of additional
depreciation for plant improvements that should have been recorded prior to 2009. TEP also
recorded an after-tax gain of $15million related to proceeds from a company owned life insurance
policy that should have been recorded prior to 2009. TEP 2008 Rate Order In the TEP 2008 Rate Order, the Arizona Corporation Commission ACCgranted TEP a Purchased Power
and Fuel Adjustment Clause PPFACwhich allows recovery of actual fuel and purchased power costs,
including demand charges, transmission costs, and prudent settlement costs of contracts for hedging
fuel and purchased power costs. UNS Electric has a similar PPFAC mechanism. UNS Gas has a
Purchased Gas Adjuster PGAmechanism which allows UNS Gas to recover its actual commodity costs,
including transportation. See Note 2. To provide more information regarding the components of the PPFAC/PGA and to be comparable with the
2009 presentation, UniSource Energy and TEP made the following reclassifications to the statements
of income for the years ended December31, 2008 and December31, 2007.   
UniSource Energy and TEP reclassified Transmission expenses of $19million and $11
million in 2008, and $16million and $9million in 2007, respectively, from Other
Operations and Maintenance to Transmission, a component of Total Fuel and Purchased Energy   
UniSource Energy and TEP reclassified capital lease expenses of $5million in 2007 and
2008 from Interest on Capital Leases to Fuel; and   
UniSource Energy reclassified $11million in 2008 and $5million in 2007 of
over-recovered PPFAC and PGA expenses from Purchased Energy, Transmission, and Fuel to
Increase Decrease to reflect PPFAC/PGA Recovery Treatment, a component of Total Fuel and
Purchased Energy. These reclassifications had no effect on Net Income. NOTE 2. REGULATORY MATTERS 1999 Settlement Agreement We believe that the 1999 Settlement Agreement contemplated that TEPs retail rates for generation
service would have been market-based beginning January1, 2009. As part of the 2008 TEP Rate
Order, TEP and all the parties to the 2008 Proposed Settlement Agreement relinquished all claims
related to the 1999 Settlement Agreement and the ACC order adopting the 1999 Settlement Agreement. 1999 Transition Recovery Asset TEPs Transition Recovery Asset consisted of generation-related regulatory assets and a portion of
TEPs generation plant asset costs. Transition costs that were recovered through the Fixed CTC
included: 1the Transition Recovery Regulatory Asset; 2a small portion of generation-related
plant assets included in Plant in Service on the balance sheet; and 3excess capacity deferrals
related to operating and capital costs associated with Springerville Unit 2 which were amortized as
an off-balance sheet regulatory asset through 2003. In May2008, TEP fully amortized the remaining
Transition Recovery Asset balance, as costs were fully recovered through rates. TEP amortized $24
million and $78million of the asset to the
income statement in 2008 and 2007, respectively. TEP also amortized $2million and $8million of
generation-related plant assets in 2008 and 2007, respectively. K-108 Table of Contents UNISOURCE ENERGY, TEP AND SUBSIDIARIES
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS continued DRAFT Audit Committee
2/19/10 In May2007, the ACC ordered that TEPs current Fixed CTC revenue remain at its then-current level
until the effective date of a final order in the TEP 2008 proposed settlement agreement proceeding.
As of December1, 2008, when new rates went into effect, TEP had collected $58million of true-up
revenues and recorded a $58million reserve for Fixed CTC revenue to be refunded against its
Electric Retail Sales in 2008. The 2008 TEP Rate Order requires TEP to return the Fixed CTC
true-up revenues to customers by reducing the PPFAC balance. TEP 2008 Rate Order The 2008 TEP Rate Order, issued by the ACC and effective December1, 2008, provides for a cost of
service rate methodology for TEPs generation assets; an average base rate increase of 6% over
TEPs previous retail rates; a fuel rate included in base rates of 29 cents per kilowatt-hour
kWh; a PPFAC effective January1, 2009; a base rate increase moratorium through January1, 2013;
and a waiver of any claims under the 1999 Settlement Agreement. As a result of the 2008 TEP Rate Order, TEP reapplied regulatory accounting to its generation
operations. In addition, in December2008, TEP began deferring its mark-to-market adjustments for
derivative instruments that are expected to be recovered through the PPFAC as either regulatory
assets or regulatory liabilities. Purchased Power and Fuel Adjustment Clause PPFAC The TEP PPFAC became effective January1, 2009. The PPFAC allows recovery of fuel and purchased
power costs, including demand charges and the prudent costs of contracts for hedging fuel and
purchased power costs. The PPFAC consists of a forward component and a true-up component.   
The forward component of 018 cents per kWh became effective on April1, 2009, and will
be updated each year. The forward component is based on the forecasted fuel and purchased
power costs for the twelve-month period from April 1 to March31 the following year, less
the average base cost of fuel and purchased power of approximately 29 cents per kWh, which
is embedded in base rates.   
The true-up component will reconcile any over/under collected amounts from the preceding
12month period and will be credited to or recovered from customers in the subsequent year. TEP credited Fixed CTC revenue to be refunded $58million collected from May2008 to November30,
2008 to customers as an offset to the PPFAC rate. This credit will offset the forward and true-up
components of the PPFAC, resulting in a PPFAC charge of zero until the Fixed CTC revenue to be
refunded is fully credited, which is expected to occur over the next 36 to 48months beginning
April1, 2009. K-109 Table of Contents UNISOURCE ENERGY, TEP AND SUBSIDIARIES

The $12million amortization of the Fixed CTC Revenue to be Refunded appears in the accompanying
income statements as an addition to retail revenues in 2009. The $21million 2009 change in
Under-Recovered Purchased Energy Costs appears in the income statement as a credit to fuel and
purchased power costs in the line item Increase Decrease to Reflect PPFAC Recovery Treatment. For the purposes of reconciling fuel and purchased power to PPFAC revenues, including the credited
forward component, TEP will credit the allocable retail portion of the following against the PPFAC
eligible costs: 100% of short-term wholesale revenues; 10% of the annual profit on trading
activity; and 50% of the revenues from the sales of SO2 emission allowances. TEP had no
trading activities or sales of SO2 emission allowances in 2009. Ratemaking Methodology for Generation Assets Rates for generation service are based on a cost-of-service methodology. All generation assets
acquired by TEP between the end of the rate case test year December31, 2006 and the end of the
base rate increase moratorium period December31, 2012 shall be included in TEPs rate base at
their respective original depreciated cost, subject to subsequent review and approval by the ACC in
future rate cases. Luna is included in TEPs original cost rate base at its net book value of $48
million as of December31, 2006. Springerville Unit 1 non-fuel costs are being recovered through base rates at $2567 per kilowatt
kW per month, which approximates the levelized cost of Springerville Unit 1 through the remainder
of the lease term. Depreciation and Net Negative Salvage On December1, 2008, TEP implemented new depreciation rates that include a component for net
negative salvage value for all generation assets except Luna and new depreciation rates for
distribution and general plant assets that will extend the depreciable lives of these assets. The
estimated net impact on the income statement is to increase depreciation expense $9million per
year. K-110 Table of Contents UNISOURCE ENERGY, TEP AND SUBSIDIARIES

customer surcharges, of which $18million and $3million were expensed for REST projects,
respectively. At December31, 2009 and December31, 2008, $17million and $6million were recorded as a
current regulatory liability to be used in future periods, respectively. The approved REST adjustor mechanism allows TEP to file an application with the ACC to apply any
shortage or surplus in the prior years program expenses to the subsequent years REST surcharge. K-112 Table of Contents UNISOURCE ENERGY, TEP AND SUBSIDIARIES

Regulatory assets are either being collected in rates or are expected to be collected through rates
in a future period, as described below   
1.
Property Tax is recorded based on historical ratemaking treatment allowing recovery as
costs are paid out, rather than as costs are accrued. TEP records a regulatory property
tax asset related to its generation assets. While these assets do not earn a return, the
costs are fully recovered in rates over an approximate six month period.   
2.
Derivative Instruments represent the unrealized gains or losses on contracts entered
into to hedge the variability of purchased energy costs and short-term wholesale sales that
are expected to be recovered through the PPFAC. As a result of the 2008 TEP Rate Order and
the approval of the PPFAC, TEP deferred the gains and losses on certain contracts that meet
the recovery criteria under the PPFAC requirements.   
3.
Deregulation costs represent deferred expenses that TEP incurred to comply with various
ACC deregulation orders, the recovery of which has been authorized by the ACC in the 2008
TEP Rate
Order. These assets are included in rate base and consequently earn a return. TEP will
recover these costs through rates over a four-year period, beginning in December2008. K-113 Table of Contents UNISOURCE ENERGY, TEP AND SUBSIDIARIES
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS continued DRAFT Audit Committee
2/19/10   
4.
TEP does not earn a return on these assets.   
5.
San Juan Coal Contract Amendment costs of $15million were incurred by TEP in 2000. In
the 2008 TEP Rate Order, the ACC approved the recovery of $9million of these costs over a
nine-year period beginning in December2008. The current portion is recorded in Other
Assets. These assets do not earn a return.   
6.
Income Taxes Recoverable Through Future Revenues, while not included in rate base, are
amortized over the life of the assets. TEP does not earn a return on these assets.   
7.
Pension Assets. TEP records a regulatory pension and postretirement benefit asset
related to its employees. Based on past regulatory actions, TEP expects to
recover these costs in rates. TEP does not earn a return on these assets.   
8.
Final Reclamation and Retiree Health Care Costs represent costs associated with TEPs
jointly-owned facilities at San Juan, Four Corners and Navajo. TEP is required to
recognize the present value of its liability associated with final reclamation and retiree
health care obligations. As TEP is permitted to fully recover these costs through the
PPFAC when the costs are invoiced by the miners, TEP recorded a regulatory asset. TEP
expects to recover these costs over the life of the mines, which is estimated to be between
17 and 34years. TEP does not earn a return on these assets.   
9.
Unamortized Loss on Reacquired Debt Costs is amortized for rate recovery over the
remaining life of the related debt instruments over a period of 21years. TEP does not
earn a return on these costs. Regulatory liabilities represent items that TEP expects to pay to customers through billing
reductions in future periods or use for the purpose for which they were collected from customers,
as described below   
10.
Renewable Energy Standards Tariff RESTrepresents the REST surcharge collected in
excess of qualified renewable expenditures.   
11.
Net Cost of Removal for Interim Retirements represents an estimate of the cost of
future asset retirement obligations net of salvage value. These are amounts collected
through revenue for the net cost of removal of interim retirements for transmission,
distribution, general and intangible plant which are not yet expended. TEP collects
through revenue the net cost of removal of interim retirements for generation plant, which
it has not yet expended. Future Implications of Discontinuing Application of Regulatory Accounting TEP continues to apply regulatory accounting to its regulated operations. TEP regularly assesses
whether it can continue to apply regulatory accounting to these operations. If TEP stopped
applying regulatory accounting to its regulated operations, regulatory pension assets would be reflected in AOCI, and it would write-off the remaining related balances
of its regulatory assets as an expense and its regulatory liabilities as income on its income
statement. Based on the regulatory assets balances, net of regulatory liabilities, at December31,
2009, if TEP had stopped applying regulatory accounting to its regulated operations, it would have
recorded an extraordinary after-tax gain of $74million and an after-tax loss in AOCI of $48
million. While future regulatory orders and market conditions may affect cash flows, TEPs cash
flows would not be affected if TEP stopped applying regulatory accounting. UNS GAS RATES AND REGULATION 2008 General Rate Case Filing In November2008, UNS Gas filed a general rate case on a cost of service basis with the ACC
requesting a total rate increase of 6% to cover a revenue deficiency of $10million. The case uses
a June30, 2008 test year. UNS Gas expects the ACC to rule on its rate case in the first half of
2010. K-114 Table of Contents UNISOURCE ENERGY, TEP AND SUBSIDIARIES
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS continued DRAFT Audit Committee
2/19/10 Purchase Gas Adjustor PGAMechanism UNS Gas retail rates include a PGA mechanism intended to address the volatility of natural gas
prices and allow UNS Gas to recover its actual commodity costs, including transportation, through a
price adjustor. All purchased gas commodity costs, including transportation, increase the PGA
bank, a balancing account. UNS Gas recovers these costs or returns amounts over-collected from/to
ratepayers through a PGA rate. The PGA rate includes the following two components   
1
The PGA factor, computed monthly, is a calculation of the twelve-month rolling weighted
average gas cost, and automatically adjusts monthly, subject to limitations on how much the
price per therm may change in a twelve-month period. Effective December2007, the ACC
increased the annual cap on the maximum increase in the PGA factor from $010 per therm to
$015 per therm in a twelve-month period.   
2
At any time UNS Gas PGA bank balance is under-recovered, UNS Gas may request a PGA
surcharge with the goal of collecting the amount deferred from customers over a period
deemed appropriate by the ACC. When the PGA bank balance reaches an over-collected balance
of $10million on a billed basis, UNS Gas is required to request a PGA surcredit with the
goal of returning the over-collected balance to customers over a period deemed appropriate
by the ACC. The PGA surcharge was $005 cents per therm from January2007 through April2007. The PGA surcredit was $004 cents per
therm from October2007 through April2008. From May2008 through October2009, there was no
surcharge or surcredit in effect. In October2009, the ACC approved a $008 cent per therm PGA
surcredit, effective November2009 through October2010 or until the balance reaches zero. Based on current projections of gas prices, UNS Gas believes that the current PGA rates will allow
it to timely recover its gas costs. However, changes in the market price for gas, sales volumes
and surcharges could significantly change the PGA bank balance in the future. The following table shows the balance of over-recovered purchased gas costs

Regulatory assets are either being collected in rates or are expected to be collected through rates
in a future period, as described below   
Derivative instruments represent the unrealized gains or losses on contracts entered
into to hedge the variability of purchased energy costs that are expected to be recovered
through the PGA. UNS Gas does not earn a return on these costs.   
Pension assets represent the unfunded status of UNS Gas share of the UES pension and
other postretirement benefit plans that it expects, based on past regulatory actions, to
recover through rates. UNS Gas does not earn a return on these costs.   
Other Regulatory Assets consist of its 2007 rate case costs which are recoverable over 3
years. In addition, UNS Gas deferred its 2008 rate case costs and its low income
assistance program costs. UNS Gas requested recovery of these costs in its 2008 rate case
filing. UNS Gas does not earn a return on these costs. Regulatory liabilities represent items that UNS Gas expects to pay to customers through billing
reductions in future periods or use for the purpose for which they were collected from customers,
as described below   
Net Cost of Removal for Interim Retirements represents an estimate of the cost of future
asset retirement obligations. These are amounts collected through revenue for the net cost
of removal of interim retirements for which removal costs have not yet been expended. In
December2007, to comply with ACC requirements, UNS Gas reclassified $12million of Net
Cost of Removal for Interim Retirements from Accumulated Depreciation to a regulatory
liability. Income Statement Impact of Applying Regulatory Accounting If UNS Gas had not applied regulatory accounting, net income would have been $6million higher in
2009, and $9 million higher in 2007 as UNS Gas would have been able to recognize over-recovered purchased energy costs and unrealized gains on its
commodity derivative instruments as a reduction to its expenses in the income statement rather than record a regulatory liability. Net income would have been $4million lower in 2008 as UNS Gas would have recognized under-recovered purchased
energy costs and unrealized losses on its commodity derivative instruments as an expense to its income statement rather than a reduction to its regulatory
liability. Future Implications of Discontinuing Application of Regulatory Accounting UNS Gas regularly assesses whether it can continue to apply regulatory accounting. If UNS Gas
stopped applying regulatory accounting to its regulated operations,
regulatory pension assets would be reflected in AOCI and UNS Gas would write-off the
remaining related balance of its regulatory assets as an expense and write-off its regulatory liabilities as
income on its income statement. Based on the regulatory asset and liability balances, if UNS Gas
had stopped applying
regulatory accounting to its regulated operations, it would have recorded an extraordinary
after-tax gain of $13million and an after-tax loss in AOCI of $1million at December31, 2009.
Discontinuing application of regulatory accounting would not affect UNS Gas cash flows. K-116 Table of Contents UNISOURCE ENERGY, TEP AND SUBSIDIARIES

2/19/10 UNS ELECTRIC RATES AND REGULATION 2008 UNS Electric Rate Order In the May2008 rate order, the ACC approved a rate increase of 25% $4million effective June
2008. As a result of the May2008 rate order limiting recovery of deferred rate case costs, UNS
Electric expensed $03million of the $06million deferred costs in May2008. 2009 General Rate Case Filing In April2009, UNS Electric filed a general rate case with the ACC on a cost of service basis
requesting a total rate increase of 74% to cover a revenue deficiency of $135million. The case
uses a December31, 2008 test year. Hearings before an ACC administrative law judge concluded in
February2010. UNS Electric expects the ACC to rule on its rate case in the second half of 2010. Purchased Power and Fuel Adjustment Clause PPFAC UNS Electrics retail rates include a PPFAC, which allows for a separate surcharge or surcredit to
the base rate for delivered purchased power to collect under-recovered or return over-recovered
costs. Allowable PPFAC costs include fuel, purchased power less proceeds from most wholesale
sales and transmission costs. The PPFAC approved in UNS Electrics last rate case in May2008,
allows recovery of fuel and purchased power costs incurred to provide service to retail customers,
including demand charges and the prudent costs of contracts for hedging fuel and purchased power
costs. The PPFAC mechanism has a forward component and a true-up component. The forward component of the
PPFAC rate is based on the difference between forecasted fuel and purchased power costs and the
base cost of fuel and purchased power included in base rates. The true-up component reconciles the
previous years actual fuel and purchased power costs with the amounts collected through base and
PPFAC rates and credits or recovers that amount to or from customers in the subsequent PPFAC year.
The PPFAC rate will be updated on June 1 of each year, beginning June1, 2009. On June1, 2009, a PPFAC credit of approximately 106 cents per kWh took effect. The PPFAC rate
from June1, 2008 to May31, 2009, was a charge of approximately 15 cents per kWh. Base rates of
approximately 71 cents per kWh have been in effect since June1, 2008. The retail rates prior to
June2008, included a charge for fuel and purchased power of approximately 7 cents per kWh base
rate recovery of 52 cents per kWh and a transmission surcharge of 18 cents per kWh. The following table shows the balance of over-recovered purchased power costs

Rate case costs included in Other Regulatory Assets are included in rate base and
consequently earn a return. The recovery period is 3years. Regulatory liabilities represent items that UNS Electric expects to pay to customers through
billing reductions in future periods or use for the purpose for which they were collected from
customers, as described below   
Renewable Energy Standards Tariff RESTrepresents the REST surcharge collected in
excess of qualified renewable expenditures. The ACC approved a REST surcharge for UNS
Electric, effective June1, 2008, to allow UNS Electric to recover the cost of qualified
renewable expenditures, such as payments to customers who have renewable energy resources
or the incremental cost of renewable power generated or purchased by UNS Electric. Any
surcharge collected in excess of qualified renewable expenditures will be reflected in the
financial statements as a current regulatory liability. Conversely, qualified renewable
expenditures in excess of the REST surcharge will be reflected as a current regulatory
asset. The REST plan includes an adjustor mechanism which allows UNS Electric to file an
application with the ACC to apply any shortage or surplus in the prior years program
expenses to the subsequent years REST surcharge. K-118 Table of Contents UNISOURCE ENERGY, TEP AND SUBSIDIARIES
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS continued DRAFT Audit Committee
2/19/10   
UNS Electric defers differences between purchased energy costs and the recovery of such
costs in revenues. Future billings are adjusted for such deferrals through use of a PPFAC
approved by the ACC. The PPFAC allows for a revenue surcharge or surcredit that adjusts
the customers rate for delivered purchased power to collect or return under- or
over-recovery of costs.   
Net Cost of Removal for Interim Retirements represents an estimate of the cost of future
asset retirement obligations. These are amounts collected through revenue for the net cost
of removal of interim retirements for which removal costs have not yet been expended. In
June2008, to comply with ACC expectations, UNS Electric reclassified $7million of Net
Cost of Removal for Interim Retirements from Accumulated Depreciation to a regulatory
liability. Income Statement Impact of Applying Regulatory Accounting If UNS Electric had not applied regulatory accounting, net income would have been $7million higher
in 2009 and $1 million higher in 2007, as UNS Electric would have been able to recognize over-recovered purchased power costs and unrealized gains on its commodity derivative instruments as a credit to the income statement
rather than record an increase to regulatory liabilities. If UNS Electric had not applied regulatory accounting, net income would have been $15million lower in 2008 as UNS Electric would have recognized under-recovered
purchased energy and unrealized losses on its commodity derivative instruments as an expense to its
income statement, rather than as regulatory assets or a reduction to its regulatory liabilities. Future Implications of Discontinuing Application of Regulatory Accounting UNS Electric regularly assesses whether it can continue to apply regulatory accounting to its
operations. If UNS Electric stopped applying regulatory accounting to its regulated
operations, regulatory pension assets would be reflected in AOCI and
it would write-off the remaining related balances of its regulatory assets as an expense and
would write-off its regulatory liabilities as income on its income statement. Based on the
regulatory asset and liability balances, if UNS Electric had stopped applying regulatory accounting
to its regulated operations, it would have recorded an extraordinary
after-tax gain of $3million
and an after-tax loss in AOCI of $1million at December31, 2009. Discontinuing application of
regulatory accounting would not affect UNS Electrics cash flows. NOTE 3. SEGMENT AND RELATED INFORMATION We have three reportable segments that are determined based on the way we organize our operations

Fuel and Purchased Power Contracts TEP has long-term contracts for the purchase and delivery of coal and natural gas with various
expiration dates from 2010 through 2020. Amounts paid under these contracts depend on actual
quantities purchased and delivered. Some of these contracts include a price adjustment clause that
will affect the future cost. The table above also includes approximately $1million under
take-or-pay arrangements if certain minimum quantities are not transported in 2010. TEP expects to
spend more to meet its fuel requirements than the minimum purchase obligations outlined above. TEP has entered into agreements with utilities and other energy suppliers for purchased power to
meet system load and energy requirements, replace generation from company-owned units under
maintenance and during outages, and meet operating reserve obligations. In general, these
contracts provide for capacity payments and energy payments based on actual power taken under the
contracts. These
contracts expire in various years between 2010 and 2015. Certain of these contracts are at a fixed
price per MW and others are indexed to natural gas prices. The commitment amounts included in the
table are based on projected market prices as of December31, 2009. K-122 Table of Contents UNISOURCE ENERGY, TEP AND SUBSIDIARIES
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS continued DRAFT Audit Committee
2/19/10 Starting January1, 2009, fuel, purchased power and transmission costs are recoverable from
customers through a PPFAC. TEP has,
subject to ACC approval, entered into three long-term purchase power agreements with developing renewable energy
generation facilities that extend for periods of 15 to 20years. The facilities are expected to
begin commercial operation between 2010 and 2012. TEP is required to purchase the full output of
each facility. Expected capacities range from 2 MW to 25 MW. TEP is only obligated to pay for
actual energy delivered. There are no minimum payment obligations under these contracts. Operating Leases TEPs aggregate operating lease expense, which is primarily for office facilities and computer
equipment, with varying terms, provisions, and expiration dates, totaled $1million in 2009, $1
million in 2008 and $2million in 2007. Environmental Regulation Clean Air Act Requirements TEP generating facilities are subject to EPA limits on the amount of sulfur dioxide
SO2, nitrogen oxide NOx and other emissions released into the atmosphere.
TEP capitalized $24million in 2009, $73million in 2008 and $7million in 2007 in construction
costs to comply with environmental requirements, including TEPs share of new pollution control
equipment installed at San Juan described below. TEP expects to capitalize environmental
compliance costs of $8million in 2010 and $5million in 2011. In addition, TEP recorded operating
expenses of $13million in 2009, $14million in 2008 and $10million in 2007 related to
environmental compliance. TEP expects environmental expenses to be $11million in 2010. As a result of a 2005 settlement agreement between PNM, environmental activist groups, and the New
Mexico Environment Department PNM Consent Decree, the co-owners of San Juan installed new
pollution control equipment at the generating station to reduce mercury, particulate matter, NOx,
and SO2 emissions. TEP owns 50% of San Juan Units 1 and 2. The PNM Consent Decree
includes stipulated penalties for non-compliance with specified emissions limits at San Juan. In
2008 and 2007, TEPs share of stipulated penalties at San Juan was $1million and $2million,
respectively. TEP can not deduct these penalties for income tax purposes. TEP did not incur any
stipulated penalties at San Juan in 2009. The installation of new pollution control equipment
designed to remedy all emission violations was completed in 2008 for San Juan Unit 1 and in 2009 at
San Juan Unit 2. In April2009, APS received a request from the EPA under section 114 of the Clean Air Act seeking
information about Four Corners. Four Corners, which is operated by APS, is comprised of five
coal-fired generating units. TEP has a 7% ownership interest in two units, totaling 100 MW. APS
has responded to the EPAs request. TEP cannot predict the timing or outcome of this matter. In 1993, the EPA allocated TEPs generating units SO2 Emission Allowances based on past operational
history. Beginning in 2000, TEPs generating units were required to hold SO2 Emission Allowances
equal to the level of emissions in the compliance year or pay penalties and offset excess emissions
in future years. To date, TEP has had sufficient SO2 Emission Allowances to comply with the SO2
regulations.
TEP may incur additional costs to comply with future changes in federal and state environmental
laws, regulations and permit requirements at existing electric generating facilities. Compliance
with these changes may reduce operating efficiency. K-123 Table of Contents UNISOURCE ENERGY, TEP AND SUBSIDIARIES

UNS Gas purchases gas from various suppliers at market prices. However, UNS Gas risk of loss due
to increased costs as a result of changes in the market price of fuel is mitigated through the
use of the PGA, which provides for pass-through of most fuel costs to customers. UNS Gas forward
gas purchase agreements expire through 2012. Certain of these contracts are at a fixed price per
mmbtu and others are indexed to natural gas prices. UNS Gas has firm transportation agreements with
capacity sufficient to meet its load requirements. These contracts expire in various years between
2011 and 2024. At December31, 2009, UNS Electric had various firm non-cancelable purchase commitments as

UNS Electric enters into agreements with various energy suppliers for purchased power at market
prices to meet its energy requirements. In general, these contracts provide for capacity payments
and energy payments based on actual power taken under the contracts. These contracts expire in
various years through 2013. Certain of these contracts are at a fixed price per MW and others are
indexed to natural gas prices. The commitment amounts included in the table above are based on
market prices as of December31, 2009. UNS Electric imports the power it purchases over the Western Area Power Administrations WAPA
transmission lines. UNS Electrics transmission capacity agreements with WAPA provide for annual
rate adjustments and expire in 2011 and 2017. However, the effects of both purchased power and
transmission cost adjustments are mitigated through a purchased power rate-adjustment mechanism. UNS
Electric has subject to ACC approval, entered into one long-term purchase power agreement with a renewable energy
generation facility that extends for 20years. The facility is expected to begin commercial
operation in 2011. UNS Electric is required to purchase the full output of the facility with an
expected minimum capacity of 7 MW. UNS Electric is only obligated to pay for actual energy
delivered. There is no minimum payment obligation under this contract. In addition, UNS Gas and UNS Electrics combined operating lease expense, which is primarily for
office facilities and computer equipment, with varying terms, provisions, and expiration dates was
$1million in each of the years 2009, 2008 and 2007. UNS Gas and UNS Electrics estimated future
minimum payments under non-cancelable operating leases are approximately $1million per year from
2010 to 2011 and $2million thereafter. K-124 Table of Contents UNISOURCE ENERGY, TEP AND SUBSIDIARIES

2/19/10 MILLENNIUM COMMITMENTS Millennium has a remaining obligation to fund investments for capital and operations of less than
$1million over the next 3years. UNISOURCE ENERGY COMMITMENTS UniSource Energy purchased land and plans to construct a new headquarters building on the site.
The construction contract has not yet been executed; however, firm commitments related to the
design phase have been made requiring expenditures of $3million over the next 18months. TEP CONTINGENCIES El Paso Electric Transmission In 2006, El Paso filed a complaint to the FERC claiming that TEP must request service under El
Pasos Open Access Transmission Tariff OATTin order to transmit power from Luna to TEPs system.
TEP filed a counter complaint stating that TEP has existing rights under a 1982 Tucson-El Paso
Transmission Agreement and, therefore, is not required to pay for transmission service under El
Pasos OATT. On November13, 2008, the FERC issued an order supporting TEPs position. In
December2008, El Paso refunded to TEP $10million paid for transmission service from Luna during
the pendency of this dispute and interest of $1million. On January14, 2009, FERC granted El
Pasos request for a rehearing of this matter. TEP is no longer accruing for transmission service
under El Pasos OATT, however, due to the rehearing, TEP deferred recognition of a reduction in
transmission expense. In December2008, TEP filed a complaint in the United States Federal District Court against El Paso
seeking a $2million reimbursement from El Paso for transmission charges paid by TEP to PNM for
transmission service in an attempt to mitigate TEPs damages before FERC issued its decision in
November2008. On September10, 2009, the District Court denied El Pasos motion to dismiss TEPs
complaint and stayed the proceeding pending a final resolution of the FERC proceedings and any
appeal. TEP cannot predict the timing or outcome of these lawsuits. Claims Related to Navajo Generating Station In June1999, the Navajo Nation filed suit against Salt River Project, several Peabody Coal Company
entities including Peabody Western Coal Company, the coal supplier to Navajo Generating Station,
Southern California Edison Company, and other defendants in the U.S. District Court for the
District of Columbia D.C. Lawsuit. The D.C. Lawsuit alleges, among other things, that the
defendants obtained a favorable coal royalty rate of the lease agreements under which Peabody mines
coal by improperly influencing the outcome of a federal administrative process pursuant to which
the royalty rate was to be adjusted. The suit seeks $600million in damages, treble damages, and
punitive damages of not less than $1billion, and the ejection of defendants from all possessory
interests and Navajo Tribal lands arising out of the primary coal lease. In July2001, the U.S.
District Court dismissed all claims against Salt River Project. In March2008, the U.S. District
Court lifted a stay that had been in place since October2004 and referred pending discovery
related motions to a Magistrate judge. In June2009, the District Court ordered the parties to
complete fact discovery by February2010. In February2010, the District Court issued an Amended
Scheduling Order which extends the February2010 discovery deadline and sets other procedural
deadlines at various dates between March2010 and February2011. K-125 Table of Contents UNISOURCE ENERGY, TEP AND SUBSIDIARIES
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS continued DRAFT Audit Committee
2/19/10 In 2004, Peabody Western Coal Company Peabody filed a complaint in the Circuit Court for the City
of St. Louis, Missouri against the participants at Navajo, including TEP 75% owner, for
reimbursement of royalties and other costs arising out of the D.C. Lawsuit. In July2008, the
parties entered into a joint stipulation of dismissal of these claims which was approved by the
Circuit Court. TEP cannot predict whether the lawsuit will be refiled based upon the final outcome
of the D.C. Lawsuit. Claims Related to San Juan Coal Company San Juan Coal Company, the coal supplier to San Juan, through leases with the federal government
and the State of New Mexico, owns coal interests with respect to an underground mine. Certain gas
producers have oil and gas leases with the federal government, the State of New Mexico and private
parties in the area of the underground mine. These gas producers allege that San Juan Coal
Companys underground coal mining operations have or will interfere with their gas production and
will reduce the amount of natural gas that they would otherwise be entitled to recover. San Juan
Coal Company has compensated certain gas producers for any remaining gas production from a well
when it was determined that mining activity was close enough to warrant shutting down the well.
These settlements, however, do not resolve all potential claims by gas producers in the underground
mine area. TEP cannot estimate the impact of any future claims by these gas producers on the cost
of coal at San Juan. Environmental Reclamation at Remote Generating Stations TEP currently pays on-going reclamation costs related to the coal mines which supply the remote
generating stations, and it is probable that TEP will have to pay a portion of final reclamation
costs upon mine closure. When a reasonable estimate of final reclamation costs is available, the
liability is recognized as a cost of coal over the remaining term of the corresponding coal supply
agreement. At December31, 2009 and 2008, TEP recorded liabilities of $10million and $9million,
respectively, based on our $17million obligation at the expiration dates of the coal supply
agreements in 2011 through 2017. TEPs PPFAC, as approved in the 2008 TEP Rate Order, allows TEP to pass-through most fuel costs,
including final reclamation costs, to customers. Therefore, in 2008, when TEP reapplied regulatory
accounting to its generation operations, TEP reclassified these costs from fuel expense to a
regulatory asset. TEP will increase the regulatory asset and the liability over the remaining life
of the coal supply agreements on an accrual basis, and will recover the regulatory asset through
the PPFAC as final mine reclamation costs are paid to the coal suppliers. Amounts recorded for final reclamation are subject to various assumptions, such as estimating the
costs of reclamation, when final reclamation will occur, and the credit-adjusted risk-free interest
rate to be used to discount future liabilities. As these assumptions change, TEP will
prospectively adjust the expense amounts for final reclamation over the remaining coal supply
agreement term. TEP does not believe that recognition of its final reclamation obligations will be
material to TEP in any single year because recognition occurs over the remaining terms of its coal
supply agreements. TEP Wholesale Accounts Receivable and Allowances TEPs Accounts Receivable from Electric Wholesale Sales included $16million of receivables at
December31, 2008 related to sales to the California Power Exchange CPXand the California
Independent System Operator CISOin 2001 and 2000. TEP had recognized a related reserve of $14
million. There are currently pending several proceedings and lawsuits concerning the California
energy crisis related to the FERC, wholesale power suppliers, Southern California Edison Company,
Pacific Gas and Electric Company, the CPX and the CISO, where the parties are seeking refunds of $4
million. TEPs cost to litigate these matters is expected to increase substantially as the
proceedings enter the trial phase in 2010. In light of this, TEP re-engaged in settlement
discussions with the plaintiffs in the fourth quarter of 2009. In December2009, based on those
settlement discussions, TEP wrote off the remaining receivable balance of $2million and accrued an
additional liability of $2million. TEP believes it is adequately reserved but we cannot predict
the final outcome of the settlement discussions or lawsuits at this time. K-126 Table of Contents UNISOURCE ENERGY, TEP AND SUBSIDIARIES
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS continued DRAFT Audit Committee
2/19/10 Tucson to Nogales Transmission Line TEP and UNS Electric are parties to a project development agreement for the joint construction of
an approximately 60-mile transmission line from Tucson to Nogales, Arizona. UNS Electrics
participation in
this project was initiated in response to an order by the ACC to improve reliability to UNS
Electrics retail customers in Nogales, Arizona. In 2002, the ACC approved the location and construction of the proposed 345-kV line along a route
identified as the Western Corridor route subject to a number of conditions, including obtaining all
required permits from state and federal agencies. The U.S. Forest Service subsequently identified
a preference for a route identified as the Central Corridor route in the final Environmental Impact
Statement for the project. TEP is considering options for the project including potential new
routes. If a decision is made to pursue an alternative route, approvals will be needed from the
ACC, the Department of Energy, U.S. Forest Service, Bureau of Land Management, and the
International Boundary and Water Commission. As of December31, 2009, TEP had capitalized $11
million related to the project, including $2million of land and land rights. If TEP does not
receive the required approvals or abandons the project, TEP believes cost recovery is probable for
prudent and reasonably incurred costs related to the project as a consequence of the ACCs
requirement for a second transmission line serving the Nogales, Arizona area. Sierra Club San Juan Allegations In December2009, the Sierra Club sent TEP, the other owners of the San Juan Generating Station
SJGS, and San Juan Coal Company SJCC, a Notice of Intent to Sue RCRA Notice under the
Resource Conservation and Recovery Act RCRA. The RCRA Notice alleges that certain activities at
SJGS and the San Juan mine associated with the treatment, storage and disposal of coal and coal
combustion by-products CCBs are causing imminent and substantial harm to the environment and that
placement of CCBs at the mine constitute open dumping in violation of RCRA. Additionally, TEP
has been informed that the Sierra Club sent SJCC a separate Notice of Intent to Sue SMCRA Notice
under the Surface Mine Control and Reclamation Act SMCRAin December2009. The SMCRA Notice
similarly alleges damage to the environment due to activities at the San Juan mine, including the
placement of CCBs from SJGS in the surface pits at the mine. Both Notices state Sierra Clubs
intent to file citizens suits to pursue these claims upon expiration of the RCRA and SMRCA
statutory notice periods. If suits are filed, potential remedies include the imposition of civil
penalties and injunctive relief. TEP and Public Service Company of New Mexico, the SJGS operator,
plan an aggressive defense of the RCRA claims. TEP cannot predict the outcome of these matters at
this time. GUARANTEES AND INDEMNITIES In the normal course of business, UniSource Energy and certain subsidiaries enter into various
agreements providing financial or performance assurance to third parties on behalf of certain
subsidiaries. We enter into these agreements primarily to support or enhance the creditworthiness
of a subsidiary on a stand-alone basis. The most significant of these guarantees are   
UES guarantee of senior unsecured notes issued by UNS Gas $100million and by UNS
Electric $100million   
UES guarantee of the $60million UNS Gas/UNS Electric Revolver, and   
UniSource Energys guarantee of approximately $2million in building lease payments for
UNS Gas, and   
UniSource Energys guarantee of the $26million of outstanding loans under the UED
Credit Agreement. In February2010, UED increased its borrowings under this agreement to
$35million. As a result, UniSource Energy increased its guarantee to $35million. K-127 Table of Contents UNISOURCE ENERGY, TEP AND SUBSIDIARIES

taxes or fees due relating to the purchase. The terms of the indemnification do not include a
limit on potential future payments; however, we believe that the parties to the agreement have
abided by all tax laws and we do
not have any additional tax obligations. We have not made any payments under the terms of this
indemnification to date. K-128 Table of Contents UNISOURCE ENERGY, TEP AND SUBSIDIARIES

2/19/10 TEP DEBT 2009 Sale and Redemption of Bonds In October2009, the Pima Authority issued approximately $80million of its 2009 SeriesA
tax-exempt pollution control bonds 2009 Pima A San Juan Bonds for TEPs benefit. At the same
time, the Coconino County, Arizona Pollution Control Corporation Coconino PCC issued
approximately $15million of its 2009 SeriesA tax-exempt pollution control bonds 2009 Coconino A
Bonds for TEPs benefit. The 2009 Pima A San Juan Bonds are unsecured, bear interest at a rate of
495%, mature on October1, 2020, and are not callable prior to maturity. The 2009 Coconino A
Bonds are unsecured, bear interest at 5125%, mature on October1, 2032, and are callable in whole
or in part for cash at par beginning October1, 2019. Semi-annual interest payments on both series
of bonds are payable beginning April1, 2010. TEP capitalized approximately $1million in costs
related to the issuance of these bonds and will amortize the costs for each through the respective
maturity dates. The proceeds from the issuance of the 2009 Pima A San Juan Bonds and the 2009 Coconino A Bonds were
deposited with a trustee and were used on November2, 2009, to redeem approximately $80million of
695% 1997 SeriesA City of Farmington, New Mexico Pollution Control Bonds and approximately $15
million of 70% 1997 SeriesB Coconino County, Arizona Pollution Control Bonds. Collateral Trust Bonds In 1998, TEP issued a total of $140million, 75% Collateral Trust Bonds, due August, 2008. TEP
retired these bonds in 2008. See 2008 Pima A and 2008 Pima B Bonds below. 2008 Pima A Bonds In March2008, The Industrial Development Authority of Pima County Pima Authority issued, for the
benefit of TEP, approximately $91million of its 2008 SeriesA tax-exempt, unsecured, 6375% bonds
2008 Pima A Bonds due September1, 2029. The proceeds were used to redeem a corresponding
principal amount of bonds previously issued by the Pima Authority for TEPs benefit, which TEP
repurchased in 2005. In 2005, TEP did not cancel the repurchased bonds, which remained outstanding
under their respective indentures but were not reflected as debt on the balance sheet. As holder
of the repurchased bonds, TEP received the payment of the redemption price. TEP used the redemption proceeds to repay $75million in revolving loans outstanding under its
revolving credit facility. The remaining proceeds were used in May2008 to redeem $10million of
the $138million 75% Collateral Trust Bonds due August2008. TEP capitalized $1million of costs
related to the issuance of the 2008 Pima A Bonds and will amortize these costs through August2029,
the term of the bonds. Interest on the 2008 Pima A Bonds is payable semi-annually, commencing on September1, 2008. Beginning in March2013, TEP will have the option to redeem the 2008 Pima A Bonds, in whole or in
part, for cash, at a price equal to 100% of the principal amount, plus accrued interest. 2008 Pima B Bonds In June2008, the Pima Authority issued for TEPs benefit, $130million of its 2008 SeriesB
tax-exempt variable rate IDBs 2008 Pima B Bonds due September1, 2029. The 2008 Pima B Bonds
were supported by a letter of credit LOCissued under the TEP 2008 Letter of Credit Facility.
The LOC was secured by $132million of 1992 Mortgage Bonds. The proceeds were used to redeem a
corresponding principal amount of bonds previously issued by the Pima Authority for TEPs benefit
which TEP repurchased in 2005. TEP did not cancel the repurchased bonds, which remained
outstanding under their respective indentures but were not reflected as debt on the balance sheet.
As holder of the repurchased bonds being redeemed, TEP received the payment of the redemption
price. K-132 Table of Contents UNISOURCE ENERGY, TEP AND SUBSIDIARIES
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS continued DRAFT Audit Committee
2/19/10 TEP deposited the redemption proceeds with the trustee for its 75% Collateral Trust Bonds. In
August2008, the deposit was applied to the payment of $128million of principal plus $5million of
accrued interest on such bonds at maturity. TEP was required to deposit these funds with the
trustee pursuant to amendments dated May30, 2008 to the TEP Credit Agreement and the 2008 TEP
Letter of Credit Facility. These amendments allowed TEP to exclude the $128million of Collateral
Trust Bonds to be retired in August2008 from Total Indebtedness for the calculation of its
leverage ratio covenant at June30, 2008. While in the variable rate mode, the 2008 Pima B Bonds accrued interest at a rate which reset
weekly. The average weekly interest rate on the 2008 Pima B Bonds ranged from 050% to 825%, with
an average rate of 203% for 2008, and from 015% to 075%, with an average rate of 034% for 2009.
The peak weekly rate of 825% occurred in mid-September2008, when the short-term debt markets
began to experience significant disruptions related to the creditworthiness of several large
financial institutions. The rate on this debt was 030% and 075 respectively, as of December31,
2009 and 2008. TEP paid a remarketing fee of 10 basis points bpsto the remarketing agent of the
bonds, an LOC fee of 65 bps to the lenders, and an LOC issuing fee of 125 bps to the issuing bank. In January2010, TEP converted the interest on the 2008 Pima B to a fixed rate. The Pima B Bonds
were reoffered in January2010, with a term rate of 575% through maturity of September2029.
Interest is payable semi-annually beginning June1, 2010. The bonds are callable at par beginning
January2015. Accordingly, the associated LOC was terminated on January12, 2010 and the mortgage
bonds were canceled. TEP capitalized $1million of costs related to the issuance of the 2008 Pima B Bonds and will
amortize these costs through August2029. TEP capitalized approximately $2million of costs
related to the reoffering in January2010 and will amortize these costs through August2029. Variable Rate Industrial Development Bonds IDBs Weighted average interest rates on this variable rate tax-exempt IDBs debt ranged from 025% to
079% during 2009, and from 055% to 809% during 2008, and the average interest rate on such debt
was 041% in 2009, and 211% in 2008. In August2009, TEP entered into an interest rate swap that
had the effect of converting $50million of variable rate industrial development bonds to a fixed
rate of 24% from September2009 through September2014. 1992 Mortgage TEPs 1992 Mortgage creates liens on and security interests in most of TEPs utility plant assets,
with the exception of Springerville Unit 2. San Carlos Resources Inc., a wholly-owned subsidiary
of TEP, holds title to Springerville Unit 2. Utility Plant under Capital Leases is not subject to
such liens or available to TEP creditors, other than the lessors. The net book value of TEPs
utility plant subject to the lien of the indenture was approximately $2billion at December31,
2009. TEP CAPITAL LEASE OBLIGATIONS In January2010, TEP entered into an agreement to purchase 100% of the equity interest in Sundt
Unit 4 from the owner participant for $52million. The purchase price is subject to increase by
075% of the purchase price per month in the event that the purchase occurs after March31, 2010.
TEP expects to finalize the purchase prior to March31, 2010. Following the completion of the
transaction, TEP expects to repay the remaining Sundt Unit 4 lease obligation of $5million. K-133 Table of Contents UNISOURCE ENERGY, TEP AND SUBSIDIARIES

2/19/10 The terms of TEPs other capital leases are as follows   
The Springerville Common Facilities Leases have an initial term to December2017 for
one lease and January2021 for the other two leases, subject to optional renewal periods
of two or more years through 2025.   
The Springerville Unit 1 Leases have an initial term to January2015 and provide for
renewal periods of three or more years through 2030.   
The Springerville Coal Handling Facilities Leases have an initial term to April2015
and provide for one renewal period of six years, then additional renewal periods of five
or more years through 2035. Effective with commercial operation of Springerville Unit 3 in July2006 and Springerville Unit 4
in December2009, Tri-State and SRP are reimbursing TEP for various operating costs related to the
common facilities on an ongoing basis, including 14% each of the Springerville Common Lease
payments and 17% each of the Springerville Coal Handling Facilities Lease payments. TEP remains
the obligor under these capital leases, and Capital Lease Obligations do not reflect any reduction
associated with this reimbursement. Lease expenses reimbursed by Tri-State were $7million in each
of 2009, 2008 and 2007. TEP has agreed with the owners of Springerville Units 3 and 4 that, upon expiration of the
Springerville Coal Handling Facilities and Common Leases, TEP will acquire the leased interest in
the facilities at fixed prices of $120million in 2015, $38million in 2017, and $68million in
2021. Upon such acquisitions by TEP, each of the owners of Unit 3 and Unit 4 have the obligation
to purchase or continue renting from TEP a 17% and 14% interest, respectively, in such facilities.
On or before the Springerville Unit 1 Lease expiration date, TEP will determine if it will either:
a purchase the assets at the fair market value; b extend the lease term; or c not continue with
an interest in Springerville Unit 1. In January2010, through scheduled lease payments, TEP reduced its capital lease obligation by $40
million. Investments in Springerville Lease Debt and Equity In March2009, TEP purchased $31million of Springerville Unit 1 lease debt which included a
premium that will be amortized over the remaining term of the lease debt. TEPs investment in
Springerville Unit 1 lease debt totaled $88million at December31, 2009 and $59million at
December31, 2008. TEP also held an undivided equity ownership interest in the Springerville Unit
1 lease totaling $37million at December31, 2009 and $48million at December31, 2008. TEP held
an investment in Springerville Coal Handling Facilities lease debt totaling $7million at December
31, 2009 and $20million at December31, 2008. Interest Rate Swaps Springerville Common Facilities Lease Debt In June2006 and in May2009, TEP entered into interest rate swaps to hedge the floating interest
rate risk associated with the Springerville Common Facilities Lease debt. Interest on the lease
debt is payable at six-month LIBOR plus a spread. The applicable spread was 1625% as of December
31, 2009 and 15% as of December31, 2008. The swaps have the effect of fixing the interest rates
on the amortizing principal balances as follows

2/19/10 We have included the revolver borrowings in Long-Term Debt as UniSource Energy has the ability and
the intent to have outstanding borrowings for the next twelve months. As of February 25, 2010,
outstanding borrowings under the UniSource Energy Credit Agreement were $15million. Principal payments of $15million on the outstanding term loan are due quarterly, with the balance
due at maturity. We have the option of paying interest on the term loan and on borrowings under
the revolving credit facility at adjusted LIBOR plus 125% or the sum of the greater of the federal funds rate
plus 05% or the agent banks reference rate and 025%. The UniSource Energy Credit Agreement restricts additional indebtedness, liens, mergers, sales of
assets, and certain investments and acquisitions. We must also meet: 1a minimum cash flow to
interest coverage ratio for UniSource Energy on a standalone basis and 2a maximum leverage ratio
on a consolidated basis. In September2008, as a result of higher than expected fuel and purchased
power costs, UniSource Energy amended the UniSource Energy Credit Agreement to provide more
flexibility to meet the leverage ratio test for the next four calendar quarters, ending June30,
2009. In February2009, the leverage ratio in the UniSource Credit Agreement was further amended
through August2011. The leverage ratio is calculated as the ratio of consolidated total
indebtedness to consolidated earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization
EBITDA. As of December31, 2009, UniSource Energy was in compliance with the terms of its credit
agreement. UniSource Energy may pay dividends if, after giving effect to the dividend payment, it has more
than $15million of unrestricted cash and unused revolving credit. TEP CREDIT AGREEMENT The TEP Credit Agreement consists of a $150million revolving credit facility, and a $341million
LOC facility which supports $329million of tax-exempt Variable Rate IDBs. The TEP Credit
Agreement matures in August2011 and is secured by $491million of mortgage bonds issued under the
1992 Mortgage, which creates a lien on and security interest in most of TEPs utility plant assets.
The $150million revolving credit facility may be used for revolver borrowings as well as to issue
letters of credit. TEP issues letters of credit to provide credit enhancements to counterparties
for power and gas procurement and hedging activities. Interest rates and fees under the TEP Credit Agreement are based on a pricing grid tied to TEPs
credit ratings. Letter of credit fees are 045% per annum and amounts drawn under a letter of
credit would bear interest at LIBOR plus 045% per annum. TEP has the option of paying interest on
borrowings under the revolving credit facility at LIBOR plus 045% or the greater of the federal
funds rate plus 05% or the agent banks reference rate. The TEP Credit Agreement restricts additional indebtedness, liens, sale of assets and
sale-leaseback agreements. The TEP Credit Agreement also requires TEP to meet a minimum cash
coverage ratio and a maximum leverage ratio. If TEP complies with the terms of the TEP Credit
Agreement, TEP may pay dividends to UniSource Energy. In September2008, as a result of higher than expected fuel and purchased power costs, TEP amended
the TEP Credit Agreement, to provide more flexibility to meet the leverage ratio test for the next
four calendar quarters, ending June30, 2009. The leverage ratio is calculated as the ratio of
consolidated total indebtedness to EBITDA. As of December31, 2009, TEP was in compliance with all
the terms of its credit agreement. As of December31, 2009, TEP had $35million in borrowings and $1million outstanding in letters of
credit under its revolving credit facility. As of December31, 2008, TEP had $10million in loans
outstanding under its revolving credit facility and $1million outstanding in letters of credit.
The revolving loan balances are included in Current Liabilities in the UniSource Energy and TEP
balance sheets. The outstanding letters of credit are off-balance
sheet obligations of TEP. As of February25, 2009, TEP had
$50million in borrowings and $1million outstanding in letters of
credit under its revolving credit facility. K-136 Table of Contents UNISOURCE ENERGY, TEP AND SUBSIDIARIES

2/19/10 TEP Letter of Credit Facility In April2008, TEP entered into a three-year $132million letter of credit and reimbursement
agreement 2008 TEP Letter of Credit Facility. The 2008 TEP Letter of Credit Facility supported
$130million aggregate principal amount of variable rate tax-exempt IDBs that were issued on behalf
of TEP in June2008. See 2008 Pima B Bonds above. Interest rates and fees under the 2008 TEP Letter of Credit Facility were based on a pricing grid
tied to TEPs credit ratings. Based on TEPs current credit ratings, the letter of credit fees
were 065% per annum during the first two years and 0775% in the third year. The TEP Letter of Credit Facility contained substantially the same restrictive covenants as the TEP
Credit Agreement described above. As of December31, 2009, TEP was in compliance with all the
terms of the TEP Letter of Credit Facility. The TEP Letter of Credit Facility was terminated in
January2010 at the time of the fixed rate conversion of the 2008 Pima B Bonds See 2008 Pima B
Bonds above. UNS GAS/UNS ELECTRIC CREDIT AGREEMENT The UNS Gas/UNS Electric Revolver is a $60million revolving credit facility which matures in
August2011. Either UNS Gas or UNS Electric may borrow up to a maximum of $45million, so long as
the combined amount borrowed does not exceed $60million. UNS Gas is only liable for UNS Gas
borrowings, and similarly, UNS Electric is only liable for UNS Electrics borrowings under the UNS
Gas/UNS Electric Revolver. UES guarantees the obligations of both UNS Gas and UNS Electric. The
UNS Gas/UNS Electric Revolver may be used to issue letters of credit, as well as for revolver
borrowings. UNS Gas and UNS Electric issue letters of credit, which are off-balance sheet
obligations, to support power and gas purchases and hedges. UNS Gas and UNS Electric each have the option of paying interest at LIBOR plus 10% or the greater
of the federal funds rate plus 05% or the agent banks reference rate. The UNS Gas/UNS Electric Revolver contains restrictions on additional indebtedness, liens,
dividends, mergers and sales of assets. The UNS Gas/UNS Electric Revolver also contains a maximum
leverage ratio and a minimum cash flow to interest coverage ratio for each borrower. As of
December31, 2009, UNS Gas and UNS Electric were each in compliance with the terms of the UNS

2/19/10 UED BORROWINGS In March2009, UED entered into a 364-day, $30million senior secured term loan facility. The loan
is guaranteed by UniSource Energy and is secured by a lien of substantially all the assets of UED,
including the BMGS and an assignment of UEDs PPA with UNS Electric. UED has the option of paying
interest on the loan facility at LIBOR plus 3% or an alternative base rate plus 2%. The
alternative base rate is the greater of federal funds plus 05%, the agent banks reference rate or
one-month LIBOR plus 1%. The terms of the facility require UED to make quarterly excess cash flow
payments. UED paid $1million in debt issuance costs which are being amortized to interest expense
over one year, the term of the loan. UED used the proceeds of the loan to pay a dividend of $30
million to UniSource Energy. As of
December31, 2009, UED owed $26million under the senior secured term loan facility. In February
2010, UED amended its term loan facility to extend the termination date by two years to March2012
and had net additional borrowings of $9million bringing the outstanding balance to $35million. UED
capitalized less than $1million in costs related to the transaction. DEBT MATURITIES Long-term debt, including term loan payments, revolving credit facilities classified as long-term,

asset or transfer a liability at the measurement date. We use the following methods and
assumptions for estimating the fair value of our financial instruments   
The carrying amounts of our current assets and liabilities, including Current Maturities of
Long-Term Debt, UEDs term loan, and amounts outstanding under our credit agreements,
approximate their fair value due to the short-term nature of these instruments. Accordingly,
these items have been excluded from the table below. K-138 Table of Contents UNISOURCE ENERGY, TEP AND SUBSIDIARIES

Investments in Lease Debt and Equity: TEP calculated the present value of remaining cash
flows at the balance sheet date using current market rates with similar characteristics with
respect to credit rating and time-to-maturity. We also incorporated the impact of
counterparty credit risk using market credit default swap data.   
Fixed Rate Long-Term Debt: UniSource Energy and TEP used quoted market prices, where
available, or calculated the present value of remaining cash flows at the balance sheet date
using current market rates for bonds with similar characteristics with respect to credit
rating and time-to-maturity. We also incorporate the impact of our own credit risk using a
credit default swap rate when determining the fair value of fixed rate long-term debt.   
Variable Rate Long-Term Debt: TEP considers the principal amounts of variable rate debt
outstanding to be reasonable estimates of their fair value. The fair value of variable rate
long-term debt has also been adjusted for credit risk using a credit default swap rate. The use of different estimation methods and/or market assumptions may yield different estimated
fair value amounts. The amount recorded in the balance sheet carrying value and the estimated
fair values of our financial instruments included the following

See Note 6 for a description of TEPs investment in Springerville Lease Debt and Equity. TEP
intends to hold the $95million investment in Springerville Lease Debt Securities to maturity
Springerville Coal Handling Facilities lease debt totaling $7million matures through July1,
2011, and Springerville Unit 1 lease debt totaling $88million matures through January1, 2013.
This investment is stated at amortized cost, which means the purchase cost has been adjusted for
the amortization of the premium and discount to maturity. NOTE 8. STOCKHOLDERS EQUITY DIVIDEND LIMITATIONS UniSource Energy Our ability to pay cash dividends on Common Stock outstanding depends, in part, upon cash flows
from our subsidiaries: TEP, UES, Millennium and UED, as well as compliance with various debt
covenant requirements. As of December31, 2009, we complied with the terms of all such debt
covenant requirements. Because UNS and all of its subsidiaries are in compliance with their debt covenants at December31, 2009, there are no amounts of net income which are restricted. K-139 Table of Contents UNISOURCE ENERGY, TEP AND SUBSIDIARIES
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS continued DRAFT Audit Committee
2/19/10 In February2010, UniSource Energy declared a first quarter dividend to shareholders of $039 per
share of UniSource Energy Common Stock. The dividend, totaling approximately $14million, will be
paid on March8, 2010 to common shareholders of record as of February23, 2010. In 2009, UniSource
Energy paid quarterly dividends to the shareholders of $029 per share, for a total of $116 per
share, or $41million for the year. In 2008, UniSource Energy paid quarterly dividends to the
shareholders of $024 per share, for a total of $096 per share, or $34million, for the year.
During 2007, UniSource Energy paid quarterly dividends to the shareholders of $0225 per share, for
a total of $090 per share, or $32million, for the year. In 2008, UniSource Energys dividend to the shareholders of $34million exceeded its retained
earnings. As a result, we recorded dividends of $14million against retained earnings and
dividends of $20million against common stock. UniSource Energy has no additional paid-in capital. Such dividends do not
represent a return of capital dividend for income tax purposes. TEP TEP paid dividends to UniSource Energy of $60million in 2009, $3million in 2008, and $53million
in 2007. In 2009, TEP recorded $08million of dividend equivalents related to restricted stock
units as dividends. UniSource Energy is the holder of TEPs common stock. TEP met the requirements
discussed below before paying these dividends. UniSource Energy contributed capital to TEP of $30million in 2009 and $18million in 2007. Bank Credit Agreement TEPs Credit Agreement as of August2006 allows TEP to pay dividends as long as TEP complies with
the agreement and certain financial covenants including quarterly limits on the ratio of total
indebtedness to total earnings before interest expense/income, income taxes and non-cash items.
TEP is in compliance with these covenants. Federal Power Act This Act states that dividends shall not be paid out of funds properly included in capital
accounts. TEPs 2009, 2008 and 2007 dividends were paid from current year earnings. UNS Gas and UNS Electric The terms of the senior unsecured note agreements entered into by both UNS Gas and UNS Electric
contain dividend restrictions. See Note 6. UES did not pay any dividends to UniSource Energy in
2009, 2008 or 2007. UES made capital contributions to UNS Electric of less than $05million in 2008. UniSource Energy made no capital contributions to UNS Electric in 2009 and 2008. UniSource Energy
made capital contributions to UNS Electric of $10million in 2007. Millennium and UED Millennium paid dividends of $4million to UniSource Energy in January2010, $3million in 2009 25million in 2008 and $15million in 2007, all of which represented return of capital
distributions. UED paid dividends to UniSource Energy of $9million in February2010, $4million of which
represented return of capital distributions; $30million in 2009 which represented return of
capital distributions; and $05million in 2008. Millennium and UED have no dividend restrictions. K-140 Table of Contents UNISOURCE ENERGY, TEP AND SUBSIDIARIES

In 2008, it was determined that the environmental penalties at San Juan Generating Station would
not be deductible for income tax purposes. As a result, an additional $3million of tax expense
was recognized in 2008 for penalties incurred in the current and prior years. Other items included
in GAAP expense which will not be deductible for tax were offset by the recognition of income tax
credits. Income tax expense included in the income statements consists of the following

We record deferred income tax assets and liabilities for amounts that will result in tax deductions
or taxable income on future tax returns. We consider it more likely than not that all the deferred
tax assets will result in lower income taxes in the future. Consequently, we have not recorded a
valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets. K-141 Table of Contents UNISOURCE ENERGY, TEP AND SUBSIDIARIES

Deferred Income Taxes Current Assets at December31, 2009 and 2008 for UniSource Energy includes
$3million of deferred tax assets related to losses of a foreign investment held by a Millennium
subsidiary. Management plans to dispose of its investment in the foreign joint venture and
recognize the deferred losses on UniSource Energys federal and state income tax returns. This
recognition on filed tax returns will allow for realization of the deferred tax asset. If
management is unable to complete its plans to dispose of the joint venture, UniSource Energy may be
required to write off the deferred tax asset of $3million. At December31, 2008, UniSource Energy had $43million and TEP had $28million of state net
operating loss carryforwards which are expected to be used on the 2009 income tax returns.
Deferred tax assets also include $2million of federal and state capital loss carryforward at
UniSource Energy which is also expected to be fully used on the 2009 income tax returns. K-142 Table of Contents UNISOURCE ENERGY, TEP AND SUBSIDIARIES
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS continued DRAFT Audit Committee
2/19/10 Management believes that based on its historical pattern of taxable income, UniSource Energy will
produce sufficient income in the future to realize its deferred income tax assets. Deferred tax
assets are reduced by a valuation allowance when, in the opinion of management, it is more likely
than not that some portion or the entire deferred tax asset will not be realized. No valuation
allowance has been recorded to reduce the balance in deferred tax assets since management believes
it is more likely than not that UniSource Energy will be able to recognize the tax deductions on
future returns. The $13million income tax receivable at December31, 2008 is attributable to a 2008 net operating
loss which was carried back to prior years. Uncertain Tax Positions UniSource Energy and TEP adopted uncertain tax position accounting as of January 1, 2007. Accounting guidance requires us to determine whether it is more likely than not that we will
sustain a tax position under examination. Each tax position is measured to determine the amount of
benefit to recognize in the financial statements. The amount of unrecognized tax benefit reported
by UniSource Energy, all of which is recorded at TEP, was $19million at December31, 2009 and $20
million at December31, 2008. The following table shows the changes in unrecognized tax benefits

Unrecognized tax benefits which, if recognized, would reduce the effective tax rate, were $1
million at December31, 2009 and 2008 for both UniSource Energy and TEP. The $1million decrease in the balance of unrecognized tax benefits from 2008 to 2009 relates to $1
million of tax benefit attributable to tax positions taken in 2009 which may not be sustainable,
offset by the recognition of $1million of tax benefits from prior years and recognition of $1
million of tax benefits based on settlements with authorities. The balance in unrecognized tax
benefits could increase in the next twelve months as a result of the ongoing IRS audits, but the
amount of the increase cannot be determined. TEP recognizes interest accrued related to unrecognized tax benefits in Other Interest Expense in
the income statements. In 2009 $1million of interest expense was recorded and in 2008 no interest
expense was recognized. The balance of interest payable at December31, 2009 is $2million and at
December31, 2008 it was $1million. Penalties accrued are immaterial in amount. UniSource Energy and TEP have been audited by the IRS through tax year 2004 and are currently under
audit by the IRS for 2005, 2006, and 2008. Tax Year 2007 has not yet been selected for audit. The
fieldwork for the 2005 and 2006 audits is complete and the audits are effectively settled. The
2005 and 2006 audits closed in January2010. UniSource Energy and TEP have a current liability of
$2million for taxes and interest to settle 2005 and 2006 audits. We are unable to determine when
the 2008 audit will be completed. UniSource Energy and TEP are not currently under audit by any
state tax agencies. K-143 Table of Contents UNISOURCE ENERGY, TEP AND SUBSIDIARIES

2/19/10 NOTE 10. EMPLOYEE BENEFIT PLANS PENSION BENEFIT PLANS TEP, UNS Gas and UNS Electric maintain noncontributory, defined benefit pension plans for
substantially all regular employees and certain affiliate employees. Employees receive benefits
based on their years of service and average compensation. TEP, UNS Gas and UNS Electric fund the
plans by contributing at least the minimum amount required under Internal Revenue Service
regulations. We recognize the underfunded status of our defined benefit pension plans as a liability on our
consolidated balance sheets. The underfunded status is measured as the difference between the fair
value of the plans assets and the projected benefit obligation for pension plans. We recognize a
regulatory asset to the extent these future costs are probable of recovery in rates. In December
2008, as a result of the 2008 TEP Rate Order, TEP reapplied regulatory accounting to its generation
operations. Accordingly, TEP reclassified pension amounts related to its generation operations,
previously recognized in AOCI, to a regulatory asset. TEP also provides supplemental retirement benefits to certain employees whose benefits are limited
by IRS benefit or compensation limitations. Changes in benefit obligations are recognized as a
component of AOCI. Pension Contributions The Pension Protection Act of 2006 The Pension Act establishes minimum funding targets for
pension plans beginning in 2008. A plans funding target is the present value of all benefits
accrued or earned as of the beginning of the plan year. While the annual targets are not legally
required, if a plan does not meet the annual funding targets, the plans benefit payment options
are limited and a funding deficiency notice must be sent to all plan participants. All TEP, UNS
Gas and UNS Electric plans are in compliance with The Pension Act. UniSource Energy made pension plan contributions in 2009 of $25million, of which $23million was
made by TEP. In 2010,
UniSource Energy expects to contribute $22million to the
pension plans of which $20million will be made by TEP. TEP Salaried Employees Retirement Plan Amendment In August2009, TEP amended one of its defined benefit pension plans to limit early retirement
benefits for TEP non-union employees hired after June1, 2009 and to modify disability retirement
and survivor benefits for all TEP non-union employees. As a result of the pension plan amendment,
the plan assets and liabilities were remeasured as of August31, 2009. In performing the
remeasurement, management reviewed the key assumptions used to measure the plans benefit
obligation at December31, 2008 and to calculate pension expense for 2009. TEP determined that the
discount rate should be increased to 640% from the 630% rate assumed at December31, 2008. The
revised discount rate was determined using the same methodology as was employed at year-end 2008.
All other key assumptions, including the expected rate of return on assets, remained unchanged from
December31, 2008. The amendment reduced the annual expense for 2009 for the salaried plan by less than $1million to
$8million. The reduction in pension expense was recognized ratably from September to December of
2009. The remeasurement reduced the benefit obligation and corresponding regulatory asset by $8
million. In December2009, TEP amended its defined benefit pension plan for union employees to limit early
retirement benefits for TEP union employees hired on or after January1, 2011, modify disability
retirement and survivor benefits for TEP union employees, and modify maximum credited service
beginning in 2009. Because the amendment was in December, there was no additional remeasurement. K-144 Table of Contents UNISOURCE ENERGY, TEP AND SUBSIDIARIES
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS continued DRAFT Audit Committee
2/19/10 OTHER POSTRETIREMENT BENEFIT PLANS TEP provides limited health care and life insurance benefits for retirees. All regular employees
may become eligible for these benefits if they reach retirement age while working for TEP or an
affiliate. UNS Gas and UNS Electric provide postretirement medical benefits for current retirees
and a small group of active employees. In the 2008 TEP Rate Order, the ACC authorized accrual basis recovery of other postretirement
benefit plan costs based on a commitment to fund the plan. TEP established a Voluntary Employee
Beneficiary Association VEBAtrust in 2009 to fund its other postretirement benefit plan and
began funding the plan. TEP, UNS Gas and UNS Electric now record changes in their other
postretirement obligation, not yet reflected in net periodic benefit cost, as a regulatory asset,
as such amounts are probable of future recovery in rates. Amounts previously recorded in AOCI were
reclassified to a regulatory asset in 2008. The pension and other postretirement benefit related amounts excluding tax balances included in
the UniSource Energy balance sheet are

Net periodic benefit cost for the other postretirement benefit plan was remeasured as of January1,
2007 to reflect the plan amendment communicated to plan participants on January2, 2007. A
discount rate of 56% was used for the January2007 portion of the expense, while a discount rate
of 58% was used for the remaining eleven months. Net periodic benefit cost is subject to various assumptions and determinations, such as the
discount rate, the rate of compensation increase, and the expected return on plan assets. TEP, UNS Gas and UNS Electric use a combination of sources in selecting the expected long-term
rate-of-return-on-assets assumption, including an investment return model. The model used provides
a best-estimate range over 20years from the 25th percentile to the 75th
percentile. The model used as a guideline for selecting the overall rate-of-return-on-assets
assumption is based on forward looking return expectations only. The above method is used for all
asset classes. Changes that may arise over time with regard to these assumptions and determinations will change
amounts recorded in the future as net periodic benefit cost.

2/19/10 Pension Plan Investments Investment Goals Strategic asset allocation is the principal method for achieving each plans investment objective,
while maintaining an appropriate level of risk. We will consider the projected impact on benefit
security of any proposed changes to the current asset allocation policy. The expected long-term
returns and implications for Plan Sponsor funding will be reviewed in selecting policies to ensure
that current asset pools are projected to be adequate to meet the expected liabilities of the
Plans. We expect to use asset allocation policies weighted most heavily to equity and fixed income
funds, while maintaining some exposure to real estate and opportunistic funds. Within the fixed
income allocation, long-duration funds may be used to partially hedge interest rate risk. The plan
seeks to provide returns in excess of a portfolio benchmark. Risk Management We recognize the difficulty of achieving investment objectives in light of the uncertainties and
complexities of the investment markets. We also recognize some risk must be assumed to achieve a
Plans long-term investment objectives. In establishing risk tolerances, the following factors
affecting risk tolerance and risk objectives will be considered: 1 Plan status; 2 Plan Sponsor
financial status and profitability; 3 Plan features; and 4 workforce characteristics. We have
determined that the Plans can tolerate some interim fluctuations in market value and rates of
return in order to achieve long-term objectives. TEP tracks the plans portfolio relative to the
benchmark through quarterly investment reviews. The reviews consist of a performance and risk
assessment of all investment managers and on the portfolio as a whole. Investment managers for the
plan may use derivative financial instruments for risk management purposes or as part of their
investment strategy. Currency hedges have also been used for defensive purposes. Relationship between Plan Assets and Benefit Obligations The overall health of the Plan will be monitored by comparing the value of Plan obligations both
Accumulated Benefit Obligation and Projected Benefit Obligation against the market value of assets
and tracking the changes in each. The frequency of this monitoring will depend on the availability
of Plan data, but will be no less frequent than annually via annual actuarial valuation. The current target allocation percentages for the major categories or plan assets follow. For each
Plan, there is a range of /- 2% of the target allocation before the fund will be automatically
rebalanced. The hedge fund is being closed, and is currently in the redemption/liquidation
process.

UNS Gas and UNS Electric expect pension and postretirement benefit payouts of approximately $4
million in 2010 through 2014 and $7million in 2015 through 2019 to be made by the defined benefit
pension and postretirement plans. DEFINED CONTRIBUTION PLANS TEP, UNS Gas and UNS Electric offer defined contribution savings plans to all eligible employees.
The Internal Revenue Code identifies the plans as qualified 401k plans. Participants direct the
investment of contributions to certain funds in their account which may include a UNS stock fund.
TEP, UNS Gas, and UNS Electric match part of a participants contributions to the plans. TEP made
matching contributions to these plans of approximately $4million in each of 2009, 2008, and 2007.
UNS Gas and UNS Electric made matching contributions of less than $05million in each of 2009,
2008, and 2007. NOTE 11. SHARE-BASED COMPENSATION PLANS Under the 2006 Omnibus Stock and Incentive Plan, the Compensation Committee of the UniSource Energy
Board of Directors may issue various types of share-based compensation, including stock options,
restricted shares/units, and performance shares. The total number of shares which may be awarded
under the Plan cannot exceed 225million shares. At December31, 2009, the total number of shares
awarded under the 2006 Omnibus Stock and Incentive Plan was 1million shares. STOCK OPTIONS In February2009, the Compensation Committee of the UniSource Energy Board of Directors granted
248,760 stock options to officers with an exercise price of $2611. In 2008, the Compensation
Committee of the UniSource Energy Board of Directors granted 303,550 stock options to officers with
an exercise price of $2618. In 2007, the board granted 184,260 stock options to officers with an
exercise price of $3788. K-153 Table of Contents UNISOURCE ENERGY, TEP AND SUBSIDIARIES
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS continued DRAFT Audit Committee
2/19/10 Stock options are granted with an exercise price equal to the fair market value of the stock on the
date of grant, vest over three years, become exercisable in one-third increments on each
anniversary date of the grant and expire on the tenth anniversary of the grant. Compensation
expense is recorded on a straight-line basis over the service period for the total award based on
the grant date fair value of the options less estimated forfeitures. For awards granted to
retirement eligible officers, compensation expense is recorded immediately. One stock option award
accrues dividend equivalents that are paid in cash on the earlier of the date of exercise of the
underlying option or the date the option expires. Dividend equivalents are recorded as dividends
when declared. See discussion of dividend equivalents in Note 1. The fair value of each option award was estimated on the date of grant using the
Black-Scholes-Merton option pricing model with the assumptions noted in the following table. The
expected terms of the stock options granted in 2009 and 2008 were estimated using historical
exercise data. The expected term of 2007 options granted was estimated using a simplified method
which considered the 3year vesting period and the contractual term. The risk-free rate was based
on the rate available on a U.S. Treasury Strip with a maturity equal to the expected term of the
option at the time of the grant. The expected volatility for each award was based on historical
volatility for UniSource Energys stock for a period equal to the expected term of the award. The
expected dividend yield on a share of stock was calculated using the historical dividend yield with
the implicit assumption that current dividend yields will continue in the future.

2/19/10 RESTRICTED STOCK UNITS/AWARDS AND PERFORMANCE SHARES Restricted Stock Units Restricted stock and stock units are generally granted under the Plan to non-employee directors.
Restricted stock is an award of Common Stock that is subject to forfeiture if the restrictions
specified in the award are not satisfied. Stock units are a non-voting unit of measure that is
equivalent to one share of Common Stock. The directors may elect to receive stock units in lieu of
restricted stock. Restricted stock generally vests over periods ranging from one to three years
and are payable in Common Stock. Stock units vest either immediately or over periods ranging from
one to three years. The restricted stock units vest immediately upon death, disability, or
retirement. In the January following the year the person is no longer a director, Common Stock
shares will be issued for the vested stock units. Compensation expense equal to the fair market
value on the grant date is recognized over the vesting period. Fully vested but undistributed
stock unit awards accrue dividend equivalent stock units based on the fair market value of common
shares on the date the dividend is paid. The Compensation Committee of the UniSource Energy Board of Directors granted the following stock
units to non-employee directors   
May2009 21,886 stock units at a weighted average fair value of $2673 per share   
February2008 3,130 stock units at a weighted average fair value of $2875 per share   
May2008 18,448 stock units at a weighted average fair value of $3171 per share   
August2008 1,400 stock units at a weighted average fair value of $3215 per share,
and   
2007 17,857 stock units at a weighted average fair value of $3730 per share. Performance Share Awards In February2009, the Compensation Committee of the UniSource Energy Board of Directors granted
62,190 performance share awards targeted shares to Officers at a grant date fair value, based on
a Monte Carlo simulation, of $2162 per share. The performance share awards will be paid out in
shares of UniSource Energy common stock based on targeted, cumulative UniSource Energy Total
Shareholder Return during the performance period of January1, 2009 through December31, 2011
compared with Total Shareholder Return over the same period of an industry peer group. In February2008, the Compensation Committee of the UniSource Energy Board of Directors granted
49,120 performance share awards targeted shares to Officers at a grant date fair value, based on
a Monte Carlo simulation, of $1710 per share. The performance share awards will be paid out in
shares of UniSource Energy Common Stock based on UniSource Energys performance over the
performance period of January1, 2008 through December31, 2010. The performance criteria
specified in the awards is determined based on targeted UniSource Energy Total Shareholder Return
during the performance period compared to the Total Shareholder Return over the same period of an
industry or peer group. The performance shares vest based on goal attainment, upon completion of
the performance period; any unearned awards are forfeited. Compensation expense equal to the fair
value on the grant date is recognized over the vesting period if the requisite service period is
fulfilled whether or not the threshold is achieved. In March2007, the Compensation Committee of the UniSource Energy Board of Directors granted 37,270
performance share awards targeted shares to certain officers at a grant date fair value of $3556
per share market price of $3788 less the present value of expected dividends of $232. At
December31, 2009, upon completion of the 3-year performance period, 22,116 shares vested based on
achievement of targeted cumulative Cash Flows from Operations and cumulative Diluted Earnings per
Share over the performance period; 15,154 shares were unearned and forfeited. Compensation expense
equal to the fair market value on the grant date less the present value of expected dividends was
recognized over the performance period and adjusted for goals that were not achieved. In February
2010, the Board of Directors approved distribution of the 22,116 vested shares of UniSource Energy
Common Stock. K-156 Table of Contents UNISOURCE ENERGY, TEP AND SUBSIDIARIES

SHARE-BASED COMPENSATION EXPENSE Stock Options, Performance Shares and Restricted Stock Units Annually during 2007 through 2009, UniSource Energy and TEP recorded share-based compensation
expense of $3million and $2million, respectively. The actual tax deduction realized from the
exercise of share-based payment arrangements totaled $3million for 2009, $1million for 2008, and
$05million in 2007. We capitalize approximately 30% of share-based compensation costs as a cost
of construction. At December31, 2009, the total unrecognized compensation cost related to non-vested share-based
compensation was $2million, which will be recorded as compensation expense over the remaining
vesting periods through February2011. The total number of shares awarded but not yet issued,
including target performance based shares, under the share-based compensation plans at December31,
2009 was 2million. 2010 SHARE-BASED COMPENSATION AWARDS In February2010, the Compensation Committee of the UniSource Energy Board of Directors granted
93,720 performance share awards targeted shares. 50% of the performance share awards will be paid out in shares
of UniSource Energy Common Stock based on targeted, cumulative UniSource Energy Total Shareholder
Return during the performance period of January1, 2010 through December31, 2012, compared to the
Total Shareholder Return over the same period of an industry or peer group. The remaining 50% will
be paid out in shares of UniSource Energy Common Stock based on cumulative net income for the
3-year period ended December31, 2012. The performance shares vest based on goal attainment, upon
completion of the performance period; any unearned awards are forfeited. Performance shares are
eligible for dividend equivalents during the performance period. NOTE 12. FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS The following tables set forth, by level within the fair value hierarchy, UniSource Energy and
TEPs financial assets and liabilities that were accounted for at fair value on a recurring basis
as of December31, 2009. Financial assets and liabilities are classified in their entirety based

Energy Contracts include gas swap agreements Level 2, forward power purchase and sales
contracts Level 3, and forward power purchase contracts indexed to gas Level 3, entered into to
take advantage of favorable market conditions and reduce exposure to energy price risk. The
valuation techniques are described below.   6
Interest Rate Swaps are valued based on either the six-month LIBOR index or the Securities
Industry and Financial Markets Association SIFMA Municipal Swap index Level 2. K-159 Table of Contents UNISOURCE ENERGY, TEP AND SUBSIDIARIES
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS continued DRAFT Audit Committee
2/19/10 Energy Contracts TEP, UNS Gas, and UNS Electric primarily apply the market approach for recurring fair value
measurements and endeavor to utilize the best available information. Where observable inputs are
available for substantially the full terms of the asset or liability, such as gas swap derivatives
valued using New York Mercantile Exchange NYMEXpricing, adjusted for basin differences, the
instrument is categorized in Level 2. Derivatives valued using an aggregate pricing service or published prices that represent a
consensus reporting of multiple brokers are categorized in Level 3. For both power and gas prices,
TEP and UNS Electric obtain quotes from brokers, major market participants, exchanges or industry
publications as well as its own price experience from active transactions in the market. TEP and
UNS Electric primarily use one set of quotations each for power and for gas, and then use the other
sources as validation of those prices. The broker providing quotes for power prices states that
the market information provided is indicative only, but believes it to be reflective of market
conditions as of the time and date indicated. In addition, energy derivatives include contracts
where published prices are not readily available. These include contracts for delivery periods
during non-standard time blocks, contracts for delivery during only a few months of a given year
when prices are quoted only for the annual average, or contracts for delivery at illiquid delivery
points. In these cases, TEP and UNS Electric apply certain management assumptions to value such
contracts. These assumptions include applying percentage multipliers to value non-standard time
blocks, applying historical price curve relationships to calendar year quotes, and including
adjustments for transmission and line losses to value contracts at illiquid delivery points. We
also consider the impact of counterparty credit risk using current and historical default and
recovery rates as well as our own credit risk using credit default swap data. TEP and UNS Electric
review these assumptions on a quarterly basis. The fair value of TEPs and UNS Electrics purchase power call options is estimated using an
internal pricing model which includes assumptions about market risks such as liquidity, volatility,
and contract valuation. This model also considers credit and non-performance risk. UniSource
Energy and TEPs assessment of the significance of a particular input to the fair value
measurements requires judgment, and may affect the valuation of fair value assets and liabilities
and their placement within the fair value hierarchy levels. K-160 Table of Contents UNISOURCE ENERGY, TEP AND SUBSIDIARIES

Gains and losses on mark-to-market contracts include the reclassification of realized gains and
losses on the settlement of derivative contracts. All of the Level 3 unrealized gains and losses
are attributable to the change in fair value of Level 3 assets and liabilities held at the
reporting date. There were no transfers in or out of Level 3 derivatives. NOTE 13. UNISOURCE ENERGY EARNINGS PER SHARE EPS We compute basic EPS by dividing Net Income by the weighted average number of common shares
outstanding during the period. Except when the effect would be anti-dilutive, the diluted EPS
calculation includes the impact of shares that could be issued upon exercise of outstanding stock
options, contingently issuable shares under equity-based awards or common shares that would result
from the conversion of convertible notes. The numerator in calculating diluted earnings per share
is Net Income adjusted for the interest on convertible notes net of tax that would not be paid if
the notes were converted to common shares. The following table shows the effects of potentially dilutive common stock on the weighted average

2/19/10 For the year ended December31, 2008, 4million potentially dilutive shares from the conversion of
convertible senior notes, and after-tax interest expense of $4million was not included in the
computation of diluted EPS because to do so would be anti-dilutive. Stock options to purchase an average of 395,000, 312,000 and 169,000 shares of Common Stock were
outstanding during 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively, but were not included in the computation of
EPS because the stock options exercise price was greater than the average market price of the
Common Stock at year end. NOTE 14. RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS UniSource Energy incurs corporate costs that are allocated to its subsidiaries, including TEP.
Corporate costs are allocated based on a weighted-average of three factors: assets, payroll and
revenues. Management believes this method of allocation is reasonable and approximates the cost
that TEP and its other affiliates would have incurred as stand-alone entities. Charges allocated
to TEP were $7million in each of 2009, 2008 and 2007. Charges allocated to UNS Gas and UNS
Electric were $1million in each of 2009, 2008 and 2007. TEP provides all corporate services finance, accounting, tax, information technology services,
etc. to UniSource Energy, UNS Gas and UNS Electric as well as to UniSource Energys non-utility
businesses. Costs are directly assigned to the benefiting entity where possible. Common costs are
allocated on a cost-causative basis. Management believes this method of allocation is reasonable.
The charges by TEP to the other companies were $15million in 2009 and 2008, and $14
million in 2007. TEP and UNS Electric began selling power to each other in 2008 at prices based on the Dow Jones
Four Corners Daily Index. TEP had wholesale power sales to UNS Electric of $23million in 2009 and
$25million in 2008. UNS Electric had wholesale power sales to TEP of $4million in 2009 and $9
million in 2008. TEP charged UNS Electric $3million for control area services in 2009 and $2million in 2008. No
such services were provided in 2007. In May2008, UED began providing energy from its Black Mountain Generating Station BMGSto UNS
Electric, through a power sale agreement. UED charged UNS Electric $12million in 2009 and $7
million in 2008 for this energy. UNS Gas charged UNS Electric $5million for gas used by the BMGS
facility in 2009 and $7million in 2008. In 2008, UNS Gas charged UED $1million for gas used by
BMGS facility. Southwest Energy Solutions, Inc. SES, a subsidiary of Millennium, provides a supplemental
workforce for TEP and UNS Electric. Types of services provided for TEP include dusk to dawn
lighting, facilities maintenance, meter reading, transmission and distribution, line locating,
fleet support, and general supplemental support. SES bills TEP for these services. Management
believes that the charges for services are reasonable and approximate the cost that TEP would have
incurred if it performed these services directly. SES charged TEP $15million in 2009, $15million
in 2008 and $14million in 2007 for these services. SES provides meter reading services for UNS
Electric. SES charged UNS Electric $1million for these services in 2009, 2008 and 2007. K-162 Table of Contents UNISOURCE ENERGY, TEP AND SUBSIDIARIES

2/19/10 NOTE 15. SALE OF MILLENNIUMS INVESTMENT IN SABINAS In June2009, Millennium finalized a sale of its 50% equity interest in Carboelectrica Sabinas, S.
de R.L. de C.V. Sabinas, a Mexican limited liability company. Millennium received an upfront
payment of $5million in January2009 and a $15million, three-year, 6%, secured note receivable
from Minerales de Monclova, S.A. de C.V. Mimosa. Principal on the note is due at maturity;
interest on the note is due annually on December31. The $15million note is included in
Investments and Other Property Other on UniSource Energys balance sheet. Millennium recorded a
$6million pre-tax gain on the sale included in Other Income on UniSource Energys income
statement. NOTE 16. RECENTLY ISSUED ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS The following recently issued accounting standards are not yet reflected in the UniSource Energy
and TEPs financial statements   
The FASB issued authoritative guidance for transfers of financial assets that clarify
and change the criteria for a transfer to be accounted for as a sale, change the amount of
a recognized gain/loss on a sale when beneficial interests are received by the transferor,
and requires extensive disclosures. This standard is effective for interim and annual
periods beginning January1, 2010. To date, we have not participated in any transfers to
which this guidance is applicable.   
The FASB issued authoritative guidance for variable interest entities requiring an
analysis to determine whether the enterprises variable interest or interests give it a
controlling financial interest in a variable interest entity. This standard did not have a
material impact on our financial statements on adoption on January1, 2010.   
The FASB issued authoritative guidance for multiple deliverable revenue arrangements
that provides another alternative for determining the selling price of deliverables and
eliminates the residual method of allocating consideration. In addition, this
pronouncement requires expanded qualitative and quantitative disclosures and is effective
for revenue arrangements entered into after January1, 2011. We are evaluating the impact
of this pronouncement.   
The FASB issued amendments that require some new disclosures and clarify some existing
disclosure requirements about fair value measurements. The amendments are effective for
interim and annual reporting periods beginning January1, 2010, except for disclosures
about purchases, sales, issuances, and settlements in the roll forward of activity in level
3 fair value measurements, which are effective for interim and annual reporting periods
beginning January1, 2011. We are evaluating the impact of these new and revised
disclosures on our financial statements. K-163 Table of Contents

UED prepaid $2million for its LIBOR borrowing with Union Bank on July28 and again on October30,
2009 in accordance with the terms of the UED Credit Agreement. In August and November2009,
the deposits were applied to the $30million principal giving rise to a $4million non-cash
financing activity that affected recognized assets and liabilities but did not result in cash
receipts or payments. The proceeds from the issuance of the 2009 Pima A San Juan Bonds and the 2009 Coconino A Bonds
were deposited with a trustee and were used in November 2009, to redeem approximately $80 million of 695% 1997 Series A City of Farmington, New Mexico Pollution Control
Bonds and approximately $15 million of 70% 1997 Series B Coconino County, Arizona Pollution Control Bonds. TEP had no cash receipts or payments as a result of this transaction.
In the third quarter of 2008, TEP deposited the Pima B redemption proceeds for its 75% collateral
trust bonds with a trustee. On August1, 2008, the deposit was applied to the payment of $128
million of principal plus $5million of accrued interest upon maturity of the bonds giving rise to
a $128million non-cash financing activity that affected recognized assets and liabilities but did

Regulatory Treatment of Commodity Derivatives Prior to December2008, unrealized gains and losses resulting from changes in the market prices of
non-trading hedges or short-term forward power sales contracts were recorded on the same line in
the income statement as the hedged transaction. Beginning in December2008, as a result of the
2008 TEP Rate Order, which permits the recovery of prudent costs associated with hedging contracts
through the PPFAC, unrealized gains and losses are recorded as either a regulatory asset or
regulatory liability. K-166 Table of Contents

Audit Committee 2/19/10 UniSource Energy and TEP report unrealized gains and losses on energy contracts that are
recoverable through the PPFAC or PGA on the balance sheet as a regulatory asset or a regulatory
liability rather than as a component of AOCI or in the income statement. UniSource Energy recorded
decreases to regulatory balances of $29million and increases of $65million in 2009 and 2008,
respectively. In 2007, UniSource Energy recorded an increase to regulatory balances of $6million.
TEP recorded decreases to regulatory balances of $11million and increases of $19million in 2009
and 2008, respectively. Realized gains and losses on settled gas swaps are fully recovered through
the PPFAC or PGA. In 2009, 2008, and 2007, UniSource Energy realized losses of $51million, $9
million and $9million, respectively. TEP realized losses of $29million, $4million and $9
million in 2009, 2008, and 2007, respectively. At December31, 2009, TEP had contracts that will settle through the third quarter of 2015; UNS
Electric had contracts that will settle through the fourth quarter of 2013; and UNS Gas had
contracts that will settle through the fourth quarter of 2012. Other Commodity Derivatives UniSource Energy and TEP record unrealized gains and losses on energy trading contracts in

Credit Risk Adjustment When the fair value of our derivative contracts are reflected as an asset, the counterparty owes us
and this creates credit risk. We minimize our credit risk by 1entering into transactions with
high-quality counterparties; 2limiting our exposure to each counterparty; 3monitoring the
financial condition of the counterparties; and 4requiring collateral in accordance with the
counterparty master agreements. Using a combination of market credit default swap data and
historical recovery rates for subordinated bonds, we consider the impact of counterparty credit
worthiness in determining the fair value of our derivatives as well as its possible effect on
continued qualification for cash flow hedge accounting. At December31, 2009, and December31,
2008, the impact of counterparty credit risk on the fair value of derivative asset contracts was
less than $05million. We also consider the impact of our own credit risk on instruments that are in a net liability
position, after deducting collateral posted, using market credit default swap data and allocating
the credit risk adjustment to all individual contracts in a net liability position. At December
31, 2009, and December31, 2008, the impact of our own credit risk was less than $05million. K-167 Table of Contents   
UNISOURCE ENERGY, TEP AND SUBSIDIARIES
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS continued DRAFT
Audit Committee 2/19/10 CONCENTRATION OF CREDIT RISK The use of contractual arrangements to manage the risks associated with changes in energy commodity
prices creates credit risk exposure resulting from the possibility of nonperformance by
counterparties pursuant to the terms of their contractual obligations. TEP, UNS Gas and UNS
Electric enter into contracts for the physical delivery of energy and gas which contain remedies in
the event of non-performance by the supply counterparties. In addition, volatile energy prices can
create significant credit exposure from energy market receivables and mark-to-market valuations. TEP, UNS Gas and UNS Electric have contractual agreements for their energy procurement and hedging
activities that contain certain provisions that require each company to post collateral under
certain circumstances. These circumstances include credit rating downgrades, or a failure to meet
certain financial ratios. In the event that such credit events were to occur, TEP, UNS Gas and UNS
Electric would have to provide certain credit enhancements in the form of cash or letters of credit
to fully collateralize their exposure to these counterparties. The following table shows the sum of the fair value of all derivative instruments along with net
payable position under contracts with credit-risk-related contingent features that are in a net
liability position at December31, 2009. It also
shows cash collateral and letters of credit posted, and additional collateral to be posted if
credit-risk related contingent features were triggered.

Item4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES UniSource Energy and TEPs Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer supervised and
participated in UniSource Energy and TEPs evaluation of their disclosure controls and procedures
as such term is defined under Rule13a 15e or Rule15d 15e under the Securities Exchange
Act of 1934, as amended the Exchange Act, as of December31, 2009. Disclosure controls and
procedures are controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed
in UniSource Energy and TEPs periodic reports filed or submitted under the Exchange Act, is
recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the Securities
and Exchange Commissions rules and forms. These disclosure controls and procedures are also
designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by UniSource Energy and TEP in the
reports that they file or submit under the Act is accumulated and communicated to management,
including the principal executive and principal financial officers, or person performing similar
functions, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Based upon the
evaluation performed, UniSource Energy and TEPs Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial
Officer concluded that UniSource Energy and TEPs disclosure controls and procedures are effective. While UniSource Energy and TEP continually strive to improve their disclosure controls and
procedures to enhance the quality of their financial reporting, there has been no change in
UniSource Energy or TEPs internal control over financial reporting during the fourth quarter of
2009, that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, UniSource Energy
or TEPs internal control over financial reporting. UniSource Energys and TEPs Managements Reports on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting
Under 404 of Sarbanes-Oxley appear as the first two reports under Item8 in UniSource Energys and
TEPs 2009 Annual Report on Form 10-K, the Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm
for UniSource Energy appears as the third report under Item8, and the Report of Independent
Registered Public Accounting Firm for TEP appears as the fourth report under Item8. Item1A. Risk Factors
