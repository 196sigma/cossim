30             INDEPENDENT AUDITORS' REPORT The Board of Directors and Shareholders
Antares Pharma, Inc.   We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Antares
Pharma, Inc. and subsidiaries the Company as of December 31, 2000 and 2001,
and the related consolidated statements of operations, shareholders' equity
deficit and comprehensive loss, and cash flows for each of the years in the
three-year period ended December 31, 2001. These financial statements are the
responsibility of the Company management. Our responsibility is to express an
opinion on these financial statements based on our audits.
We conducted our audits in accordance with auditing standards generally
accepted in the United States of America. Those standards require that we plan
and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial
statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a
test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial
statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and
significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall
financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a
reasonable basis for our opinion.
In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above
present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Antares
Pharma, Inc. and subsidiaries as of December 31, 2000 and 2001, and the results
of their operations and their cash flows for each of the years in the three-year
period ended December 31, 2001, in conformity with accounting principles
generally accepted in the United States of America.
The accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared
assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern. As discussed in Note
2 to the financial statements, the Company has negative working capital and has
suffered recurring losses and negative cash flows from operations that raise
substantial doubt about its ability to continue as a going concern. Management
plans in regard to these matters are also described in Note 2. The financial
statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of
this uncertainty.
As discussed in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements, the
Company adopted the cumulative deferral method of revenue recognition for
licensing arrangements in 2000.                                KPMG LLP Minneapolis, Minnesota

Business
The Company develops, produces and markets pharmaceutical delivery
solutions, including needle-free and mini-needle injector systems, gel
technologies and transdermal products. The Company currently distributes its
needle-free injector systems for the delivery of insulin and growth hormone in
more than 20 countries and an estradiol transdermal patch for hormone
replacement therapy. In addition, the Company has several products and compound
formulations under development and is conducting ongoing research to create new
products and formulations that combine various elements of the Company
technology portfolio. The corporate headquarters are located in Exton,
Pennsylvania, with research and production facilities in Minneapolis, Minnesota,
and research facilities in Basel, Switzerland.
Basis of Presentation
In July 2000, Medi-Ject Corporation, now known as Antares Pharma, Inc.
Antares or the Company, entered into a Purchase Agreement with Permatec
Holding AG Permatec, Permatec Pharma AG, Permatec Technology AG, and
Permatec NV. Pursuant to the Purchase Agreement, on January 31, 2001, Antares
purchased all of the outstanding shares of the three Permatec Subsidiaries the
Share Transaction. In exchange, Antares issued 2,900,000 shares of Antares
common stock to Permatec. Upon the issuance, Permatec owned approximately 67% of
the outstanding shares of Antares common stock. For accounting purposes,
Permatec is deemed to have acquired Antares. The acquisition has been accounted
for by the purchase method of accounting. The financial statements and related
disclosures that were previously reported for Medi-Ject have been replaced with
the Permatec financial statements and disclosures. The operating financial
history of Antares has become that of Permatec.
As of January 31, 2001, Permatec had two other subsidiaries that were not
sold pursuant to the Purchase Agreement and they are in the process of being
dissolved. All assets and liabilities relating to those two subsidiaries remain
with Permatec and did not form part of the Share Transaction.
Principles of Consolidation
As discussed in Note 3, on January 31, 2001 the Company completed a
business combination to acquire the three operating subsidiaries of Permatec
Holding AG Permatec, headquartered in Basel, Switzerland. The accompanying
consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Antares Pharma, Inc.
and its three wholly-owned subsidiaries. All significant intercompany accounts
and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.
Foreign Currency Translation
The Company has determined that the Swiss Franc is the functional currency
for its three subsidiaries under Financial Accounting Standards board Statement
No. 52, Foreign Currency Translation. The reporting currency for the Company
is the United States Dollar USD. The financial statements of the Company
three subsidiaries are translated into USD for consolidation purposes. All
assets and liabilities are translated using period-end exchange rates and
statements of operations items are translated using average exchange rates for
the period. The resulting translation adjustments are recorded as a separate
component of shareholders' equity. Foreign currency transaction gains and losses
are included in the statements of operations.
Cash Equivalents
The Company considers highly liquid debt instruments with original
maturities of 90 days or less to be cash equivalents.

Inventories
Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market. Cost is determined
on a first-in, first-out basis. Certain components of the Company products are
provided by a limited number of vendors. Disruption of supply from key vendors
may have a material adverse impact on the Company operations.
Inventory Reserves
The Company records reserves for inventory shrinkage and for potentially
excess, obsolete and slow moving inventory. The amounts of these reserves are
based upon inventory levels, expected product lives and forecasted sales demand.
Although management believes the likelihood to be relatively low, results could
be materially different if demand for the Company products decreased because
of economic or competitive conditions, or if products became obsolete because of
technical advancements in the industry or by the Company. The Company has
recorded inventory reserves of approximately $105,000 at December 31, 2001.
Equipment, Furniture, and Fixtures
Equipment, furniture, and fixtures are stated at cost and are depreciated
using the straight-line method over their estimated useful lives ranging from
three to ten years. Certain equipment and furniture held under capital leases is
classified in equipment, furniture and fixtures and is amortized using the
straight-line method over the lesser of the lease term or estimated useful life,
and the related obligations are recorded as liabilities. Lease amortization is
included in depreciation expense.
Patent Rights
The Company capitalizes the cost of obtaining patent rights. These
capitalized costs are being amortized on a straight-line basis over periods
ranging from six to ten years beginning on the earlier of the date the patent is
issued or the first commercial sale of product utilizing such patent rights.
Recoverability of such patent assets is evaluated on a quarterly basis.
Goodwill
Goodwill arising from the purchase of minority ownership interests in 1996
was amortized on a straight-line basis over a period of five years. Goodwill
arising from the Share Transaction described in Note 3 is being amortized on a
straight-line basis over a period of ten years. The recoverability of goodwill
is determined based on analysis of the net present value of projected related
revenue.
Other Intangible Assets
Other intangible assets include values assigned to workforce, ISO
certification and clinical studies and are being amortized over estimated useful
lives which range from five to ten years.
Impairment of Long-Lived Assets and Long-Lived Assets to Be Disposed Of
Long-lived assets and certain identifiable intangibles are reviewed for
impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the
carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. Recoverability of assets to
be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset
to future net cash flows expected to be generated by the asset. If such assets
are considered to be impaired, the impairment to be recognized is measured by
the amount by which the carrying amount of the assets exceeds the fair value of
the assets. Assets to be disposed of are reported at the lower of the carrying
amount or fair value less costs to sell.

Continued
Fair Value of Financial Instruments
All financial instruments are carried at amounts that approximate estimated
fair value. At December 31, 2000 it was not practicable to estimate the fair
value of the subordinated loans from shareholders, because of the lack of quoted
market prices for similar investments, and such loans can only be repaid after
achievement of positive shareholders' equity as defined by Swiss statutory
regulations.
Revenue Recognition
Sales and related costs are recognized upon shipment of product to
customers. The majority of the Company sales are made to distributors under
sales terms that provide no right of return outside of the Company standard
warranty policy. Sales terms and pricing extended to the Company distributors
are governed by the respective distribution agreements.
Licensing and Product Development Revenue Recognition
In December 1999, the Securities and Exchange Commission issued Staff
Accounting Bulletin SAB No. 101 which provides the Staff views in applying
generally accepted accounting principles to selected revenue recognition issues.
The SAB provides additional guidance on when revenue is realized, earned and
properly recognized. The Company elected to adopt the cumulative deferral method
for recognizing milestone revenues beginning with the fourth quarter of fiscal
2000. This method defers milestone payments with amortization to income over the
contract term using the percentage of completion or straight-line basis
commencing with the achievement of a contractual milestone. If the Company is
required to refund any portion of a milestone payment, the milestone will not be
amortized into revenue until the repayment obligation no longer exists.
Upon adoption of the cumulative deferral method, the Company recognized a
cumulative effect adjustment that increased its losses by $1,059,622 or $025
per share as of January 1, 2000. For the years ended December 31, 2000 and 2001,
the Company recognized $277,200 and $267,180, respectively, of license revenues
that were deferred at January 1, 2000 as the result of the adoption of the
cumulative deferral method.
Prior to the adoption of the cumulative deferral method, licensing and
product development revenue was recognized when underlying performance criteria
for payment had been met and the Company had an unconditional right to such
payment. Depending on a license or product development agreement terms,
recognition criteria was satisfied upon achievement of milestones or passage of
time. Milestone payments were typically triggered by the successful achievement
of important events such as the completion of clinical studies, filings with the
FDA, bioequivalence to other drugs, and approval by the FDA as defined by the
underlying licensing and product development agreement. The Company classified
amounts received related to the performance of a series of tasks, e.g. testing
the transdermal penetration of a drug, manufacture of a clinical batch, etc. as
product development revenues.
The Company recognizes royalty revenues upon the sale of licensed products
by the licensee, and recognizes such revenue as license revenue. The Company
occasionally receives payment of up-front royalty advances from licensees. Upon
adoption of the cumulative deferral method, if vendor specific objective
evidence of fair value exists, revenues from up-front royalty payments are
deferred until earned through the sale of licensed revenue from the licensee or
the termination of the agreement based on the terms of the license. If vendor
specific objective evidence of fair value does not exist, revenues from up-front
royalty payments are recognized using the cumulative deferral method. The
Company classifies amounts received related to royalties from sales of products
licensed by the Company, which the Company developed or partially developed, as
license revenues in accordance with the terms of the underlying agreement.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED
December 31, 1999, 2000 and 2001 1.  Description of Business and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies
Continued
In certain cases the Company receives up-front payments upon signing
licensing and development agreements. Prior to the adoption of the cumulative
deferral method, if the up-front payment related to services already performed,
and there was no additional performance obligation under the agreement, the
amount was recognized as revenue in the period the payment was received. If the
Company had subsequent obligations under the agreement, or the payment did not
relate to services already provided, the amount was deferred in relation to the
performance requirements under the related licensing and development agreement.
Upon adoption of the cumulative deferral method, up-front license payments are
deferred and amortized into revenues on a straight-line basis.
Stock-Based Compensation
Compensation expense for stock incentives granted to employees and
directors is recognized in accordance with Accounting Principles Board, Opinion
25 APB 25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees. Pro forma effects on
net loss and loss per share are provided as if the fair value based method
defined in Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123 SFAS 123,
Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation, had been applied.
Product Warranty
The Company recognizes the estimated cost of warranty obligations to
customers at the time the products are shipped.
Research and Development
Research and development costs are expensed as incurred.
Use of Estimates
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally
accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and
assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and
disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial
statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the
reporting period. The Company significant accounting estimates relate to the
revenue recognition periods for license revenues, product warranty accruals,
obsolete inventory accruals, and determination of the fair value and
recoverability of intangible assets. Actual results could differ from these
estimates.
Advertising Expense
Advertising costs including production and communication costs for 1999
and 2000 were insignificant, and for 2001 were approximately $45,000. Production
costs related to advertising are expensed as incurred.
Income Taxes
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax
consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement
carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax
bases. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates
expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary
differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax
assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the
period that includes the enactment date. Due to historical net losses of the
Company, a valuation allowance is established to offset the deferred tax asset.

Net Loss Per Share
Basic EPS is computed by dividing net income or loss available to Common
Shareholders by the weighted-average number of Common Shares outstanding for the
period. Diluted EPS reflects the potential dilution from the exercise or
conversion of securities into Common Stock. For the years ended December 31,
1999, 2000 and 2001, the effects of potential Common Shares were excluded from
the calculation of diluted EPS because their effect was antidilutive.
Reclassifications
Certain prior year amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current
year presentation. These reclassifications did not impact previously reported
net loss or net loss per share.
New Accounting Pronouncements
In July 2001, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued SFAS 141,
Business Combinations, and SFAS 142, Goodwill and Other Tangible Assets.
SFAS 141 requires that the purchase method of accounting be used for all
business combinations initiated after June 30, 2001. SFAS 141 also specifies
criteria that identify intangible assets acquired in a purchase method business
combination that must be recognized and reported apart from goodwill. SFAS 142
requires that goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite useful lives no
longer be amortized, but instead tested for impairment at least annually. SFAS
142 also requires that intangible assets with definite useful lives be amortized
over their respective estimated useful lives. At December 31, 2001, the
Company goodwill and amortizable intangible assets aggregate $1,159,767 and
$1,935,588, respectively.
The Company adopted SFAS 141 during 2001. SFAS 142 adoption will be
effective January 1, 2002. The Company is evaluating whether any write-down of
goodwill may be required as a result of implementing this new standard. The
Company had goodwill amortization of $177,963, $177,963 and $205,237 in each of
the years ended December 31, 1999, 2000 and 2001, respectively. Adoption of SFAS
142 is expected to decrease expenses in 2002 by approximately $253,000 as a
result of ceasing amortization of goodwill and other intangible amounts
allocated to workforce.
SFAS 144, Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets,
was issued in October 2001. SFAS 144 provides new guidance on the recognition of
impairment losses on long-lived assets to be held and used or to be disposed of
and also broadens the definition of what constitutes a discontinued operation
and how the results of a discontinued operation are to be measured and
presented. The provisions of SFAS 144 are effective for fiscal years beginning
after December 15, 2001. The Company will adopt the provisions of this statement
on January 1, 2002, and does not expect adoption will have a material impact on
its consolidated results of operations or financial position.
2.  Going Concern
The accompanying financial statements have been prepared on a going-concern
basis, which contemplates the realization of assets and the satisfaction of
liabilities and other commitments in the normal course of business. The Company
had negative working capital of $2,439,577 and $11,712 at December 31, 2000 and
2001, respectively, and has had net losses and negative cash flows from
operating activities since inception, and incurred net losses of $3,967,366 5,260,387 and $9,499,101 in 1999, 2000 and 2001, respectively.
The Company expects to report a net loss for the year ending December 31,
2002, as marketing and development costs related to bringing future generations
of products to market continue. Long-term capital requirements will depend on
numerous factors, including the status of collaborative arrangements, the
progress of research and development programs and the receipt of revenues from
sales of products.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED
December 31, 1999, 2000 and 2001 2.  Going Concern Continued
The Company has sufficient cash through April 2002 and will be required to
raise additional working capital to continue to exist. Management intentions
are to raise this additional capital through alliances with strategic corporate
partners, equity offerings, and/or borrowing from the Company majority
shareholder. On March 12, 2002 the Company received an advance of $1,000,000
from the Company majority shareholder, Dr. Jacques Gonella, under a Term Note
agreement dated February 20, 2002. The Company can receive a total of $2,000,000
under the Term Note in increments of $1,000,000. There can be no assurance that
the Company will ever become profitable or that additional adequate funds will
be available when needed or on acceptable terms.
The financial statements do not include any adjustments relating to the
recoverability and classification of recorded asset amounts or the amounts and
classification of liabilities that might be necessary if the Company is unable
to continue as a going concern.
3.  Acquisition of Medi-Ject Corporation
Upon closing of the Share Transaction on January 31, 2001, the full
principal amount of Permatec shareholders' loans to the three Permatec
subsidiaries which were included in the Share Transaction, of $13,069,870, was
converted to equity.
Also on January 31, 2001, promissory notes issued by Medi-Ject to Permatec
between January 25, 2000 and January 15, 2001, in the aggregate principal amount
of $5,500,000, were converted into Series C Convertible Preferred Stock Series
C. Permatec, the holder of the Series C stock, immediately exercised its right
to convert the Series C stock, and Antares issued 2,750,000 shares of common
stock to Permatec upon such conversion. Also on that date, the name of the
corporation was changed to Antares Pharma, Inc.
The total consideration paid, or purchase price, for Medi-Ject was
approximately $6,889,974, which represents the fair market value of Medi-Ject
and related transaction costs of $480,095. For accounting purposes, the fair
value of Medi-Ject is based on the 1,424,729 shares of Medi-Ject common stock
outstanding on January 25, 2000, at an average closing price three days before
and after such date of $2509 per share plus the estimated fair value of the
Series A convertible preferred stock and the Series B mandatorily redeemable
convertible preferred stock plus the fair value of outstanding stock options and
warrants representing shares of Medi-Ject common stock either vested on January
25, 2000, or that became vested at the close of the Share Transaction plus the
capitalized acquisition cost of Permatec.
The purchase price allocation, based on an appraisal by an independent
third-party appraisal firm, was as follows     Cash  $   394,535
Current     900,143
Equipment, furniture and fixtures.   1,784,813

In connection with the Share Transaction on January 31, 2001, the Company
acquired in-process research and development projects having an estimated fair
value of $948,000 that had not yet reached technological feasibility and had no
alternative future use. Accordingly, this amount was immediately expensed in the
Consolidated

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED
December 31, 1999, 2000 and 2001 3.  Acquisition of Medi-Ject Corporation Continued
Statement of Operations. The fair value of in-process research and development
was determined by an independent valuation using discounted forecasted cash
flows directly related to the products expected to result from the research and
development projects. The discount rates used in the valuation take into account
the stage of completion and the risks surrounding the successful development and
commercialization of each of the purchased in-process technology projects that
were valued. The weighted-average discount rate used in calculating the present
value of the in-process technology was 65%. Projects included in the valuation
were approximately 10% to 40% complete and related to ongoing injection
research, mini-needle technology, pre-filled syringes and single-shot disposable
injection devices. The nature of the efforts to develop the acquired in-process
research and development into commercially viable products consists principally
of planning, designing and testing activities necessary to determine that the
products can meet market expectations, including functionality, technical and
performance requirements and specifications.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED
December 1, 1999, 2000 and 2001 5.  Restructuring Activities Continued
The restructuring charge is primarily comprised of involuntary severance
benefits and other incremental costs of exiting facilities, including lease
termination costs, and write-off of certain assets. In connection with the
closure of these facilities, the Company involuntarily terminated in 1999
approximately 25 employees, of which 13 were entitled to receive severance
benefits. The restructuring charges incurred during 2000 included involuntary
severance benefits of $178,257 for two employees of the Company French
operations resulting from an out of court arbitration settlement finalized in
March 2000.
The Company reported charges of approximately $103,400 and $17,000 related
to the write-off of assets which were disposed of in connection with the closure
of the France and Argentina facilities for the years ended December 31, 1999 and
2000, respectively. The assets disposed of consisted of certain laboratory
equipment and office equipment that the Company decided not to transfer to its
central facilities in Basel, Switzerland.
The Company undertook these restructuring actions as part of its efforts to
reduce costs and to centralize its developmental and administrative functions in
Switzerland. These restructuring programs were completed during the year ended
December 31, 2000. The following table provides a summary of the Company

The Company has non-cancelable operating leases for its office, research
and manufacturing facility in Minneapolis, MN, for office space in Exton, PA,
and for its office and research facility in Basel, Switzerland. The leases
require payment of all executory costs such as maintenance and property taxes.
The Company also leases certain equipment and furniture under various operating
and capital leases. The cost of equipment and furniture under capital leases at
December 31, 2000 and 2001 was $282,385 and $245,905, respectively, and
accumulated amortization was $92,143 and $113,478, respectively.
Rent expense incurred for the years ended December 31, 1999, 2000 and 2001
was $270,537 $143,349, and $421,942 respectively.

years in the three-year period ended December 31, 2001, and, accordingly, no
income taxes were provided. In 1999 and 2000 the Company was subject to Swiss
taxes and in 2001 is subject to taxes in both the U.S. and Switzerland.

7.  Income Taxes Continued
The valuation allowance for deferred tax assets as of December 31, 2000 and
2001 was $2,226,600 and $16,136,274, respectively. The net change in the total
valuation allowance for the years ended December 31, 2000 and 2001 was an
increase of $726,600 and $13,909,674, respectively. In assessing the
realizability of deferred tax assets, management considers whether it is more
likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be
realized. The ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the
generation of future taxable income during the periods in which those temporary
differences become deductible. Management considers the scheduled reversal of
deferred tax liabilities, projected future taxable income and tax planning
strategies in making this assessment. Due to the uncertainty of realizing the
deferred tax asset, management has placed a valuation allowance against the
entire deferred tax asset.
The Company has a U.S. federal net operating loss carryforward at December
31, 2001, of approximately $31,872,000, which is available to reduce income
taxes payable in future years. If not used, this carryforward will expire in
years 2009 through 2021. Additionally, the Company has a research credit
carryforward of approximately $694,000. These credits begin to expire in 2009.
The Company also has a Swiss net operating loss carryforward at December
31, 2001, of approximately $7,800,000, which is available to reduce income taxes
payable in future years. If not used, this carryforward will expire in years
2004 through 2008. The Company subsidiaries have deferred tax assets related
to research and development costs, which are eligible for capitalization and
amortization for tax purposes in certain of the Company taxable jurisdictions.
The net operating losses and tax credits of Antares Pharma, Inc. are
subject to annual limitations under Internal Revenue Code Sections 382 and 383,
respectively, as a result of significant changes in ownership, including the
business combination with Permatec and private placements. Subsequent equity
changes could further limit the utilization of the net operations losses and
credits.
8.  Shareholders' Equity
As discussed in Note 3, on January 31, 2001 Medi-Ject Corporation purchased
Permatec Pharma AG, Permatec Technology AG, and Permatec NV from Permatec
Holding AG Permatec. The acquisition was consummated under the purchase
method of accounting and Medi-Ject Corporation changed its name to Antares
Pharma, Inc. The transaction was accounted for as a reverse acquisition because
upon completion of the transaction the shareholders of Permatec held
approximately 67% of the outstanding common shares. Accordingly, Permatec is
deemed to have acquired Medi-Ject Corporation. As a result, the historical
financial statements are those of Permatec. However, the outstanding common
shares, preferred shares, stock warrants and employee, consultant and director
stock options of Antares Pharma, Inc. are those that existed under Medi-Ject
Corporation, adjusted for shares issued in the purchase transaction. The
employee, consultant and director stock options outstanding on January 31, 2001
became fully vested as a result of the purchase transaction.
The Company raised $9,991,391 of net proceeds through an issuance of common
stock Units to accredited investors in a private placement transaction. Each
Unit was sold for $2344 and consisted of i four shares of common stock, $001
par value, and ii a warrant to purchase one share of common stock. These
five-year warrants allow for the purchase of 426,620 shares of common stock, at
an exercise price of $703 per share.
In October 2001 the Company issued 188,063 shares of common stock valued at
$517,173 in connection with a technology acquisition agreement with Endoscoptic,
Inc. Endoscoptic, a French Company, to purchase certain patents, patent
applications, trademarks, trade secrets, know-how and other related technology
incorporating or relating to the Hiprin single-use, needle-free, pre-filled,
disposable syringe.

Series A Convertible Preferred Stock
On November 10, 1998, the Company sold 1,000 shares of Series A Convertible
Preferred Stock Series A and warrants to purchase 56,000 shares of common
stock to Elan International Services, Ltd., for total consideration of
$1,000,000. The Series A carries a 10% dividend which is payable semi-annually.
The Series A is redeemable at the Company option at any time and is
convertible into common stock for sixty days following the 10th anniversary of
the date of issuance at the lower of $750 per share or 95% of the market price
of the Common Stock. The warrants to purchase Common Stock may be exercised at
any time prior to November 10, 2005, at a price of $451 per share.
Conversion of Series B Convertible Preferred Stock to Common Stock
On December 22, 1999, the Company sold 250 shares of Series B Convertible
Preferred Stock Series B to Bio-Technology General Corporation for total
consideration of $250,000. The Series B did not carry a dividend rate. Series B
was automatically converted on June 30, 2001, into 100,000 shares of common
stock pursuant to the terms of the Series B stock agreement.
In-The-Money Conversion Feature-Preferred Stock Dividend
During 2000 and 2001, prior to the closing of the Share Transaction on
January 31, 2001, Medi-Ject borrowed a total of $5,500,000 in convertible
promissory notes from Permatec. At the closing of the Share Transaction, the
principal amount of convertible promissory notes converted to 27,500 shares of
Series C preferred stock. At the option of the holder, these shares were
immediately converted into 2,750,000 shares of Antares common stock. As the
conversion feature to common stock was contingent upon the closing of the Share
Transaction, the measurement of the stated conversion feature as compared to the
Company common stock price of $456 at January 31, 2001, resulted in an
in-the-money conversion feature of $5,314,125, which is a deemed dividend to the
Series C preferred shareholder. This dividend increases the net loss applicable
to common shareholders in the Antares' net loss per share calculation.
Restricted Stock
Roger G. Harrison, Ph.D., was appointed Chief Executive Officer of Antares
Pharma, Inc., effective March 12, 2001. The terms of the employment agreement

performance-based milestones. The Company anticipates the time-based milestones
will be achieved and has recorded deferred compensation expense related to
48,000 shares issued to Dr. Harrison in April 2001 and 40,000 shares expected to
be earned in April 2002. The shares vest over a three-year period and had an
aggregate market value of $341,000 at the measurement date. Compensation expense
is being recognized ratably over the three-year vesting period. Through December
31, 2001 compensation expense of $89,984 has been recognized in connection with
these shares.
Stock Options and Warrants
The Company stock option plans allow for the grants of options to
officers, directors, consultants and employees to purchase shares of Common
Stock at exercise prices not less than 100% of fair market value on the dates of
grant. The term of the options is either ten or eleven years and they vest in
varying periods. As of December 31, 2001, these plans had 483,821 shares

Warrants were issued in connection with debt financing, financial
consulting and technology procurement during 1996 through 2001. The terms of the
warrants do not exceed ten years and vest in varying periods. During 2000, the

11. License Agreements
Segix License Agreement
In May 1999, the Company entered into an exclusive agreement to license one
application of its drug-delivery technology to Segix Italia S.p.a. Segix in
Italy, the Vatican and San Marino collectively, the Segix Territories. The
Company is required to transfer technology know-how, provide technical
assistance, and to reimburse an estimated $75,000 to Segix for one-half of the
cost of a bio-equivalency study, if that study is required by the Italian
regulatory authorities. Segix will use the licensed technology to seek marketing
approval of a hormone replacement therapy product. The license agreement
requires Segix to pay a $25,000 exclusivity fee, $125,000 upon signing of the
license, $100,000 upon the first submission by Segix to any one of the
regulatory authorities in the Segix Territories, $100,000 upon the first
completed registration with any of the regulatory officials in the Segix
Territories, and $150,000 upon the earlier of receipt of reimbursement
classification from regulatory authorities or the launch of product sales in the
Segix Territories.
The Company recognized $228,720 in 1999, which is net of filing and
registration fees of $21,280, related to milestone payments under this
agreement. The Company must also provide Segix with licensed product under a
supply agreement that runs for two years from the date of first delivery of
products ordered by Segix, which is automatically renewable for additional
one-year periods unless terminated by either party. The supply agreement is a
separately priced, independent agreement that is not tied to the license
agreement. The Company will receive from Segix a 5% royalty from the sale of
licensed products in the Segix Territories.
In 2000, the Company adopted the cumulative deferral method for recognizing
revenue, which results in the ratable revenue recognition of milestone payments
from the date of achievement of the milestone through the date that is the
earlier of receipt of reimbursement classification from regulatory authorities
or the launch of product sales in the Segix Territories. The Company expects the
receipt of reimbursement classification from regulatory authorities to occur
first, and estimates this date to be March 2003. The Company will recognize the
first two milestone payments of $125,000 and $100,000 over estimated 47 and
46-month periods, respectively, the next milestone payment of $100,000 over an
estimated 7-month period, and the final $150,000 payment in March 2003.
Solvay License Agreement
In June 1999, the Company entered into an exclusive agreement to license
one application of its drug-delivery technology to Solvay Pharmaceuticals
Solvay in all countries except the United States, Canada, Japan and Korea
collectively, the Solvay Territories. The Company is required to transfer
technology know-how and to provide developmental assistance to Solvay until the
licensed product is approved by each country applicable regulatory
authorities. The Company will be reimbursed by Solvay for all technical
assistance provided during Solvay development. Solvay will use the licensed
technology for the development of a hormone replacement therapy gel. The license
agreement requires Solvay to pay the Company milestone payments of $1,000,000
upon signing of the license, $1,000,000 upon the start of Phase IIb/III clinical
trials, as defined in the agreement, $1,000,000 upon the first submission by
Solvay to regulatory authorities in the Solvay Territories, and $2,000,000

upon the first completed registration in either Germany, France or the United
Kingdom. The Company recognized $1,000,000 in 1999 related to milestone payments
under this agreement. The Company will receive from Solvay a 5% royalty from the
sale of licensed products.
In 2000, the Company adopted the cumulative deferral method for recognizing
revenue, which results in the ratable revenue recognition of milestone payments
from the date of achievement of the milestone through the estimated date of the
first completed registration in either Germany, France or the United Kingdom.
The Company expects the first completed registration to occur in June 2005. The
Company will recognize the first three $1,000,000 milestone payments over
estimated periods of 73, 37 and 13-months, respectively, and the final
$2,000,000 milestone payment in June 2005.
BioSante License Agreement
In June 2000, the Company entered into an exclusive agreement to license
four applications of its drug-delivery technology to BioSante Pharmaceuticals,
Inc. BioSante in the United States, Canada, China, Australia, New Zealand,
South Africa, Israel, Mexico, Malaysia and Indonesia collectively, the
BioSante Territories. The Company is required to transfer technology know-how
and to provide significant development assistance to BioSante until the licensed
product is approved by each country regulatory authorities. BioSante will use
the licensed technology for the development of hormone replacement therapy
products. At the signing of the contract, BioSante made an upfront payment to
the Company, a portion of which will offset future royalties from BioSante
sale of licensed products and/or sublicense up front payments. This milestone
payment was for the delivery of intellectual property to BioSante. BioSante is
required to tender milestone payments upon commencement of manufacturing of each
of the first two licensed products. In the event that the Company fails to
produce or have produced the ordered clinical batches, then the Company is
required to repay 25% of these two milestone payments to BioSante.
The Company will receive payments upon the achievement of certain
milestones and will receive from BioSante a royalty from the sale of licensed
products. The Company will also receive a portion of any sublicense fees
received by BioSante. The Company is obligated to incur the first $150,000 of
production costs for each of the four products, for an aggregate of $600,000.
The Company is further obligated to provide BioSante licensed products under a
twenty-year supply agreement. The supply agreement is a separately priced,
independent agreement that is not tied to the license agreement.
In the agreement, the Company has granted BioSante the option for
additional licensed territories and the licensed products. The Company will
receive additional milestone payments if this option is exercised.
In 2000, the Company adopted the cumulative deferral method for recognizing
revenue, which results in the ratable revenue recognition of milestone payments
from the date of achievement of the milestone through the estimated date of
receipt of final regulatory approval in the BioSante Territory. The Company is
recognizing the initial milestone payment in revenue over a 74-month period. All
other milestone payments will be recognized ratably on a product-by-product
basis from the date the milestone payment is earned and all repayment
obligations have been satisfied until the receipt of final regulatory approval
in the BioSante Territory for each respective product. It is expected that these
milestones will be earned at various dates from July 2002 to July 2006 and will
be recognized as revenue over periods of up to 49 months.
In August 2001, BioSante entered into an exclusive agreement with Solvay in
which Solvay has sublicensed from BioSante the U.S. and Canadian rights to an
estrogen/progestogen combination transdermal hormone replacement gel product,
one of the four drug-delivery products the Company has licensed to BioSante.
Under the terms of the license agreement between the Company and BioSante, the
Company received a portion of the up front payment made by Solvay to BioSante,
net of the portion of the initial up front payment the Company received from
BioSante intended to offset sublicense up front payments. The Company is also
entitled to a portion of any
