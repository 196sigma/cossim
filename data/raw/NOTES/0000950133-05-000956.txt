41 REPORT OF ERNST YOUNG LLP INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM Board of Directors United Defense Industries, Inc. We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of
United Defense Industries, Inc. as of December31, 2003 and
2004, and the related consolidated statements of operations,
stockholders equity deficit, and cash flows for each of
the three years in the period ended December31, 2004. Our
audits also included the financial statement schedule listed in
the appendix at a. These financial statements and
schedule are the responsibility of the Companys
management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these
financial statements and schedule based on our audits. We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the
Public Company Accounting Oversight Board United States. Those
standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are
free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a
test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in
the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the
accounting principles used and significant estimates made by
management, as well as evaluating the overall financial
statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a
reasonable basis for our opinion. In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above
present fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated
financial position of United Defense Industries, Inc. at
December31, 2003 and 2004, and the consolidated results of
its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in
the period ended December31, 2004, in conformity with
U.S.generally accepted accounting principles. Also, in our
opinion, the related financial statement schedule, when
considered in relation to the basic financial statements taken
as a whole, presents fairly in all material respects the
information set forth therein. We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the
Public Company Accounting Oversight Board United States, the
effectiveness of United Defense Industries, Inc.s internal
control over financial reporting as of December31, 2004,
based on criteria established in Internal Control
Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring
Organizations of the Treadway Commission and our report dated
March4, 2005, expressed an unqualified opinion thereon. McLean, Virginia March4, 2005 F-1 UNITED DEFENSE INDUSTRIES, INC. CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS

1.
Basis of Presentation United Defense Industries, Inc. is a global leader in the
design, development and production of combat vehicles, artillery
systems, naval guns, missile launchers and precision munitions
used by the U.S. Department of Defense and allied militaries
around the world, and through United States Marine Repair, Inc.
USMR, is the leading provider of non-nuclear ship
repair, modernization and conversion services to the U.S. Navy
and related agencies. We believe our operating results are
driven principally by the business activities related to our
major military programs. Currently we are the sole-source, prime
contractor to the U.S. Department of Defense for many of these
programs. We report our operations under two business segments:
Defense Systems and Ship Repair and Maintenance. The Defense
Systems segment program portfolio consists of a mix of weapon
systems development, production, upgrade and life cycle support
programs. The Ship Repair and Maintenance segment portfolio
consists of ship repair, maintenance, and modernization service
programs. Our headquarters office is located in Arlington, Virginia. Our
operations are primarily situated in the United States, with the
exception of our Bofors subsidiary in Sweden and our joint
venture in Turkey. The financial statements include our accounts and the accounts
of our subsidiaries. Inter-company accounts and transactions are
eliminated in consolidation.   
2.
Summary of Significant Accounting Policies   
Reclassifications Certain prior year amounts have been reclassified to conform to
the current year presentation. Such amounts include the
reclassification of extraordinary items in accordance with FAS
145 adopted in 2003. We reclassified $17million of
extraordinary items and the related tax effects to interest
expense for the year ended December31, 2002.   
Use of Estimates The preparation of financial statements in conformity with
generally accepted accounting principles requires management to
make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported
in the financial statements and accompanying notes. In
particular, estimates are used for contract costs and revenues
used in the earnings recognition process, accruals related to
environmental and other liabilities, allowance for doubtful
accounts, and pension and other retirement costs. Actual results
could differ from those estimates.   
Cash and Cash Equivalents Cash and cash equivalents consist of investments with initial
maturities of three months or less. The Company invests a
majority of its available cash in money market securities with
primarily one high credit quality financial institution.   
Property, Plant and Equipment Property, plant and equipment are recorded at cost. Depreciation
is provided principally on the sum-of-the-years digits,
straight-line and double-declining balance methods over
estimated useful lives of the assets computer equipment and
software three to five years; land
improvements twenty years; buildings
twenty to thirty-nine years; dry docks and piers
fifteen to thirty years; and machinery and equipment
two to twelve years. F-6 UNITED DEFENSE INDUSTRIES, INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTSContinued Maintenance and repairs are expensed as incurred. Expenditures
that extend the useful life of property, plant and equipment or
increase productivity are capitalized and depreciated.   
Long-lived Assets We evaluate our long-lived assets to be held and used, including
intangible assets subject to amortization, to determine whether
any events or changes in circumstances indicate that the
carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable. We base our
evaluation on such impairment indicators as the nature of the
assets, the future economic benefit of the assets, any
historical or future profitability measurements, the likelihood
of sale or other significant disposition before the end of its
previously estimated useful life, as well as other external
market conditions or factors that may be present. If such
impairment indicators are present or other factors exist that
indicate that the carrying amount of the asset may not be
recoverable, we would use an estimate of the undiscounted value
of expected future cash flows to determine whether the asset is
recoverable and measure the amount of any impairment as the
difference between the carrying amount of the asset and its
estimated fair value. The fair value would be estimated using
valuation techniques such as market prices for similar assets or
discounted future cash flows.   
Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets Goodwill is not subject to amortization but is tested for
impairment on an annual basis and more frequently if indicators
of impairment exist. In assessing impairment of goodwill, we
compare the estimated fair value of each reporting unit to the
carrying value of that reporting unit as of October 1 our
annual testing date. If the carrying value is greater than the
fair value of the reporting unit, an impairment charge is
recorded in accordance with FAS 142. We completed the required
annual impairment test of goodwill as of October1, 2004
and determined that there was no impairment of goodwill. During
2004, we also adopted plans to discontinue operations at two
shipyard facilities that are part of the Ship Repair and
Maintenance segment and recorded a charge to earnings of
$45million which represents the carrying amount of the
goodwill associated with these businesses. Intangible assets are amortized on the pattern in which the
economic benefits of the intangible asset are consumed or
otherwise used up. If indicators of impairment exist for
intangible assets, and future cash flows were not expected to be
sufficient to recover the assets carrying amount, an impairment
loss would be charged to expense in the period identified.   
Equity Investments in Affiliated Companies Our investment in our 51% owned foreign joint venture in Turkey,
FNSS Savunma Sistemleri A.S. is accounted for using the equity
method because we do not control it due to our partners
veto rights over most operating decisions, although we do have
the ability to exercise influence over its operating and
financial policies. Our share of the earnings from our
investment in Turkey was $139million, $198million
and $64million net of write-off of investments for
$53million for the years ended December31, 2002,
2003 and 2004, respectively. A dividend payment from FNSS in
2005 is unlikely. Since FNSS has completed its production
contracts, its ability to pay dividends in future years is
unclear. Consequently this deterioration in the outlook is
viewed as other than temporary. We discontinued recognizing our
share of the equity in earnings and wrote off our investment
balance as of June30, 2004. F-7 UNITED DEFENSE INDUSTRIES, INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL

Restricted Cash Restricted cash consists mainly of cash held in escrow to
support letters of credit as required under the Bofors purchase
agreement. The restriction will expire upon release of the
former owners of Bofors as guarantors under the letters of
credit.   
Deferred Financing Costs The costs associated with obtaining financing have been deferred
and are amortized over the terms of the underlying loan
agreements using a method that approximates the effective
interest method. Deferred financing fee expense is classified in
interest expense and totaled $51million 33million and $29million for the years ended
December31, 2002, 2003 and 2004, respectively. The
deferred financing charges related to the unamortized deferred
financing costs associated with early extinguishment of debt are
included in the deferred financing fee expense.   
Advanced Payments Advanced payments by customers for deposits on orders not yet
billed and progress payments on contracts-in-progress are
recorded as current liabilities. The payments are recorded as
revenue when certain criteria are met as described in the
Revenue and Profit Recognition for Contracts-in-Progress
accounting policy.   
Foreign Currency Translation The financial position and operating results of our foreign
operations are prepared using the local currencies as the
functional currency. The balance sheet accounts are translated
at exchange rates in effect at the end of the period, and income
statement accounts are translated to U.S. dollars at average
exchange rates during the period. The resulting translation
gains and losses are included as a separate component of
stockholders equity. There was $49million and
$60million of gains included in accumulated other
comprehensive income from currency translation adjustments as of
December31, 2003 and 2004, respectively. Foreign currency
transaction gains and losses are included in our income
statement in the period in which they occur.   
Inventories The majority of our inventories are related to contracts in
process and are recorded at cost determined on a last-in,
first-out LIFO basis. Inventory costs include
manufacturing overhead. The current replacement F-8 UNITED DEFENSE INDUSTRIES, INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTSContinued cost of LIFO inventories exceeded their recorded values by
approximately $236million and $325million at
December31, 2003 and December31, 2004, respectively.   
Revenue and Profit Recognition for
Contracts-in-Progress We use different techniques for estimating and recording
revenues depending on the type and characteristics of the
contract. Sales are recognized on most fixed-price production
contracts when the risks and rewards of ownership have been
transferred to the customer. For our DoD production contracts,
those criteria are typically met when the manufacture of the
product is completed and the customer has certified it as
meeting the contract specifications and as having passed quality
control tests. However, under recent Bradley and M113 production
contracts, sales are not recognized until the vehicles are
fielded to individual Army units, because it is at that point
that the risks and rewards of ownership are stipulated to be
transferred. Fielding a vehicle refers to the final deprocessing
activity such as verification of proper running condition,
installing on-board equipment, and obtaining certified customer
acceptance at their site of operation. This contractual
provision extends the period of time during which these vehicles
are carried as inventory and may result in an uneven
distribution of revenue from these contracts between periods. For production contracts with foreign customers, sales are
generally recorded upon shipment of products to the customer,
which corresponds to when the risks and rewards of ownership
transfer. Gross margin on each unit delivered or accepted is
recognized, based on an estimate of the margin that will be
realized over the life of the related contract. We evaluate
estimates of gross margin on production contracts quarterly and
recognize changes in estimates of gross margins during the
period in which those changes are determined. Sales under
fixed-price ship repair and maintenance contracts are recognized
as work is performed. Under this method, contract costs are
expensed as incurred and sales are recognized simultaneously
based on the ratio of direct labor inputs and other costs
incurred to date compared with estimated total direct labor
inputs and total costs. Sales under cost reimbursement contracts
for research, engineering, prototypes, ship repair and
maintenance and certain other contracts are recorded as costs
are incurred and include estimated base fees in the proportion
that costs incurred to date bear to total estimated costs. Award
fees are recorded as revenue when contracts are modified to
incorporate the earned award fees. We charge any anticipated
losses on a contract to operations as soon as those losses are
determined. At December31, 2003 and 2004, trade receivables include
$211million and $345million related to contractual
revenue that had not been billed to customers. These amounts are
generally billable within the following year. Receivables
include U.S. Government holdbacks for in-process ship repair and
maintenance contracts of $65million and $23million
at December31, 2003 and 2004, respectively. The allowance
for doubtful accounts was $28million and
$27million at December31, 2003 and 2004,
respectively.   
Stock-Based Compensation At December31, 2004, we had a stock-based employee
compensation plan, which is described more fully in
Note10. We account for the plan under the recognition and
measurement principles of APB Opinion No25,
Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees, and
related Interpretations. Accordingly, we record compensation
expense over the vesting period in our consolidated statements
of operations if the option price is less than fair value of the
common stock at the date an option is granted. Most of the
amortization in 2004 was related to restricted stock awards. The
compensation recorded in the financial statements reflects the
amortization based on vesting of stock options and restricted
stock awards. The following table illustrates the effect on net
income and earnings per share if we had elected to apply the
fair value recognition provisions of F-9 UNITED DEFENSE INDUSTRIES, INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTSContinued FASB Statement No123, Accounting for Stock-Based
Compensation, to stock-based employee compensation.

The effect of applying Statement No123 on the net income
as stated above is not necessarily representative of the effects
on reported net income for future years due to, among other
things, the vesting period of the stock options, the amount of
forfeitures, and additional stock options that may be granted in
future years. The fair value of each option granted was estimated on the date
of grant using the Black-Scholes model with the following
assumptions: For years with multiple grant dates, weighted

No stock options were granted in 2002. In 2003 stock options were granted to purchase 2,215,323 common
shares at a weighted average exercise price of $2316. In 2004,
additional stock options were granted to purchase 500,000 common
shares at an exercise price of $3180. As of December31,
2004, there were 2,693,172 options outstanding. These grants
resulted in no additional compensation expense under APB Opinion
No25.   
Restricted Stock During 2002 and 2004, we issued 1,372 and 146,800 shares of
restricted stock, respectively, with a weighted average fair
value of $2185 and $3248, respectively. No grants were made
during 2003. On March2, 2005, we issued 266,700 shares of
restricted stock at a fair value of $5668 per share. Restricted
shares are issued at the market price of the stock at the date
of grant. The restricted shares require no payment from the
recipient employee or director and compensation expense is
recorded based on the market price on F-10 UNITED DEFENSE INDUSTRIES, INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTSContinued the grant date recorded over the vesting period of three years.
During 2004, compensation expense related to these restricted
stock grants was approximately $10million, net of taxes.   
Rabbi TrustAccounts We offer a deferred compensation arrangement which allows
certain employees to defer a portion of their earnings and defer
the related income taxes. These deferred earnings are invested
in a rabbi trust, and are accounted for in
accordance with Emerging Issues Task Force Issue No97-14,
Accounting for Deferred Compensation Arrangements Where Amounts
Earned Are Held in a Rabbi Trust and Invested. A rabbi trust is
a funding vehicle used to protect deferred compensation benefits
from certain events other than bankruptcy. The assets of the
trust are to be consolidated with those of the employer and the
value of the employers stock held in the rabbi trust
should be classified in shareholders equity and generally
accounted for in a manner similar to treasury stock. Therefore,
the shares the Company has issued to its rabbi trust and the
corresponding liability related to the deferred compensation
plans are presented as components of stockholders equity
as shares held in rabbi trust and deferred compensation
liability, respectively. The amount invested in the rabbi trust,
which was approximately $186million at December31,
2004, was classified as other assets on our balance sheet. We maintain the assets of a non-qualified pension plan in a
rabbi trust and as such the fair value of the assets are not
included in the tables in Note7, Pensions and Other Post
Retirement Benefits. The fair value of the assets that are held
in the rabbi trust are approximately $36million and are
included in other assets on the balance sheet.   
Stock Repurchase In March 2004, the Board of Directors authorized the repurchase
of up to $100million of our common stock. The total number
of shares repurchased under the plan as of December31,
2004 was 2,491,800 at an aggregate cost of $927million,
before expenses. In January 2005, the Board of Directors
authorized the repurchase of up to an additional
$100million shares of our common stock.   
Income Taxes We account for income taxes under the liability method. Under
this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined
based on differences between the financial reporting and tax
bases of assets and liabilities and are measured using the
enacted tax rates and laws expected to be effective when these
differences reverse.   
Derivatives and Hedging Activities Effective January1, 2001, we adopted
SFASNo133, Accounting for Derivative
Instruments and Hedging Activities, as amended. As a
result, we recognize all derivative financial instruments, such
as foreign exchange contracts, in the consolidated financial
statements at fair value regardless of the purpose or intent for
holding the instrument. Changes in the fair value of derivative
financial instruments are either recognized periodically in the
results of operations or in stockholders equity as a
component of other comprehensive income, depending on whether
the derivative financial instrument qualifies for hedge
accounting and, if so, whether it qualifies as a fair value
hedge or cash flow hedge. Generally, changes in fair values of
the derivatives accounted for as fair value hedges are recorded
in the results of operations along with the portions of the
changes in the fair values of the hedged items that relate to
the hedged risks. Changes in fair values of derivatives
accounted for as cash flow hedges, to the extent they are
effective as hedges, are recorded in other comprehensive income.
Changes in fair values of derivatives not qualifying as hedges
are reported in the results of operations. There was a
$36million cumulative loss, net of taxes, and a
$08million cumulative F-11 UNITED DEFENSE INDUSTRIES, INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTSContinued gain, net of taxes, of accumulated comprehensive income from
changes in the fair value of foreign currency and interest rate
hedges as of December31, 2003 and 2004, respectively.   
Asset Retirement Obligations In June 2001, the FASB issued SFASNo143,
Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations. We
adopted SFASNo143, which provides accounting
requirements for costs associated with legal obligations to
retire tangible, long-lived assets, effective January1,
2003. Under SFASNo143, an Asset Retirement
Obligation ARO is recorded at fair value in the
period in which it is incurred by increasing the carrying amount
of the related long-lived asset. In each subsequent period, the
liability is accreted towards the ultimate obligation amount and
the capitalized ARO costs are depreciated over the useful life
of the related asset. The AROs that have been recorded as part of the transition
adjustment upon adopting SFAS143 and the accretion and
relative depreciation following have not been significant to our
statement of operations or our financial position through
December31, 2004.   
New Accounting Pronouncements In January 2003 the FASB issued FASB Interpretation No46
FIN46, Consolidation of Variable Interest
Entities. FIN46 became effective in the first
quarter of 2004 and requires a variable interest entity to be
consolidated by a company if that company is subject to a
majority of the risk of loss from the variable interest
entitys activities or entitled to receive a majority of
the entitys residual returns or both. In general, a
variable interest entity is a corporation, partnership, trust,
or any other legal structure used for business purposes that
either adoes not have equity investors with voting
rights, or bhas equity investors that do not provide
sufficient financial resources for the entity to support its
activities. The adoption of the Interpretation has not had a
significant impact on our financial statements. In December 2003, the FASB issued FASB Interpretation
No46R FIN46R which amends and supersedes the
original FIN46. Effective January 2004, we adopted
FIN46R. Any impacts of applying FIN46R to an entity
to which FIN46 had previously been applied are considered
immaterial to our results of operations and financial position. In December 2003, the FASB issued Statement No132R,
Employers Disclosure about Pensions and Other
Postretirement Benefits. SFASNo132R requires
additional disclosures about defined benefit pension plans and
other post retirement benefit plans. The standard requires,
among other things, additional disclosures about the assets held
in employer sponsored pension plans, disclosures relating to
plan asset investment policy and practices, disclosure of
expected contributions to be made to the plans and expected
benefit payments to be made by the plans. We have adopted this
pronouncement as of December31, 2003 for all of our U.S.
plans and December31, 2004 for our non-U.S. plans. In March 2004, the EITF reached a consensus on Issue
No03-1, The Meaning of
and Its Application to Certain
Investments EITF03-1. EITF03-1
provides guidance on determining when an investment is
considered impaired, whether that impairment is other than
temporary and the measurement of an impairment loss.
EITF03-1 is applicable to marketable debt and equity
securities within the scope of SFASNo115,
Accounting for Certain Investments in Debt and Equity
Securities SFAS115, and
SFASNo124, Accounting for Certain Investments
Held by Not-For-Profit Organizations, and equity
securities that are not subject to the scope of SFAS115
and not accounted for under the equity method of accounting. In
September 2004, the FASB issued FSP EITF03-1-1.,
Effective Date of Paragraphs10-20 of EITF Issue
No03-1, The Meaning of Other-Than-Temporary
Impairment and Its Application to Certain
Investments, which delays the effective date
for the measurement and recognition criteria contained in
EITF03-1 until final application guidance is issued. The
delay does not suspend the requirement to recognize
other-than-temporary impairments as required by existing
authoritative literature. F-12 UNITED DEFENSE INDUSTRIES, INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTSContinued The adoption of EITF03-1 is not expected to have a
material impact on our results of operations and financial
position. On October13, 2004, the FASB reached a consensus on the
effective date for SFASNo123R
SFAS123R, Share-Based Payment.
SFAS123R requires us to measure compensation cost for all
share-based payments at fair value for interim and annual
periods beginning after June15, 2005. We are currently
evaluating the requirements and impact of SFAS123R on the
Companys consolidated financial statements. In May 2004, the FASB issued FASB Staff Position
FSPNo.FAS 106-2, Accounting and Disclosure
Requirements Related to the Medicare Prescription Drug,
Improvement and Modernization Act of 2003 the Act.
The Act introduces a prescription drug benefit under
Medicare beginning in 2006 as well as a federal subsidy to
sponsors of retiree health care benefit plans that provide a
benefit that is at least actuarially equivalent to
Medicare. FSP No106-2 requires an employer to initially
account for any subsidy received under the Act as an actuarial
experience gain to the accumulated postretirement benefit
obligation which would be amortized over future service periods.
Future subsidies would reduce service cost each year. FSP
No106-2 became effective for us beginning in the quarter
ended September30, 2004. Due to the nature of our
contribution to the retiree healthcare benefit plan, we do not
expect a significant impact to our results of operations in any
period. On October22, 2004, the FASB issued two FASB Staff
Positions FSPs regarding the accounting implications of the
American Jobs Creation Act of 2004. We are currently evaluating
the requirements and impact of FSP No109-1,
Application of FASB Statement No109
Accounting for Income Taxes to the Tax Deduction on
Qualified Production Activities Provided by the American Jobs
Creation Act of 2004. However, it is not expected to have
a material effect on our effective tax rate. FSP No109-2,
Accounting and Disclosure Guidance for the Foreign
Earnings Repatriation Provision within the American Jobs
Creation Act of 2004 will not affect our consolidated
financial statements.

Acquisitions On March26, 2002, through our Bofors subsidiary, we
finalized the acquisition of 100% of the outstanding stock of
Cell ITS AB Cell ITS, a company incorporated under
the laws of Sweden and wholly owned by Cell Network AB. Cell ITS
specializes in interactive training and simulation. As
consideration for the purchase, we paid the former owner, Cell
Network AB, 45million Swedish krona SEK approximately
$4million. The transaction was accounted for as a
purchase. Accordingly, the financial statements reflect the
results of operations of Cell ITS from the date of acquisition. Effective July2, 2002, we completed the acquisition of
100% of the outstanding stock of USMR from The Carlyle Group
then one of our significant shareholders for
$3069million net of $73million of acquired cash,
including the repayment of approximately $105million of
USMR debt. The acquisition of USMR helped to balance and
diversify our portfolio, provided us with a strategic growth
platform, and expanded our mission to support the U.S. Navy with
superior technology and services. As a result of the
transaction, USMR became a wholly owned subsidiary. The
transaction was accounted for as a purchase. We financed the
acquisition with cash on hand and by amending our credit
facility to borrow an additional $300million. We began to
consolidate the results of operations of USMR as of the
effective date of the transaction. F-13 UNITED DEFENSE INDUSTRIES, INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTSContinued The following are the unaudited pro forma consolidated results
of our operations for the year ended December31, 2002
assuming the USMR acquisition occurred at the beginning of
January1, 2002, and our actual results of operations for
the year ended December31, 2003 and 2004.

These unaudited pro forma consolidated results are not
necessarily indicative of future outcomes. On February5, 2004, we completed the acquisition of the
assets of Kaiser Compositek, Inc. KCI for a
purchase price of $85million. KCI, located in Brea,
California, is a provider to government and industry sectors
with particular emphasis on primary structures fabricated with
polymeric composites. The acquisition is expected to enhance our
development of advanced weapon systems. On March1, 2004 we purchased certain assets and
liabilities of the Pearl Harbor, Hawaii ship repair operations
of Pacific Shipyards International, LLC and Honolulu Shipyards,
Inc. for a purchase price after adjustments of
$150million. The Pearl Harbor ship repair business is
being operated by a newly formed subsidiary, Hawaii Shipyards,
Inc. HSI. Principals of the predecessor entity
serve as directors of HSI. On March1, 2004 we completed the acquisition of Cercom,
Inc. of Vista, California for a purchase price of
$211million. Cercom is a producer of advanced ceramic
materials and supplier of light-weight ceramic armor. The
acquisition is expected to enhance our market presence regarding
survivability solutions in specialty metals and composites. On January13, 2005, we completed the acquisition of
Engineered Plastic Designs, Inc., doing business as EPD
Container Solutions EPD, of Berthoud, Colorado,
for $80million. EPD is a full service provider of
specialized containers for military munitions. The acquisition
was complimentary to our existing U.S. Navy canister business,
which will enable us to extend products to all military services
as well as other aerospace applications. F-14 UNITED DEFENSE INDUSTRIES, INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL

Pensions and Other Postretirement Benefits The majority of our domestic Defense Systems segment employees
are covered by retirement plans. Plans covering salaried
employees provide pension benefits based on years of service and
compensation. Plans covering hourly employees generally provide
benefits of stated amounts for each year of service. Our funding
policy is to make contributions based on the projected unit
credit method and to limit contributions to amounts that are
currently deductible for tax purposes. In addition, certain
current and former employees at our Norfolk shipyard are covered
by two qualified pension plans and two defined benefit deferred
compensation plans providing for payments upon retirement,
death, or disability. With the exception of Bofors, most of our Defense Systems
segment employees are covered by postretirement health care and
life insurance benefit programs. Employees generally become
eligible to receive benefits under these plans after they
retire, to the extent that they meet minimum retirement age and
service requirements. The cost of providing most of these
benefits is shared with retirees. We have reserved the right to
change or eliminate these benefit plans. At December31, 2004, Bofors had a pension obligation of
$165million, which is included in accrued pension and
postretirement benefit cost on the consolidated balance sheet at
December31, 2004, in accordance with FAS132R. At
December31, 2003, Bofors had a pension obligation of
$161million, which was included in accrued pension and
postretirement benefit cost on the consolidated balance sheet at
December31, 2003. Bofors pension obligation is
administered by an agent of the Swedish government using methods
and assumptions different from those used to determine domestic
amounts. Accordingly, the following tables do not include this
liability. The Swedish Government maintains the pension plan and
accordingly controls the assets of the plan. Consequently, the
investment strategy, plan asset mix, estimated F-16 UNITED DEFENSE INDUSTRIES, INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTSContinued rate of return, future expected annual benefit payments and the
accumulated pension obligation are not available to Bofors.
Bofors expects to contribute approximately $42million to
their pension plan during 2005. We used December31 as the measurement date for the
majority of our plans. The information contained in the following tables is based on
reliable and reasonable estimates. Differences between the
actual amounts of plan assets and the amounts included in these
tables are considered immaterial. The change in benefit obligation and plan assets of the plans

The expected long-term rate of return on assets assumption of
85% for the pension plans was based on historical returns of
the assets in the pension plans. F-18 UNITED DEFENSE INDUSTRIES, INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL

77% for the other retirement benefit plans was chosen from the
range of likely results of compound average annual returns over
a 20-year time horizon. The model was based on historical equity

Senior Secured Credit Facility In August 2001, we entered into a credit facility with various
banks that included $600million of term loan facilities
and a $200million revolving credit facility. On
July2, 2002 we amended the credit facility to borrow an
additional $300million for the purchase of USMR see
note3. We incurred $55million in additional
financing fees that have been deferred and are being amortized
over the remaining term of the credit facility using the
effective interest method. Outstanding borrowings on the term loan facilities were
$5770million and $5249million at December31,
2003 and December31, 2004, respectively. The facilities
bear interest at variable rates with a weighted average rate of
443% at December31, 2004. These loans are due through
2009 and provide for quarterly principal and interest payments. The revolving credit facility provides for loans and letters of
credit and matures in 2007. We had outstanding letters of credit
under the facility of approximately $757million at
December31, 2004, and $1243million available under
the revolving credit facility at December31, 2004. We are
obligated to pay a fee of 0375% on the unused revolving credit
facility. Amounts outstanding under the senior secured credit facility are
guaranteed by certain of our subsidiaries and are secured by a
lien on our assets. The senior secured credit facility contains customary covenants
restricting the incurrence of debt, encumbrances on and sales of
assets, limitations on mergers and certain acquisitions,
limitations on changes in control, certain restrictions on
payment of dividends, provision for the maintenance of certain
financial ratios F-20 UNITED DEFENSE INDUSTRIES, INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTSContinued and various other financial covenants and restrictions. There
were no events of default as of December31, 2004. Pursuant to the terms of the agreement entered into under the
senior secured credit facility, our applicable margin for the
term loans may be reduced if our leverage ratio as defined in
the Agreement decreases. Our results during the years ended
December31, 2003 and December31, 2004 exceeded the
required leverage ratio targets, resulting in a reduction of the
margin in the interest rates and reduced pricing for letters of
credit, effective as of January1, 2004 and January1,
2005. We made total debt repayments under the credit facility of
$1409million, $130million, and $520million
during 2002, 2003, and 2004, respectively. Cash paid for
interest was $276million, $252million, and

Commitments and Contingencies   
Termination Claims In 1994 the U.S.Army initiated the Crusader program to
develop an integrated and extensively automated two-vehicle
artillery system consisting of a 155mm, self-propelled howitzer
and a resupply vehicle. During the lifetime of the program, we
were the sole-source prime contractor for its design and
development. The Armys plan called for fielding of 480
Crusader systems, but in May 2002 the Secretary of Defense
announced the termination of the program. We subsequently
received Army funding to accomplish an orderly closeout of
Crusader activities and transition key Crusader technologies to
the Future Combat Systems FCS Non Line of
Sight-Cannon NLOS-C program. Through
December31, 2004, we incurred $392million of
termination costs of which we have invoiced and recovered
$363million from the Army. In order to complete the
Crusader termination process, we are negotiating a final
termination settlement with the Army which we expect to conclude
in due course. In 1997 we were awarded a contract to provide repairs and
maintenance for the U.S.Navy on mine-countermeasures class
vessels that were home-ported in Ingleside, Texas. We
established a ship repair operation on leased facilities to
accomplish this contract as well as follow-on contracts which
continued through 2004. During 2004, the U.S.Navys
contract awards in Ingleside were protested by a competitor.
Although we were not directly involved in this protest, the
U.S.Navy elected to terminate our contract as well as
other related ship repair contracts at Ingleside for the
convenience of the government. We chose not to participate in
re-procurement activities because this process is expected to be
lengthy and costly. Our operation in Ingleside ceased in October
2004, and all employees were either relocated or terminated by
December 2004. We will prepare and submit our termination claim
to the U.S.Navy in 2005. F-21 UNITED DEFENSE INDUSTRIES, INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTSContinued   
Operating Leases We lease office space, plants and facilities, and various types
of manufacturing, data processing and transportation equipment.
Rent expense for the years ended December31, 2002, 2003,
and 2004 was $182million, $216million and
$221million, respectively. Some of our leases contain
escalation clauses that increase rents based on future increases
in the Consumer Price Index. Minimum future rentals under
non-cancellable leases are estimated to be $159million in
2005, $122million in 2006, $104million in 2007 85million in 2008, $79million in 2009 and
$280million thereafter.   
Legal Proceedings As a government contractor, we are subject to the audit, review,
and investigative authority of various U.S.Government
agencies. Depending upon the particular jurisdictional statute,
violations of federal procurement rules may result in contract
price reductions or refunds, civil penalties, and/or criminal
penalties. Government contractors that violate the False Claims
Act and/or other applicable laws may be suspended or debarred
from receiving further government contracts. Given our
dependence on U.S.Government contracts, suspension or
debarment is an inherent risk that could readily have a material
adverse effect on us. Our policy is to cooperate with
governmental investigations and inquiries regarding compliance
matters, and we also make voluntary disclosures of compliance
issues to governmental agencies as appropriate. In the ordinary
course of business, we provide information on compliance matters
to various government agencies, and we expect to continue to do
so in the future. For example, as previously disclosed, in 2002
we were served with a grand jury subpoena issued by the United
States District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia,
seeking information regarding a 2000 contract between us and the
Italian government for the upgrading of amphibious assault
vehicles. We believe that the grand jury investigation seeks to
ascertain whether any violation of the Foreign Corrupt Practices
Act occurred in connection with the Italian contract. While we
are not aware of any such violation, and we are cooperating with
the investigation, it is too early for us to determine whether
the ultimate outcome of the investigation would have a material
adverse impact on our results of operations or financial
position. From time to time we are involved in legal proceedings arising
in the ordinary course of our business. We believe that we have
adequately reserved for these liabilities and that there is no
litigation pending that we expect to have a material adverse
effect on our results of operations or financial condition. Environmental Matters We incur costs annually to comply with environmental laws,
regulations and permits. Operating and maintenance costs
associated with ongoing environmental compliance and prevention
of pollution at our facilities are a normal, recurring part of
operations, are not significant relative to total operating
costs or cash flows, and are generally allowable as contract
costs under our contracts with the U.S.Government
Allowable Costs. As with compliance costs, a significant portion of our
expenditures for remediation of existing contamination related
to our facilities consist of Allowable Costs. As of
December31, 2004, we had accrued approximately
$324million to cover any investigation and/or remediation
costs that may or may not be Allowable Costs. The amount accrued
is based on managements best estimates of the probable and
reasonably estimable costs related to remediation obligations,
although there is a possibility that amounts in excess of costs
accrued may be incurred. Two of the most significant of the
estimated liabilities are related to ongoing remediation efforts
described below. One of our largest ship repair operations is located in
SanDiego, California. Pursuant to a requirement from the
California Regional Water Quality Control Board, we completed a
study of sedimentary contamination in SanDiego Bay. Once
definitive clean-up criteria are established, we expect that we
will be required to F-22 UNITED DEFENSE INDUSTRIES, INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTSContinued begin remediation procedures with respect to the contamination.
We anticipate that the total cost associated with the
remediation phase will range from $6million to
$9million, although it is conceivable that costs could be
as high as $30million if the most stringent clean-up
standard were to be adopted. Up to $91million of such
remediation costs, to the extent the costs are not recovered on
USMRs government contracts or from other responsible
parties, may be recoverable from USMRs former shareholders
under an escrow arrangement established in 1997 when the
SanDiego operation was acquired by USMR. Also, a further
$15million escrow fund was established in our 2002
acquisition of USMR, which we believe is available in respect to
USMRs remediation exposure. We have asserted claims
against both escrow funds, primarily on account of the potential
remediation exposure at SanDiego. Since approximately 1941, we and, prior to our formation, our
predecessors have operated a manufacturing and engineering
facility in Fridley, Minnesota. The majority of the Fridley
facility was historically owned by the U.S.Navy the
Navy property, but operated by us under contract
with and on behalf of the Navy. In June 2004, we purchased the
Navy property and most of the associated equipment. Since the
early 1980s, the Navy has expended more than
$30million in remediation costs, including site
investigation, on and adjacent to the Navy property, and the
Navy has indicated that it anticipates spending an additional
$10million on such matters at the site. The Navy has
engaged us in discussions as to whether we should pay a portion
of the expenses, and offered to resolve the matter if we would
pay approximately $84million for such purpose. We dispute
any responsibility for such costs, and also believe that any
remediation related costs that we may incur concerning the Navy
property would constitute Allowable Costs. However, there is
still uncertainty regarding the terms on which the matter might
ultimately be resolved whether by settlement, legal
proceedings, or otherwise. Also located at the Fridley, Minnesota site, is an 18acre
tract of land south of the manufacturing and engineering
facility used to dispose of plant wastes including industrial
wastes from the 1940s to 1969. Environmental
investigations conducted at the property revealed soil and
groundwater contamination was present. In 1987, a settlement
agreement was reached with the U.S.Government whereby the
U.S.Government made a lump sum payment for all past,
present and future investigation and remediation costs with the
provision any future response costs regarding this property
would be unallowable as part of direct or indirect costing of
government contracts. Presently, almost $76million has
been accrued to cover long-term operation, maintenance and
monitoring costs related to response activities for this
property.

Stockholders Equity   
Stock Options During 1998, we adopted the 1998 Stock Plan under which
3,375,000shares of common stock were reserved for
issuance. On April1, 2002, we amended the Stock Plan to
increase the number of shares of common stock available to
7,375,000 and provide for the granting of restricted stock under
the Stock Plan. On March2, 2004, we amended and restated
the Stock Plan in the form of the Incentive Award Plan of United

There were no options granted during the year ended
December31, 2002. In 2003, we granted stock options to
purchase2,215,323shares at a weighted average
exercise price of $2316. In 2004, we granted stock options to
purchase500,000 common shares at an exercise price of
$3180. No expenses were recorded related to these option grants
under APB Opinion No25. During 2002 and 2004, the Company issued 1,372 and
146,800shares of restricted stock, respectively, with a
weighted average fair value of $2185 and $3248, respectively.
No grants were made during 2003. Restricted shares are issued at
each respective market price of the stock at the date of grant.
The restricted shares require no payment from the recipient
employee or director and compensation expense is recorded based
on the market price on the grant date and is amortized over the
vesting period of three years. During 2004, compensation expense
related to these restricted stock grants was approximately
$10million, net of taxes. F-24 UNITED DEFENSE INDUSTRIES, INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL

At December31, 2004 the net deferred tax liability of
$252million represents net current and net non-current
deferred tax liabilities of $200million and
$52million, respectively. The net deferred tax liability
at December31, 2003 of $340million represents net
current and net non-current deferred tax liabilities of
$163million and $177million, respectively. In
assessing the realizability of deferred tax assets, we consider
whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of
the deferred tax assets will not be realized. In 2004, due to
the write-off of our investment in FNSS, we have established a
$75million valuation allowance for our foreign tax credit
carry-forwards. At December31, 2003 we established a
$05million valuation allowance which offsets
approximately $12million in capital loss carryovers. This
amount was fully reversed in 2004 because we utilized the
capital loss carry-forward. In 2002, we concluded that it was
more likely than not that sufficient future taxable income would
be generated to fully realize the deferred tax assets.
Accordingly, in 2002, we reversed the offsetting valuation
allowance in its entirety. Undistributed earnings of our Swedish subsidiary amounted to
approximately $211million at December31, 2004.
Those earnings are considered to be indefinitely reinvested;
accordingly, no provision for U.S.federal and state income
taxes has been provided thereon. Upon repatriation of those
earnings, in the form of dividends or otherwise, we would be
subject to both U.S.income taxes subject to an adjustment
for foreign tax credits and foreign withholding taxes.
Determination of the amount of unrecognized deferred
U.S.income tax liability is not practicable due to the
complexities associated with its hypothetical calculation;
however, unrecognized foreign tax credit carry-forwards would be
available to reduce some portion of the U.S.liability.
Withholding taxes of approximately $11million would be
payable upon remittance of all previously unremitted earnings at
December31, 2004. F-26 UNITED DEFENSE INDUSTRIES, INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTSContinued We paid $433million and $791million for income
taxes, net of refunds, in 2003 and 2004, respectively.

Fair Value of Financial Instruments The carrying amount of our financial instruments included in
current assets and current liabilities approximates their fair
value due to their short-term nature. The fair market value of
our long-term debt was estimated to be $5770million and
$5249million at December31, 2003 and 2004,
respectively, for the senior secured credit facility. Since the senior credit facility has variable rate debt, its
fair value approximates its carrying amount.

Significant Customer and Export Sales Sales to various agencies of the U.S. Government aggregated
$1,3615million, $1,5754million, and

Related Party Transactions In October 1997, The Carlyle Group Carlyle formed
United Defense Industries, Inc. as a wholly-owned entity in
order to acquire our predecessor, United Defense, L.P. Beginning
with our initial public offering in December 2001, Carlyle began
to sell major portions of its United Defense holdings. On
April30, 2004 Carlyle completed the sale of its remaining
United Defense shares. In connection with our initial public

which certain Carlyle entities had the right to designate up to
four nominees for our Board of Directors, so long as Carlyle
owned greater than 20% of our voting stock. By virtue of
Carlyles sales of United Defense shares, such agreements
have lapsed. Nonetheless, three individuals affiliated with
Carlyle Messrs.Carlucci, Clare, and Conway were
re-elected to our Board of Directors at our annual meeting on
April13, 2004, and Carlyle may thereby continue to
influence our operations. Commencing with Carlyles acquisition of United Defense in
October 1997, we agreed to pay Carlyle for various management
and consulting services under a management agreement with
Carlyle. The management agreement was terminated in March 2004,
and in connection with the termination, we made a final payment
of $30million to Carlyle for services rendered from
January1, 2002 through March31, 2004. We had not
previously paid Carlyle for services during this period. In June 2002 we entered into an agreement with CPU Technology,
Inc. CPU/T to purchase component and design
services regarding electronic subsystems for the Bradley
program. Our total purchases for the year ended
December31, 2004 were $13million and we currently
have $21million in purchase orders with CPU/T. Certain
Carlyle affiliates are minority stockholders of CPU/T and
collectively have the right to appoint two of the six members of
CPU/Ts board. As of December31, 2004, Bofors had an agreement with
QinetiQ to purchase component and design services regarding the
production of combat vehicle ammunition. We paid
$05million to QinetiQ for design and analysis services
for technology to be used in future combat systems during the
year ended December31 F-27 UNITED DEFENSE INDUSTRIES, INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTSContinued 2004 and had $18million in outstanding purchase orders at
December31, 2004. Carlyle holds a significant interest in
QinetiQ. We recognized $176million and $108million of
royalties, license fees and technical service fees during the
year ended December31, 2003 and 2004, respectively, from
our Turkish joint venture. We have also paid our Turkish joint
venture approximately $13million for miscellaneous parts
and kits for our M113 vehicles and Mk 25 canisters. Our subsidiary, HSI, purchases goods and services from various
entities which are owned and controlled by its current officers
or directors. Purchases are made pursuant to teaming agreements,
other preferred supplier agreements, and purely competitive
procurements. The aggregate amount of purchases by HSI from all
related party businesses during the twelve months ended
December31, 2004 was $85million. The aggregate
amount of sales by HSI to all related party businesses during
twelve months ended December31, 2004 was
$02million. It is our policy that any transactions with
related parties be on terms that are no less favorable than
those available from unrelated third parties. The transactions
with related parties entered into by our subsidiary HSI are on
terms that we believe are consistent with this policy.

Recent Developments Unaudited On March6, 2005, we entered into an agreement and plan of
merger the Merger Agreement with BAE Systems North
America Inc. BAE and BAEs wholly owned
subsidiary, Ute Acquisition Company Inc. The Merger Agreement
provides for BAEs acquisition of the United Defense
Industries, Inc. the Company. The consummation of
this transaction is subject to certain conditions, including the
adoption of the Merger Agreement by the required vote of our
stockholders and certain related regulatory approvals. If the
Merger Agreement is approved by the Companys stockholders
and if the other conditions in the Merger Agreement are met,
BAEs wholly owned subsidiary will merge into the Company,
which will be the surviving corporation, and each share of our
common stock will be converted into the right to receive $7500
in cash. For more information pertaining to the pending
transaction with BAE, please refer to our current report on

Controls and Procedures   
Disclosure Controls and Procedures We maintain disclosure controls and procedures designed to
ensure that information required to be disclosed in our
Companys Exchange Act reports is recorded, processed,
summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the
SECs rules and forms, and that such information is
accumulated and communicated to our management, including our
Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as
appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required
disclosure. In designing and evaluating the disclosure controls
and procedures, management recognizes that any controls and
procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can
provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired
control objectives, and management is necessarily required to
apply its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship
of possible controls and procedures. Also, we have investments
in certain unconsolidated entities. As we do not control or
manage these entities, the disclosure controls and procedures
with respect to such entities are necessarily substantially more
limited than those we maintain with respect to our consolidated
subsidiaries. As of December31, 2004, we carried out an evaluation,
under the supervision and with the participation of our
management, including the Chief Executive Officer and the Chief
Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of the design and
operation of the our disclosure controls and procedures. Based
on the foregoing, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief
Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and
procedures were effective. There have been no significant changes in our internal controls
or in other factors that could significantly affect the internal
controls subsequent to the date we completed the evaluation.   
Managements Report on Internal Control over Financial
Reporting Internal control over financial reporting refers to the process
designed by, or under the supervision of, our Chief Executive
Officer and Chief Financial Officer, and effected by our board
of directors, management and other personnel, to provide
reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial
reporting and the preparation of financial statements for
external purposes in accordance with U.S.generally
accepted accounting principles, and includes those policies and
procedures that 1Pertain to the maintenance of records that in
reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the transactions
and dispositions of the assets of the Company 2Provide reasonable assurance that transactions are
recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial
statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting
principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the Company
are being made only in accordance with authorizations of
managements and directors of the Company;and 3Provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or
timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition
of the Companys assets that could have a material effect
on the financial statements. Internal control over financial reporting cannot provide
absolute assurance of achieving financial reporting objectives
because of its inherent limitations. Internal control over
financial reporting is a process that involves human diligence
and compliance and is subject to lapses in judgment and
breakdowns resulting from human failures. Internal control over
financial reporting also can be circumvented by collusion or
improper management override. Because of such limitations, there
is a risk that material misstatements may not be prevented or
detected on a timely basis by internal control over financial
reporting. However, these inherent limitations are known
features of the financial reporting process. Therefore, it is
possible to design into the process safeguards to reduce, though
not eliminate, this risk. Management is responsible for
establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over
financial reporting for the Company. 42 Management has used the framework set forth in the report
entitled Internal Control Integrated
Framework published by the Committee of Sponsoring
Organizations COSO of the Treadway Commission to
evaluate the effectiveness of the Companys internal
control over financial reporting. Management has concluded that
the Companys internal control over financial reporting was
effective as of December31, 2004. Ernst Young
LLP, our independent registered public accounting firm, has
issued an attestation report dated March4, 2005 on
managements assessment of the Companys internal
control over financial reporting, which is included in this
