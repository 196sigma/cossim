ITEM 8. FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA
REPORT OF ERNST & YOUNG LLP, INDEPENDENT AUDITORS
The Board of Directors and Shareholders
Targeted Genetics Corporation
We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Targeted
Genetics Corporation as of December 31, 2000 and 1999, and the related
consolidated statements of operations, shareholders' equity, and cash flows for
each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2000. These financial
statements are the responsibility of the Company management. Our
responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on
our audits.
We conducted our audits in accordance with auditing standards generally
accepted in the United States. Those standards require that we plan and perform
the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements
are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test
basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial
statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and
significant estimates made by management, as well as the overall financial
statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis
for our opinion.
In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly,
in all material respects, the consolidated financial position of Targeted
Genetics Corporation at December 31, 2000 and 1999, and the consolidated
results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the
period ended December 31, 2000 in conformity with accounting principles
generally accepted in the United States.
As discussed in Note 2 to the financial statements, in 2000 the Company
changed its method of accounting for revenue recognition.

40             TARGETED GENETICS CORPORATION
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
1. Nature of Operations
Targeted Genetics Corporation is developing gene therapy products and
technologies for the treatment of certain acquired and inherited diseases.
Targeted Genetics was incorporated in the state of Washington in March 1989.
2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies
Basis of Presentation
The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Targeted
Genetics and its wholly-owned subsidiaries Genovo, Inc., TGCF Manufacturing
Corporation and CellExSys, Inc. All intercompany transactions have been
eliminated. Targeted Genetics' operations constitute one business segment.
Cash Equivalents
Targeted Genetics considers as cash equivalents all short-term investments
with a purchased maturity of three months or less that are readily convertible
into cash and have insignificant interest rate risk. Cash equivalents, valued
at cost that approximates fair market value, consist principally of money
market accounts and shares of a short-term limited-maturity mutual fund. All
other investments are reported as securities available for sale.
Securities Available for Sale
Securities available for sale consist primarily of corporate debt securities
and U.S. government notes that, on the average, mature within one year.
Targeted Genetics classifies all of its securities investments as securities
available for sale. Securities held are stated at market value, with any
unrealized gains and losses included as a component of shareholders' equity.
The cost of debt securities in this category is adjusted for amortization of
premiums and accretion of discounts to maturity, which are included in
investment income. Realized gains and losses and declines in value on
securities available for sale judged to be other than temporary are also
included in investment income. The cost of securities sold is calculated using
the specific identification method.
Fair Value of Financial Instruments
The carrying amounts of financial instruments such as cash and cash
equivalents, securities available for sale, investments, accounts receivable
and accounts payable reasonably approximate fair value, because of the short-
term nature of these items. Targeted Genetics believes the carrying amounts of
the note payable and capital lease obligations approximate fair value because
the interest rates on these instruments change with, or approximate, market
interest rates.
Long-Lived Assets
Property, plant and equipment are stated at cost. Depreciation of furniture
and equipment is provided using the straight-line method over the assets'
estimated useful lives, which range from three to seven years. Furniture and
equipment under capitalized leases are amortized over the life of the lease.
Leasehold improvements are amortized over the life of the improvements or the
term of the lease, whichever is shorter. Amortization of assets recorded under
capital leases is included with depreciation expense.
41             TARGETED GENETICS CORPORATION
NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS--Continued  Intangible assets consist of assembled workforce, employment contracts,
acquired AAV core technology and goodwill and are amortized on the straight-
line method over periods ranging from two to seven years.
In accordance with SFAS No. 121 Accounting for the Impairment of Long-Lived
Assets and for Long-Live Assets to be Disposed of, the carrying value of
intangible assets is reviewed on a regular basis to determin whether factors
are present that may indicate impairment. To date, no factors are present that
would indicate impairment. Sound impairment exist in the future, the impairment
would be measured based on the excess of the carrying value of the assets over
the discounted future cash flows expected to be generated by the impaired
assets.
Stock Compensation
As permitted by the provisions of Financial Accounting Standards Board
FASB Statement No. 123, Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation, Targeted
Genetics has elected to follow Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 25,
Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees, and related interpretations in
accounting for its employee stock option grants and to apply the disclosure-
only provisions to account for its stock option plans. Targeted Genetics does
not recognize any compensation expense related to the plans because all options
are granted at fair market value on the date of grant. Options granted to
consultants are accounted for using the Black-Scholes method prescribed by
Statement No. 123 and are subject to periodic revaluation over their vesting
terms.
Revenue Recognition under Collaborative Agreements
Targeted Genetics generates revenues from technology licenses, collaborative
research arrangements and cost reimbursement contracts. Revenue under
technology licenses and collaborative agreements typically consists of
nonrefundable, up-front license fees, collaborative research funding,
technology access fees and various other payments.
Revenue from nonrefundable, up-front license fees and technology access
payments is recognized ratably over the development period in the collaborative
agreement. Revenue associated with performance milestones is recognized as
earned, based upon the achievement of the milestones defined in the applicable
agreements. Revenue under research and development cost-reimbursement contracts
is recognized as the related costs are incurred. Advance payments received in
excess of amounts earned are classified as deferred revenue.
Targeted Genetics previously recognized nonrefundable, up-front license fees
as revenue when the technology was transferred and when all of its significant
contractual obligations relating to the fees had been fulfilled. Effective
January 1, 2000, Targeted Genetics changed its method of accounting for
nonrefundable up-front license fees to recognize such fees over the term of the
related research and development collaboration arrangement on a straight-line
basis, as this method best matches the effort provided. Targeted Genetics
believes that this change in accounting principle is preferable, based on
guidance provided in the SEC Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 101, Revenue
Recognition in Financial Statements. The $37 million cumulative effect of the
change in accounting principle, calculated as of January 1, 2000, was reported
as a charge for the year 2000. The cumulative effect was recorded as deferred
revenue that will be recognized as revenue over the remaining term of the
research and development collaboration agreements. In September 2000, Targeted
Genetics recognized a nonrefundable, up-front fee of $50 million. This amount
has been reversed and will be recognized over the term of the related research
and development arrangement, of which $430,000 has been recognized during 2000.
In November 2000, the Company received another nonrefundable up-front fee of
$50 million. This amount will be recognized over the term of the related
research and development arrangement. For 2000, the impact of the change in
accounting was to increase net loss by $114 million, or
42             TARGETED GENETICS CORPORATION
NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS--Continued 030 per share, comprised of the $37 million cumulative effect of the change
as described above $010 per share, net of $21 million of related deferred
revenue that was recognized as revenue during the year $006 per share, and
$105 million of revenue deferred under the agreements executed in September
2000 and November 2000, less $704,000 recognized during 2000. The remainder of
the related deferred revenue will be recognized as revenue approximately as
follows: $50 million in 2001, $34 million in 2002 and $30 million in 2003.
Had the change in accounting been in effect retroactively to January 1, 1999,
net loss for 1999 would have decreased by $21 million, or $007 per share. The
pro forma amounts shown on the statement of operations have been adjusted for
the effects on revenue that would have applied had the new method been in
effect during the periods presented.
Net Loss Per Share
Basic net loss per share is computed based on the weighted average number of
common shares outstanding during the period after giving effect to preferred
stock dividends. Targeted Genetics' diluted net loss per share is the same as
its basic net loss per share because all stock options, warrants and other
potentially dilutive securities are antidilutive and are therefore excluded
from the calculation of diluted net loss per share. The total number of shares
excluded from this calculation of diluted net loss per share, prior to the
application of the treasury stock method for options, was 14,552,758,
13,807,922 and 6,982,589 for 2000, 1999 and 1998, respectively.
Use of Estimates
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally
accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and
assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and
accompanying notes. Actual results may differ from those estimates.
New Accounting Pronouncements
In June 1998, the FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards
No. 133, Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities.
Statement No. 133, which is effective beginning in 2001, establishes accounting
and reporting standards for derivative instruments, including certain
derivative instruments embedded in other contracts, and for hedging activities.
Because Targeted Genetics does not currently hold derivative instruments or
engage in hedging activities, the impact of Statement No. 133 is not expected
to be material.
Reclassifications
Certain reclassifications have been made to conform to the current year
presentation.
3. Business Combinations
On September 19, 2000, Targeted Genetics acquired all of the outstanding
shares of capital stock of Genovo, Inc., a development-stage biotechnology
company specializing in viral gene delivery. Targeted Genetics accounted for
the acquisition of Genovo as a purchase transaction. The total purchase price
for the acquisition was approximately $664 million, which consisted of the
following                                 
Issuance of 5,250,805 shares of common stock. $58,461,000

7 years  Of the 5,250,805 shares issued in the merger, 550,872 shares are held in
escrow for the benefit of former Genovo stockholders. Subject to the
fulfillment of specified representations and warranties in the merger
agreement, all or a portion of the escrowed shares will be released to the
stockholders in accordance with the terms of the merger agreement during the
18-month period following the merger date.
Under two circumstances, Targeted Genetics may issue additional shares of
its common stock as merger consideration, as follows. Because specified Genovo licensing arrangements were unresolved at the
time of the merger, Targeted Genetics and Genovo agreed to establish an
escrow of 700,000 shares. These shares are held in escrow for the
benefit of former Genovo stockholders. All, a portion, or none of the
escrowed shares, depending on whether and the extent to which Targeted
Genetics successfully renegotiates these license terms, will be release
to the former Genovo stockholders no later than 18 months after the
merger. In connection with the merger and an August 1999 collaborative research
agreement between Genzyme Corporation and Genovo, Targeted Genetics
assumed Genzyme outstanding option to purchase Genovo capital stock in
two tranches. After the merger, Genzyme exercised the first option
tranche to purchase 311,295 shares of Targeted Genetics common stock, at
a price of $128495 per share. In August 2001, Genzyme may exercise the
second option tranche and acquire up to an additional 311,295 shares of
Targeted Genetics common stock as successor company to Genovo, also at
a price of $128495 per share. If, at that time, Genzyme should elect to
purchase fewer than 311,295 shares of Targeted Genetics common stock,
the former Genovo shareholders and optionholders will receive additional
purchase price consideration in the form of shares equal to one-half the
difference between the number of shares purchased by Genzyme and the
311,295 shares purchasable by Genzyme.
In each of the above circumstances, the fair value of the shares issued to
the former Genovo shareholders, if any, will be determined on the date of
resolution of the matter described and will be reflected as additional purchase
price. No amounts related to these contingencies have been included in the
purchase price to date.
44             TARGETED GENETICS CORPORATION
NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS--Continued  Certain stock options assumed by the Company were subject to continuing
employment. The intrinsic value of the invested options of $301,000 was
recorded as deferred compensation. As of December 31, 2000 all of the deferred
compensation had been earned and recognized as expense.
Acquired in-process research and development IPR in the acquisition was
evaluated utilizing the present value of the estimated after-tax cash flows
expected to be generated by the purchased technology, which had not reached
technological feasibility at the effective time of the acquisition. The cash
flow projections for revenue are based on estimates of growth rates and the
aggregate size of the markets for each product or technology; the probability
of technical success given the stage of development at the time of acquisition;
royalty rates, based on prior licensing agreements; product sales cycles; and
the estimated life of the product underlying technology. Estimated operating
expenses and income taxes were deducted from estimated revenue projections to
arrive at estimated after-tax cash flows. The rates utilized to discount
projected cash flows for in-process technologies were 30% to 45%, depending on
the relative risk of each in-process technology, and were based primarily on
Targeted Genetics' internal rates of return, cost of capital, rates of return
for research and development and the weighted average cost of capital at the
time of acquisition. Projected operating expenses include general and
administrative expenses and research and development costs.
Targeted Genetics based all of the foregoing estimates and projections
regarding the Genovo acquisition on assumptions that it believed to be
reasonable at the time of the acquisition but that are inherently uncertain and
unpredictable. If Targeted Genetics does not successfully develop the projects
and technologies considered in these estimates, its business, operating results
and financial condition may be adversely affected. As of the date of the
acquisition, management concluded that the technologies under development, once
completed, could be economically used only for their specifically intended
purposes and that the in-process technology had no alternative future use after
taking into consideration the overall objectives of the project, progress
toward the objectives and uniqueness of developments to these objectives. If
Targeted Genetics fails in these development efforts, no alternative economic
value will result from these technologies and the economic contribution
projected to be made by the IPR will not materialize. The risk of
unsuccessful or untimely completion includes the risk that Targeted Genetics'
competitors will develop alternative gene delivery technologies or will develop
more effective or economically feasible technologies using more traditional
approaches to treating human diseases.
The following table reflects unaudited consolidated pro forma results of
operations for the year ended December 31, 2000, which give effect to the
Genovo acquisition as if it had occurred on January 1, 2000, and for the year
ended December 31, 1999, which give effect to the Genovo acquisition as if it
had occurred on January 1, 1999. These pro forma amounts are not necessarily
indicative of what the actual consolidated results of operations would have
been if the acquisition had been effective at the beginning of each of these
periods. The pro forma information does not include the one-time charges for

Under an agreement with Celltech, subject to specified circumstances,
Celltech will loan Targeted Genetics up to $20 million. Loan proceeds are
unsecured and are required to be used to partially finance the cost of
establishing tgAAV-CF manufacturing facilities for the supply of bulk product
to be used in Phase III clinical trials and for initial commercial launch. As
of December 31, 2000 and 1999, Targeted Genetics had $10 million in loans
outstanding under this agreement. Interest on borrowings is payable annually in
arrears at a rate that is 150 basis points over the one-month LIBOR rate, but
neither less than 5% nor more than 7% per year. Targeted Genetics recognized
$70,000 of Celltech loan interest expense in 2000 and $19,000 in 1999.
Principal is due and payable in November 2003, or earlier if the cumulative net
product sales of Targeted Genetics' cystic fibrosis product equal or exceed
$600 million. The loan agreement contains financial covenants including limits
on Targeted Genetics' ability to declare or pay dividends. Targeted Genetics
can, at its option and with Celltech consent, repay the loan with its common
stock at any time during the loan term, at a conversion price equal to the
average closing price of the common stock over a 20 day period preceding the
repayment date.
In September 2000, as part of its acquisition of Genovo, Targeted Genetics
assumed promissory notes with an outstanding principal amount of $650,000
previously issued by Genovo to Biogen. The notes bear no interest and are due
in September 2005. At the time of the acquisition , Targeted Genetics
discounted the notes to reflect market interest rates, using an imputed
interest rate of 56%. In 2000, Targeted Genetics recognized $8,000 of interest
expense relating to the Biogen promissory notes.
8. Shareholders' Equity
Series B Preferred Stock
In July 1999, Elan International Services, Ltd. purchased $12,015,000 of
Targeted Genetics' Series B preferred stock in conjunction with the formation
of the Emerald Gene Systems Ltd. joint venture. See Note 14. This preferred
stock bears an annual dividend of 7%, accrued semi-annually and added to
principal. As of December 31, 2000 and 1999, Targeted Genetics had accrued
dividends of $13 million and $376,000, respectively. The Series B preferred
stock is convertible until July 2005, at Elan option, into Targeted Genetics
common stock, at a price of $332 per share. Elan holdings of the Series B
preferred stock were convertible into 3,998,375 shares of the common stock as
of December 31, 2000. Targeted Genetics would issue 5,740,548 shares of its
common stock if Elan were to elect to convert its preferred stock into shares
of common stock as of July 21, 2005, the expiration of the conversion option.
Alternatively, Elan has an option to
47             TARGETED GENETICS CORPORATION
NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS--Continued
exchange the Series B preferred stock and all accumulated dividends for a 301%
interest in Emerald. This exchange option is exercisable up to six months after
the completion of a research and development program that is currently
anticipated to be 36 to 48 months in length. This exchange right will terminate
if the preferred stock is converted into common stock, unless the conversion
occurs as a result of a liquidation or specified transactions involving a
change of control of Targeted Genetics.
Should Targeted Genetics liquidate or wind-up its operations, Targeted
Genetics' articles of incorporation give preferred shareholders priority over
common shareholders with respect to the assets legally available for
distribution to shareholders. The Series B shareholders' liquidation preference
is at the original purchase price. Targeted Genetics has redemption rights to
these shares only in certain instances involving a change of control. Holders
of Series B preferred stock are not entitled to vote together with holders of
common stock with respect to election of directors or other corporate
governance matters.
Warrants
In June 1999, Targeted Genetics issued warrants to purchase 2,000,000 shares
of its common stock to Alkermes, Inc. These warrants were issued in two
tranches of 1,000,000 shares each. The warrants expire in June 2007 and June
2009 and have an exercise price of $250 and $416 per share, respectively. See
Note 10.
In 1998, Targeted Genetics completed a private placement of common stock and
warrants, which resulted in net proceeds of approximately $128 million.
Warrants to purchase a total of 4,333,333 shares of common stock were issued in
the transaction, with an exercise price of $200 per share and an expiration of
April 2003.
Targeted Genetics has outstanding warrants to purchase a total of 64,842
shares related to equipment financing and consulting agreements. These warrants
have a weighted average price of $466 per share and expire between May 2001
and March 2004.
At December 31, 2000, 6,398,175 shares of common stock were reserved for
issuance upon the conversion of all outstanding warrants.
Shareholder Rights Plan
Targeted Genetics has adopted a shareholder rights plan, under which it has
distributed a dividend of one right for each outstanding share of common stock.
These rights could cause substantial dilution to persons or groups that attempt
to acquire Targeted Genetics on terms not approved by its Board of Directors.
Stock Options
Targeted Genetics has four stock option plans. Beginning in 1999, Targeted
Genetics began granting all options from its 1999 Stock Option Plan the 1999
Plan, and discontinued grants from two other plans existing at that time. In
2000, in connection with the acquisition of Genovo, Targeted Genetics
established the Genovo, Inc. Roll-over Stock Option Plan the Genovo Plan.
The 1999 Plan provides for option grants of up to a maximum of 15 million
shares of common stock to employees, directors and officers of Targeted
Genetics and to consultants, agents, advisors and independent
contractors who provide services to Targeted Genetics or its subsidiaries.
Generally, options vest in even quarterly or annual increments over a three- to
five-year period. All options expire ten years from date of grant. As of
December 31, 2000, options to purchase 524,135 shares were available for future
grant under the 1999 Plan.
48             TARGETED GENETICS CORPORATION
NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS--Continued  The Genovo Plan was established to convert Genovo employees' options to
purchase shares of common stock of Genovo into options to purchase common stock
of Targeted Genetics. Targeted Genetics issued options to purchase 679,444
shares of Targeted Genetics common stock under the Genovo Plan to the former
employees of Genovo, based on their option holdings in Genovo before the
acquisition. These options are fully vested and expire ten years from the date
that the underlying Genovo stock options were granted. The Genovo Plan is
subject to approval by the shareholders of Targeted Genetics.

In 1998, Targeted Genetics offered active employees, except executive
officers, the opportunity to cancel previously awarded stock option grants with
exercise prices greater than the current market price of common stock and to be
granted the same number of new options at the closing market price on the grant
date. Substantially all eligible employees elected to replace their previously
awarded stock option grants, resulting in the cancellation of options to
purchase 531,550 shares, at an average price of $377 per share, and the
issuance of options to purchase the same number of shares at $122 per share.
The new options awarded under this offer vest over a three-year period, ending
in February 2001.

In connection with the Genovo acquisition and an August 1999 collaborative
research agreement between Genzyme and Genovo, Targeted Genetics assumed
Genzyme outstanding option to purchase Genovo capital stock in two tranches.
As discussed in Note 3, Genzyme exercised the first option tranche after the
merger and purchased 311,295 shares of Targeted Genetics common stock, at a

9. Collaborative Agreements
Celltech Group Agreement
In 1998, Targeted Genetics entered into a series of agreements with Medeva
Pharmaceuticals, Inc. In January 2000, Medeva merged with Celltech/Chiroscience
to become part of Celltech Group plc. Celltech has assumed Medeva rights and
responsibilities under these agreements, under which Targeted Genetics and
Celltech will collaborate to develop on a worldwide basis Targeted Genetics'
tgAAV-CF gene therapy product for the treatment of cystic fibrosis. Under a
research and development funding agreement, Targeted Genetics received a
license and technology access fee of $50 million at the time of signing and a
milestone payment of $10 million related to the start of Phase I clinical
trials for the aerosolized version of the tgAAV-CF product. In addition,
Celltech will pay up to $50 million per year for three years to fund Targeted
Genetics' tgAAV-CF research and development activities and certain Phase I
clinical trial expenses and will pay the costs of Phase II and subsequent
clinical trials of the product candidate. Assuming successful development and
regulatory approval, Celltech will have the exclusive right to market the
product on a worldwide basis. Under a long-term supply agreement, Targeted
Genetics will manufacture and supply bulk product to Celltech under a pricing
formula constructed to compensate Targeted Genetics with a fixed percentage of
Celltech net product sales.
The research and development funding agreement is effective from October
1998 to October 2001, with an option to extend the term if both parties agree.
The long-term supply agreement is effective for the term of the patents
covering Targeted Genetics' tgAAV-CF technology. Celltech has the option to
terminate the agreements at will with 180 days' notice. Should Celltech
exercise this right to terminate, all rights related to tgAAV-CF technology
would return to Targeted Genetics.
Targeted Genetics recognized $67 million, $64 million and $70 million of
revenue under the Celltech agreements in 2000, 1999 and 1998, respectively. As
a result of implementing SAB 101, $21 million of revenue from amortization of
a nonrefundable up-front fee received in 1998 is included in the $67 million
recognized in 2000.
Under related agreements, Celltech agreed to purchase $30 million of
Targeted Genetics common stock and, as described below, to loan Targeted
Genetics up to $120 million for the construction of manufacturing facilities.
Celltech purchased $30 million of Targeted Genetics common stock in two
tranches: 750,000 shares

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS--Continued
of common stock for $15 million upon signing the agreements in 1998 and
677,392 shares of common stock for $15 million in 1999. Under the agreements,
subject to specified conditions, Targeted Genetics can draw up to $20 million
to partially fund construction of facilities to support Phase III clinical
trials and initial commercialization of tgAAV-CF product candidates. At
December 31, 2000, Targeted Genetics had drawn $10 million. Celltech will also
loan Targeted Genetics, under specified conditions, up to an additional
$100 million toward building a manufacturing facility compliant with the FDA
Good Manufacturing Practices guidelines for higher-volume production of tgAAV-
CF. No amounts have been drawn under this commitment.
Emerald Gene Systems Joint Venture
In July 1999, Targeted Genetics and Elan International Services, Ltd. formed
Emerald Gene Systems, Ltd., a joint venture to develop enhanced gene delivery
technology and products.
Elan has agreed to loan Targeted Genetics up to $120 million, in the form
of a convertible promissory note, to support Targeted Genetics' share of
Emerald research and development costs. The note has a six-year term and any
draws made under the note accrue interest at 12% per year. The note and related
accrued interest are convertible, at Elan option, into Targeted Genetics
common stock at a conversion price equal to 150% of the average closing price
of Targeted Genetics common stock for the 60 trading days ending two business
days before the draws. Alternatively, the note agreement includes provisions
allowing Targeted Genetics, at its option, to convert the note into common
stock at the lesser of the then-current market price and the Elan conversion
price. As of December 31, 2000 and 1999, Targeted Genetics had not drawn on the
note.
Targeted Genetics also entered into an agreement with Elan that requires
Elan to purchase up to $100 million of Targeted Genetics common stock. Elan
purchased $50 million of common stock 2,148,899 shares at the closing of the
joint venture transaction and purchased the remaining $50 million of common
stock 382,739 shares in July 2000, the one-year anniversary of the agreement.
Biogen Agreement
In September 2000, Targeted Genetics established a multiple-product
development and commercialization collaboration with Biogen, Inc. Biogen paid
Targeted Genetics $80 million, which included up-front prepaid research and
development funding of $30 million, upon initiation of the collaboration.
Biogen will also provide Targeted Genetics with a minimum of $30 million of
additional research and development funding over three years, at a rate of $10
million per year. Under the terms of the collaborative agreement, Targeted
Genetics granted Biogen an exclusive worldwide license to sell products
developed in the collaboration and assumed responsibility for manufacturing and
supplying bulk vector supplies to Biogen to support product development,
clinical trials and product commercialization.
Under a related funding agreement, Biogen also agreed to provide Targeted
Genetics with loans of up to $100 million and to purchase up to $100 million
of Targeted Genetics common stock, each at Targeted Genetics' discretion.
Targeted Genetics may make up to five draws against the $100 million loan
amount, with any draws bearing interest at market rates. Any draws against the
loan, all of which must be made before September 2005, mature after five years
but no later than September 2006. Until September 2003, Targeted Genetics can
elect to have Biogen purchase the $100 million of common stock in one or more
tranches, at a price per share equal to the average of the daily closing prices
of a share of Targeted Genetics common stock for a specified period of time
before and after the applicable exercise date. As of December 31, 2000,
Targeted Genetics had neither drawn any proceeds on this loan nor exercised its
right to have Biogen purchase shares of its common stock.
52             TARGETED GENETICS CORPORATION
NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS--Continued  Assuming successful commercialization of products under the Biogen
collaboration, Targeted Genetics could receive an aggregate of up to $125
million in license fees, development funding, milestone payments, loan proceeds
and equity investments connected to the Biogen agreements. Targeted Genetics
will receive royalties based upon any sales of products that result from the
collaborative product development efforts or, alternatively, will sell product
to Biogen at transfer prices that include sales-based and cost-based
components.
The research and development funding agreement is effective to September 30,
2003, with an option to extend the term if both parties agree. The product
manufacturing and supply provisions of the agreement are effective for the term
of the patents covering the Targeted Genetics technology. Although Biogen may
terminate the development and commercialization agreement at any time following
the first anniversary of the agreement, Biogen obligation under the related
funding agreement to pay the minimum annual project funding totaling $30
million over three years would continue.
Targeted Genetics is amortizing the $50 million up-front fee paid by Biogen
over the initial three-year research and development performance period.
Targeted Genetics will recognize revenue on the remaining $30 million of up-
front payment and the $10 million minimum annual project funding as it
performs research and development efforts. Targeted Genetics performed no
research and development efforts attributable to the Biogen collaboration
agreements in 2000.
Genetics Institute Agreement
In November 2000, Targeted Genetics entered into a collaboration to develop
gene therapy products for the treatment of hemophilia with Genetics Institute,
the biotechnology research division of Wyeth-Ayerst, a division of American
Home Products Corporation. Under terms of the research and development funding
agreement, Genetics Institute paid Targeted Genetics $5 million in
nonrefundable up-front payments and $500,000 in reimbursements for research
performed before the collaboration and will pay up to $15 million for
developing a hemophilia A candidate product over a three-year research and
development collaboration. Subject to the achievement of specified objectives,
Genetics Institute could pay additional product development and
commercialization milestones payments of up to $60 million. In addition,
Targeted Genetics also granted Genetics Institute an option to collaborate on
the development of a hemophilia B product candidate, which, if developed, would
trigger additional payments to Targeted Genetics. Genetics Institute also
agreed, upon the occurrence of specified events, to enter into an agreement to
loan Targeted Genetics up to $10 million to finance manufacturing facility
expansions. Under a related supply agreement, Genetics Institute agreed to pay
Targeted Genetics to manufacture product for clinical trials and, upon
approval, for commercial use according to a sales-based formula. In addition,
Genetics Institute agreed to manage and fund the costs of clinical trials and
related regulatory filings required for product approval and marketing.
Genetics Institute will retain global marketing rights for any products
resulting from the alliance.
The research and development funding agreement is effective until October
2003, with an option to extend the term if both parties agree. The supply
agreement is effective for the term of the initial product development period,
to be extended should regulatory agencies approve a product for commercial use.
Genetics Institute has the right to terminate both agreements at will, with 180
days' notice. Should Genetics Institute exercise this right to terminate, all
rights that Targeted Genetics granted or otherwise extended to Genetics
Institute related to the hemophilia technology would return to Targeted
Genetics.
Targeted Genetics is amortizing the $50 million up-front fee and the up-
front $500,000 research reimbursement from the Genetics Institute collaboration
over the initial three-year research and development performance period.
53             TARGETED GENETICS CORPORATION
NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS--Continued Genzyme Agreement
When Targeted Genetics acquired Genovo, it assumed a three-year Development
and License Agreement with Genzyme Corporation under which Genovo was committed
to perform, at its own cost, up to $29 million per year of research and
development activities. Under the terms of this agreement, should Targeted
Genetics achieve specified regulatory milestones, Genzyme would be required to
make milestone payments and pay royalties to Targeted Genetics on sales of any
products developed under the agreement. In November 2000, Targeted Genetics
amended the development agreement to expand the collaboration technological
scope and financial terms and establish a development plan for the second year
of the three-year collaborative effort. This agreement is effective from August
1999 to August 2002, with an option to extend the term if both parties agree.
Targeted Genetics also assumed a separate agreement that granted Genzyme an
option to purchase up to $114 million of Genovo equity, of which $34 million
had been purchased as of the Genovo acquisition date. After the November 2000
amendment to the development agreement, Genzyme exercised its option to
purchase 311,295 shares of Targeted Genetics' common stock, at a purchase price
of $128495 per share, providing $40 million of proceeds to Targeted Genetics.
International AIDS Vaccine Initiative Agreement
In February 2000, Targeted Genetics entered into a collaboration to develop
a vaccine to prevent AIDS with the International AIDS Vaccine Initiative IAVI
and Children Research Institute on the campus of Children Hospital in
Columbus, Ohio. Under the terms of the collaboration, IAVI will fund
development, preclinical and Phase I studies. IAVI expects to invest up to $6
million in research funding during the first three years of the agreement,
provided that specified milestones are achieved.
Under the terms of the IAVI agreement, Targeted Genetics has rights to
manufacture any vaccine developed under the collaboration and will retain
worldwide exclusive commercialization rights to any product that may stem from
the collaboration. If Targeted Genetics declines to produce the vaccine for
developing countries in reasonable quantity at a reasonable price, as
determined in accordance with a variety of factors specified in the agreement,
IAVI will have rights to obtain licenses from Targeted Genetics that will allow
IAVI to contract with other manufacturers to make the vaccine available at a
reasonable price in those countries. In any event, however, Targeted Genetics
will have exclusive rights to commercialize in industrialized countries any
successful vaccine developed under the collaboration.
10. Alkermes License
In June 1999, Targeted Genetics entered into an agreement with Alkermes,
Inc. to acquire the exclusive rights to sublicense a patent and other pending
patent applications for manufacturing AAV vectors. The license to this
technology, first developed by Children Hospital in Columbus, Ohio, covers
the use of cell lines for the manufacture of AAV vectors and expands a
previously acquired limited field license to these rights. Targeted Genetics
issued to Alkermes 500,000 shares of its common stock and warrants to purchase
a total of up to 20 million additional shares in exchange for this technology
license. Under the terms of the license, Targeted Genetics must attempt to
commercialize the technology. Additionally, Targeted Genetics is obligated to
make milestone payments if any product candidates using this technology reach
clinical trial and regulatory milestones and to pay royalties upon the sale of
any AAV products using the licensed technology or the sublicensing of the
Alkermes technology.
Targeted Genetics recorded a $32 million noncash charge with respect to the
Alkermes license in its 1999 operating results, because the underlying
technology is not complete and Targeted Genetics will have to invest
54             TARGETED GENETICS CORPORATION
NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS--Continued
significant resources to develop and prove its commercial feasibility. This
charge was computed based on the value of the warrants and shares of common
stock issued to Alkermes. Targeted Genetics computed the value of the warrants
issued to Alkermes using the Black-Scholes valuation method.
11. Lease Commitments
Targeted Genetics leases its research and office facilities in Seattle,
Washington under two noncancellable operating leases that expire on March 31,
2004 and leases its manufacturing facilities in Bothell, Washington under a
noncancellable operating lease that expires on October 1, 2015. The research
and office facility leases may be extended under two additional five-year
renewal options at the then-prevailing fair market value rental rate. The
manufacturing facility lease may be extended for an additional five-year
period. Targeted Genetics also leases research and office facilities in Sharon
Hill, Pennsylvania, under a noncancellable operating lease that expires in
November 30, 2005. This lease may be extended for two additional five-year
periods and has an early termination option allowing for termination of the
lease on November 30, 2001, with advance notice.
Future minimum payments under noncancelable leases at December 31, 2000 were
as follows                            Operating   Capital
Year Ending December 31:
$ 2,168,081 $  901,264

Rent expense under operating leases for the years ended December 31, 2000,
1999 and 1998 was $11 million, $587,000 and $533,000, respectively.
12. Employee Retirement Plan
Targeted Genetics sponsors an employee retirement plan under Section 401k
of the Internal Revenue Code. All employees of Targeted Genetics and its
subsidiaries who are 21 years old or older are eligible to participate in the
plan. Contributions made into the 401k plan by Targeted Genetics are made at
the discretion of the board of directors. Targeted Genetics incurred $144,000 90,000 and $0 of expense in 2000, 1999 and 1998, respectively, related to
contributions to the plan.
13. Income Taxes
At December 31, 2000, Targeted Genetics had net operating loss carryforwards
of $807 million and research and experimental credit carryforwards of $31
million. The carryforwards, which are available to offset future federal income
taxes, begin to expire in 2008. Targeted Genetics has provided a valuation
allowance to offset the excess of deferred tax assets over the deferred tax
liabilities, due to the uncertainty of realizing the benefits of the net
deferred tax asset. The valuation allowance increased by $108 million in 2000
and $39 million in 1999.
55             TARGETED GENETICS CORPORATION
NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS--Continued  Significant components of Targeted Genetics' deferred tax assets and
liabilities were as follows                                December 31,
2000    1999
Deferred tax assets:
Net operating loss  $27,453,000 $23,828,000
Deferred   5,548,000  1,815,000
Research and experimental credit carryforwards.  3,094,000            954,000   842,000
384,000   185,000
Total deferred tax  $37,433,000 $26,670,000
Valuation allowance for deferred tax assets. $37,433,000 $26,670,000
Utilization of federal income tax carryforwards is subject to limitation
under Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code. Targeted Genetics' past sales
and issuances of common stock have resulted in ownership changes, as defined
under Section 382, that may result in limitations on the future use of some
portion of the net operating loss carryforwards.
14. Joint Venture
When Targeted Genetics and Elan formed the Emerald joint venture in July
1999, Elan purchased $120 million of Targeted Genetics' Series B convertible
exchangeable preferred stock. The preferred stock is convertible, at Elan
option, into Targeted Genetics common stock or into shares representing a 301%
interest in Emerald, which would increase Elan ownership in Emerald to 50%.
Targeted Genetics used the proceeds of the convertible exchangeable preferred
stock sale to purchase its 801% interest in Emerald. Emerald used these
proceeds to pay $150 million to Elan for a license giving Emerald exclusive
rights to use Elan drug delivery technologies within the gene delivery field.
At its formation, Emerald issued preferred and common stock valued at $150
million to Targeted Genetics and Elan. Targeted Genetics currently owns an
801% interest in Emerald in common stock, and Elan owns a 199% nonvoting
interest, in preferred shares. Although Targeted Genetics owns 100% of the
voting common shares, Elan and its subsidiaries have retained significant
minority investor rights that are considered participating rights under the
FASB Emerging Issues Task Force Bulletin 96-16, Investors' Accounting for an
Investee When the Investor Has a Majority of the Voting Interest but the
Minority Shareholder Has Certain Approval or Veto Rights. Because Elan
participating rights prevent Targeted Genetics from exercising control over
Emerald, Targeted Genetics does not consolidate the financial statements of
Emerald but instead accounts for its investment in Emerald under the equity
method of accounting.
The condensed financial statements of Emerald as of December 31, 2000 and
1999 and for the year ended December 31, 2000 and the period from July 21, 1999

performed by Targeted Genetics for Emerald. The balance sheets also include
accounts payable to Emerald of $262,000 for 2000 and $595,000 for 1999, for
Targeted Genetics' 801% share of Emerald funding requirements as of each
date. Targeted Genetics expects to advance Emerald its share of the required
funding and collect the $177,000 Emerald account receivable for 2000 during the
first quarter of 2001. Targeted Genetics is required to provide additional
funding to Emerald as needed in relation to its ownership interest in Emerald.
Targeted Genetics provided $28 million of funding to Emerald in 2000 and no
funding to Emerald in 1999.
