The Board of Directors and Stockholders
LeCroy Corporation We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of LeCroy
Corporation and subsidiaries as of June 30, 2006 and 2005, and the related
consolidated statements of operations, stockholders' equity, comprehensive
income and cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended June
30, 2006. In connection with our audits of the consolidated financial
statements, we also have audited the valuation and qualifying accounts financial
statement schedule. These consolidated financial statements and the financial
statement schedule are the responsibility of the Company management. Our
responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated financial
statements and financial statement schedule based on our audits.
We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company
Accounting Oversight Board United States. Those standards require that we plan
and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial
statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a
test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial
statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and
significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall
financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a
reasonable basis for our opinion.
In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present
fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of LeCroy Corporation
and subsidiaries as of June 30, 2006 and 2005, and the results of their
operations and their cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period
ended June 30, 2006, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting
principles. Also, in our opinion, the related financial statement schedule, when
considered in relation to the basic consolidated financial statements taken as a
whole, presents fairly, in all material respects, the information set forth
therein.
We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company
Accounting Oversight Board United States, the effectiveness of LeCroy
Corporation and subsidiaries' internal control over financial reporting as of
June 30, 2006, based on criteria established in Internal Control--Integrated
Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway
Commission COSO, and our report dated September 13, 2006 expressed an
unqualified opinion on management assessment of, and the effective operation
of, internal control over financial reporting. s/ KPMG LLP

1. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
ORGANIZATION
LeCroy Corporation the Company or LeCroy, was founded and
incorporated in the State of New York in 1964 and reincorporated in the State of
Delaware in 1995. The Company develops, manufactures, sells and licenses
high-performance oscilloscopes and global communications protocol analyzers.
Oscilloscopes are tools used by designers and engineers to measure and analyze
complex electronic signals in order to develop high-performance systems, to
validate electronic designs and to improve time to market. Protocol analyzers
are tools used by designers and engineers to generate and monitor traffic over
high speed serial data interfaces, including USB20, Bluetooth, PCI Express,
Serial ATA, Serial Attached SCSI SAS, Wireless USB, and others. The Company
products are sold into a broad range of end markets, including
electronics, data storage,
automotive/industrial, and military/aerospace. Revenues are also generated from
the sale of probes, accessories, and applications solutions, and to a lesser
extent, extended warranty and maintenance contracts, repairs and calibrations
performed on instruments after the expiration of their warranties.
BASIS OF PRESENTATION AND USE OF ESTIMATES
The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of LeCroy and
its wholly-owned subsidiaries. Intercompany balances and transactions have been
eliminated in consolidation. Certain reclassifications have been made to
prior-years' amounts to conform to the current-year presentation.
The Company consolidated financial statements have been prepared in
accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of
America, which require management to make estimates and assumptions. These
estimates and assumptions affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities
and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the
consolidated financial statements and the revenues and expenses reported during
the period. The most significant of these estimates and assumptions relate to
revenue recognition, reserve for accounts receivable, allowance for excess and
obsolete inventory, valuation of long-lived and intangible assets, goodwill and
deferred tax assets, and share-based compensation expense and warranty. These
estimates and assumptions are based on management judgment and available
information and, consequently, actual results could differ from these estimates.
FISCAL YEAR ENDING DATES
The Company fiscal year ends on the Saturday closest to June 30 July 1,
2006, July 2, 2005 and June 26, 2004. Fiscal years 2006 and 2004 represented
52-week periods and fiscal year 2005 represented a 53-week period. For clarity
of presentation, the consolidated financial statement year-end references are
stated as June 30.
REVENUE
LeCroy recognizes product and service revenue, net of allowances for
anticipated returns, provided that 1 persuasive evidence of an arrangement
exists, 2 delivery has occurred, 3 the selling price is fixed or
determinable and 4 collection is reasonably assured. Delivery is considered to
have occurred when title and risk of loss have transferred to the customer, or
when services have been provided. The price is considered fixed or determinable
when it is not subject to refund or adjustments.
The Company maintains an allowance for doubtful accounts relating to
accounts receivable estimated to be non-collectible. The Company analyzes
historical bad debts, customer concentrations, customer creditworthiness,
current economic trends and changes in customer payment terms when evaluating
the adequacy of the allowance for doubtful accounts. In addition, the Company
maintains an allowance for anticipated sales returns. The Company analyzes
historical return trends as well as in-transit product returns to evaluate the
adequacy of the allowance for anticipated returns.                    56   Test and measurement products revenue. The Company generates Test and
measurement product revenue from the sales of oscilloscopes and application
solutions, protocol analyzers, probes and accessories. Provisions for warranty
costs are recorded at the time products are shipped. Application solutions,
which provide oscilloscopes with additional analysis capabilities, are either
delivered via compact disc or are already loaded in the oscilloscopes and
activated via a key code after the sale is made to the customer. No
post-contract support is provided on the application solutions. All sales of
test and measurement products are based upon separately established prices for
the items and are recorded as revenue according to the above revenue recognition
criteria. Revenues from these products are included in revenues from Test and
measurement products in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. Certain
software is embedded in the Company oscilloscopes, but the embedded software
component is considered incidental.
In the first quarter of fiscal 2006, in an effort to provide end-user
customers an alternative to purchasing the Company higher end products under
its standard terms and conditions, the Company began offering customers an
opportunity to enter into sales-type or direct financing leases for these
products. The Company is accounting for these leases in accordance with
Statement of Financial Accounting Standards SFAS No. 13, Accounting for
Leases. Lease and rental revenues are reported within Test and measurement
product revenue.
Due to the significant software content of its protocol analyzer products,
the Company recognizes revenue on the sale of these products, in accordance with
American Institute of Certified Public Accountants Statement of Position 97-2,
Software Revenue Recognition SOP 97-2, as amended by Statement of Position
98-9, Modifications of SOP 97-2 with Respect to Certain Transactions SOP
98-9, upon shipment, provided there is persuasive evidence of an arrangement,
the product has been delivered, the price is fixed or determinable and
collectibility is probable. Software maintenance support revenue is deferred
based on its vendor specific objective evidence of fair value VSOE and
recognized ratably over the maintenance support periods. Provisions for warranty
costs are recorded at the time of product revenue recognition. Revenues from
protocol analyzer products are included in Test and measurement products in the
Consolidated Statements of Operations.
Software license revenue. The Company recognizes software license revenue
in accordance with SOP 97-2 as amended by SOP 98-9. Revenues from perpetual
software license agreements are recognized upon delivery of the software if
evidence of an arrangement exists, pricing is fixed and determinable, and
collectibility is probable. If an acceptance period is required, revenues are
recognized upon the earlier of customer acceptance or the expiration of the
acceptance period. The Company allocates revenue on software arrangements
involving multiple elements to each element based on the relative fair values of
the elements. The determination of fair value of each element in multiple
element arrangements is based on VSOE. The Company analyzes all of the elements
and determines if there is sufficient VSOE to allocate revenue to maintenance
included in multiple element arrangements. Accordingly, assuming all other
revenue recognition criteria are met, revenue is recognized upon delivery using
the residual method in accordance with SOP 98-9, where the VSOE of the
undelivered elements is deferred and the remaining portion of the arrangement
fee is recognized as license revenue. The revenue allocated to software
maintenance is recognized ratably over the term of the support agreement. The
revenue allocated to licenses is recognized upon delivery of the licenses.
Revenues from perpetual software license agreements are included in Service and
other in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. There was no revenue from
perpetual software license agreements for the years ended June 30, 2006, 2005
and 2004.
Service and other revenue. Service and other revenue includes extended
warranty contracts, software maintenance agreements and repairs and calibrations
performed on instruments after the expiration of their normal warranty period.
The Company defers revenue for extended warranty contracts, software maintenance
agreements and calibration services and then recognizes such revenue on a
straight-line basis over the related service period. When arrangements include
multiple elements, the Company uses relative fair values in accordance with
Emerging Issues Task Force EITF Issue No. 00-21, Revenue Arrangements with
Multiple Deliverables, to allocate revenue to the elements and recognizes
revenue when the criteria for revenue recognition have been met for each
element.
57   Deferred product revenue. During the third quarter of fiscal 2004, the
Company began shipping the WaveSurfer oscilloscope product line. One component
of the Company strategy for distributing this product line was the use of a
buy-sell distribution channel. This was the Company initial entry into this
distribution channel and, because of the associated uncertainty about
sell-through volumes, the Company was unable to sufficiently estimate the
amounts of potential product returns. In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2005,
having had four full quarters of experience with this product and channel with
no significant returns, the Company had sufficient data to estimate potential
returns and, in accordance with SFAS No. 48, Revenue Recognition When Right of
Return Exists SFAS 48, recognized previously deferred revenue of $26
million. Revenue related to WaveSurfers sold to distributors, beginning with the
fourth quarter of fiscal 2005, is recognized upon shipment to the distributor,
rather than upon the sale of the unit by the distributor to the end user, and a
provision for expected returns is recognized.
Deferred license revenue. Revenue from license fees under agreements that
have exclusivity clauses and, from the licensee perspective, have ongoing
requirements or expectations that are more than perfunctory, are recognized on a
straight-line basis over the terms of the related agreements. An ongoing
requirement or expectation would be considered more than perfunctory if any
party to the contract considers it to be essential to the functionality of the
delivered product or service or failure to complete the activities would result
in the customer receiving a full or partial refund or rejecting the products
delivered or services performed to date.
Beginning in fiscal 2001 with the adoption of the SEC Staff Accounting
Bulletin, SAB No. 101 SAB 101, Revenue Recognition in Financial
Statements, superseded by SAB 104, certain previously recognized license fee
revenue was deferred and recognized in future periods over the terms of the
agreements. The adoption of SAB 101 was recorded as of the beginning of fiscal
2001 and resulted in a non-cash charge for the cumulative effect of an
accounting change of $44 million, net of a tax benefit of $27 million. The
deferred revenue is being amortized into revenue on a straight-line basis over
55 years, the remaining terms of the license agreements. The Company recognized
pretax license fee revenue of $07 million, $13 million and $13 million during
fiscal years 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. Such license fees were included
in Service and other revenue in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. As of
June 30, 2006, there is no remaining deferred license revenue from the adoption
of SAB 101.
SHARE - BASED COMPENSATION
In the first quarter of fiscal 2006, the Company adopted the provisions of
SFAS No. 123 revised 2004, Share-Based Payment SFAS 123R which requires
that the cost resulting from all share-based payment transactions be recognized
in the financial statements at their fair values. The Company adopted SFAS 123R
using the modified prospective application method under which the provisions of
SFAS 123R apply to new awards and to awards modified, repurchased, or cancelled
after the adoption date. Additionally, compensation cost for the portion of the
awards for which the requisite service has not been rendered that are
outstanding as of the adoption date is recognized in the Consolidated Statement
of Operations over the remaining service period after the adoption date based on
the award original estimate of fair value. The Company uses the Black-Scholes
option pricing model to estimate the fair value of options on the date of grant
which requires certain estimates by management including the expected volatility
and expected term of the option. Management also makes decisions regarding the
risk free interest rate used in the model and makes estimates regarding
forfeiture rates. Fluctuations in the market that affect these estimates could
have an impact on the resulting compensation cost. The fair value of the
compensation cost is recognized on a straight-line basis over the requisite
service period of the award.
Historically, through fiscal 2005, the Company accounted for stock-based
compensation under the recognition and measurement principles of Accounting
Principles Board Opinion APB No. 25, Accounting for Stock Issued to
Employees APB 25, and related interpretations. No compensation expense
related to stock options was reflected in the Company Consolidated Statements
of Operations, with the exception of the CATC Plans, as all options had an
exercise price equal to the market value of the underlying common stock on the
date of grant. Compensation cost for restricted stock non-vested stock was
recorded based on its market value on the date of grant and was expensed in the
Company Consolidated Statements of Operations ratably over the vesting period.
Upon the grant of restricted stock, deferred stock compensation was recorded as
an offset to additional paid-in capital and was amortized on a straight-line
basis as compensation expense over the vesting period. See Note 14 to the
Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.                    58  WARRANTY
The Company provides a warranty on its products, typically extending three
years after delivery and accounted for in accordance with SFAS No. 5,
Accounting for Contingencies SFAS 5. Estimated future warranty obligations
related to products are provided by charges to Cost of revenues in the period
that the related revenue is recognized. These estimates are derived from
historical data of product reliability and, for new products, published by a
third party expected failure rates. The expected failure rate is arrived at in
terms of units, which are then converted into labor hours to which an average
fully burdened cost per hour is applied to derive the amount of accrued warranty
required. On a quarterly basis, the Company studies trends of warranty claims
and performance of specific products and adjusts its warranty obligation through
charges or credits to Cost of revenues.
SHIPPING AND HANDLING COSTS
The Company records the costs and fees associated with transporting its
products to customers as a component of Selling, general and administrative
expense in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. These costs totaled $35
million, $31 million and $22 million for the fiscal years ended June 30, 2006,
2005 and 2004, respectively.
ADVERTISING COSTS
The costs of general advertising, promotion and marketing programs are
charged to Selling, general and administrative expense in the Consolidated
Statements of Operations in the fiscal year incurred. The costs of advertising
related to new product introductions are deferred until such advertising first
takes place, which generally coincides with product introduction. Advertising
expense for the fiscal years ended June 30, 2006, 2005 and 2004 was $26
million, $27 million and $23 million, respectively.
RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT
Research and development costs are expensed as incurred. The Company
evaluates the requirement to capitalize certain software development costs for
protocol analyzers in accordance with SFAS No. 86, Accounting for the Costs of
Computer Software to Be Sold, Leased, or Otherwise Marketed SFAS 86. Under
SFAS 86, costs incurred to develop or significantly enhance computer software
products are charged to research and development expense as incurred until
technological feasibility has been established. The nature of the Company
development for protocol analyzers is generally such that the Company can
measure technological feasibility most effectively using the working model
method where the time between establishment of a working model and general
availability is of short duration which results in very little or no costs that
qualify for capitalization. As such, the Company has not capitalized any
software development costs for the years ended June 30, 2006, 2005 or 2004.
CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS
Cash in excess of current operating requirements are invested in cash
equivalents, which are short-term, highly liquid interest bearing investments
with maturities of three months or less at the date of purchase and are stated
at cost, which approximates market value.
PROPERTY AND EQUIPMENT
Property and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation.
Replacements, maintenance and repairs which do not improve or extend the life of
the respective asset are expensed as incurred. Depreciation and amortization of
property and equipment is provided on a straight-line basis over the asset
estimated useful life or related lease term, if shorter, as follows  Building and      10-32 years
Furniture, machinery and equipment.     2-10 years
Computer software and hardware.      2-7 years                    59  INVENTORIES
Inventories, with the exception of demonstration units in finished goods,
are stated at the lower of cost first-in, first-out method or market.
Demonstration units are stated at lower of cost specific identification method
or market.
IMPAIRMENT OF LONG-LIVED ASSETS AND ACQUIRED INTANGIBLE ASSETS
The Company monitors events and changes in circumstances that could
indicate carrying amounts of long-lived assets, including amortizable intangible
assets, may not be recoverable. When such events or changes in circumstances
occur, the Company assesses the recoverability of long-lived assets by
determining whether the carrying value of such assets will be recovered through
undiscounted expected future cash flows. If the undiscounted cash flows are less
than the carrying amount, an impairment loss is recorded to the extent that the
carrying amount exceeds the fair value. During 2005, an intangible asset that
provided for manufacturing rights to, and the use of, certain intellectual
property failed the impairment test due to a change in product strategy and,
accordingly, a $15 million pre-tax loss was recognized in Cost of revenues in
the fiscal 2005 Consolidated Statement of Operations. There were no other
impairment indicators for other long-lived assets during the fiscal years ended
June 30, 2006, 2005 or 2004.
GOODWILL
Goodwill is recognized for the excess of the purchase price over the fair
value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a purchase business
combination. The Company tests goodwill for impairment annually under a two-step
approach, or more frequently, if events or changes in circumstances indicate
that the asset might be impaired. Impairment is assessed at the reporting unit
level by applying a fair value-based test using the Company market
capitalization. The Company has one reporting unit for the purposes of
impairment testing.
The Company completed the annual impairment test during the fourth quarter
of fiscal 2006 and determined that there was no impairment to its recorded
goodwill balance of $785 million at June 30, 2006. There were no impairment
indicators during fiscal years 2006, 2005 or 2004.
CONCENTRATION OF CREDIT RISK
The Company develops, manufactures, sells and licenses high-performance
oscilloscopes and global communication protocol test solutions. The Company
products are sold into a broad range of end markets, including the computer and
semiconductor, consumer electronics, data storage devices, automotive and
industrial, and military and aerospace markets. Sales occur in all regions of
the United States as well as a multitude of foreign countries. No customer
accounted for more than 10% of the Company consolidated revenues in any of the
last three fiscal years. There is no significant concentration of the Company
accounts receivable portfolio in any customer or geographical region that
presents a risk to the Company based on that concentration. Credit losses have
been minimal in fiscal 2006, 2005 and 2004.
INCOME TAXES
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized under the asset and
liability method based upon the difference between the amounts reported for
financial reporting and tax purposes. These deferred taxes are measured by
applying current enacted tax rates. The effect on deferred tax assets and
liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in operations in the period
that includes the enactment date. A valuation allowance is provided when it is
more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will
not be realized. The ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent
upon the generation of future taxable income during the period in which related
temporary differences become deductible. Management considers the scheduled
reversal of deferred tax liabilities, projected future taxable income and tax
planning strategies in making this assessment. The Company policy is not to
provide for U.S. taxes on undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries to the
extent such earnings are determined to be permanently invested outside the
United States.                    60  FOREIGN EXCHANGE
The Company foreign subsidiaries use their local currency as the
functional currency and translate all assets and liabilities at fiscal year-end
exchange rates and all income and expenses at average fiscal year exchange rates
with translation adjustments recorded in Accumulated other comprehensive income,
a separate component of stockholders' equity in the Consolidated Balance Sheets.
Transaction gains and losses that arise from exchange rate fluctuations on
transactions denominated in a currency other than the functional currency are
included in Other, net in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. Foreign
currency transaction gains and losses, related to short-term intercompany loans,
are recorded in the Consolidated Statements of Operations as incurred.
Intercompany loans that are of a long-term-investment nature are accounted for
in accordance with SFAS 52, Foreign Currency Translation, whereby foreign
currency transaction gains and losses are recorded in accumulated other
comprehensive income, a component of stockholders' equity.
FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS
Cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, accounts payable, accrued
expenses and other current liabilities reported in the Consolidated Balance
Sheets equal or approximate their fair value due to their short term to
maturity. The Term Loan, totaling $341 million at June 30, 2006, is included
within Current portion of long-term debt and capital leases and Long term debt.
Borrowings under the revolving line of credit totaling $35 million at June 30,
2006 are included in Short-term borrowings. Borrowings under the Term Loan and
revolving line of credit have variable rates and the carrying amounts are
considered by management to be a reasonable estimate of their fair value. See
below for the fair value of derivative instruments.
DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS
The Company accounts for derivatives and hedging activities in accordance
with SFAS No. 133, Accounting for Derivative Investments and Hedging
Activities, as amended SFAS 133, which requires that all derivative
instruments be recorded on the balance sheet at their respective fair values.
The accounting for changes in the fair value i.e., gains or losses of a
derivative instrument is dependent upon whether the derivative has been
designated and qualifies as part of a hedging relationship and further, on the
type of hedging relationship. The Company foreign exchange forward contracts
and interest rate swap agreements are not accounted for as hedges in accordance
with SFAS 133; therefore, any changes in fair value of these contracts are
recorded in Other expense income, net in the Consolidated Statements of
Operations. These derivatives are also recorded on the Consolidated Balance
Sheets at fair value.
The Company does not use derivative financial instruments for trading or
other speculative purposes and does not enter into fair value hedges.
The Company enters into foreign exchange forward contracts to minimize the
risks associated with foreign currency fluctuations on assets or liabilities
denominated in other than the functional currency of the Company or its
subsidiaries. The Company also entered into an interest rate swap transaction
with the Manufacturers & Traders Trust Co. M Bank effective January 31,
2005 and continuing through January 31, 2008, corresponding with the repayment
terms of the $500 million Term Loan portion of the senior, secured, five-year
credit agreement entered into with the lenders listed therein and The Bank of
New York, as administrative agent for such lenders on October 29, 2004 the
Credit Agreement. These foreign exchange forward contracts and interest rate
swap agreements are not accounted for as hedges in accordance with SFAS 133;
therefore, any changes in fair value of these contracts are recorded in Other
expense income, net in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. These
derivatives are also recorded on the Consolidated Balance Sheets in Other assets
or liabilities at fair value. The fair value of the foreign exchange forward
contracts is a liability of approximately $02 million at June 30, 2006 as
compared to an asset of approximately $01 million at June 30, 2005.
The changes in fair value of the foreign exchange contracts are highly
inversely correlated to changes in the value of certain of the Company foreign
currency-denominated assets and liabilities. At June 30, 2006 and 2005, the
notional amounts of the Company open foreign exchange forward contracts, all
with maturities of less than six months, were approximately $146 million and
$106 million, respectively.
61   The notional amount of the interest rate swap as of June 30, 2006 and 2005
was approximately $191 million and $231 million, respectively. The fair value
of the interest rate swap as of June 30, 2006 and 2005, was $04 million and
$66,000, respectively, is recorded in Other assets on the Consolidated Balance
Sheets and approximates the amount that the Company would have received from M
Bank if the Company had canceled the transaction at that date.
COMPREHENSIVE INCOME
Comprehensive income comprises net income, foreign currency translation
adjustments and unrealized gains and losses on marketable securities classified
as available-for-sale, net of reclassification adjustments for realized gain and
losses on marketable securities included in net income.
NEW ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS
In May 2005, the Financial Accounting Standards Board FASB issued SFAS
No. 154, Accounting Changes and Error Corrections, SFAS 154 which will be
effective for the Company for reporting changes in accounting principles and for
correction of errors beginning in fiscal year 2007. SFAS 154 requires a change
in accounting principle to be applied retrospectively application to prior
periods' financial statements, unless explicit transition provisions are
provided for in new accounting pronouncements or existing pronouncements that
are in the transition phase when SFAS 154 becomes effective. There will be no
immediate effect from our adoption of SFAS 154.
In June 2005, the FASB issued FASB Staff Position FSP 143-1,
Accounting for Electronic Equipment Waste Obligations. FSP 143-1 addresses the
accounting related to obligations associated with Directive 2002/96/ EC on Waste
Electrical and Electronic Equipment the Directive adopted by the European
Union. Under the Directive, the waste management obligation for historical
equipment products put on the market on or prior to August 13, 2005 remains
with the commercial user until the equipment is replaced. FSP 143-1 is effective
the later of the end of the first quarter of fiscal year 2006 or the date of
adoption of the law by the applicable EU-member country. It is expected that the
law will be adopted by certain EU countries in calendar year 2006 and that the
Company will be required to adopt the provisions of FSP-143-1 at that time. The
effects will depend on the respective laws adopted by the EU member countries.
On February 3, 2006, the FASB issued FSP 123R-4, Classification of
Options and Similar Instruments as Employee Compensation That Allow for Cash
Settlement upon the Occurrence of a Contingent Event. This amends paragraphs 32
and A229 of SFAS 123R , which required that share options with contingent cash
settlement features be classified as liabilities regardless of the event
likelihood of occurrence. FSP 123R-4 requires companies with cash-settleable
provisions in their employee share-option awards to assess the probability of
the contingent event occurrence when determining the classification of the
awards as liability or equity. If the event likelihood of occurrence is less
than probable and the award would otherwise be classified as equity, under FSP
123R-4, it would be equity classified. The Company would be required to make
an ongoing assessment of the probability of the contingent event occurring and
reclassify the award as a liability should the event become probable. The
Company was required to adopt the provisions of this FSP as of the beginning of
the fourth quarter of fiscal 2006, the first reporting period after the FSP was
posted to the FASB website. The adoption of FSP 123R-4 had no impact on the
Company results of operations or financial condition as it has not issued any
share options with contingent cash settlement features.
On February 16, 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 155, Accounting for Certain
Hybrid Instruments, an amendment of FASB Statements No. 133 and 140 SFAS
155. SFAS 155 allows financial instruments that have embedded derivatives to
be accounted for as a whole eliminating the need to separate the derivative
from its host if the holder elects to account for the whole instrument on a
fair value basis. It also clarifies which interest-only strips and
principal-only strips are not subject to the requirements of Statement 133;
establishes a requirement to evaluate interest in securitized financial assets
to identify interests that are freestanding derivatives or that are hybrid
financial instruments that contain an embedded derivative requiring separation;
clarifies that concentrations of credit risk in the form of subordination are
not embedded derivatives; and amends Statement 140 to eliminate the prohibition
on a qualifying special-purpose entity from holding a derivative financial
instrument that pertains to a beneficial interest other than another derivative
financial instrument. SFAS 155 is effective for all financial instruments
acquired or issued after the beginning of an entity first fiscal year that
begins after September 15, 2006. The adoption of SFAS 155 is not expected to
have any impact on the Company results of operations or financial condition as
it does not currently use hybrid instruments.
62   In July 2006, the FASB issued FASB Interpretation No. 48, Accounting for
Uncertainty in Income Taxes--An Interpretation of FASB Statement No. 109 FIN
48, which prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the
financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or
expected to be taken in a tax return. FIN 48 will be effective for fiscal years
beginning after December 15, 2006. Management is currently evaluating the effect
that adoption of this interpretation will have on the Company consolidated
financial position and results of operations. 2. CATC ACQUISITION
On October 29, 2004, the Company completed its acquisition of 100% of the
outstanding common stock of Computer Access Technology Corporation CATC via
the merger of a newly-formed, wholly-owned subsidiary of LeCroy with and into
CATC, with CATC surviving as a wholly-owned subsidiary of LeCroy the Merger.
CATC is a provider of advanced verification systems for existing and emerging
digital communications standards. CATC products are used by semiconductor,
device, system and software companies at each phase of their products'
lifecycles from development through production and market deployment. CATC had
approximately 70 employees at the time of the Merger. Through its acquisition of
CATC, LeCroy expects to capitalize on the increasing demand for serial data test
instruments, leverage its global, technical, direct sales force to accelerate
the growth of CATC products, strengthen its position in the data storage
market, increase penetration into the computer market, expand gross profit,
increase operating leverage leading to expanded operating profit and increase
cash generation capabilities.
Total consideration paid to acquire CATC was $1300 million. The Merger was
recorded under the purchase method of accounting, in accordance with Statement
of Financial Accounting Standards SFAS No. 141, Business Combinations,
which requires that the total consideration be allocated to the assets acquired
and liabilities assumed based on their fair values. On the effective date of the
Merger, each share of CATC common stock issued and outstanding immediately prior
thereto was canceled and converted into the right to receive $600 in cash. In
addition, LeCroy paid cash to the holders of CATC outstanding, vested,
in-the-money stock options and employee stock purchase plan the CATC ESPP
purchase rights. Further, LeCroy assumed CATC outstanding unvested stock
options, as well as certain vested but unexercised stock options, by granting to
CATC employees a total of 648,284 options to purchase LeCroy common stock the
LeCroy Options. The LeCroy Options were recorded at their fair values using
the Black-Scholes option pricing model based on a stock price of $1683 per
share, which was the closing price of LeCroy common stock on October 29, 2004,
less the intrinsic value of unvested options, which was to be charged as
compensation expense to operations as earned by employees over their remaining
vesting periods. See Note 14 - Share-Based Compensation for further discussion
of the accounting for these options following the Company adoption of SFAS No.
123R. LeCroy paid cash of $804 million, net of cash acquired, using $304
million of cash on hand and borrowings of $500 million under the Company
$750 million senior, secured, five-year credit agreement entered into on
October 29, 2004, with the lenders listed therein and The Bank of New York, as
administrative agent for such lenders. See Note 13 - Long-term Debt and Capital
Leases. The Merger consideration is summarized below in thousands Cash for  $  120,242

Intrinsic value of unearned stock compensation
on unvested options    1,945
Transaction     2,622
Total purchase  $  129,995
The fair value of tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities
assumed was established based upon the unaudited October 28, 2004 Consolidated                    63 Balance Sheet of CATC, as well as certain assumptions made regarding fair
values. The fair value of finished goods and work in process inventory was
valued based on estimated selling prices less direct costs to sell and a profit
margin on the selling effort. The fair value of the in-process research and
development IPR, purchased technology, trade name and purchase orders was
determined by an independent appraisal firm. The fair value of the IPR was
based on the total estimated costs to develop the related technologies less the
costs incurred to date for the projects, and the intangible asset values were
based on estimates of future cash flows associated with those assets. The
purchased technology, trade name and purchase orders related to this acquisition
are being amortized over their estimated economic useful lives ranging from two
to twenty-nine months. The excess of the purchase price over the fair value of
the net assets acquired has been allocated to goodwill. The principle factors
that contributed to a purchase price that resulted in the recognition of
goodwill was the fair value of the going-concern element of the CATC business,
which includes the assembled workforce and their technology position within
emerging communication standards, as well as the expected synergies that will be
achieved by combining both companies. The goodwill is not deductible for tax
purposes. During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2006, the Company reduced its CATC
goodwill by approximately $04 million, a result of a reversal of a
pre-acquisition tax contingency reserve. In fiscal 2005, the Company reduced its
CATC goodwill by approximately $29 million, a result of a reversal of a
valuation allowance against the CATC deferred tax assets and a reversal of a
pre-acquisition contingency reserve. The final purchase price allocation is

3. RESTRUCTURING AND ASSET IMPAIRMENT
In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2006, the Company realigned some of its
business processes and as a result, incurred severance and related expenses of
approximately $04 million of which approximately $01 million was charged to
Cost of revenues, $02 million was expensed to Selling, general and
administrative and $01 million was expensed to Research and development. The
implementation of this plan resulted in headcount reductions of sixteen
employees or 35% of the workforce as compared to June 30, 2005. As of June 30,
2006, approximately $02 million has been paid in cash and $02 million remains
in Accrued expenses and other current liabilities on the Consolidated Balance
Sheet. Severance and other related amounts under this plan will be paid by the
end of the third quarter of fiscal 2007.
During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2005, the Company realigned some of its
business processes and, as a result, incurred expenses of approximately $10
million, consisting of $07 million of severance and related expenses and $03
million of facility closure expenses which included lease termination costs and
asset write-downs. Of these costs, $01 million was recorded in Cost of
revenues, $08 million was recorded in Selling, general and administrative and
$01 million was recorded in Research and development. As of June 30, 2006,
approximately $07 million of severance has been paid and $03 million of
facility charges have been paid in cash or written off and approximately $19,000
remains in Accrued expenses and other current liabilities on the Consolidated
Balance Sheet. The remaining balance is expected to be paid by the end of fiscal
2007.
Finally, during the second quarter of fiscal 2005, as a result of the
Merger, the Company adopted a plan to restructure its organization and refine
its product strategy. In connection with the adoption of this plan, the Company
recorded a charge for severance and related expenses in fiscal 2005 of
approximately $06 million in Selling, general and administrative expense. The
implementation of this plan resulted in headcount reductions of six employees or
approximately 2% of the workforce as compared to June 30, 2004. As of June 30,
2006, approximately $554,000 of severance has been paid and approximately
$46,000 remains in Accrued Expenses and other current liabilities on the
Consolidated Balance Sheet. Severance and other related amounts under this plan
are expected to be paid by the end of the second quarter of fiscal 2007.
Additionally, in the second quarter of fiscal 2005, as a result of a change in
the Company organization stemming from the Merger and a subsequent change in
the Company low to mid-range oscilloscope manufacturing strategy, the Company
took a $15 million non-cash charge to Cost of revenues for the impairment of a
related intangible asset.
The below table summarizes the restructuring charges for the fiscal years
ended June 30, 2006 and 2005 no similar charges were recorded in fiscal 2004

65 4. DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS
In August 2000, the Company closed the sale of the assets and business of
its Vigilant Networks, Inc. subsidiary Vigilant and a portion of the assets
and business of its Digitech Industries, Inc. subsidiary Digitech for gross
proceeds of $120 million. The remaining business of Digitech was classified as
discontinued operations. The buyer also assumed certain liabilities of Vigilant.
In fiscal 2004, the Company recorded $01 million of gain on sales of
discontinued operations in the Consolidated Statements of Operations, net of
income tax provisions, for the reversal of unused accrued discontinued
operations reserves. As of June 30, 2006, the Company has accrued discontinued
operations reserves of $02 million due to environmental matters at Digitech
previously leased facilities See Note 22- Commitments and Contingencies.
5. ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE, NET
In fiscal 2006, the Company had an agreement with one of its customers, who
is also a vendor, that provided the Company with the legal right to offset
outstanding accounts receivable balances against outstanding accounts payable
balances. At June 30, 2006, the Company netted $25,000 of accounts receivable
against accounts payable on the Consolidated Balance Sheet related to this
agreement. During fiscal 2005, the Company had agreements with two of its
customers, who were also vendors, that provided the Company with the legal right
to offset outstanding accounts receivable balances against outstanding accounts
payable balances. At June 30, 2005, the Company netted $23 million of accounts
receivable against accounts payable on the Consolidated Balance Sheet related to
these agreements.
The allowance for doubtful accounts and sales returns was approximately
$05 million and $04 million as of June 30, 2006 and June 30, 2005,
respectively.
6. INVENTORIES
Inventories consist of the following in thousands                          JUNE 30,

1 Approximately $56 million of inventory classified as raw materials as of
June 30, 2005 has been reclassified to finished goods to conform to the
current year presentation.
The value of demonstration units included in finished goods was $109
million and $108 million at June 30, 2006 and 2005, respectively. The Company
demonstration units are held for sale and are sold regularly in the ordinary
course of business through its normal sales distribution channels and existing
customer base. The allowance for excess and obsolete inventory, included above,
amounted to $16 million and $11 million at June 30, 2006 and 2005,
respectively.
In fiscal 2005, as a result of the Merger, the Company reviewed the
long-term product support policies in place at LeCroy and at CATC prior to the
Merger with an aim toward developing one policy to best serve customers. In
connection with the resultant change in policy, as well as changes in the
Company product support strategy, for the year ended June 30, 2005, the
Company recorded a $27 million charge to Cost of revenues in the Consolidated
Statements of Operations for the write-off of excess parts. In addition, in
fiscal 2005 the Company expensed approximately $18 million for the write-down
of inventory primarily related to a lower of cost or market adjustment due to
renegotiated pricing with a particular vendor.

The fiscal 2006 decrease in Goodwill of $04 million is attributable to the
release of a CATC pre-acquisition tax contingency reserve for rights which
expired in fiscal 2006. In fiscal 2005, the Company reduced its CATC goodwill by
approximately $29 million, a result of a reversal of a valuation allowance
against the CATC deferred tax assets and a reversal of a pre-acquisition
contingency reserve. See Note 2 - CATC Acquisition
The following table reflects the gross carrying amount and accumulated
amortization of the Company intangible assets included in Other non-current

67   During the year ended June 30, 2006, the Company completed a purchase and
settlement agreement with Iwatsu Electric Company, Ltd. Iwatsu that included
a non-compete agreement, whereby Iwatsu agreed not to engage in competition with
the Company for a period of ten years and the purchase of certain other
intellectual property rights see Note 21. The asset for the intellectual
property rights is being amortized over a period of seven years based on the
estimated useful life.
During the year ended June 30, 2005, the Company entered into capital lease
agreements for $10 million for the use of electronic design automation software
and a license for $02 million for the ability to use certain computer aided
design software tools. Additionally, the Company increased an existing license
by $01 million for the use of embedded memory macro technology. The assets for
the design software licenses are being amortized over a period of three years
based on the terms of the license agreements. The asset for the use of the
embedded memory technology has an amortization period of five years based on the
terms of the license agreement.
Amortization for assets under capital leases is included in total
depreciation and amortization expense. The net carrying value of assets under
capital leases at June 30, 2006, is $07 million.
As part of the Merger, LeCroy purchased technology, the CATC trade name and
purchase orders at their fair value of $32 million.
Also during the year ended June 30, 2005, as a result of a change in the
Company organization stemming from the Merger and a subsequent change in the
Company low to mid-range oscilloscope manufacturing strategy, the Company
recorded a $15 million non-cash charge for the write-off of an intangible
asset.
Amortization expense for those intangible assets with finite lives was $26
million, $31 million, and $14 million for fiscal 2006, 2005 and 2004,
respectively. The cost of an amortizable intangible asset is amortized on a
straight-line basis over the estimated economic life of the asset. As of June
30, 2006, certain technology rights totaling $50 million were fully amortized
due to contract expiration and were removed from the Consolidated Balance Sheet
in the first quarter of fiscal 2006. Management estimates intangible assets
amortization expense on a straight-line basis in fiscal 2007 through 2011 and
beyond will approximate $19 million, $10 million, $05 million, $01 million 01 million and $04 million, respectively.

The following table is a reconciliation of the changes in the Company
aggregate product warranty liability during the years ended June 30, 2006, 2005
and 2004 in thousands                                     JUNE 30,

Change in accrual       -    350     -
Balance at end of  $  1,005 $   971 $  1,247
68   In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2006, management determined that certain
amounts previously reported as warranty costs were services expense that had
been misclassified. This caused an overstatement of the related warranty
accruals in the table above. The warranty accrual and cost activity for all
years presented above has been revised to properly reflect only warranty
expense. These revisions had no impact on the Company beginning or ending
warranty liability balance, financial position or Cost of revenue for any of the
periods presented.
During the year ended June 30, 2005, the Company management revisited
labor and cost estimates utilized in its existing warranty model in light of the
Company fiscal 2005 product introductions, and determined that the actual
labor and cost estimates to repair the warranty units were lower than previously
estimated given the Company success in reducing the time and costs necessary
to fix the newer models currently under warranty. As a result of this evaluation
and conclusion the Company changed the labor and cost estimates used to
calculate the warranty accrual commencing with the period ended March 31, 2005.
This change in estimate was recorded in the quarter ended March 31, 2005, and
reduced the accrual required by approximately $350,000.
In connection with an agreement to license the Company MAUI Instrument
Operating System technology entered into by the Company during the third quarter
of fiscal 2003, the Company agreed to indemnify the licensee against losses
arising from any third party claim against the licensee to the extent such claim
arose directly out of the infringement of a U.S. or Japanese patent by any
LeCroy software components delivered under the license agreement. As of June 30,
2006, there have been no claims under such indemnification provisions.
As is customary in the test and measurement industry, and as provided for
by local law in the U.S. and other jurisdictions, the Company standard terms
of sale provide remedies to customers, such as defense, settlement or payment of
a judgment for intellectual property claims related to the use of the Company
products. Such indemnification provisions are accounted for in accordance with
SFAS No. 5. To date, there have been no claims under such indemnification
provisions.

At June 30, 2006 and 2005, $82 million and $90 million, respectively, of
the Company net deferred tax assets were included on the Consolidated Balance
Sheets in Other current assets, $40 million and $54 million, respectively,
were included in Other non-current assets, and $02 million and zero of foreign
deferred tax liabilities, respectively, were included in Accrued expenses and
other current liabilities.
The Company is required to recognize all or a portion of its deferred tax
assets if it believes that it is more likely than not, given the weight of all
available evidence, that all or a portion of its deferred tax assets will be
realized. Management assesses the realizability of the deferred tax assets at
each interim and annual balance sheet date based on actual and forecasted
operating results. The Company assessed both its positive and negative evidence
to determine the proper amount of its required valuation allowance. Factors
considered include the Company current utilization of net operating loss
carryforwards as well as management projection that the Company expects to
utilize the net operating loss carryforwards within one year, prior to the
initial expiration period in fiscal 2022.
As a result of profits realized in certain subsidiaries in Europe during
fiscal 2006, resulting in the utilization of foreign net operating losses, the
valuation allowance recorded in those subsidiaries were accordingly reduced by
$92,000. A valuation allowance totaling $258,000 as of June 30, 2006, continues
to be recorded for certain tax credits and foreign net operating loss
carryforwards due to the uncertainty surrounding the utilization of these
deferred tax assets. As such, management believes that it is more likely than
not that the Company will realize the benefits of the Company deductible                    70 differences, net of the valuation allowance. The valuation allowance against
deferred tax assets decreased in fiscal 2005 by $50 million principally due to
a change in estimate that resulted in a corresponding reduction of the gross
carrying values of the deferred tax assets related to certain tax credits and
amended return net operating loss carryforwards. Management will continue to
assess the realizability of the deferred tax assets at each interim and annual
balance sheet date based on actual and forecasted operating results.
On October 22, 2004, the American Jobs Creation Act the Act was signed
into law. The Act included a provision for the deduction of 85% of certain
foreign earnings that were repatriated, as defined in the Act. In fiscal 2005,
the Company elected to repatriate $231 million of qualifying earnings pursuant
to its approved domestic reinvestment plan. The income tax effect recognized
under the repatriation provision was approximately $11 million which was
substantially offset by the release of a tax reserve related to a favorable
foreign tax audit settlement during fiscal 2005.
Historically, it has been the practice of the Company to reinvest
unremitted earnings of foreign subsidiaries. During the fourth quarter of fiscal
2001, however, the Company determined that it would repatriate approximately
$70 million in future periods from its foreign subsidiaries. The Company
believes repatriation of these earnings will result in additional taxes in the
amount of $16 million and provided for that amount in the fiscal 2001 tax
provision. The cumulative amount of all other undistributed earnings of
consolidated foreign subsidiaries, for which U.S. federal income tax has not
been provided, was $55 million and $40 million at June 30, 2006 and 2005,
respectively. These earnings, which reflect full provision for non-U.S. income
taxes, are anticipated to be reinvested permanently outside the United States.
Determining the U.S. income tax liability that might result if these earnings
were remitted is not practicable.
At June 30, 2006, the Company has federal and state net operating loss
carryforwards of approximately $96 million and acquired net operating loss
carryforwards of $53 million available to offset future taxable income. The
carryforwards begin to expire at various dates starting in 2022 through 2025.
Foreign tax net operating loss carryforwards of approximately $03 million at
June 30, 2006 are available to offset future taxable income of certain foreign
subsidiaries. These foreign net operating loss carryforwards do not have an
expiration period. The Company has approximately $14 million of foreign tax
credits, $25 million of state tax credits, $12 million of acquired state tax
credits, $37 million of federal general business credits, and $09 million of
acquired federal general business credits. The foreign, state and federal tax
credits expire at various dates between fiscal 2007 and 2022.
13. LONG-TERM DEBT AND CAPITAL LEASES
On October 29, 2004, LeCroy entered into a $750 million senior, secured,
five-year credit agreement with the lenders listed therein and The Bank of New
York, as administrative agent for such lenders the Credit Agreement, which
replaced LeCroy prior $250 million revolving credit facility with The Bank of
New York. The terms of the Credit Agreement provide LeCroy with a $500 million
term loan the Term Loan and a $250 million revolving credit facility the
Revolver, which includes a $10 million swingline loan subfacility and a $10
million letter of credit subfacility. The performance by LeCroy of its
obligations under the Credit Agreement is secured by all of the assets of LeCroy
and its domestic subsidiaries, and is guaranteed by LeCroy domestic
subsidiaries. The proceeds under the Term Loan were used to finance the
acquisition of CATC and pay transaction expenses related to the Merger. Proceeds
from the Revolver may be used for general corporate purposes, including the
financing of working capital requirements, capital expenditures and
acquisitions. As of June 30, 2006, the Company had an outstanding loan balance
of $35 million against the Revolver and $341 million on the Term Loan. The
Company has not borrowed against the letter of credit sub-facility or swingline
loan subfacility.
On May 9, 2006, the Company amended the Credit Agreement Amendment No2
to, among other terms, a increase the Revolver Commitments from $250 million
to $50 million, b amend the financial covenants and reduce certain fees and
margins, c extend the Revolver termination date from October 29, 2009 to
October 29, 2010, d increase the aggregate amount the Company is permitted to
pay for acquisitions and e permit the Company to make certain payments for
cash dividends and repurchases of common stock.
Borrowings under the Credit Agreement, as amended, bear interest at
variable rates equal to, at the Company election, 1 the higher of a the
prime rate or b the federal funds rate plus 05%, plus an applicable margin of
between 000% and 150% based on the Company leverage ratio, as defined in the
Credit Agreement, or 2 the London Interbank Offering Rate LIBOR plus an
applicable margin of between 125% and 275% based on the Company leverage
ratio. In addition, the Company must pay commitment fees on unused Revolver
borrowings during the term of the Credit Agreement at rates between 0375% and
05% dependent upon its leverage ratio.
71   Under the Credit Agreement, the Company is required to comply with certain
financial covenants, measured quarterly, including a minimum interest coverage
ratio, minimum total net worth, maximum leverage ratio, minimum fixed charge
coverage ratio and limitations on capital expenditures. As of June 30, 2006, the
Company was in compliance with its financial covenants under the Credit
Agreement.
Beginning March 31, 2005, outstanding borrowings of $500 million under the
Term Loan were required to be repaid quarterly through October 2009, based on an
annualized amortization rate starting at 15% in calendar year 2005 and
increasing 250 basis points per year during the term of the Credit Agreement. As
of June 30, 2006, the Company has repaid $159 million of the principal balance
of this loan including voluntary repayments in excess of those required by the
Credit Agreement aggregating $41 million. The remaining outstanding balance to
be repaid annually is approximately $94 million, $106 million, $119 million
and $22 million for the years ended June 2007, 2008, 2009 and 2010,
respectively.
As of June 30, 2006, there was an outstanding balance of $35 million
against the Revolver included in Short-Term borrowings on the Consolidated
Balance Sheets which was repaid in July 2006.
The Company incurred approximately $14 million of transaction fees in
connection with entering into the Credit Agreement, which have been deferred and
are being amortized over the term of the Credit Agreement using the effective
interest method for the Term Loan and the straight-line method for the Revolver.
The Company incurred additional fees of approximately $02 million in connection
with entering into Amendment No. 2 which have been deferred and are being
amortized on a straight line basis over the term of Amendment No. 2 in
accordance with EITF 98-14. Amortization of the remaining balance of the
transaction fees under the Credit Agreement has been adjusted to coincide with
the one-year extension of the Revolver. At June 30, 2006, of the total
unamortized fees of $09 million under both agreements, $03 million were
included in Other current assets, and $06 million were included in Other
non-current assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.
As required by the terms of the Credit Agreement, the Company entered into
an interest rate swap transaction effective January 31, 2005 See Note 24 -
Derivative Instruments.
In addition to the above U.S.-based credit facilities, the Company
maintains certain short-term foreign credit facilities, principally with two
Japanese banks totaling 1500 million yen approximately $13 million as of June
30, 2006 and 2005. No amounts were outstanding under these facilities as of
June 30, 2006 and 2005. The Company Swiss subsidiary, LeCroy S.A., also has an
overdraft facility totaling 10 million Swiss francs approximately $08 million
as of June 30, 2006 and 2005. As of June 30, 2006 and 2005, 04 million Swiss
francs were held against supplier obligations leaving an available balance of
06 million Swiss francs under this credit facility. These obligations to
suppliers, such as rent and utilities, are payable under the credit facility
only in the event that the Company is unable to meet its financial obligations
to those suppliers.
The Company had a five-year $20 million capital lease line of credit to
fund certain capital expenditures that bore interest at an annual rate of 122%
on outstanding borrowings. This line of credit, originally set to expire in
November 2005, was renewed for one additional year. As of June 30, 2006 and
2005, the Company had $01 million outstanding under this line of credit, all of
which was current and included within Current portion of long-term debt and
capital leases on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.
During fiscal 2005, the Company entered into vendor supplied capital lease
agreements for technology rights of $13 million. These leases bear interest at
45% to 488% with three-year terms. At June 30, 2006, the Company outstanding
balance under these agreements was $06 million of which $05 million was
included within Current portion of long-term debt and capital leases and $01
million was included within Deferred revenue and other non-current liabilities
in the Consolidated Balance Sheet. Under these capital lease obligations, the
annual payments, including interest, for fiscal year 2007 and 2008 are $05
million and $01 million, respectively.                    72 14. SHARE-BASED COMPENSATION
Share-Based Compensation
Historically, through fiscal 2005, the Company accounted for stock-based
compensation under the recognition and measurement principles of Accounting
Principles Board Opinion APB No. 25, Accounting for Stock Issued to
Employees APB 25, and related interpretations. No compensation expense
related to stock option plans was reflected in the Company Consolidated
Statements of Operations, with the exception of the CATC Plans described below,
as all options had an exercise price equal to the market value of the underlying
common stock on the date of grant. Compensation cost for restricted stock
non-vested stock was recorded based on its market value on the date of grant
and was expensed in the Company Consolidated Statements of Operations ratably
over the vesting period. Upon the grant of restricted stock, deferred stock
compensation was recorded as an offset to additional paid-in capital and was
amortized on a straight-line basis as compensation expense over the vesting
period.
On July 3, 2005, the start of the first quarter of fiscal 2006, the Company
adopted the provisions of SFAS 123R, which requires that the costs resulting
from all share-based payment transactions be recognized in the financial
statements at their fair values. The Company adopted SFAS 123R using the
modified prospective application method under which the provisions of SFAS 123R
apply to new awards and to awards modified, repurchased, or cancelled after the
adoption date. Additionally, compensation cost for the portion of the awards for
which the requisite service has not been rendered that are outstanding as of the
adoption date is recognized in the Consolidated Statement of Operations over the
remaining service period after the adoption date based on the award original
estimate of fair value. In connection with the adoption of SFAS 123R, the
deferred stock compensation at June 30, 2005 of $86 million relating to
previous grants of restricted stock and stock options assumed in the Merger was
eliminated against additional paid-in capital during the first quarter of fiscal
2006. Results for prior periods have not been restated. Total share-based
compensation expense recorded in the Consolidated Statement of Operations for
the year ended June 30, 2006 is $53 million.
As a result of applying SFAS 123R during fiscal 2006, the Company income
before income taxes and net income for the year ended June 30, 2006 are $23
million and $13 million lower, respectively, than if it had continued to
account for share-based compensation under APB No. 25. Basic and diluted
earnings per share for the year ended June 30, 2006 are $011 and $010 per
share lower, respectively, than if the Company had continued to account for
share-based compensation under APB No. 25. Under APB No. 25, restricted stock
was historically being expensed although under APB No. 25, forfeitures were
accounted for as they occurred.
On November 10, 2005, the FASB issued FASB Staff Position 123R-3 FSP
123R-3, Transition Election Related to Accounting for the Tax Effects of
Share-based Payment Awards, that provides an elective alternative transition
method of calculating the pool of excess tax benefits available to absorb tax
deficiencies recognized subsequent to the adoption of SFAS 123R the APIC
Pool to the method otherwise required by paragraph 81 of SFAS 123R. The
Company may take up to one year from the effective date of this FSP to evaluate
its available alternatives and make its one-time election. The Company is
currently evaluating the alternative methods; however, neither alternative would
have an impact on the Company results of operations or financial condition for
the year ended June 30, 2006, due to the fact that the Company is currently
using prior period net operating losses and has not realized any tax benefits
under SFAS 123R. Until and unless the Company elects the transition method
described in this FSP, the Company will follow the transition method described
in paragraph 81 of SFAS 123R.
The following table illustrates the effect on net income and net income per
common share for the years ended June 30, 2005 and 2004, as if the Company had
applied the fair value recognition provisions for stock-based employee
compensation under Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123
Accounting for Stock-based Compensation, SFAS 123, as amended. For
purposes of the pro forma presentation, option and restricted stock forfeitures
are accounted for as they occurred and no amounts of compensation expense have
been capitalized into inventory or other assets, but instead were considered as
period expenses in thousands, except per share data                                         YEARS ENDED JUNE 30,

of deductions resulting from the exercise of stock options as operating cash
flows in the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows. SFAS 123R requires the cash
flows resulting from tax benefits resulting from tax deductions in excess of the
compensation cost recognized for those options excess tax benefits to be
classified as financing cash flows. For the year ended June 30, 2006, there was
no excess tax benefit recognized resulting from share-based compensation cost.
The fair value of options granted is estimated on the date of grant using a
Black-Scholes option pricing model. Expected volatilities are calculated based
on the historical volatility of the Company stock. Management monitors share
option exercise and employee termination patterns to estimate forfeiture rates.
Separate groups of employees that have similar historical exercise behavior are
considered separately for valuation purposes. The expected holding period of
options represents the period of time that options granted are expected to be
outstanding. The risk-free interest rate is based on the interest rate of a
5-year U.S. Treasury note in effect on the date of the grant or such other
period that most closely equals the term of the option.
The table below presents the assumptions used to calculate the fair value
of options granted during the years ended June 30, 2006, 2005 and 2004                                YEARS ENDED JUNE 30,

a look-back option that allows employees to purchase shares of common stock at
85% of the market value at the lower of either the date of enrollment or the
date of purchase. Payment for the ESPP is a fixed amount, set at the beginning
of the period, made through payroll withholding over the enrollment period which
is six months. The number of shares the participant can acquire is variable
based on the fixed amount withheld and the applicable fair value. SFAS No. 123R
requires an ESPP with a purchase price discount of greater than 5% and a
look-back option to be compensatory. The fair value of the `put' and `call'
features of the estimated shares to be purchased are estimated at the beginning
of the purchase period using a Black-Scholes option pricing model. Expected
volatilities are calculated based on the historical six-month volatility of the
Company stock. The expected holding period is equal to the six-month
enrollment period. The risk-free interest rate is based on the interest rate of
a six-month U.S. Treasury note in effect on the first day of the enrollment
period. The fair value of the shares is liability classified until the end of
the six-month period at which time the fair value is re-calculated as of the end
of the period and compared to the estimate. The lower amount is then equity
classified and any over accrual reversed. As of June 30, 2006, there is
approximately $42,000 of liability classified share-based compensation expense
included in Accrued expenses and other current liabilities on the Consolidated
Balance Sheet.                    74  Stock Option Plans
The Company maintains share-based payment arrangements under the following
plans: i the Amended and Restated 1993 Stock Incentive Plan 1993 Plan,
ii the Amended and Restated 1995 Employee Stock Purchase Plan ESPP, iii
the Amended and Restated 1998 Non-Employee Director Stock Plan 1998 Plan,
iv the 2003 Stock Incentive Plan 2003 Plan, v the 2004 Employment
Inducement Stock Plan 2004 Plan, vi the LeCroy Corporation CATC Special
2000 Stock Option Plan, vii the LeCroy Corporation CATC 2000 Stock Incentive
Plan, and viii the LeCroy Corporation CATC 1994 Stock Option Plan items
vi, vii and viii collectively the LeCroy CATC Plans. The Company has
a policy of issuing new shares to satisfy share option exercises.
The 1993 Plan expired on January 4, 2003. All options outstanding under the
1993 Plan at the time of its expiration will continue in full force and effect
in accordance with their terms. The vesting period and expiration of each grant
was determined by the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors. In
general, the vesting period is 25% per annum over a four-year period, or 50%
after the second year and 25% for the third and fourth years. The lives of the
options are generally ten years from the date of grant. As of June 30, 2006,
there were 1,310,582 options outstanding under the 1993 Plan, of which 1,243,458
options were vested.
The ESPP has reserved for issuance an aggregate of 1,060,000 shares of
Common Stock and is set to expire on November 30, 2011. The purpose of the ESPP
is twofold: first, to encourage stock ownership by employees by establishing a
program that permits them to purchase shares of Common Stock on a regular basis
through payroll deductions; and second, to offer employees an opportunity,
without adverse tax consequences, to purchase stock at a price equal to 85% of
the market value on the first or last business day of the offering period.
Through June 30, 2006, a total of 570,921 shares have been issued under the ESPP
including 78,408, 56,214 and 49,141 shares for the years ended June 30, 2006,
2005 and 2004, respectively. As of June 30, 2006, 489,079 shares are available
for future issuance.
In October 1998, the Board of Directors and stockholders terminated the
1995 Non-Employee Director Stock Option Plan 1995 Plan and adopted the 1998
Plan. As of June 30, 2006, stock options to purchase 901 shares of Common Stock
issued pursuant to the 1995 Plan are outstanding and fully vested. On October
26, 2005, the Company shareholders approved amendments to the 1998 Plan to
extend the termination date of the 1998 Plan to October 27, 2010 and to provide
for the ability to grant restricted stock awards under the 1998 Plan. Pursuant
to the 1998 Plan, each non-employee director receives annually either a stock
option grant of 15,000 shares to vest ratably over 36 months, or a restricted
stock award of 10,000 shares of Common Stock, subject to such vesting and other
conditions and restrictions as the Board may determine at its discretion.
Additionally, each non-employee director will receive annually a restricted
stock award of 5,000 shares of Common Stock subject to such vesting and other
conditions and restrictions as the Board may determine at its discretion. A
total of 500,000 shares of Common Stock can be issued during the term of the
1998 Plan. As of June 30, 2006, there were 238,670 options outstanding under the
1998 Plan, of which 234,086 options were vested. As of June 30, 2006, 212,330
shares are available for future issuance under the 1998 Plan.
The 2003 Plan provides for the grant of incentive stock options,
nonqualified stock options and restricted stock awards to employees including
officers and employee directors and consultants. Unless approved by
stockholders owning a majority of shares present and entitled to vote at a duly
convened meeting of stockholders of the Company, the purchase price of any
option granted under the 2003 Plan may not be less than 100% of the fair value
of the Company common stock on the date of grant. The aggregate number of
shares of Common Stock that may be issued or transferred pursuant to options or
restricted stock awards under the 2003 Plan is 1,560,167 shares. The 2003 Plan
also allows for awards based on performance criteria which awards may then
qualify as performance-based compensation under Section 162m of the Internal
Revenue Code. The Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors administers
the 2003 Plan and has the authority to determine the terms of such options or
awards including the number of shares, exercise or purchase prices and times at
which the options become and remain exercisable or restricted stock is no longer
restricted. There have been no performance-based awards granted under the 2003
Plan. The 2003 Plan expires on October 29, 2013. As of June 30, 2006, there were
57,968 options outstanding under the 2003 Plan, of which 9,018 options were
vested. As of June 30, 2006, 966,577 shares are available for future issuance
under the 2003 Plan.                    75   In connection with the Merger, on October 29, 2004, the Company Board of
Directors approved the 2004 Plan to promote the interests of the Company and its
stockholders by strengthening the Company ability to attract and induce
persons to become employees of the Company, including certain of CATC
employees. The adoption of the 2004 Plan did not require stockholder approval.
The number of shares of LeCroy common stock that may be issued or transferred
pursuant to options or restricted stock awards granted under the 2004 Plan is
750,000 shares. On October 29, 2004, the Company issued the following grants
under the 2004 Plan: i 70,000 shares of restricted common stock to certain
former officers of CATC, and ii options to purchase an aggregate of 230,984
shares of common stock to 61 former CATC employees who became non-officer
employees of LeCroy none of whom received an option grant of more than 20,000
shares. The options were issued with vesting periods of four to six years. On
September 13, 2005, the Board of Directors resolved that no further grants would
be made under the 2004 Plan. The 2004 Plan expires on October 29, 2014. As of
June 30, 2006, there were 172,152 options outstanding under the 2004 Plan, of
which 16,126 options were vested.
In connection with the Merger, LeCroy assumed the LeCroy CATC Plans. On
October 27, 2004, the Board of Directors of CATC approved technical amendments
to each of the CATC Stock Plans in anticipation of their assumption by LeCroy
pursuant to the Merger including, without limitation, amendments reflecting that
any stock option or other award granted thereunder would be exercisable for
LeCroy common stock. Pursuant to SFAS No. 141 and FIN 44, the 648,284 unvested
stock options and certain vested but unexercised stock options, granted by the
Company in exchange for the stock options held by the employees of CATC were
considered part of the purchase price for CATC. The $51 million fair value of
the new awards was included in the purchase price, less the intrinsic value of
unvested options of $19 million, which, during the period from October 29, 2004
to June 30, 2005, was being charged as compensation expense to operations on a
straight-line basis as earned by employees over their remaining vesting periods.
In connection with the adoption of SFAS 123R, the remaining unamortized deferred
compensation was eliminated against additional paid-in capital on the date of
adoption and compensation cost for unvested options under the LeCroy CATC
Plans is being recognized over the remaining vesting period using the fair value
of the options on the date of the Merger. On September 13, 2005, the Board of
Directors resolved that no further grants would be made under the LeCroy CATC
Plans. As of June 30, 2006, there were 450,575 options outstanding under the
LeCroy CATC Plans, of which 289,122 options were vested.
Stock option transactions for fiscal years 2006, 2005 and 2004 under all
plans are as follows                                       WEIGHTED AVERAGE

Of the total stock options outstanding, 1,792,711, 1,860,699 and 1,771,859
options were exercisable at June 30, 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. Shares
available for grant under all plans were 1,667,986, 1,415,772 and 977,648 at
June 30, 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively.
As of June 30, 2006, there was approximately $32 million of unrecognized
compensation cost net of estimated forfeitures related to stock options
granted under the plans. That cost is expected to be recognized over a
weighted-average period of 262 years. No compensation cost related to stock
options was capitalized in inventory or any other assets for the years ended
June 30, 2006, 2005 or 2004.
Restricted Stock
Compensation cost for restricted stock referred to as non-vested stock
was historically recorded based on its market value on the date of grant as
deferred stock compensation, a component of Stockholder Equity, and then
recognized ratably over the associated service period, the period in which
restrictions are removed. Forfeitures were accounted for as they occurred. With
the adoption of SFAS 123R, effective July 3, 2005, deferred stock compensation
was eliminated against additional paid-in capital. The fair value of new grants
is determined based on the closing price on the date of grant. Related
compensation expense is recognized ratably over the associated service period,
giving effect to estimated forfeitures. During the year ended June 30, 2006
there were 73,500 shares of restricted stock granted. Of these shares, 25,000
were issued under the 1998 Plan to non-employee directors and were immediately
vested and 48,500 shares were issued to employees under the 2003 Plan with
4-year vesting. In fiscal 2005, 198,030 and 70,000 shares of restricted stock
were granted under the 2003 Plan and 2004 Plan, respectively, with various
vesting conditions ranging from three to four years. In fiscal 2004, 365,000
shares of restricted stock were granted under the 2003 Plan with long-term cliff
vesting conditions of three to five years to certain key employees. During the
years ended June 30, 2006 and 2005, 32,375 and 2,300 shares, respectively, of
non-vested stock were forfeited as a result of employee terminations and $01
million and $24,000 of compensation expense was reversed in fiscal 2006 and
2005, respectively. As of June 30, 2006, 528,075 shares are unvested.

restricted stock grants was capitalized in inventory or any other assets for the
years ended June 30, 2006, 2005 and 2004.
15. COMMON STOCK, TREASURY STOCK AND WARRANTS TO PURCHASE COMMON STOCK
On April 14, 2004, the Company closed an underwritten public follow-on
offering of 500,000 shares of its common stock at $1900 per share less the
underwriting discount raising aggregate net proceeds of approximately $79
million, net of $11 million in offering costs and expenses. On April 27, 2004,
pursuant to the exercise of an over-allotment option, the Company sold an
additional 225,000 shares at $1900 per share less the underwriting discount,
raising additional net proceeds of $41 million, net of expenses. On April 23,
2004, the Company used $40 million of proceeds from this offering to repay $40
million of indebtedness outstanding under its revolving credit facility.
On May 25, 2006, the Company Board of Directors approved the adoption of
a share repurchase plan authorizing the Company to purchase up to 2 million
shares, not to exceed $25 million, of its common stock for the treasury. During
the fourth quarter of fiscal 2006, the Company repurchased 142,283 shares for
total consideration of $19 million.
Purchases under this buyback program may be made from time to time on the
open market and in privately negotiated transactions, including pursuant to the
terms of a 10b5-1 plan. A 10b5-1 plan allows a company to purchase shares during
a blackout period, provided the company communicates its share purchase
instructions to the broker prior to the blackout period, pursuant to a written
plan that may not be changed. The timing of these purchases is dependent upon
several factors, including market conditions, the market price of the Company
common stock, the effect of the share dilution on earnings, available cash and
any other potential risks the Company may encounter. The share repurchase plan
may be discontinued at any time at the discretion of the Company.
At June 30, 2006 the Company had outstanding warrants to purchase 28,571
shares of common stock at a purchase price of $1750 per share. These warrants
expired on August 15, 2006. Warrants to purchase 250,000 shares of common stock
at a purchase price of $2000 per share expired on June 30, 2006. No warrants
were exercised during the fiscal years ended June 30, 2006, 2005 or 2004. 16. EARNINGS PER COMMON SHARE

approximately 17 million, 16 million and 11 million, respectively, of stock
options, restricted stock and warrants to purchase common stock as the effect of
their inclusion would have been anti-dilutive to earnings per share.
17. STOCKHOLDER RIGHTS PLAN
On November 2, 1998, the Company Board of Directors declared a dividend
distribution of one right in respect to each share of LeCroy Common Stock
outstanding at the record date, November 18, 1998. To date, the rights have been
traded together with the Common Stock and are not exercisable or separately
tradable. The rights will be exercisable if a person or group acquires, in the
future, 15% or more of the Company stock or announces a tender offer. Right
holders, other than the acquiring person or group, are then entitled to purchase
an amount of the Company stock at a 50% discount to the share price at that
time. The number of shares of stock that a right holder is entitled to purchase
is based on the exercise price. Under certain circumstances, the right will
entitle the stockholder to buy shares in an acquiring entity at a discount.
The Board of Directors may redeem the rights at a price of $0001 per right
up until 10 days following a public announcement that any person or group has
acquired 15% or more of LeCroy Common Stock. The rights will expire on
November 2, 2008, unless redeemed prior to that date.
18. REDEEMABLE CONVERTIBLE PREFERRED STOCK
On June 30, 1999, the Company completed a private placement of 500,000
shares of its redeemable convertible preferred stock for proceeds of $100
million. The shares of preferred stock were entitled to a 12% cumulative
dividend on the original purchase price of $100 million, with redemption rights
beginning on June 30, 2004 at the sole discretion of the holders of such shares.
On September 27, 2003, the Company repurchased from the holders of its
redeemable convertible preferred stock all 500,000 issued and outstanding shares
for $230 million in cash. In connection with the repurchase of preferred stock,
the Company recorded a charge of approximately $77 million to stockholders'
equity representing the premium paid to the holders of its preferred stock $10
million charged to Retained earnings and $67 million charged to Additional
paid-in capital and recognized transaction costs of $04 million included in
Other, net in the fiscal 2004 Consolidated Statement of Operations. In
accordance with the SEC position published in EITF Topic No. D-42 relating to
induced conversions of preferred stock, the Company recorded the $77 million
premium paid to purchase the preferred stock as a charge to arrive at Net income
applicable to common stockholders in fiscal 2004.
The Company and the holders of its preferred stock agreed that the final
repurchase of preferred stock would be negotiated as though the transaction had
occurred at the beginning of the first quarter of fiscal 2004. As a result, the
Company accounted for the transaction as though no dividends had accrued in
fiscal 2004 and that the charge for the value originally attributed to the
warrants at the point of issue that remained unaccreted at the time of
redemption was accelerated and combined with the redemption premium to reflect
the total charge related to the redemption of convertible preferred stock in the
fiscal 2004 Consolidated Statement of Operations.
79 19. EMPLOYEE BENEFIT PLANS
The Company had two employee 401k savings plans. One is a trusted,
employee 401k savings plan for eligible U.S. employees under which it
contributes an unconditional match of up to 50% of employee contributions up to
a maximum employer contribution of 5% of the employee eligible compensation,
as defined.
The other plan is the CATC 401k Profit Sharing Plan the CATC 401k
Plan which the Company assumed in the Merger, and which covered all full-time
former CATC employees employed by LeCroy. The CATC 401k Plan permitted, but
did not require, that the Company provide matching contributions to the CATC
401k Plan on behalf of all participants. Effective January 11, 2006 the
Company decided to merge the CATC 401k Plan into the trusted, employee 401k
savings plan. For fiscal 2006, 2005 and 2004, the Company has expensed $06
million, $06 million and $04 million, respectively, for those plans.
The Company subsidiary in Switzerland maintains a defined contribution
plan, which requires employee contributions based upon a percentage of the
employee earnings, as defined, currently ranging from 46% to 84%. The
Company makes a matching contribution based also upon a percentage of the
employee earnings, as defined, currently ranging from 54% to 96%. For fiscal
2006, 2005, and 2004, the Company has expensed $04 million, $05 million, and
$04 million, respectively, in matching contributions to this plan.

21. IWATSU SETTLEMENT/PURCHASE AGREEMENT
On March 22, 2006, the Company completed a purchase and settlement
agreement with Iwatsu Electric Company, Ltd. Iwatsu for a total of $36
million which included the settlement of an underlying dispute between the
Company and Iwatsu relating to the ownership of intellectual property contained
in Iwatsu ViewGo product line, a non-compete agreement, whereby Iwatsu agreed
not to engage in competition with the Company for a period of ten years, and the
purchase of certain other intellectual property rights unrelated to the ViewGo
product line. The Company obtained an independent third-party appraisal to value
these elements of the Iwatsu agreement. As a result of the appraisal, in the
third quarter of fiscal 2006, the Company expensed $28 million of the total
purchase price as a legal settlement. The remaining $08 million was recorded as
intangible assets of which $05 million will be amortized over the 10-year
estimated life of the non-compete agreement and $03 million will be amortized
over the 7-year estimated useful life of the acquired intellectual property
assets. The ViewGo product line was re-engineered by the Company and launched as
the WaveJet family of products during the third quarter of fiscal 2006.
22. COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES
OPERATING LEASES
Operating leases covering plant, certain office facilities and equipment
expire at various dates through 2013. Future minimum annual lease payments
required during the years ending June 30, 2007, 2008, 2009, 2010, 2011 and
thereafter, under non-cancelable operating leases having an original term of
more than one year, are $20 million, $16 million, $07 million, $02 million 01 million and $01 million, respectively. Aggregate rental expense on
non-cancelable operating leases for the years ended June 30, 2006, 2005 and 2004
approximated $21 million, $20 million and $21 million, respectively.
ENVIRONMENTAL
The Company former subsidiary, Digitech, was notified prior to 1999 by
the Connecticut Department of Environmental Protection the DEP that it may
be responsible for environmental damage that occurred at its previously leased
facilities in Ridgefield, Connecticut the Ridgefield Site. Based upon
recommendations made by the DEP, Digitech engaged environmental consultants to
assist it in evaluating the costs associated with the DEP recommendations for
monitoring and remediation of the environmental damage.
In May 1999, LeCroy, Digitech and the former owners of the Ridgefield Site
entered into an agreement with the current owners of the Ridgefield Site. The
current owners purchased an insurance policy providing for $20 million of
coverage against certain environmental liabilities related to the Ridgefield
Site. This insurance policy names both LeCroy and Digitech as insured parties.
The current owners of the Ridgefield Site also agreed to remediate all
environmental problems associated with the property and to obtain all applicable
approvals and certifications from the DEP. The current owners of the Ridgefield
Site also agreed to hold both LeCroy and Digitech harmless in the event of a
claim made against them relating to these environmental matters. In return for
the above, forty-five days after the DEP has provided written notification to
the Company that the site remediation has been accomplished to its satisfaction,
the Company agreed to pay the former owners of the Ridgefield Site $02 million
as compensation for the reduced sale value of the property due to the
environmental problems existing on the site. The Company has retained this
liability after the sale of the Vigilant business and the residual assets of
Digitech, which amount is recorded in Accrued expenses and other current
liabilities on the June 30, 2006 and 2005 Consolidated Balance Sheets.                    81  LEGAL
On April 28, 2003, Tektronix, Inc. Tektronix filed a complaint against
the Company in the United States District Court for the District of Oregon
claiming that the Company infringed on eight of Tektronix' U.S. patents. In the
Company responsive pleading, the Company denied that it has infringed, or is
infringing, any of these patents, and contends that the patents are invalid. The
Company furthermore filed a counterclaim on August 5, 2003, claiming Tektronix
is infringing three of the Company patents. On April 11, 2005, all claims
related to two of the Tektronix patents were voluntarily dismissed from the
Tektronix complaint and the Company counterclaim. All claims related to one of
the Company patents were also voluntarily dismissed from the Company
counterclaim. On November 30, 2004, the Company filed a Motion for Summary
Judgment of Non-infringement concerning one of the six Tektronix patents. In
response, Tektronix filed a Cross-Motion for Summary Judgment of Infringement by
the Company concerning the same patent. By order dated May 4, 2005, the court
granted the Company Motion for Summary Judgment of Non-infringement and denied
Tektronix' Cross-Motion for Summary Judgment of Infringement. On May 11, 2005,
Tektronix and the Company entered into an agreement settling all claims and
counterclaims between the parties in connection with their respective patents.
As part of the settlement agreement, the Company paid $10 million to Tektronix
in fiscal 2005.
From time to time, the Company may be involved in lawsuits, claims,
investigations and proceedings, including patent and environmental matters,
which arise in the ordinary course of business. There are no matters pending
that the Company expects to be material to its business, results of operations,
financial condition or cash flows.
23. RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS
On October 20, 2000, the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors
approved a $03 million five-year loan to Thomas H. Reslewic, LeCroy Chief
Executive Officer and President, secured by Mr. Reslewic non-qualified stock
options. The loan accrued interest at 95% compounded annually with interest
payable at the maturity of the loan. If Mr. Reslewic remained an employee of
LeCroy for the entire five-year term of the loan or was terminated without cause
prior to the maturity date of the loan, the Company would forgive the loan
principal and all accrued interest. The loan was amortized on a straight-line
basis and the compensation expense was recorded within Selling, general and
administrative expenses. The loan reached maturity in the second quarter of
fiscal 2006 and was forgiven along with the accrued interest, in accordance with
the agreement.
On July 19, 2005 the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors
approved a $03 million retention bonus to Mr. Reslewic. This retention bonus
requires Mr. Reslewic to remain an employee for five years. If Mr. Reslewic
terminates his employment earlier than five years, he will be required to repay
the bonus in full. The retention bonus is being amortized over five years on a
straight line basis as compensation expense. At June 30, 2006 $02 million
remains on the balance sheet of which a portion is in Other current assets and
the remaining balance is in Other non-current assets on the Consolidated Balance
Sheet.
24. DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS
The Company has the following derivative instruments   Interest Rate Swap
As required by the terms of the Credit Agreement See Note 13 - Long Term
Debt and Capital Leases, on January 27, 2005 the Company entered into a Master
Agreement with the M Bank, the purpose of which is to protect against rising
interest rates during the term of the Credit Agreement. The Credit Agreement
obligates the Company to enter into one or more interest rate swap agreements
covering the interest payable with respect to at least 50% of the outstanding
principal amount of the Term Loan for a period of at least three years. In
connection with the Master Agreement, the Company entered into an interest rate
swap transaction effective January 31, 2005 and continuing through January 31,
2008, corresponding with the repayment terms of the Term Loan. The swap
agreement is not designated as a cash flow hedge under SFAS 133. Accordingly,
changes in the fair value of the swap are charged or credited to operations. In
accordance with the interest rate swap transaction, the Company pays interest
quarterly on the notional amount at a fixed annualized rate of 387% to M
Bank, and receives interest quarterly on the same notional amount at the
three-month LIBOR rate in effect at the beginning of each quarterly reset
period; except for the initial period, which covered the two months ending March                    82 31, 2005, in which the Company received interest at a LIBOR rate of 264%. The
initial notional amount was $250 million and resets quarterly to 50% of the
outstanding principal balance of the Term Loan with respect to the original
amortization schedule as set forth in the Credit Agreement. The net interest
incurred on the swap was approximately $01 million income for the year ended
June 30, 2006 and $01 million expense for the year ended June 30, 2005. The
notional amount as of June 30, 2006 was approximately $191 million as compared
to approximately $231 million as of June 30, 2005. The fair value of the
interest rate swap as of June 30, 2006 and 2005, was $04 million and $01
million, respectively, and approximates the amount that the Company would have
received from M Bank if the Company had canceled the transaction at those
dates. The fair value is recorded in Other non-current assets in the
Consolidated Balance Sheets as of June 30, 2006 and 2005 and the change in fair
value of $03 million ad $66,000 for the year ended June 30, 2006 and 2005,
respectively, is recognized in Interest expense in the Consolidated Statements
of Operations.
Forward foreign exchange contracts
The Company enters into short-term forward exchange agreements to purchase
foreign currencies at set rates in the future. These foreign currency forward
exchange agreements are used to limit exposure to fluctuations in foreign
currency exchange rates on assets and liabilities denominated in currencies
other than the subsidiaries' functional currency. Subsidiaries may also use
forward exchange agreements to offset the foreign currency risk for receivables
and payables not denominated in, or indexed to, their functional currencies. The
Company records these short-term forward exchange agreements on the balance
sheet at fair value and changes in the fair value are recognized currently in
Other expense income, net in the Consolidated Statement of Operations.
During fiscal 2006, 2005 and 2004, foreign currency exchange gains losses

Item 5. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES.   The Company, under the supervision and with the participation of its
management, including the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer,
evaluated the effectiveness of the design and operation of the Company
disclosure controls and procedures as defined in Rule 13a-15e under the
Exchange Act as of the end of the period covered by this report. Based on that
evaluation, the Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer
concluded that the Company disclosure controls and procedures are effective in
recording, processing, summarizing and reporting, on a timely basis, information
relating to the Company and the Company consolidated subsidiaries required to
be disclosed in the Company reports filed or submitted under the Exchange Act.   There have not been any changes in the Company internal control over
financial reporting as defined in Rules 13a-15f and 15d-15f under the
Exchange Act during the quarter ended June 30, 2006 that have materially
affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, its internal control
over financial reporting.   Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 requires that management
document and test the Company internal controls over financial reporting and
include in this Annual Report on Form 10-K a report on management assessment
of the effectiveness of the Company internal controls over financial
reporting. See Management Report on Internal Control over Financial
Reporting. In addition, KPMG LLP, an independent registered public accounting
firm, has audited management assessment of the effectiveness of internal
control over financial reporting as of June 30, 2006, as well as the
effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting as of June 30, 2006
and has issued their report thereon, also included in this Annual Report on Form
10-K.     MANAGEMENT'S REPORT ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING
Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate
internal control over financial reporting, as defined in Rules 13a-15f and
15d-15f of the Exchange Act. The Company internal control over financial
reporting is designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability
of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external
purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. Under the
supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Chief
Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, we conducted an evaluation of the
effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting based upon the
guidelines established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the
Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission COSO. Based
on that evaluation, our management has concluded that our internal control over
financial reporting is effective as of June 30, 2006. In addition, KPMG LLP, our
independent registered public accounting firm, has audited our assessment of the
effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting as of June 30, 2006,
as well as the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting as of
June 30, 2006 and has issued their report thereon. That report appears below.                    86       REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM The Board of Directors and Stockholders
LeCroy Corporation We have audited management assessment, included in the accompanying
Management Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting, that LeCroy
Corporation and subsidiaries maintained effective internal control over
financial reporting as of June 30, 2006, based on criteria established in
Internal Control--Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring
Organizations of the Treadway Commission COSO. LeCroy Corporation management
is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial
reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over
financial reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on management
assessment and an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company internal control
over financial reporting based on our audit.
We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company
Accounting Oversight Board United States. Those standards require that we plan
and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective
internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material
respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over
financial reporting, evaluating management assessment, testing and evaluating
the design and operating effectiveness of internal control, and performing such
other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe
that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.
A company internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to
provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting
and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance
with generally accepted accounting principles. A company internal control over
financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that 1 pertain to
the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly
reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; 2
provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to
permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted
accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are
being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of
the company; and 3 provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely
detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company
assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting
may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of
effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become
inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance
with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
In our opinion, management assessment that LeCroy Corporation and subsidiaries
maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of June 30,
2006, is fairly stated, in all material respects, based on criteria established
in Internal Control--Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring
Organizations of the Treadway Commission COSO. Also, in our opinion, LeCroy
Corporation and subsidiaries maintained, in all material respects, effective
internal control over financial reporting as of June 30, 2006, based on the
criteria established in Internal Control--Integrated Framework issued by the
Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission COSO.
We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company
Accounting Oversight Board United States, the consolidated balance sheets of
LeCroy Corporation and subsidiaries as of June 30, 2006 and 2005, and the
related consolidated statements of operations, stockholders' equity,
comprehensive income and cash flows for each of the years in the three-year
period ended June 30, 2006, and our report dated September 13, 2006, expressed
an unqualified opinion on those consolidated financial statements. s/ KPMG LLP
