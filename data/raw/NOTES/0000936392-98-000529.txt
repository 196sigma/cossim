INTERVU INC.
A DEVELOPMENT STAGE COMPANY
NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
1. THE COMPANY AND SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
InterVU Inc. the Company was incorporated in Delaware on August 2, 1995
to develop and market proprietary technologies and systems for delivering video
on the Internet. The Company utilizes a proprietary operating system for routing
and distributing high quality video over the Internet at high speeds. The
Company has commenced planned principal operations, however, as there has been
no significant revenue therefrom, the Company is considered to be in the
development stage.
BASIS OF PRESENTATION
The accompanying financial statements have been prepared assuming that the
Company will continue as a going concern. This basis of accounting contemplates
the recovery of the Company assets and the satisfaction of its liabilities in
the normal course of business. Since inception, the Company has been engaged in
organizational activities, including recruiting personnel, establishing office
facilities, research and development and obtaining financing. Through December
31, 1997, the Company had incurred accumulated losses of $7,589,281. Successful
completion of the Company development program and its transition to attaining
profitable operations is dependent upon obtaining financing adequate to fulfill
its research, development and market introduction activities, and achieving a
level of revenues adequate to support the Company cost structure. While
management believes the Company has funds to meet its capital requirements for
the next twelve months, without the additional financing, the Company may be
required to delay, reduce the scope of or eliminate one or more of its research
and development projects or market introduction activities and significantly
reduce its expenditures on infrastructure and product upgrade programs that
enhance the InterVU network architecture.
CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS
Cash and cash equivalents consist of cash, money market funds, and other
highly liquid investments with maturities of three months or less when
purchased. The carrying value of these instruments approximates fair value. Such
investments are made in accordance with the Company investment policy, which
establishes guidelines relative to diversification and maturities designed to
maintain safety and liquidity. The Company has not experienced any losses on its
cash and cash equivalents.
PROPERTY AND EQUIPMENT
Property and equipment are stated at cost, net of accumulated depreciation
and depreciated over the estimated useful lives of the assets, ranging from
three to five years, using the straight-line method. Leasehold improvements are
stated at cost and amortized using the straight-line method over the shorter of
the estimated useful lives of the assets or the lease term. Amortization of
equipment under capital leases is reported with depreciation of property and
equipment.
SOFTWARE DEVELOPMENT COSTS
Financial accounting standards provide for the capitalization of certain
software development costs after technological feasibility of the software is
attained. No such costs have been capitalized to date because costs incurred
subsequent to reaching technological feasibility have not been material.                                        36

NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
USE OF ESTIMATES
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted
accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that
affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and disclosures made in
the accompanying notes to the financial statements. Actual results could differ
from those estimates.
REVENUE RECOGNITION
Revenue is generated primarily from video encoding and distribution services.
Revenue from video encoding services is recognized as the service is provided
and revenue from video distribution services is recognized at the time of
delivery.
CONCENTRATION OF CREDIT RISK
Credit is extended based on an evaluation of the customer financial
condition and collateral is generally not required. Credit losses have been
minimal and such losses have been within management expectations.
RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT COSTS
Costs incurred in connection with research and development are charged to
operations as incurred.
IMPAIRMENT OF LONG-LIVED ASSETS
In 1996, the Company adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standard
SFAS No. 121, Accounting for the Impairment of Long-Lived Assets and for
Long-Lived Assets to Be Disposed Of, which requires impairment losses to be
recorded on long-lived assets used in operations when indicators of impairment
are present and the undiscounted cash flows estimated to be generated by those
assets are less than the assets' carrying amount. SFAS No. 121 also addresses
the accounting for long-lived assets that are expected to be disposed of. The
adoption had no impact on the Company financial statements.
STOCK OPTIONS
In 1996, the Company adopted SFAS No. 123, Accounting for Stock-Based
Compensation, which establishes the use of the fair value based method of
accounting for stock-based compensation arrangements, under which compensation
cost is determined using the fair value of stock-based compensation determined
as of the grant date, and is recognized over the periods in which the related
services are rendered. SFAS No. 123 also permits companies to elect to continue
using the intrinsic value accounting method specified in Accounting Principles
Board APB Opinion No. 25 to account for stock-based compensation. The Company
has decided to retain the intrinsic value based method, and has disclosed the
pro forma effect of using the fair value based method to account for its
stock-based compensation Note 4.
LOSS PER SHARE
Loss per share is computed using the weighted average number of common
shares and common equivalent shares outstanding during the periods presented.
Common equivalent shares result from stock options, warrants and unvested
restricted stock of which 2,775,659 and 2,442,540 shares were excluded from the
computation of diluted earnings per share in 1996 and 1997, respectively, as the
effect would be anti-dilutive. For loss periods, common equivalent shares are
excluded from the computation as their effect would be anti-dilutive, except
that the Securities and Exchange Commission SEC has historically required
common and common share equivalents issued during the last twelve-month period
prior to the initial filing of a proposed public offering, to be included in the
calculation as if they were outstanding for all periods presented using the
treasury stock method and the initial public offering price.                                        37

INTERVU INC.
A DEVELOPMENT STAGE COMPANY
NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
In February 1997, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued SFAS No.
128, Earnings per Share, which supercedes APB opinion No. 15. SFAS No. 128
replaces the presentation of primary earnings per share EPS with Basis EPS,
which includes no dilution and is based on weighted average common shares
outstanding for the period. Companies with complex capital structures, including
InterVU, will also be required to present Diluted EPS that reflects the
potential dilution of securities such as employee stock options and warrants to
purchase common stock. SFAS No. 128 is effective for financial statements issued
for periods ending after December 15, 1997. On February 2, 1998, the SEC issued
Staff Accounting Bulletin SAB No. 98 which revised the previous instructions
for determining the dilutive effects of earnings per share computations of
common stock and common stock equivalents at prices below the IPO price prior to
the effectiveness of the IPO.
Included in the shares used in calculating Basic and Diluted net loss per
share for 1996 and 1997 are the weighted-average effect of assumed conversion
of preferred shares totaling 2,052,983 and 3,199,777, respectively, and
weighted-average common shares totaling 1,387,948 and 2,622,817, respectively.
NEW ACCOUNTING STANDARDS
In June 1997, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued SFAS No. 130,
Reporting Comprehensive Income, and SFAS No. 131, Segment Information. Both of
these standards are effective for the fiscal years beginning after December 15,
1997. SFAS No. 130 requires that all components of comprehensive income,
including net income, be reported in the financial statements in the period in
which they are recognized. Comprehensive income is defined as the change in
equity during the period from transactions and other events and circumstances
from non-owner sources. Net income and other comprehensive income, including
foreign currency translation adjustments, and unrealized gains and losses on
investment shall be reported, net of their related tax effect, to arrive at
comprehensive income. The Company does not believe that comprehensive income or
loss will be materially different than net income or loss. SFAS No. 131 amends
the requirements for public enterprises to report financial and descriptive
information about its reportable operating segments. Operating segments, as
defined in SFAS No. 131 are components of an enterprise for which separate
financial information is available and is evaluated regularly by the Company in
deciding how to allocate resources and in assessing performance. The financial
information is required to be reported on the basis that is used internally for
evaluating the segment performance. The Company believes it operates in one
business and operating segment and does not believe adoption of this standard
will have a material impact on the Company financial statements.

4. STOCKHOLDERS' EQUITY
CONVERTIBLE PREFERRED STOCK
Upon completion of the Company public offering, the Company had authorized
5,000,000 shares of preferred stock of which 1,280,000 shares were designated as
Series G convertible preferred shares. The Board of Directors is authorized,
without further stockholder approval, to issue the remaining 3,720,000 shares of
preferred stock in one or more series and to fix the rights, preferences,
privileges, and restrictions granted or imposed upon any unissued shares of
preferred stock and to fix the number of shares constituting any series and the
designation of such series.
In connection with the formation of a strategic alliance in October 1997,
the Company issued 1,280,000 shares of Series G preferred stock. The Series G
convertible preferred stock $001 par value has an aggregate liquidation
preference of $10,240,000, a dividend rate of $64 per share and a conversion
rate of 6298 common shares to one preferred share, subject to adjustment for
dilution. Noncumulative dividends are payable quarterly, when, as and if
declared by the Board of Directors. The Series G convertible preferred shares
are convertible at the option of the holder commencing July 10, 1998. The holder
of each share of Series G convertible preferred stock has the right to one vote
for each share of common stock into which it would convert.
COMMON STOCK
In August 1995, 2,398,278 shares of common stock were issued to the founders
of the Company at a price of $0004 per share under founder stock purchase
agreements. In March 1996, an additional 886,758 shares of common stock were
issued to three of the founders at a price of $002 per share under the founder
stock purchase agreements. In January 1996, the Company issued 147,373 shares of
common stock to employees at $004 per share under restricted stock agreements.
Also, in April and December 1996, the Company issued 444,639 and 129,739 shares
of common stock, respectively, to employees at $024 and $04 per share,
respectively, under restricted stock agreements. In connection with the founder
stock purchase agreements and the restricted stock agreements, the Company has
the option to repurchase, at the original issue price, unvested common shares in
the event of termination of employment. Shares issued under the agreements
generally vest 20% on the first anniversary of the employee hire date and
daily thereafter for four years. At December 31, 1997, 1,521,293 shares were
subject to repurchase by the Company.
In April 1996, the Board of Directors declared a two-for-one stock dividend
of the Company common stock, effectuated as a stock split. Also, on July 16,
1997, the Company declared a two-for-one stock split of the Company common
stock. All applicable share and stock option information have been restated to
reflect the split.
In August 1997, the Board of Directors authorized management of the Company
to file a registration statement with the SEC permitting the Company to sell
shares of its common stock to the public. Concurrent with the closing of the
offering, all of the preferred stock outstanding, excluding 1,280,000 shares of
Series G convertible preferred stock, automatically converted into 3,328,717
shares of common stock
On November 18, 1997, the Company effected a reverse stock split in which
6298 shares of common stock were exchanged for one share of common stock. All
applicable share and stock option information have been restated to reflect the
reverse stock split. Upon completion of the public offering, the Company had
authorized 20,000,000 shares of common stock.
STOCK OPTIONS
The Company has established a stock option plan to grant options to purchase
common stock to consultants, employees, officers and directors of the Company.
The Company has authorized for grant under the plan stock options to purchase up
to 1,889,400 shares of its common stock.                                        39

NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
Under the terms of the plan, non-qualified and incentive options may be
granted to consultants, employees, officers and directors at prices not less
than 100% of the fair value on the date of grant. Options generally vest 20%
after the first year of employment and daily thereafter for four years. The
options expire ten years from the date of grant.
The following table summarizes the stock option activity for the period from
August 2, 1995 Inception to December 31, 1997                                  WEIGHTED-

As of December 31, 1997, options for 77,260 common shares were exercisable.
The weighted average remaining contractual life of outstanding options was
approximately 925 years at December 31, 1997.
Pro forma information regarding net income or loss is required to be
disclosed in accordance with SFAS No. 123, and has been determined as if the
Company has accounted for its employee stock options under the fair value method
prescribed in that Statement. For options granted in the year ended December 31,
1996 and through November 18, 1997, the fair value for the options was estimated
at the date of grant using the minimum value method for option pricing with
the following weighted average assumptions: risk-free interest rate of 6 dividend yield of 0%, and weighted average expected life of the option of seven
years. For options granted from November 18, 1997, to December 31, 1997, the
fair value of the options was estimated at the date of grant using the
Black-Scholes method for option pricing with the following weighted average
assumptions: risk free interest rate of 6%, dividend yield of 0%, expected
volatility of 75% and weighted average expected life of the option of seven
years.
The minimum value pricing model is similar to the Black-Scholes option
valuation model which was developed for use in estimating the fair value of
traded options which have no vesting restrictions and are fully transferable,
except that it excludes the factor for volatility. In addition, option valuation
models require the input of highly speculative assumptions.
Because the Company employee stock options have characteristics
significantly different from those of traded options, and because changes in the
subjective input assumptions can materially affect the fair value estimate, in
management opinion, the existing models do not necessarily provide a reliable
single measure of the fair value of its employee stock options.
For purposes of pro forma disclosures, the estimated fair value of the
options is amortized to expense over the vesting period of the related options.
The Company pro forma net loss was $46,020 for the period from August 2, 1995
Inception to December 31, 1995, $2,278,002 and $5,099,562 for the years ended
December 31, 1996 and 1997, respectively, and , $7,377,640 for the period from
August 2, 1995 Inception to December 31, 1997. The Company pro forma basic
and diluted net loss per share was $66 and $088 for the years ended
December 31, 1996 and 1997, respectively.
DEFERRED COMPENSATION
Through December 31, 1997, the Company recorded deferred compensation for the
difference between the price per share of restricted stock issued or the
exercise price of stock options granted and the deemed fair value for financial
statement presentation purposes of the Company common stock at the date of
issuance or grant. The deferred compensation will be amortized over the vesting
period of the related restricted stock or options, which is generally five
years. Gross deferred compensation at December 31, 1996 and 1997 totaled
$421,273 and $984,092,                                        40

Inception to December 31, 1997.
WARRANTS
In connection with the Company initial public offering, the Company issued
200,000 warrants to purchase common stock to its underwriters. Such warrants are
exercisable at $1140 per share of common stock through November 19, 2002.
SHARES RESERVED FOR FUTURE ISSUANCE
At December 31, 1997, the Company had reserved approximately 29 million

5. COMMITMENTS
The Company leases its principal facilities under two noncancelable operating
leases which expire in 1999 with options to renew the leases for up to two

tax loss carryforwards will begin to expire in 2010 and 2003, respectively,
unless previously utilized. The Company also has federal and California research
tax credit carryforwards of approximately $171,000 and $96,000, respectively,
which will begin to expire in 2011 and 2010 respectively, unless previously
utilized.
Pursuant to Internal Revenue Service Code Sections 382 and 383, use of the
Company net operating loss and credit carryforwards may be limited because of
a cumulative change in ownership of more than 50% which occurred                                        41

7. EMPLOYEE BENEFITS
In 1996, the Company established a cafeteria benefits plan whereby it
contributes for each employee an amount equal to $3,000 plus a percentage of
each employee base salary, as approved by the Board of Directors, up to a
maximum contribution of $9,000. The employer contribution goes towards the
purchase of various benefit packages selected by the employee. The employee may
contribute additional amounts as desired. Benefit packages include health care
reimbursement, dependent care assistance, various insurance premium payments and
a 401k plan. Company contributions to the cafeteria benefits plan were
$101,832 and $182,216 for the years ended December 31, 1996 and 1997,
respectively, and $284,048 for the period from August 2, 1995 Inception to
December 31,1997.
8. STRATEGIC ALLIANCES
On October 10, 1997, the Company entered into a strategic alliance with NBC
Multimedia, Inc. NBC Multimedia, a wholly-owned subsidiary of the National
Broadcasting Corporation, Inc. NBC whereby the Company became the exclusive
provider of technology and services for the distribution of most NBC
entertainment audio/visual content by means of the Internet. As consideration
for the formation of the strategic alliance, the Company issued to NBC 1,280,000
shares of Series G convertible preferred stock. The Company is entitled to
receive 30% of certain advertising revenues generated under this alliance from
NBC websites or, at a minimum, payments from NBC Multimedia for the video
delivery services at rates at least as favorable as the most favorable rates
offered by the Company to third parties. The Company is obligated to make
$2,000,000 in non-refundable payments to NBC Multimedia for certain production,
operating and advertising costs associated with certain NBC websites including
payments of i $750,000 paid on the completion of the initial public offering
completed in November 1997, ii $500,000 due in February 1998, iii $500,000
due in May 1998, and iv $250,000 due in August 1998.
NBC Multimedia may terminate the agreement without cause by giving 90 days
written notice and, is required to return i all shares of Series G convertible
preferred stock if termination occurs prior to January 10, 1998 and NBC
Multimedia has not promoted, at a minimum, the Company logo on the NBC Web
site or ii 600,000 shares of Series G convertible preferred stock if the
termination occurs at any other time during the first two years of the exclusive
term. The Company will determine the fair value of the Series G convertible
preferred stock issued to NBC on the dates the requirements that NBC return some
or all of the shares of Series G convertible preferred stock lapse. Based on
these provisions, the Company currently expects to charge the then fair value of
680,000 shares of Series G convertible preferred stock to expense in the quarter
ending March 31, 1998 and the then fair value of the remaining 600,000 shares of
Series G convertible preferred stock to expense in the quarter ending December
31, 1999. Should the Company renegotiate or waive these provisions, removing
NBC obligation to return shares of Series G convertible preferred stock, the
Company would expense the fair value of each share at that time. The Company
believes that the fair value of the shares of Series G convertible preferred
stock will roughly approximate the price at which the Company common stock is
then trading, multiplied by the number of common shares into which such
outstanding shares of Series G convertible preferred stock would convert at the
6298 conversion rate. These noncash charges are likely to be substantial and
are likely to have a material adverse impact on the Company results of
operations in the periods such expenses are recognized.
