Controls and Procedures. Our disclosure controls

the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended the Exchange Act are
designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in the reports
that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed,
summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the rulesand
forms of the Securities and Exchange Commission. The Chief Executive Officer and the Chief
Financial Officer, with assistance from other members of management, have
reviewed the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as
ofJune30, 2008 and, based on their evaluation, have concluded that
the disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of such date. As part of our Strategic
Modernization Initiative, we anticipate the continued migration of our
operations to SAP, with the majority of our business being implemented through
fiscal 2012. Based on managements evaluation, the necessary steps have
been taken to monitor and maintain appropriate internal control over financial
reporting during this period. There have been no
changes in our internal control over financial reporting as defined in Rules13a-15fand
15d-15fof the Exchange Act that occurred during the fourth quarter of
fiscal 2008 that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially
affect, the Companys internal control over financial reporting. Managements report on internal control over financial reporting and
