INDEPENDENT AUDITORS' REPORT
The Board of Directors and Stockholders
Turnstone Systems, Inc.
We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Turnstone
Systems, Inc. and subsidiaries the Company as of December 31, 2000 and 1999,
and the related consolidated statements of operations, stockholders' equity, and
cash flows for the years ended December 31, 2000 and 1999 and the period from
January 2, 1998 inception to December 31, 1998. In connection with our audits
of the consolidated financial statements, we have also audited the financial
statement schedule as listed in the accompanying index. These consolidated
financial statements and financial statement schedule are the responsibility of
the Company management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these
consolidated financial statements and financial statement schedule based on our
audits.
We conducted our audits in accordance with auditing standards generally
accepted in the United States of America. Those standards require that we plan
and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial
statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a
test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial
statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and
significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall
financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a
reasonable basis for our opinion.
In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above
present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Turnstone
Systems, Inc. and subsidiaries as of December 31, 2000 and 1999, and the results
of their operations and their cash flows for the years ended December 31, 2000
and 1999 and the period from January 2, 1998 inception to December 31, 1998,
in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States
of America. Also, in our opinion, the related financial statement schedule, when
considered in relation to the consolidated financial statements taken as a
whole, presents fairly, in all material respects, the information set forth
therein.

TURNSTONE SYSTEMS, INC.
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
DECEMBER 31, 2000, 1999 AND 1998
1. DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS
Turnstone Systems, Inc. the Company develops and markets products that
enable local exchange carriers to rapidly deploy and efficiently maintain
digital subscriber line services. The Company commenced the commercial sale of
its products in the first quarter of 1999.
During 1998, the Company was considered to be in the development stage as
the Company was engaged primarily in obtaining financing and personnel and
developing its products.
The Company was incorporated on January 2, 1998. The period from this date
to December 31, 1998 is referred to in the accompanying consolidated financial
statements and notes as 1998 or the Year ended December 31, 1998.
2. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
Basis of Presentation
The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company
and its wholly-owned subsidiaries located in New Zealand, the United Kingdom,
Germany and Australia. All significant intercompany accounts and transactions
have been eliminated in consolidation.
The functional currency of the Company subsidiaries is the U.S. dollar.
The financial statements of the subsidiaries are remeasured into U.S. dollars
for the purposes of consolidation using the historical exchange rates in effect
at the date of the transactions. Remeasurement gains and losses are included in
interest income expense and other, net and have not been material to date.
Foreign currency transaction gains and losses are included in interest income
expense and other, net and have not been material for all periods presented.
In July 2000, the Board of Directors authorized a two-for-one stock split
of the Company common stock effected in the form of a stock dividend on August
23, 2000 to holders of record as of the close of business on August 9, 2000. All
common shares, common options and per share amounts in the accompanying
financial statements have been adjusted to reflect the stock split.
Use of Estimates
The preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with
generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates
and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and
disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial
statements and reported results of operations during the reporting period.
Actual results could differ from those estimates.
Reclassifications
Certain reclassifications, none of which affected net income loss, have
been made to prior year amounts to conform to the current year presentation.
Cash and Cash Equivalents
The Company considers all highly liquid investments purchased with an
original maturity of less than three months at the date of purchase to be cash
equivalents. Cash equivalents at December 31, 2000 and 1999 consist primarily of
money market funds. Substantially all cash and cash equivalents are held with
three financial institutions.

TURNSTONE SYSTEMS, INC.
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED
DECEMBER 31, 2000, 1999 AND 1998
Investments
The Company has classified its investment securities as available-for-sale.
Available-for-sale securities are carried at fair value. Unrealized gains and
losses are included in other comprehensive income loss. Realized gains and
losses are computed using the specific identification method.
The Company investments comprise U.S., state, and municipal government
obligations and corporate debt securities. Investments with maturities of less
than or equal to one year are considered short-term and investments with
maturities in excess of one year are considered long-term. Management determines
the appropriate classification of securities at the time of purchase and
evaluates such designation as of each balance sheet date.
Fair Value of Financial Instruments and Concentration of Credit Risk
The carrying value of the Company financial instruments, including cash
and cash equivalents, investments and accounts receivable approximates fair
market value. Financial instruments that subject the Company to concentrations
of credit risk consist primarily of cash and cash equivalents, investments and
trade accounts receivable. Management believes the financial risks associated
with these financial instruments are minimal. The Company maintains its cash and
cash equivalents and investments with high quality financial institutions. The
Company performs ongoing credit evaluations of its customers and generally does
not require collateral on accounts receivable. The Company maintains reserves
for potential credit losses.
For the year ended December 31, 2000, 19% of net revenues were derived from
one customer. For the year ended December 31, 1999, 15% of net revenues were
derived from that same customer, and 41%, 19% and 11% of net revenues were
attributable to three additional customers. Substantially all of the Company
revenues during 2000 and 1999 were derived from customers who are competitive
local exchange carriers. The financial condition of competitive local exchange
carriers has in the past, and may in the future, have a significant impact on
the Company results of operations.
Foreign Currency Risk
The Company develops its products in the United States and markets its
products in the United States, Canada, Europe, Asia and Asia Pacific.
Substantially all revenues and expenses are denominated in United States
dollars. As a result, a strengthening of the dollar could make the Company
products less competitive in foreign markets. The Company currently does not
conduct transactions in any foreign currencies and, therefore, does not engage
in any foreign exchange hedging activities.
Inventories
Inventories consist primarily of finished products and raw materials.
Finished products are manufactured by a third party manufacturer and are
included in the Company inventory balance once testing is complete and title
passes to the Company. Raw materials included in the Company inventory balance
consist of component parts inventory purchased by the Company. The Company
recognized a charge of $41 million to write down the value of finished goods
and raw materials on hand at December 31, 2000 in excess of forecast
requirements. Inventories are stated at the lower of cost determined by the
first-in, first-out method or market. Component parts purchased and owned by
the third party manufacturer are not included in the Company inventory
balance. Under the contract with the third party manufacturer, the Company has
liability for component parts purchased on behalf of the Company, and
work-in-process and finished goods inventory manufactured for the Company, that
become excess or obsolete to the manufacturer as a result of certain actions.
Such actions can include the effect of product design changes or changes in the
Company planned requirements.

Finished   29,207   2,854

Valuation of Long-Lived Assets
Property and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation.
Depreciation and amortization are computed using the straight-line method over
the shorter of the estimated useful lives of the assets, generally three years,
or the lease term, if applicable. Gains and losses on disposals are included in
net income at amounts equal to the difference between the net book value of the
disposed assets and the proceeds received upon disposal.
Intangible assets consist of goodwill and assembled workforce associated
with the Company purchase of Paragon Solutions Limited Paragon in August
2000. Intangible assets are being amortized on a straight-line basis over an
estimated life of four years.
The Company periodically evaluates the carrying value of long-lived assets
and certain identifiable intangibles for impairment, when events and
circumstances indicate that the book value of an asset may not be recoverable.
An impairment loss is recognized whenever the review demonstrates that the book
value of a long-lived asset is not recoverable. Recoverability of property and
equipment to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount
of the asset to future net cash flows expected to be generated by the asset. If
such assets are considered to be impaired, the impairment to be recognized is
measured by the amount by which the carrying amount of the assets exceeds the
fair value of the assets. Recoverability of goodwill and certain identifiable
intangibles is measured by the undiscounted cash flows of the acquired business
over the remaining amortization period and, when the carrying value exceeds the
net realizable value, the value of goodwill and intangible is reduced to net
realizable value.
Since January 2, 1998 inception through December 31, 2000, no impairment
losses have been identified.
Revenue Recognition
The Company recognizes revenue from product sales based upon shipment of
products pursuant to customer purchase orders, assuming that the price to
customer is fixed or determinable and that collectibility of the resulting
receivable is probable. When the arrangement with the customer includes future
obligations for which fair value does not exist or when customer acceptance is
required, revenue is recognized when those obligations have been met or customer
acceptance has been received. The Company generally does not allow for product
returns. The Company maintains an estimated reserve for potential returns based
on a minimal level of returns on a historical basis. Revenue from services and
support provided under the Company maintenance programs are deferred based
upon the fair value of the program and recognized on a straight-line basis over
the period of the contract. The Company provides twelve months warranty for
product shipments not already covered under maintenance programs. Costs
associated with the warranty program are estimated and accrued for at the time
of product shipment. Revenue from consulting and training are deferred based on
the fair value of the services, and recognized when such services are completed.
Deferred revenue represents amounts received from customers in respect of
maintenance programs, consulting and training, in advance of such services and
support being provided.

Revenue from transactions involving the Company software application
products is recognized provided that a purchase order has been received, the
software and related documentation have been shipped, collection of the
resulting receivable is deemed probable, and the fee is fixed or determinable.
To date, revenue from such transactions has not been significant.
Research and Development Costs
Development costs incurred in the research and development of new products
and enhancements to existing products are expensed as incurred until the product
has been completed, tested and is ready for commercial manufacturing. To date,
hardware development projects have been completed concurrent with the
establishment of commercial manufacturing and accordingly no costs have been
capitalized. To date, software development projects have been completed
concurrent with the establishment of technological feasibility in the form of a
working model and, accordingly, no costs have been capitalized.
Stock-Based Compensation
The Company accounts for stock-based employee compensation arrangements in
accordance with the provisions of Accounting Principles Board APB Opinion No.

Board FASB Interpretation No. 44, Accounting for Certain Transactions
Involving Stock Compensation: An Interpretation of APB Opinion No. 25, and
complies with the disclosure provisions of Statement of Financial Accounting
Standards SFAS No. 123, Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation. Compensation
expense on fixed stock options is based on the difference, if any, on the date
of the grant, between the fair value of the Company stock and the exercise
price of the option. The Company accounts for equity instruments issued to

Net Earnings Loss Per Share
Basic and diluted net earnings loss per share have been computed in
accordance with SFAS No. 128, Earnings Per Share. Basic net earnings loss per
share is computed using the weighted-average number of outstanding shares of
common stock excluding weighted-average number of shares of restricted stock
subject to repurchase. Diluted net earnings loss per share is computed using
the weighted-average number of shares of common stock outstanding and, when
dilutive, shares of restricted common stock subject to repurchase, potential
shares of common stock from options and warrants using the treasury stock method
and from convertible securities using the as-if converted basis.

Other Comprehensive Income
The Company reports comprehensive income or loss in accordance with the
provisions of SFAS No. 130, Reporting Comprehensive Income. SFAS No. 130
establishes standards for reporting comprehensive income and its components in
financial statements. Comprehensive income or loss, as defined, includes all
changes in equity net assets during a period from non-owner sources.

Income Taxes
Income taxes are computed using an asset and liability approach, which
requires the recognition of taxes payable or refundable for the current year and
deferred tax assets and liabilities for the future tax consequences of events
that have been recognized in the Company consolidated financial statements or
tax returns. The measurement of current and deferred tax assets and liabilities
are based on provisions of the enacted tax law; the effects of future changes in
tax laws or rates are not anticipated. The measurement of deferred tax assets is
reduced, if necessary, by the amount of any tax benefits that, based on
available evidence, are not expected to be realized.
Recent Accounting Pronouncements
In June 1998, the FASB issued SFAS No. 133, Accounting for Derivative
Instruments and Hedging Activities, which establishes accounting and reporting
standards for derivative instruments, including derivative instruments embedded
in other contracts, collectively referred to as derivatives and for hedging
activities. Through December 31, 2000, the Company has not had any investments
in derivative instruments and the Company has not engaged in hedging activities.
Accordingly, the Company has evaluated the effects of adopting SFAS No. 133 and
currently does not believe that it will have a material impact on its financial
position, results of operations or cash flows. In June 2000, the FASB issued
Statement No. 138, Accounting for Certain Derivative Instruments and Certain
Hedging Activities. SFAS 138 addresses certain issues related to the
implementation of SFAS 133, but does not change the basic model of SFAS 133 or
further delay the implementation of SFAS 133.
3. ACQUISITION
On August 8, 2000, the Company completed the acquisition of Paragon, a
privately-held New Zealand company. Paragon is an engineering design services
company that specializes in the design of telecommunications services products.
In connection with this acquisition and in exchange for all outstanding ordinary
shares of Paragon, the former shareholders of Paragon received $50 million in
cash in August 2000. On the first anniversary of the closing date, they are
entitled to receive an additional $25 million and a further $25 million if
certain contract conditions are met, for a maximum second installment of $50
million. As a result of the acquisition, Paragon became a wholly-owned
subsidiary of the Company. The consolidated statements of
51
52
TURNSTONE SYSTEMS, INC.
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED
DECEMBER 31, 2000, 1999 AND 1998
operations for the year ended December 31, 2000 include the results of
operations of Paragon for the period from August 8, 2000 to December 31, 2000.
The acquisition was accounted for under the purchase method of accounting
in accordance with APB Opinion No. 16. Under the purchase method of accounting,
the purchase price is allocated to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed
based on their estimated fair values. Management best estimates of the fair
values of the assets and liabilities of Paragon have been combined with the
recorded values of the assets and liabilities of the Company.
The purchase price consists of the first installment of $50 million and
the minimum $25 million payment of the second installment. The minimum amount
of the second installment is valued at approximately $23 million based on the
present value at acquisition date, computed at an average annual return of 95%.
This amount is payable on August 8, 2001 and has been included in current
obligations under note payable and capital leases on our balance sheet at
December 31, 2000.
The total purchase price is allocated as follows in thousands

The goodwill and assembled workforce are being amortized on a straight-line
basis over a four year period. As of December 31, 2000, accumulated amortization
related to the goodwill and assembled workforce acquired in the Paragon
acquisition totaled $635,000. If the maximum amount of the second installment
payment is made on the first anniversary of the consummation of the transaction
and is added to the purchase price, there would be an increase to intangible
assets of $25 million. Amortization of this additional purchase consideration
would commence at that time on a straight-line basis over the remainder of the
initial four-year period.

pro forma basis, reflects the consolidated results of operations for the years

7. INCOME TAXES
The Company has provided a valuation allowance due to the uncertainty of
generating future profits that would allow for the realization of such deferred
tax assets. The change in the total valuation allowance for the years ended
December 31, 2000 and 1999 was a decrease of $4,000 and a decrease of
$1,076,000, respectively.
The Internal Revenue Code and applicable state tax laws, impose substantial
restrictions on the ability of the Company to utilize net operating losses and
tax credit carryforwards in the event of an ownership change, as defined in
Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code. The issuance of Series A convertible
preferred stock on January 13, 1998, resulted in such a change. As a result, the
annualized loss and credit carryforwards as of January 13, 1998 of $100,000 and
$5,600, respectively, are subject to an annual limitation of approximately
$300,000. The net operating losses incurred from January 14, 1998 through
December 31, 1998 are not subject to an annual limitation.
Income taxes for the years ended December 31, 2000, 1999 and 1998, were

Purchase Commitments and Contingencies
In 2000, the Company recorded a charge to cost of net revenues totaling
$73 million representing certain noncancelable purchase commitments for product
component parts in excess of forecast requirements. These purchase commitments
included commitments to the Company third party manufacturer for component
parts to be purchased on behalf of the Company by its third party manufacturer,
as well as the Company purchase commitments for component parts to its
vendors. This liability has been included in other current liabilities and
accrued expenses on the balance sheet as of December 31, 2000.
Lease Commitments
In July 1998, the Company entered into a leasing agreement with a financing
company which allows the Company to draw up to $900,000 for the lease of
hardware and $600,000 for the lease of software. The leases entered into under
this leasing agreement are accounted for as capital leases. This leasing
agreement expired April 29, 2000. The remaining lease obligations outstanding
under this agreement are repayable in 36 equal monthly installments of principal
plus interest commencing on the individual lease inception dates and are secured
by the leased assets.
In connection with the equipment leasing agreement, the Company issued to
the financing company warrants to purchase 90,000 shares of Series A convertible
preferred stock at a price of $050 per share. The fair value of the warrants
was determined to be $27,000, calculated using the Black-Scholes option pricing
model, using the following assumptions: no dividends; contractual term of five
years; risk-free interest rate of 55%; and expected volatility of 65%. The fair
value of the warrants has been recorded as additional paid-in capital and is
being amortized as interest expense over the term of the lease agreement. The
Company has issued 176,896 shares of common stock upon net exercise of these
warrants.

The Company is also obligated under certain noncancelable operating leases
for office space, which requires the Company to pay related property taxes and
normal maintenance. The leases expire in various years through 2010. Rent
expense for the years ended December 31, 2000, 1999 and 1998 was $2,537,000 244,000 and $128,000, respectively.

noncancelable operating sublease in 2001 are $467,000.
In May 2000, the Company entered into an operating lease agreement for new
corporate facilities. The lease term commenced July 1, 2000 and extends through
June 30, 2010. Lease payments will be made on an escalating basis for total
minimum lease payments of $427 million over the lease term. Rent expense is
recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term. In May 2000, the
Company was required to make an advance lease payment for the first twelve
months of the lease. This payment, totaling $36 million, has been classified as
prepaid expenses at December 31, 2000.
Upon execution of the lease agreement in May 2000 and extending through the
duration of the lease term, the Company is required to maintain a standby letter
of credit in the amount of $36 million. This letter of credit requires the
Company to hold funds in the form of a certificate of deposit with a financial
institution. The Company has classified these funds as restricted cash on the
balance sheet at December 31, 2000.
9. SEGMENT INFORMATION
In June 1997, the Financial Accounting Standards Board FASB issued SFAS
No. 131, Disclosures about Segments of an Enterprise and Related Information.
This Statement establishes standards for the way companies report information
about operating segments in annual financial statements. It also establishes
standards for related disclosures about products and services, geographic areas
and major customers. The Company has determined that it does not have separately
reportable operating segments. The Company operates in one principal business
segment across domestic and international markets.

10. STOCKHOLDERS' EQUITY
Common Stock
In 1998, the Company issued 16,951,000 shares of restricted common stock to
the three founding members of the Company at $00005 per share. The shares are
subject to a right of repurchase by the Company, which lapses monthly over four
year periods ending in October 2001 and January 2002, or on the occurrence of a
change of control event. Upon termination of employment, the Company may
repurchase all unvested shares at the original purchase price. The Company
maintains a right of first refusal with respect to restricted common stock. As
of December 31, 2000, 1999 and 1998, there were 3,834,000, 8,072,000 and
12,310,000 shares of restricted common stock subject to repurchase from the
three founding members of the Company.
In February 2000, the Company completed its initial public offering. The
Company issued 6,900,000 shares of common stock at a price to the public of
$1450 per share. The net proceeds of the initial public offering were
approximately $921 million. Upon closing of the initial public offering, all
convertible preferred stock Series A and Series B automatically converted to
29,713,860 shares of common stock. Upon the completion of the initial public
offering the Company was authorized to issue 200,000,000 shares of common stock 0001 par value.
In August 2000, the Company effected a 2-for-1 stock split in the form of a
stock dividend. All common shares, common options and per share amounts in the
accompanying financial statements have been adjusted to reflect the stock split.
In September 2000, the Company completed a follow on offering of its common
stock. The Company issued 3,500,000 shares of common stock at a price to the
public of $5000 per share. The net proceeds of the follow on offering were
approximately $1655 million.
1998 and 2000 Stock Plans
In January 1998, the 1998 Stock Plan was adopted by the Board and
subsequently received stockholder approval. Upon completion of the Company
initial public offering, the 1998 Stock Plan was terminated, no further option
grants were made under the 1998 Stock Plan, and all shares reserved but not yet
issued under the 1998 Stock Plan were made available for grant under the 2000

the Company to grant employees, outside directors, and consultants qualified
stock options, nonstatutory stock options, or stock purchase rights to purchase
shares of the Company common stock. Options generally vest 25% with respect to
the number granted upon the first anniversary date of the option grant and the
remainder vest in equal monthly installments over the 36 months thereafter.
Options are exercisable immediately. Shares issued upon exercise of non-vested
stock options are subject to the Company right to repurchase at the original
exercise price. The Company repurchase right lapses in accordance with the
vesting schedule for the stock options. At December 31, 2000, 1999 and 1998,
2,602,000, 3,266,000 and 3,328,000, shares, respectively, resulting from the
early exercise of options were subject to repurchase at weighted-average
exercise prices of $038, $032 and $003, respectively.
Under the 1998 Stock Plan, the Company issued 31,068 shares of common stock
in 1999 and 45,380 shares in 1998 in exchange for consulting services. The
aggregate estimated fair value of these shares and the resulting expense was
$25,000 for the 1999 issuances and $2,000 for the 1998 issuances. In addition,
in 1999 the Company granted 150,000 options to non-employee members of its
Advisory Board. These options were fully vested at the date of grant.
Amortization of deferred stock compensation in 1999 includes $217,500 of
compensation expense related to these option grants.
In July 1999, the Company approved increases in the number of shares of
Common Stock reserved for issuance under the Company 1998 Stock Plan from
10,648,000 to 14,148,000 shares.
The 2000 Stock Plan was adopted by the Board of Directors in November 1999
and became effective upon the effectiveness of our initial public offering in
February 2000. The 2000 Stock Plan provides for the grant of incentive stock
options, nonstatutory stock options, and stock purchase rights to employees,
directors and consultants. The plan also provides for nondiscretionary grants of
nonstatutory options to outside directors. Options granted under the 2000 Stock
Plan are exercisable upon vesting. Options granted under the 2000 Stock Plan
generally vest 25% with respect to the number granted upon the first anniversary
date of the option grant and the remainder vest in equal monthly installments
over the 36 months thereafter. A total of 10,575,752 shares of common stock have
been reserved for issuance under the 2000 Stock Plan, including 575,752 shares
available for grant under the 1998 Stock Plan that were transferred to the 2000
Stock Plan. An annual increase in the share reserve will be added on the first
day of each year, beginning in 2001.
2000 Nonstatutory Stock Plan
The 2000 Nonstatutory Stock Plan was adopted by the Board of Directors in
August 2000. The 2000 Nonstatutory Stock Plan provides for the grant of
nonstatutory stock options and stock purchase rights to employees and
consultants. Options granted under the 2000 Nonstatutory Stock Plan generally
vest 25% with respect to the number granted upon the first anniversary date of
the option grant and the remainder vest in equal monthly installments over the
36 months thereafter. A total of 4,000,000 shares of common stock have been
reserved for issuance under the 2000 Nonstatutory Stock Plan.

The Company uses the intrinsic-value method in accounting for its
stock-based compensation arrangements for employees whereby compensation cost is
recognized to the extent the fair value of the underlying common stock exceeds
the exercise price of the stock options at the date of grant. Deferred stock
compensation of $3,967,000 in 2000, $13,070,000 in 1999 and $195,000 in 1998 has
been recorded for the excess of the fair value of the common stock underlying
the options at the grant date over the exercise price of the options.
These amounts are being amortized on an accelerated basis over the vesting
period, generally four years, consistent with the method described in FASB
Interpretation No. 28. Amortization of deferred compensation was $7,017,000 in
2000, $3,584,000 in 1999 and $29,000 in 1998. The fair value of options granted
prior to the Company initial public offering on February 1, 2000 are estimated
on the date of grant using the minimum value method with the following
weighted-average assumptions: no dividend yield; risk-free interest rates of
582%, 538% and 512% in 2000, 1999 and 1998, respectively, and an expected
life of four years. The fair value of options granted subsequent to the
Company initial public offering are estimated on the date of grant using the
Black-Scholes option pricing model with the following weighted-average
assumptions: no dividend yield, risk-free interest rate of 582%, expected
volatility of 120 and an expected life of four years.

2000 Employee Stock Purchase Plan
The 2000 Employee Stock Purchase Plan was adopted by the Board of Directors
in November 1999 and became effective upon the effectiveness of our initial
public offering in February 2000. A total of 1,000,000 shares of common stock
have been reserved for issuance, with an annual increase for subsequent years. A
total of 74,000 shares have been issued pursuant to the 2000 Employee Stock
Purchase Plan as of December 31, 2000 at a weighted-average purchase price per
share of $1233. The 2000 Employee Stock Purchase Plan provides eligible
employees the opportunity to purchase common stock, subject to certain
restrictions, through payroll deductions. The purchase price per share will be
85% of the fair market value of the common stock on the first day of the
applicable offering period or the last day of the applicable purchase period,
whichever is lower.
To comply with the pro forma reporting requirements of SFAS No. 123
compensation cost is also estimated for the fair value of employee stock
purchase plan issuances, which is included in the pro forma totals above.
Therefore, the Company has estimated the compensation cost for its employee
stock purchase plan issuances in October 2000. The fair value of purchase rights
granted under the Purchase Plan is estimated on the date of grant using the
Black-Scholes option pricing model with the following weighted average
assumptions for the year ended December 31, 2000: no expected dividends;
expected volatility of 120; risk-free interest rate of 603%; and expected life
of nine months. The weighted-average per share fair value of the purchase rights
granted under the Purchase Plan during fiscal 2000 was $772.
