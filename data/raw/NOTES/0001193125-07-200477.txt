Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm The Board of Directors and
Stockholders Open Text Corporation: We have audited Open Text Corporations internal control over financial reporting as of June30, 2007, based on criteria established in Internal ControlIntegrated Framework issued by the Committee of
Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission COSO. Open Text Corporations management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control
over financial reporting, included under Part II, Item9A of this Form 10-K. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Companys internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board United States. Those standards require that we
plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial
reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audit also included performing such other procedures as we
considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion. A companys
internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted
accounting principles. A companys internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that 1pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions
and dispositions of the assets of the company; 2provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that
receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and 3provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized
acquisition, use, or disposition of the companys assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. Because of
its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because
of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. In our opinion, Open Text
Corporation maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of June30, 2007, based on criteria established in Internal ControlIntegrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring
Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Open Text Corporation acquired Hummingbird Ltd. during the year ended June30, 2007, and
management excluded from its assessment of the effectiveness of Open Text Corporations internal control over financial reporting as of June30, 2007, Hummingbird Ltd.s internal control over financial reporting. Assets of Hummingbird
Ltd. represents approximately 29% of total assets included in the consolidated financial statements of Open Text Corporation as of June30, 2007. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting of Open Text Corporation also excluded an
evaluation of the internal control over financial reporting of Hummingbird Ltd. We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of
the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board United States, the consolidated balance sheets of Open Text Corporation as of June30, 2007 and 2006, and the related consolidated statements of income, shareholders equity and comprehensive
income, and cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended June30, 2007, and our report dated September11, 2007 expressed an unqualified opinion on those consolidated financial statements. /s/KPMG LLP, Licensed Public Accountants Toronto, Canada September11, 2007

and comprehensive income, and cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended June30, 2007. These consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the Companys management. Our responsibility is to express an
opinion on these consolidated financial statements based on our audits. We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the
Public Company Accounting Oversight Board United States. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes
examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall
financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. In our opinion, the consolidated
financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Open Text Corporation as of June30, 2007 and 2006, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the years in the
three-year period ended June30, 2007, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. We also have audited, in

OPEN TEXT CORPORATION Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements Tabular amounts in thousands, except per share data NOTE 1NATURE OF OPERATIONS Open Text Corporation the
Company or Open Text develops, markets, sells, and supports Enterprise Content Management ECM solutions. The Companys principal product is called Livelink. The Company offers its solutions both as end-user stand alone products and as fully integrated modules. Open Text markets and licenses its products and services primarily in North America and Europe. NOTE 2SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES Basis of
presentation These consolidated financial statements are expressed in U.S. dollars and are prepared in accordance with accounting
principles generally accepted in the United States of America U.S. GAAP. Basis of consolidation The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Open Text Corporation and its subsidiaries, all of which are wholly-owned with the exception
of IXOS Software AG IXOS, which as of June30, 2007 and June30, 2006, was 9602% and 9552% owned, respectively. All inter-company balances and transactions have been eliminated. The Company has recorded a minority interest
on its balance sheet in respect of IXOS to reflect the non-controlling interest in IXOS. The information furnished includes the financial results of Hummingbird Ltd. Hummingbird, with effect from October2, 2006, and Momentum
Systems Inc. Momentum, with effect from March2, 2007 see Note 15Acquisitions to the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Use of estimates The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP
requires management to make estimates, judgments and assumptions, which are evaluated on an ongoing basis, that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements. Management bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other
assumptions that it believes are reasonable at that time, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from
those estimates. In particular, significant estimates, judgments and assumptions include those related to revenue recognition, allowance for doubtful accounts, testing goodwill for impairment, the valuation of acquired intangible assets, long-lived
assets, the recognition of contingencies, facility and restructuring accruals, acquisition accruals, asset retirement obligations, realization of investment tax credits, and the valuation allowance relating to the Companys deferred tax assets.
Reclassifications Certain
prior period comparative figures have been adjusted to conform to current period presentation including the reclassification of $69 million to income taxes payable from income taxes receivable, for the year ended June30, 2006. In addition, a
reclassification of $549,000 was recorded from prepaid expenses and current assets to income tax recoverable, and $85 million was reclassified from income tax recoverable to investment tax recoverable, for the year ended June30, 2006.
For the year ended June30, 2006, Cost of customer support revenues and Cost of service revenues have been increased by approximately
$730,000 and $555,000, respectively, with corresponding decreases of 
59 Table of Contents
approximately $715,000, $194,000, and $376,000 in Research and development expenses, Sales and marketing expenses, and General and administrative expenses,
respectively, from previously reported amounts. These reclassifications related to a change in the method of allocating operating expenses within the Company. Service revenues increased by approximately $55 million for the year ended June30, 2006, offset by a decrease in Customer support revenues of approximately $55 million from previously reported amounts. Cost of
service revenues increased by approximately $33 million for the year ended June30, 2006, offset by a decrease in Cost of customer support revenue of approximately $33 million from previously reported amounts. These changes correspond to an
internal reclassification pertaining to the Companys Enterprise Support Program ESP program. The ESP program is a customized on-site support program that provides support services that suit the specific requirements
of the Companys customers. There was no change to income from operations or net income loss per share in any of the periods
presented as a result of these reclassifications. Cash and cash equivalents Cash and cash equivalents include investments that have terms to maturity of three months or less at the time of acquisition. Cash equivalents are
recorded at cost and typically consist of term deposits, commercial paper, U.S. dollar denominated Canadian federal government securities or short-term interest bearing investment-grade securities and demand accounts of a major Canadian chartered
bank. Capital assets Capital
assets are stated at cost and are depreciated on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of the related assets. Gains and losses on asset disposals are taken into income in the year of disposition. The following represents the
estimated useful lives of capital assets:  Furniture and fixtures
5 to 10 years
Office equipment
5 years
Computer hardware
3 to 7 years
Computer software
3 years
Leasehold improvements
Over the term of the lease
Building
40 years
Business combinations The Company accounts for acquisitions of companies in accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board FASB Statement of Financial Accounting Standards SFAS No141, Business
Combinations SFAS 141. The Company allocates the purchase price to tangible assets, intangible assets and liabilities based on estimated fair values at the date of acquisition with the excess of purchase price, if any, being
allocated to goodwill. Impairment of long-lived assets The Company accounts for the impairment and disposition of long-lived assets in accordance with FASB SFAS No144, Accounting for Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets SFAS 144.
The Company tests long-lived assets or asset groups, such as capital assets and definite lived intangible assets, for recoverability when events or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying amount may not be recoverable. Circumstances
which could trigger a review include, but are not limited to: significant adverse changes in the business climate or legal factors; current period cash flow or operating losses combined with a history of losses 
60 Table of Contents
or a forecast of continuing losses associated with the use of the asset; and a current expectation that the asset will more likely than not be sold or
disposed of before the end of its estimated useful life. Recoverability is assessed based on comparing the carrying amount of the asset to
the aggregate pre-tax undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual disposal of the asset or asset group. Impairment is recognized when the carrying amount is not recoverable and exceeds the fair value of the asset or asset
group. The impairment loss, if any, is measured as the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds discounted projected future cash flows. The Company recorded an impairment charge for technology assets of $697,000 during the year ended
June30, 2007 and $10 million during the year ended June30, 2006 see Note 17 Special Charges Recoveries in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for more details. Acquired intangibles This category consists
of acquired technology and contractual relationships associated with various acquisitions, as well as trademarks and patents. Acquired
technology is initially recorded at fair value based on the present value of the estimated net future income-producing capabilities of software products acquired on acquisitions. Acquired technology is amortized over its estimated useful life on a
straight-line basis. Contractual relationships represent relationships that the Company has with certain customers on contractual or legal
rights and are considered separable. These contractual relationships were acquired by the Company through business combinations and were initially recorded at their fair value based on the present value of expected future cash flows. Contractual
relationships are amortized on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful life. The Company continually evaluates the remaining
estimated useful life of its intangible assets being amortized to determine whether events and circumstances warrant a revision to the remaining period of amortization. Goodwill FASB SFAS No142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets SFAS
142, requires that goodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite useful lives be tested for impairment annually or earlier if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of these assets may not be recoverable.
In accordance with SFAS 142, the Company does not amortize goodwill. The Company performed, in accordance with SFAS 142, its annual
impairment analysis of goodwill as of April1, 2007. The analysis indicated that there was no impairment of goodwill in any of the reporting units. If estimates change, a materially different impairment conclusion could result. Long-lived assets held for sale Long-lived
assets are classified as held for sale when certain criteria are met, which include: managements commitment to a plan to sell the assets; the assets are available for immediate sale in their present condition; an active program to locate
buyers and other actions to sell the assets have been initiated; the sale of the assets is probable and their transfer is expected to qualify for recognition as a completed sale within one year; the assets are being actively marketed at reasonable
prices in relation to their fair value; and it is unlikely that significant changes will be made to the plan to sell the assets or that the plan will be withdrawn. The Company measures long-lived assets held for sale at the lower of carrying amount or fair value less cost to sell. These assets are not depreciated. 
61 Table of Contents
As of June30, 2007 the Company owned one long-lived asset which has been classified as held for
sale see Note 4 Capital Assets in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Allowance for doubtful accounts 
The Company maintains an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of customers to make payments. The Company
evaluates the credit worthiness of its customers prior to order fulfillment and based on these evaluations, adjusts credit limits to the respective customers. In addition to these evaluations, the Company conducts on-going credit evaluations of its
customers payment history and current credit worthiness. The allowance is maintained for 100% of all accounts deemed to be uncollectible and, for those receivables not specifically identified as uncollectible, an allowance is maintained for a
specific percentage of those receivables based upon the aging of accounts, the Companys historical collection experience and current economic expectations. To date, the actual losses have been within management expectations. No single customer
accounted for more than 10% of the accounts receivable balance as of June30, 2007 and 2006. Asset retirement obligations 
The Company accounts for asset retirement obligations in accordance with FASB SFAS No143, Accounting for Asset Retirement
Obligations SFAS 143, which applies to certain obligations associated with the retirement of tangible long-lived assets. SFAS 143 requires that a liability be initially recognized for the estimated fair value of the obligation
when it is incurred. The associated asset retirement cost is capitalized as part of the carrying amount of the long-lived asset and depreciated over the remaining life of the underlying asset and the associated liability is accreted to the estimated
fair value of the obligation at the settlement date through periodic accretion charges recorded within general and administrative expenses. When the obligation is settled, any difference between the final cost and the recorded amount is recognized
as income or loss on settlement. Revenue recognition a License revenues The Company recognizes revenue in accordance with
Statement of Position SOP 97-2, Software Revenue Recognition, issued by the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants AICPA in October 1997 as amended by SOP 98-9 issued in December 1998. 
The Company records product revenue from software licenses and products when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, the software
product has been shipped, there are no significant uncertainties surrounding product acceptance, the fees are fixed and determinable and collection is considered probable. The Company uses the residual method to recognize revenue on delivered
elements when a license agreement includes one or more elements to be delivered at a future date if evidence of the fair value of all undelivered elements exists. If an undelivered element for the arrangement exists under the license arrangement,
revenue related to the undelivered element is deferred based on vendor-specific objective evidence VSOE of the fair value of the undelivered element. The Companys multiple-element sales arrangements include arrangements where software licenses and the associated post contract
customer support PCS are sold together. The Company has established VSOE of the fair value of the undelivered PCS element based on the contracted price for renewal PCS included in the original multiple element sales arrangement, as
substantiated by contractual terms and the Companys significant PCS renewal experience, from its existing worldwide base. The Companys multiple element sales arrangements generally include rights for the customer to renew PCS after the
bundled term ends. These rights are irrevocable to the customers benefit, are for specified prices and the customer is not subject to any economic or other penalty for failure to renew. Further, the renewal PCS options are for services
comparable to the bundled PCS and cover similar terms. 
62 Table of Contents
It is the Companys experience that customers generally exercise their renewal PCS
option. In the renewal transaction, PCS is sold on a stand-alone basis to the licensees one year or more after the original multiple element sales arrangement. The renewal PCS price is consistent with the renewal price in the original multiple
element sales arrangement although an adjustment to reflect consumer price changes is not uncommon. If VSOE of fair value
does not exist for all undelivered elements, all revenue is deferred until sufficient evidence exists or all elements have been delivered. The Company assesses whether payment terms are customary or extended in accordance with normal practice relative to the market in which the sale is occurring. The Companys sales arrangements generally include
standard payment terms. These terms effectively relate to all customers, products, and arrangements regardless of customer type, product mix or arrangement size. The only time exceptions are made to these standard terms is on certain sales in parts
of the world where local practice differs. In these jurisdictions, the Companys customary payment terms are in line with local practice. b Service revenues Service revenues consist of revenues from consulting, implementation, training
and integration services. These services are set forth separately in the contractual arrangements such that the total price of the customer arrangement is expected to vary as a result of the inclusion or exclusion of these services. For those
contracts where the services are not essential to the functionality of any other element of the transaction, the Company determines VSOE of fair value for these services based upon normal pricing and discounting practices for these services when
sold separately. These consulting and implementation services contracts are primarily time and materials based contracts that are, on average, less than six months in length. Revenue from these services is recognized at the time such services are
rendered as the time is incurred by the Company. The Company also enters into contracts that are primarily fixed fee
arrangements wherein the services are not essential to the functionality of a software element. In such cases the proportional performance method is applied to recognize revenue. Revenues from training and integration services are recognized in the period in which these services are performed. c Customer support revenues Customer support revenues consist of revenue derived from contracts to provide PCS to license holders. These revenues are recognized ratably over the term of the contract. Advance billings of PCS are not recorded to
the extent that the term of the PCS has not commenced and payment has not been received. Deferred revenue Deferred revenue primarily relates to support agreements which have been paid for by customers prior to the performance of those services. Generally, the
services will be provided in the next twelve months. Research and development costs Research and development costs internally incurred in creating computer software to be sold, licensed or otherwise marketed, are expensed as incurred
unless they meet the criteria for deferral and amortization, described in FASB SFAS No86 Accounting for the Costs of Corporate Software to be Sold, Released, or Otherwise Marketed SFAS 86. In accordance with SFAS 86,
costs related to research, design and development of products are charged to expenses as incurred and capitalized between the dates that the product is considered to be technologically feasible and is considered to be ready for general release to
customers. 
63 Table of Contents
In the Companys historical experience, the dates relating to the achievement of technological
feasibility and general release of the product have substantially coincided. In addition, no significant costs are incurred subsequent to the establishment of technological feasibility. As a result, the Company does not capitalize any research and
development costs relating to internally developed software to be sold, licensed or otherwise marketed. Income taxes The Company accounts for income taxes in accordance with FASB SFAS No109, Accounting for Income Taxes SFAS 109. Deferred
tax assets and liabilities arise from temporary differences between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their reported amounts in the consolidated financial statements that will result in taxable or deductible amounts in future years. These
temporary differences are measured using enacted tax rates. A valuation allowance is recorded to reduce deferred tax assets to the extent that management considers it is more likely than not that a deferred tax asset will not be realized. In
determining the valuation allowance, management considers factors such as the reversal of deferred income tax liabilities, projected taxable income, and the character of income tax assets and tax planning strategies. A change to these factors could
impact the estimated valuation allowance and income tax expense. In addition, the Company is subject to examinations by taxation
authorities of the jurisdictions in which the Company operates in the normal course of operations. The Company regularly assesses the status of these examinations and the potential for adverse outcomes to determine the adequacy of the provision for
income and other taxes. Fair value of financial instruments Carrying amounts of certain financial instruments, including cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable and accounts payable trade and accrued liabilities approximate their fair value due to the relatively short
period of time between origination of the instruments and their expected realization. The fair value of the Companys long-term debt
approximates its carrying value. Financial instruments and hedge accounting The Company follows the provisions of FASB SFAS No133, Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities as amended
SFAS 133. SFAS 133 requires that all derivative instruments be recorded on the balance sheet at fair value. Changes in the fair value of the derivatives are recorded each period in current earnings or other comprehensive income,
depending upon whether the derivative is part of a hedge transaction and meets specific hedge accounting criteria. Foreign currency translation
The consolidated financial statements of Open Text are presented in U.S. dollars. In general, the functional currency of the
Companys subsidiaries is the local currency. For such subsidiaries assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are translated into U.S dollars at the exchange rates in effect at balance sheet dates and revenue and expenses are
translated at the average exchange rates prevailing during the month of the transaction. The effect of foreign currency translation adjustments not affecting net income are included in Shareholders equity under the Cumulative translation
adjustment account as a component of Accumulated other comprehensive income loss. Transactional foreign currency gains losses are included in the Consolidated Statements of Income under the line item Other income
expense. For details see Note 18 Other Income expense in the Notes to these Consolidated Financial Statements. The unrealized translation gains and losses on the Companys net investment in these subsidiaries, including
long-term intercompany advances are accumulated under the Cumulative translation adjustment account as a component of Accumulated other comprehensive income loss. 
64 Table of Contents
Restructuring charges The Company records restructuring charges relating to contractual lease obligations and other exit costs in accordance with FASB SFAS No146, Accounting for Costs Associated with Exit or Disposal
Activities SFAS 146. SFAS 146 requires recognition of costs associated with an exit or disposal activity when the liability is incurred and can be measured at fair value. The Company records restructuring charges relating to employee termination costs in accordance with FASB SFAS No112, Accounting for Post
Employment Benefits SFAS 112. SFAS 112 applies to post-employment benefits provided to employees under on going benefit arrangements. In accordance with SFAS 112, the Company records such charges when the termination benefits are
capable of being determined or estimated in advance, from either the provisions of the Companys policy or from past practices, the benefits are attributable to services already rendered and the obligation relates to rights that vest or
accumulate. The recognition of restructuring charges requires management to make certain judgments regarding the nature, timing and amount
associated with the planned restructuring activities, including estimating sub-lease income and the net recoverable amount of equipment to be disposed of. At the end of each reporting period, the Company evaluates the appropriateness of the
remaining accrued balances. Litigation The Company is currently involved in various claims and legal proceedings. Quarterly, the Company reviews the status of each significant matter and assesses its potential financial exposure. If the potential loss from any claim or legal
proceeding is considered probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated, the Company accrues a liability for the estimated loss. Net income per
share Basic net income per share is computed using the weighted average number of common shares outstanding including contingently
issuable shares where the contingency has been resolved. Diluted net income per share is computed using the weighted average number of common shares and stock equivalents outstanding using the treasury stock method during the year see Note 19
Net Income Per Share in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for more details. Share-based payment On July1, 2005, the Company adopted the fair value-based method for measurement and cost recognition of employee share-based compensation
arrangements under the provisions of Financial Accounting Standards Board FASB Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. SFAS 123 Revised 2004, Share-Based Payment SFAS 123R, using the
modified prospective transitional method. Previously, the Company had elected to account for employee share-based compensation using the intrinsic value method based upon Accounting Principles Board Opinion No25, Accounting for Stock
Issued to Employees APB 25 and related interpretations. The intrinsic value method generally did not result in any compensation cost being recorded for employee stock options since the exercise price was equal to the market price
of the underlying shares on the date of grant. Under the modified prospective transitional method, share-based compensation is recognized
for awards granted, modified, repurchased or cancelled subsequent to the adoption of SFAS 123R. In addition, share-based compensation is recognized, subsequent to the adoption of SFAS 123R, for the remaining portion of the vesting period if any
for outstanding awards granted prior to the date of adoption. Prior periods have not been adjusted and the Company continues to provide pro forma disclosure as if it had accounted for employee share-based payments in all periods presented under the
fair value provisions of SFAS No123, Accounting for Stock-based Compensation, which is presented below. 
65 Table of Contents
The Company measures share-based compensation costs on the grant date, based on the calculated fair value
of the award. The Company has elected to treat awards with graded vesting as a single award when estimating fair value. Compensation cost is recognized on a straight-line basis over the employee requisite service period, which in the Companys
circumstances is the stated vesting period of the award, provided that total compensation cost recognized at least equals the pro rata value of the award that has vested. Compensation cost is initially based on the estimated number of options for
which the requisite service is expected to be rendered. This estimate is adjusted in the period once actual forfeitures are known. Had the
Company adopted the fair value-based method for accounting for share-based compensation in all prior periods presented, the pro-forma impact on net income and net income per share would be as follows:  YearendedJune30,2005

Option for Financial Assets and Financial LiabilitiesIncluding an Amendment of FASB Statement No115 SFAS 159. SFAS 159 permits an entity to choose to measure many financial instruments and certain other items at fair
value. Most of the provisions in SFAS 159 are elective; however, the amendment to FASB Statement No115, Accounting for Certain Investments in Debt and Equity Securities, applies to all entities with available-for-sale and trading
securities. SFAS 159 is effective for the Company beginning July1, 2008. The Company is currently assessing the potential impact that the adoption of SFAS 159 will have on its financial statements. In September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No158, Employers Accounting for Defined Benefit Pension and Other Postretirement Plansan
Amendment of FASB Statements 87,88,106, and 132R SFAS 158. SFAS 158 requires an employer to recognize the over funded or under funded status of defined benefit plan and post-retirement plan other than a multi employer plan as
an asset or a liability in its statement of financial position and to recognize changes in that funded statusin the year in which the changes occur through comprehensive income. Based upon the funded status of Open Texts pension plans
the adoption of SFAS 158 has had the effect of decreasing pension liabilities by $260,000 and increasing shareholders equity by the same amount. In September 2006, the United States Securities Exchange Commission SEC issued Staff Accounting Bulletin SAB No108, Considering the Effects of Prior year Misstatements when
Quantifying Current year Misstatements, SAB 108. SAB 108 requires analysis of misstatements using both an income statement rollover approach and a balance sheet iron curtain approach in assessing materiality and provides for
a one-time cumulative effect transition adjustment. SAB 108 is effective for the Companys fiscal year 2007 annual financial statements. The adoption of SAB 108 did not have any impact on the Companys financial statements. 
66 Table of Contents
In September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No157, Fair Value Measurements, and
SFAS 157, which defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value in generally accepted accounting principles, and expands disclosures about fair value measurements. SFAS 157 does not require any new fair value
measurements, but provides guidance on how to measure fair value by providing a fair value hierarchy used to classify the source of the information. This statement is effective for the Company beginning July1, 2008. The Company is currently
assessing the potential impact that the adoption of SFAS 157 will have on its financial statements. In July 2006, the FASB issued FASB
Interpretation No48 on Accounting for Uncertain Tax Positionsan interpretation of FASB Statement No109, Accounting for Income Taxes FIN 48. Under FIN 48, an entity should presume that a taxing authority
will examine a tax position when evaluating its position for recognition and measurement; therefore, assessment of the probability of the risk of examination is not appropriate. In applying the provisions of FIN 48, there will be distinct
recognition and measurement evaluations. The first step is to evaluate the tax position for recognition by determining if the weight of available evidence indicates it is more likely than not, based solely on the technical merits, that the position
will be sustained on audit, including resolution of related appeals or litigation processes, if any. The second step is to measure the appropriate amount of the benefit to recognize. The amount of benefit to recognize will be measured as the maximum
amount which is more likely than not to be realized. The tax position should be derecognized when it is no longer more likely than not of being sustained. On subsequent recognition and measurement the maximum amount which is more likely than not to
be recognized at each reporting date will represent managements best estimate, given the information available at the reporting date, even though the outcome of the tax position is not absolute or final. Subsequent recognition, derecognition,
and measurement should be based on new information. A liability for interest or penalties or both will be recognized as deemed to be incurred based on the provisions of the tax law, that is, the period for which the taxing authority will begin
assessing the interest or penalties or both. The amount of interest expense recognized will be based on the difference between the amount recognized in the financial statements and the benefit recognized in the tax return. On transition, the change
in net assets due to applying the provisions of the final interpretation will be considered as a change in accounting principle with the cumulative effect of the change treated as an offsetting adjustment to the opening balance of retained earnings
in the period of transition. FIN 48 will be effective for the Company as of July1, 2007. The Company is currently assessing the potential impact that the adoption of FIN 48 will have on its financial statements. NOTE 3INVESTMENTS On October2, 2006, the
Company acquired all of the remaining issued and outstanding shares of Hummingbird. In view of this, the investment in the equity of Hummingbird was included as part of the cost of the acquisition of Hummingbird. For details relating to this
acquisition see Note 15 Acquisitions in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. NOTE 4CAPITAL ASSETS  As of June30, 2007 Cost

Asset retirement obligations 5,253 3,896 22,516 21,121 Pension liabilities The Company acquired a controlling interest in IXOS in March 2004. IXOS has pension commitments to employees as well as to former members of its board of directors. The actuarial cost method used in determining the
net periodic pension cost, with respect to the IXOS employees, is the projected unit credit method. The liabilities and annual income or expense of the Companys pension plan are determined using methodologies that involve various actuarial
assumptions, the most significant of which are the discount rate and the long-term rate of return on assets. The Companys policy is to deposit amounts with an insurance company to cover the actuarial present value of the expected retirement
benefits. The fair value of plan assets as of June30, 2007 was $29 million June 30, 2006 $26 million. The fair value of the pension obligation as of June30, 2007 was $29million June 30, 2006 $30 million. In
accordance with SFAS 158 the Company decreased pension liabilities by $260,000 and increased shareholders equity by the same amount. For details relating to this increase see Note 2 Significant Accounting Policies to the Notes to
Consolidated Financial Statements Asset retirement obligations The Company is required to return certain of its leased facilities to their original state at the conclusion of the lease. The Company has accounted for such obligations in accordance with FASB SFAS No143,
Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations SFAS 143. At June30, 2007, the present value of this obligation was $53 million, June30, 2006 $39 million, with an undiscounted value of $75 million, June
30, 2006 $48 million. These leases were primarily assumed in connection with the IXOS and Hummingbird acquisitions. Excess facility
obligations and acquisition related accruals The Company has accrued for the cost of excess facilities in connection with a number of
its acquisitions, including its fiscal 2007 Hummingbird acquisition. These accruals include the Companys best estimate in respect of future sub-lease income and costs incurred to achieve sub-tenancy. These liabilities have been recorded using
present value discounting techniques and will be discharged over the term of the respective leases. The difference between the present value and actual cash paid for the excess facility will be charged to income over the terms of the leases ranging
between one year to 17 years.

facility the term loan and a $750 million committed revolving long-term credit facility the revolver. The term loan was used to partially finance the Hummingbird acquisition and the revolver will be used for general
business purposes. The credit agreement is guaranteed by the Company and certain of its subsidiaries. Term loan 
The term loan has a seven year term and expires on October2, 2013 and bears interest at a floating rate of LIBOR plus 250%. The term loan
principal repayments are equal to 025% of the original principal amount, due each quarter with the remainder due at the end of the term, less ratable reductions for any prepayments made. In May 2007, the Company repaid $300 million of the
principal, which had the effect of reducing the quarterly principal payment to approximately $900,000. As of June30, 2007, the
carrying value of the term loan was $3572 million. Revolver The revolver has a five year term and expires on October2, 2011. Borrowings under this facility bear interest at rates specified in the credit
agreement. The revolver replaced a CAD $400 million line of credit the old line of credit that the Company previously had with the bank. The Company was required to terminate the old line of credit prior to executing its current
credit agreement. As of the date of termination, there were no borrowings outstanding on the CAD $400 million line of credit, nor were there any termination penalties. The revolver is subject to a stand-by fee ranging between 030% and
050%per annum depending on the consolidated leverage ratio of the Company. There are no borrowings outstanding under the revolver as of June30, 2007. Mortgage The mortgage consists of a five year mortgage agreement entered into during December 2005 with the bank.

74 Table of Contents
iimatures on January1, 2011, and iiiis secured by a lien on the Companys headquarters in Waterloo, Ontario. Interest is to be
paid monthly at a fixed rate of 525%per annum. Principal and interest are payable in monthly installments of CAD $101,000 with a final lump sum principal payment of CAD $126 million due on maturity. As of June30, 2007, the carrying values of the building and mortgage were $169 million and $137 million, respectively. Financial Instruments and Hedging Activities In
October 2006, Open Text entered into a three year interest-rate collar that had the economic effect of circumscribing the floating portion of the interest rate obligations associated with $1950 million of the term loan within an upper limit of
534% and a lower limit of 479%. This was pursuant to a requirement in the credit agreement that required the Company to maintain, from thirty days following the date on which the term loan was entered into through the third anniversary or such
earlier date on which the term loan is paid, interest rate hedging arrangements with counterparties in respect of 50% of the aggregate actual and projected principal amount of the term loan. SFAS No133 Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities SFAS 133 requires that changes in a derivative
instruments fair value be recognized in current earnings unless specific hedge accounting criteria are met and that an entity must formally document, designate and assess the effectiveness of transactions that qualify for hedge accounting.
SFAS 133 requires that written options must meet certain criteria in order for hedge accounting to apply. The Company determined that
these criteria were not met and hedge accounting could not be applied for the year ended June30, 2007. The fair market value of the collar, which represents the cash the Company would receive or pay to settle the collar, was a receivable of
approximately $380,000 as of June30, 2007, and has been included within Prepaid expenses and other current assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. For the year ended June30, 2007, interest expense in the Consolidated
Statements of Income has been reduced by $380,000, representing the change in the fair value of the collar. The Company records payments or receipts on the collar as adjustments to interest expense. The collar has a remaining term to maturity of 25
years. The Company will continue to monitor changes in interest rates periodically and will assess whether hedge accounting could
potentially be applied in future periods. NOTE 11SHARE CAPITAL, OPTION PLANS AND SHARE BASED PAYMENTS Share Capital The authorized share capital of
the Company includes an unlimited number of Common Shares and an unlimited number of first preference shares. No preference shares have been issued.

391 14,185 The Company estimates the fair value of stock options using the Black-Scholes option pricing
model, consistent with the provisions of SFAS 123 Revised 2004, Share-Based Payment SFAS 123R and SEC Staff Accounting Bulletin No107. The Black-Scholes option-pricing model was developed for use in estimating the
fair value of traded options that have no vesting restrictions and are fully transferable, while the options issued by the Company are subject to both vesting and restrictions on transfer. In addition, option-pricing models require input of
subjective assumptions including the estimated life of the option and the expected volatility of the underlying stock over the estimated life of the option. The Company uses historical volatility as a basis for projecting the expected volatility of
the underlying stock and estimates the expected life of its stock options based upon historical data. The Company believes that the
valuation technique and the approach utilized to develop the underlying assumptions are appropriate in calculating the fair value of the Companys stock option grants. Estimates of fair value are not intended, however, to predict actual future
events or the value ultimately realized by employees who receive equity awards. For the year ended June30, 2007, the
weighted-average fair value of options granted, as of the grant date, was $722, using the following weighted average assumptions: expected volatility of 46%; risk-free interest rate of 47%; expected dividend yield of 0%; and expected life of 48
years. A forfeiture rate of 5%, based on historical employee turnover rates, was used to determine the net amount of compensation expense recognized. In connection with the acquisition of Hummingbird, the Company issued a net number of 98,578 stock options to the former employees of Hummingbird in replacement of their fully vested Hummingbird stock options
replacement options. These replacement options were valued using the following weighted average assumptions: expected volatility of 47%; risk-free interest rate of 43%; expected dividend yield of 0%; and expected life of 45 years,
resulting in an approximate fair value of $730 per replacement option. Approximately $286,000 has been allocated to the cost of the Hummingbird acquisition, and the remainder will be amortized to share-based compensation cost over a vesting period
of 4years. 
78 Table of Contents
For the year ended June30, 2006, the weighted-average fair value of options granted, as of the
grant date, was $768, using the following weighted average assumptions: expected volatility of 52%; risk-free interest rate of 46%; expected dividend yield of 0%; and expected life of 52 years. A forfeiture rate of 5%, based on historical
employee turnover rates, was used to determine the net amount of compensation expense recognized. For the year ended June30, 2005,
the weighted-average fair value of options granted, as of the grant date, during the periods was $835, using the following weighted-average assumptions: expected volatility of 61%; risk-free interest rate of 32%; expected dividend yield of 0%; and
expected life of 43 years. In each of the above periods, no cash was used by the Company to settle equity instruments granted under
share-based compensation arrangements. The fair value of awards granted prior to July1, 2005 is not adjusted to be consistent with
the provision of SFAS 123R from the amounts previously disclosed, on a pro forma basis, in the audited Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in the Companys Form 10-Ks or in the notes to the unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial
Statements in the Companys Form 10-Qs, except that the unvested portion at the date of adoption is adjusted to reflect the Companys estimate of forfeitures. As of June30, 2007, the total compensation cost related to unvested stock
awards not yet recognized in the consolidated statement of income was $115million, which will be recognized over a weighted average period of approximately 2 years. As of June30, 2006, the total compensation cost related to unvested
stock awards not yet recognized in the consolidated statement of income was $92 million, which will be recognized over a weighted average period of approximately 2 years. Share-based compensation cost included in the Consolidated Statement of Income for the year ended June30, 2007 was $54 million. Deferred tax
assets of $875,000 were recorded, as of June30, 2007 in relation to the tax effect of certain stock options that are eligible for a tax deduction when exercised. The Company has not capitalized any share-based compensation costs as part of the
cost of an asset. Share-based compensation cost included in the Consolidated Statement of Income for the year ended June30, 2006 was
approximately $52 million. Deferred tax assets of $622,000 were recorded, as of June30, 2006 in relation to the tax effect of certain stock options that are eligible for a tax deduction when exercised. The Company has not capitalized any
share-based compensation costs as part of the cost of an asset. For the year ended June30, 2007, cash in the amount of $111 million
was received as the result of the exercise of options granted under share-based payment arrangements. The tax benefit realized by the Company, during the year ended June30, 2007 from the exercise of options eligible for a tax deduction was
$13 million, which was recorded as additional paid-in capital. For the year ended June30, 2006, cash in the amount of $37 million
was received as the result of the exercise of options granted under share-based payment arrangements. The tax benefit realized by the Company, during the year ended June30, 2006 from the exercise of options eligible for a tax deduction was
$865,000, which was recorded as additional paid-in capital. Employee Share Purchase Plan ESPP During the year ended June30, 2007, 38,470 Common Shares were issued under the ESPP for cash collected from employees totaling $621,000. In
addition, cash in the amount of $129,000 was received from employees that will be used to purchase Common Shares in future periods. During
the year ended June30, 2006, 281,093 Common Shares were issued under the ESPP for cash collected from employees totaling $34 million. In addition, cash in the amount of $660,000 was received from employees that was used to purchase

business enterprises, of information about operating segments, products and services, geographic areas, and major customers. The method of determining what information to report is based on the way that management organizes the operating segments
within the Company for making operational decisions and assessments of financial performance. The Companys operations fall into one
dominant industry segment, being enterprise content management software. The Company manages its operations, and accordingly determines its operating segments, on a geographic basis. The Company has two reportable segments: North America and Europe.
The Company evaluates operating segment performance based on revenues and direct operating expenses of the segment, based on the location of the respective customers. The accounting policies of the operating segments are the same as those described
in the summary of accounting policies. No segments have been aggregated. Included in the following operating results are allocations of
certain operating costs that are incurred in one reporting segment but which relate to all reporting segments. The allocations of these common operating costs are consistent with the manner in which they are allocated for the chief operating
decision maker CODM of the Companys analysis. For the years ended June30, 2007, 2006 and 2005, the Other category consists of geographic regions other than North America and Europe. Revenues from transactions
that both emanate and conclude within operating segments are not considered for the purpose of this disclosure since such transactions are not reviewed by the CODM. Goodwill and other acquired intangible assets have been assigned to segment assets based on the relative benefit that the reporting units are expected to receive from the assets, or the location of the acquired
business operations to which they relate. During the three months ended December31, 2006, the Company changed the manner in which it
measures segment income loss from adjusted operating margin to contribution margin since it believes that, in the aftermath of its Hummingbird acquisition, contribution margin is more reflective of the operating performance
of the reportable segments. There is no impact to the Companys consolidated financial statements as a result of this change. Contribution margin does not include amortization of intangible assets, depreciation, provision for recovery of special charges, other income expense, interest income expense, minority interest, and the provision for recovery of
income taxes.

Rental expense of $135 million, $113 million and $155 million was recorded during the fiscal years
ended June30, 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. The long-term debt obligations are comprised of interest and principal payments on
the Companys $3900million term loan agreement and a five year mortgage on the Companys headquarters in Waterloo, Ontario. For the purpose of calculating the interest on the $3900 million term loan, LIBOR has been assumed at
536%, which is the three-month LIBOR rate as of June29, 2007. For details relating to the term loan and the mortgage see Note 10 Long-term Debt and Financial Instruments and Hedging Activities to the Notes to Consolidated
Financial Statements. The Company does not enter into off-balance sheet financing arrangements as a matter of practice except for the use
of operating leases for office space, computer equipment and vehicles. In accordance with U.S. GAAP, neither the lease liability nor the underlying asset is carried on the balance sheet, as the terms of the leases do not meet the criteria for
capitalization. Domination agreements IXOS domination agreements On December1, 2004, the Company announced that it had entered into a domination and
profit transfer agreement the IXOS DA with IXOS. The IXOS DA came into force in August 2005 when it was registered in the commercial register at the local court in Munich. Under the terms of the IXOS DA, Open Text acquired authority to
issue directives to the management of IXOS. Also within the terms of the IXOS DA, Open Text offered to purchase the remaining Common Shares of IXOS for a cash purchase price of Euro 938per share Purchase Price which was the
weighted average fair value of the IXOS Common Shares as of December1, 2004. Additionally, Open Text has guaranteed a payment by IXOS to the minority shareholders of IXOS of an annual compensation of Euro 042per share Annual
Compensation. The IXOS DA was registered on August23, 2005. In the quarter ended September30, 2005, the Company
commenced accruing the amount payable to minority shareholders of IXOS on account of Annual Compensation. This amount has been accounted for as a guaranteed dividend, payable to the minority shareholders, and is recorded as a charge to
minority interest in the Consolidated Statements of Income. Based on the number of minority IXOS shareholders as of June30, 2007,
the estimated amount of Annual Compensation is approximately $492,000 for the year ended June30, 2007. Additionally, an amount of approximately $397,000 was paid, against previously accrued amounts, to the IXOS minority shareholders on account
of Annual Compensation for the year ended June30, 2006. Because the Company is unable to predict, with reasonable accuracy, the number of IXOS minority shareholders in future periods, the Company is unable to predict the amount of Annual
Compensation that will be payable in future years. Certain IXOS shareholders have filed for a procedure granted under German law at the
district court of Munich, Germany, asking the court to review the proposed amount of the Annual Compensation and the Purchase Price the IXOS Appraisal Procedures for the amounts offered under the IXOS DA. It cannot be predicted at this
stage, whether the court will increase the Annual Compensation and/or the Purchase Price in the IXOS Appraisal Procedures. The purchase offer made under the IXOS DA will expire at the end of the IXOS Appraisal Procedures. These disputes are a normal and probable part of the process of acquiring minority shares in Germany. The costs associated with the above mentioned
shareholder objections to the proposed fair value of the Annual Compensation and the Purchase Price are direct incremental costs associated with the ongoing step acquisitions of shares held by the minority shareholders and have been deferred within
Goodwill pending the outcome of the objections. The Company is unable to predict the future costs associated with these activities that will be payable in future periods.

Gauss domination agreements On October27, 2006, the Squeeze Out agreement with the Gauss minority shareholders was registered in the Commercial Register in the
Local Court of Hamburg. Certain shareholders have filed a special procedure in the German courts to reassess the value of the purchase price and annual compensation. The procedure is still pending and the Company is not able to determine the likely
date by which such procedure will be completed. As of December31, 2006, the Company acquired the remaining minority interest in
Gauss for approximately $856,000. The Company now owns 100% of all issued and outstanding common shares of Gauss. Guarantees and indemnifications
The Company has entered into license agreements with customers that include limited intellectual property indemnification clauses.
Generally, the Company agrees to indemnify its customers against legal claims that the Companys software products infringe certain third party intellectual property rights. In the event of such a claim, the Company is generally obligated to
defend its customers against the claim and either settle the claim at the Companys expense or pay damages that its customers are legally required to pay to the third-party claimant. These intellectual property infringement indemnification
clauses generally are subject to limits based upon the amount of the license sale. Additionally, the Companys current end-user license agreement contains a limited software warranty. The Company has not made any indemnification payments in
relation to these indemnification clauses. In connection with certain facility leases, the Company has guaranteed payments on behalf of
its subsidiaries either by providing a security deposit with the landlord or through unsecured bank guarantees obtained from local banks. The Company has not recorded a liability for guarantees, indemnities or warranties described above in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets since the maximum amount of potential future payments under such guarantees, indemnities and
warranties is not determinable. Litigation The Company is subject from time to time to legal proceedings and claims, either asserted or unasserted, that arise in the ordinary course of business. While the outcome of these proceedings and claims cannot be
predicted with certainty, the Companys management does not believe that the outcome of any of these legal matters will have a material adverse effect on its consolidated financial position, results of operations and cash flows. NOTE 14SUPPLEMENTAL CASH FLOW DISCLOSURES  Year Ended June30 2007

deductible temporary differences acquired in a business combination where a valuation allowance had been established for these assets at the date of acquisition are applied to reduce goodwill and are not included in income. During Fiscal 2007, the
recognition of $48 million June 30, 2006 $193 million in pre-acquisition tax benefits of acquired companies was recorded as an adjustment reduction to goodwill. As at June30, 2007, a valuation allowance of $1358 million June 30, 2006 $943 million has been recorded on acquired deferred tax assets

The IXOS acquisition was consummated in March 2004. In accordance with EITF 95-3, the original acquisition-related accrual for this facility was reduced by an estimate for future sub-lease income. EITF
95-3 also requires that any accretions to the original estimate, occurring one year after the date of the acquisition, be included in the determination of net income for the period in which such accretions are determined. Accordingly, the Company
has included an amount of $62 million within Special charges on account of the revision of the original estimate of sub-lease income. Impairment of
intangible assets During the year ended June30, 2007 and 2006, impairment charges of $697,000 and $10 million, respectively,
were recorded relating to a write-down of certain intellectual property in North America.The intellectual property represents the fair value of acquired technology from the Corechange acquisition which closed in the 2003 fiscal year.The
triggering event that gave rise to the impairments was a shift in the marketing and development strategy associated with the intellectual property and the Companys assessment of the acquired technology relative to its product lifecycle. The
impairments were measured as the excess of the carrying amount over the discounted projected future net cash flows. In addition, in Fiscal 2006 the Company changed its estimate of the remaining useful life of the intellectual property from four to
two years. The change in estimate was accounted for on a prospective basis. As of June30, 2007, the carrying value of the intellectual property is nil. Impairment of capital assets There were no impairment charges recorded against capital assets during the year ended
June30, 2007. During the year ended June30, 2006, impairment charges of $38 million were recorded against capital assets that
were written down to fair value, including various leasehold improvements at vacated premises and redundant office equipment. Fair value was determined based on the Companys estimates of disposal proceeds, net of anticipated costs to sell.

Controls and Procedures A Evaluation of Disclosure Controls
and Procedures As of the end of the period covered by this Annual Report on Form 10-K, our management, with the participation of the
Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, performed an evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures as defined in Rule 13a-15epromulgated under the Securities Exchange
Act of 1934, as amended the Exchange Act. Based upon that evaluation, the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that as of the end of the period covered by this Annual Report on Form 10-K, our disclosure
controls and procedures were effective to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed in our reports filed or submitted under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods
specified in the Securities and Exchange Commissions rules and forms, and that material information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate to allow
timely decisions regarding required disclosure. B Managements Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as such term is defined in Exchange Act
Rule 13a-15f, to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of our financial reporting and the preparation of our financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. Internal control
over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that ipertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company;
iiprovide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that our receipts and expenditures of are being made
only in accordance with the authorizations of our management and our directors; and iiiprovide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of our assets that could have a
material effect on our financial statements. Our management assessed our internal control over financial reporting as of June30,
2007, the end of our fiscal year. In making our assessment, our management used the criteria established in Internal ControlIntegrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Based on
our assessment, our management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of June30, 2007. Our management, including the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, do not expect that our disclosure controls or our internal control over financial reporting will prevent or detect all error or all fraud. A control system,
no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the control systems objectives will be met. The design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the
benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs. Further, because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that misstatements due to error or fraud will not occur or
that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, have been detected. These inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decision-making can be faulty and that breakdowns can occur because of simple error. Controls can also be
circumvented by the individual acts of some persons, by collusion of two or more people, or by management override of the controls. The design of any system of controls is based in part on certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events,
and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions.

Any evaluation of prospective control effectiveness, with respect to future periods, are subject to risks. Over time, controls may become inadequate because
of changes in conditions or deterioration in the degree of compliance with policies or procedures. Management has concluded that the
Companys internal control over financial reporting was effective as of the end of the most recent fiscal year. Our assessment of and conclusion on the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting did not include the internal
controls of the operations acquired from Hummingbird Ltd. on October2, 2006, which are included in our fiscal 2007 consolidated financial statements and which, in the aggregate, consisted ofapproximately 29% of total assets, as of
June30, 2007. C Attestation Report of the Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm On June20, 2007, the SEC adopted rules to require the expression of a single opinion directly on the effectiveness of internal controls over
financial reporting ICFR by the auditor in its attestation report on ICFR. Therefore, the SEC no longer requires the auditor to separately express an opinion concerning managements assessment of the effectiveness of the
companys ICFR. On July25, 2007, the SEC approved PCAOB Auditing Standard No. 5 AS 5, which replaces Auditing
Standard No. 2 AS 2 as guidance for conducting an audit of ICFR. The standard must be used for all audits of internal controls performed in conjunction with financial statement audits with fiscal years ending on November15, 2007
or later. Early adoption is permitted and encouraged for companies filing annual reports after the effective date of amended SEC rules relating to ICFR. KPMG has issued an AS 5 form of report which includes only a report on the effectiveness of
internal control over financial reporting. D Changes in Internal Controls over Financial Reporting As a result of the evaluation completed by management, in which our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer participated, management has
concluded that there were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting during our fourth fiscal quarter ended June30, 2007 that have materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over
financial reporting.  Item9B.
