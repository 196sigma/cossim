Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data. Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm The Board of Directors and Stockholders
Young Innovations, Inc. We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Young Innovations, Inc. and subsidiaries as of December 31, 2007 and 2006, and the related consolidated statements of income, stockholders equity and cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended December 31, 2007. In connection with our audits of the consolidated financial statements, we also have audited the financial statement schedule. These consolidated financial statements and financial statement schedule are the responsibility of the Companys management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated financial statements and financial statement schedule based on our audits. We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board United States. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Young Innovations, Inc. and subsidiaries as of December 31, 2007 and 2006, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended December 31, 2007, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. Also in our opinion, the related financial statement schedule, when considered in relation to the basic consolidated financial statements taken as a whole, presents fairly, in all material respects, the information set forth therein. We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board United States, Young Innovations, Inc.s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2007, based on criteria established in Internal ControlIntegrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission COSO, and our report dated March 12, 2008, expressed an unqualified opinion on the effectiveness of the Companys internal control over financial reporting. s/ KPMG LLP

March 12, 2008 23 MANAGEMENTS REPORT ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING The management of Young Innovations, Inc. is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting. The Companys internal control over financial reporting is designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Internal control over financial reporting includes policies and procedures that   
pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the Company;    
provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America;    
provide reasonable assurance that receipts and expenditures of the Company are being made in accordance with authorization of management and directors of the Company; and    
provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of assets that could have a material effect on the consolidated financial statements.  Internal control over financial reporting includes the controls themselves, monitoring and testing, and actions taken to correct deficiencies as identified. All internal control systems, no matter how well designed, have inherent limitations, including the possibility that controls can be circumvented or overridden, and misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected. Therefore, even those systems determined to be effective can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement preparation and presentation. Further, conditions in our business change over time, and, therefore, internal control effectiveness may vary over time. The Companys management assessed the effectiveness of the Companys internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2007. In making this assessment, it used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission COSO in Internal ControlIntegrated Framework. Managements assessment included an evaluation of the design of the Companys internal control over financial reporting and testing of the operational effectiveness of its internal control over financial reporting. Based on this assessment, management believes that, as of December 31, 2007, the Companys internal control over financial reporting is effective based on those criteria. 24 Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm The Board of Directors and Stockholders
Young Innovations, Inc. We have audited Young Innovations, Inc. and subsidiaries internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2007, based on criteria established in Internal ControlIntegrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission COSO. Young Innovations, Inc. and subsidiaries management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Managements Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting within Item 9A. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Companys internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board United States. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audit also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion. A companys internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A companys internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that 1 pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; 2 provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and 3 provide reasonable
assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the companys assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. In our opinion, Young Innovations, Inc. and subsidiaries maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2007, based on criteria established in Internal ControlIntegrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board United States, the consolidated balance sheets of Young Innovations, Inc. and subsidiaries as of December 31, 2007 and 2006, and the related consolidated statements of income, stockholders equity and cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended December 31, 2007, and our report dated March 12, 2008 expressed an unqualified opinion on those consolidated financial statements. s/KPMG LLP

1. 
ORGANIZATION:  Young Innovations, Inc. and its subsidiaries the Company develops, manufactures and markets supplies and equipment used by dentists, dental hygienists, dental assistants and consumers.

Export sales were less than 20% of total net sales for 2007 and less than 10% in 2006 and 2005. Sales denominated in Euros and Canadian dollars approximated 6% and 1%, respectively of total sales in 2007.   
2. 
SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES:  Principles of Consolidation The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Young Innovations, Inc. and its direct and indirect wholly owned subsidiaries. All significant intercompany accounts and transactions are eliminated in consolidation. Use of Estimates The preparation of the financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reported period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. Cash and Cash Equivalents Cash and cash equivalents include all highly liquid investments with an initial maturity of three months or less. Inventories Inventories are stated at the lower of cost which includes material, labor and manufacturing overhead or net realizable value. Inventory values are based upon standard costs which approximate historical costs, determined by the first-in, first-out FIFO method. Property, Plant and Equipment Property, plant and equipment are stated at cost. Expenditures for repairs and maintenance are charged to expense as incurred, and additions and improvements that significantly extend the lives of assets are capitalized. Upon disposition, cost and accumulated depreciation are eliminated from the related accounts, and any gain or loss is reflected in the statements of income. The Company provides depreciation using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of respective classes of assets as follows   
Buildings and improvements 
3 to 40 years 
Machinery and equipment 
3 to 10 years 
Equipment rented to others 
3 to 10 years  30 Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets Goodwill represents the excess of cost over fair value of net assets of businesses acquired. Pursuant to Statement of Financial Accounting Standards SFAS No. 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, goodwill and indefinite life intangible assets acquired in a purchase business combination are not amortized, but are instead tested for impairment at least annually in accordance with the provisions of SFAS 142. SFAS 142 also requires that intangible assets with estimable useful lives be amortized over their respective estimated useful lives to their estimated residual values, and reviewed for impairment in accordance with SFAS No. 144, Accounting for Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets. Intangible assets primarily consist of trademarks, license agreements, core technology, patents and patent applications, product formulas, and supplier and customer relationships. Trademarks
have been determined to have indefinite useful lives, and therefore the carrying value is reviewed at least annually for recoverability in accordance with the requirements of SFAS No. 142. Other intangible assets are amortized on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of the assets, generally between 5 and 40 years, and tested for impairment whenever conditions indicate that an asset may be impaired. Impairment of Long-Lived Assets The Company assesses and measures any impairments of long-lived assets other than goodwill and indefinite life intangibles in accordance with the provisions of SFAS No. 144. If facts and circumstances suggest that a long-lived asset may be impaired, the carrying value is reviewed. If this review indicates that the carrying value of the asset will not be recovered, as determined based on projected undiscounted cash flows related to the asset over its remaining life, the carrying value of the asset is reduced to its estimated fair value. The Company has not incurred any material impairments of long-lived assets during 2007, 2006 and 2005. Fair Value of Financial Instruments Financial instruments consist principally of cash, accounts receivable, notes receivable, accounts payable and debt. The estimated fair value of these instruments approximates their carrying value. Due to the short term nature of the notes receivable, book value approximates fair value. Revenue Recognition Revenue from the sale of products is recorded at the time title passes, generally when the products are shipped, as the Companys shipping terms are customarily FOB shipping point. Revenue from the rental of equipment to others is recognized on a month-to-month basis as the revenue is earned. The Company generally warrants its products against defects, and its most generous policy provides a two-year parts and labor warranty on X-ray machines. The policy with respect to sales returns generally provides that a customer may not return inventory except at the Companys option, with the exception of X-ray machines, which have a 90-day return policy. The Company owns X-ray equipment rented on a month-to-month basis to customers. A liability for the removal costs of the rented X-ray machines is capitalized and amortized over four years. Advertising Costs Advertising costs are expensed when incurred. Advertising costs were approximately $2,438, $2,142, and $2,159 for 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. Research and Development Costs Research and development costs are expensed when incurred and totaled $738, $915, and $752 for 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. Interest Expense Income, net Interest expense income, net includes interest paid related to borrowings on the Companys credit facility, as well as interest income earned on various investments and notes receivable. In 2007, 2006 and 2005, interest income totaled $407, $633 and $326, respectively, and interest expense totaled $1,516, $661 and $131, respectively. 31 Other Expense Income, net Other expense income, net includes foreign currency transaction gain/loss and other miscellaneous income, all of which are not directly related to the Companys primary business. Income Taxes The Company has accounted for income taxes under SFAS No109, Accounting for Income Taxes, which requires an asset and liability approach to accounting for and reporting income taxes. Deferred income taxes are provided for temporary differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and the tax bases of existing assets and liabilities using rates which are expected to apply in the period the differences are estimated to reverse. In 2006, the Company adopted the disclosure requirements of Emerging Issues Task Force the EITF Issue No06-3, How Taxes Collected from Customers and Remitted to Governmental Authorities Should be Presented in the Income Statement that is, gross versus net presentation for tax receipts on the face of their income statements. The scope of this guidance includes any tax assessed by a governmental authority that is directly imposed on a revenue-producing transaction between a seller and a customer and may include, but is not limited to, sales, use, value added, and some excise taxes gross receipts taxes are excluded. The Company has historically presented such taxes on a net basis. The Company adopted the provisions of FIN 48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes an interpretation of SFAS No. 109 on January 1, 2007 with no material impact to the financial statements. FIN48 requires the Company to maintain a liability for underpayment of income taxes and related interest and penalties, if any, for uncertain income tax positions. In considering the need for and magnitude of a liability for uncertain income tax positions, the Company must make certain estimates and assumptions regarding the amount of income tax benefit that will ultimately be realized. The ultimate resolution of an uncertain tax position may not be known for a number of years, during which time the Company may be required to adjust these reserves, in light of changing facts and circumstances.  Share-Based Compensation In December 2004, the Financial Accounting Standards Board FASB issued SFAS No123R, Share-Based Payment, which is a revision of SFASNo123, Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation. SFASNo123R requires companies to recognize compensation expense for all share-based payments to employees at fair value. Recognizing compensation expense using the intrinsic value based method described in Accounting Principles Board APB Opinion No25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees and disclosing the pro-forma impact of using the fair value based method described in SFASNo123 is no longer an alternative. As of January 1, 2006, the Company adopted SFAS No. 123R. The Company elected the modified prospective transition method as permitted by SFAS No. 123R; accordingly, results from prior periods have not been restated. Under this transition method, compensation cost must be recognized in the financial statements for all awards granted after the date of adoption as well as for existing stock awards for which the requisite service had not been rendered as of the date of adoption. Under the provisions of SFAS 123R, share-based compensation cost is estimated at the grant date based on the awards fair-value as calculated by an option pricing model, and is recognized as expense ratably over the requisite service period. The option pricing models require judgmental assumptions including volatility, forfeiture rates, and expected option life. If any of the assumptions used in the model change significantly,
share-based compensation expense may differ in the future from that recorded in the current period. Foreign Currency Translation The translation of financial statements into U.S dollars has been performed in accordance with SFAS No. 52, Foreign Currency Translation. The local currency for all entities included in the consolidated financial statements has been designated as the functional currency. Non-U.S. dollar denominated assets and liabilities have been translated into U.S. dollars at the rate of exchange prevailing at the balance sheet date.

ACQUISITIONS:   On July 31, 2006, the Company entered into an agreement, through its wholly-owned subsidiaries Young Microbrush, LLC and Young Microbrush Ireland Ltd., with Microbrush, Inc., a Wisconsin corporation, and Microbrush International Ltd., a Republic of Ireland private limited company, collectively, Microbrush, to acquire substantially all of Microbrushs assets related to the manufacture, development and distribution of dental products. The acquisition of U.S. purchased assets was completed on July 31, 2006. The acquisition of Irish purchased assets was completed on August 18, 2006. The Company paid approximately $32,777 in cash, including direct transaction costs, in connection with the acquisition. Of the purchase price, $3,000 was paid into an escrow account pending settlement of any indemnification claims. Pursuant to the purchase agreement, the escrow was released on January 31, 2008 in
full to the sellers. An additional $3,000 in purchase price may be paid by the Company Earnout Payments if certain performance targets are achieved by July 31, 2008. Amounts paid by the Company in future periods, if any, in connection with Earnout Payments discussed above will be accounted for as an adjustment to purchase price when the related contingencies are resolved. The acquisition further establishes the Company as a leader in the category of consumable dental products, enabling the Company to expand its product offerings in this area. The acquisition was financed through a combination of cash generated from operations as well as debt, and was accounted for as a purchase transaction. Debt incurred to finance the acquisition totaled $20,060. Upon initial allocation of the purchase price at the time of the acquisition, goodwill was determined to be $23,737. The finalization of the Microbrush purchase price allocation resulted in a $649 net decrease to goodwill consisting of a decrease of $578 related to revised estimates for intangible assets, a decrease of $345 related to restructuring accruals, an increase of $82 related to adjustments to the fair value of estimates of assets and an increase of $192 related to revised estimates of fees accrued related to the acquisition.

14. 
SHARE BASED COMPENSATION:  The Company adopted the 1997 Stock Option Plan the 1997 Plan effective in November 1997 and amended the Plan in 1999 and 2001. A total of 1,725 shares of Common Stock were reserved for issuance under this plan which is administered by the compensation committee of the Board of Directors Compensation Committee. The Company adopted the 2006 Long-Term Incentive Plan the 2006 Plan effective in May 2006. The 2006 Plan is intended to be a successor to the 1997 Plan. A total of 700 shares of Common Stock are reserved for grant under the 2006 Plan. Awards under the 2006 Plan may be stock options, stock appreciation rights, restricted stock, non-vested equity share units, and other equity awards. Any employee of the Company or its affiliates, any consultant whom the Compensation Committee determines is significantly responsible for the Companys success and future growth and profitability, and any member of the Board of Directors, may be eligible to receive awards under the 2006 Plan. The purpose of the 2006 Plan is to: a attract and retain highly competent persons as employees, directors, and consultants of the Company; b provide additional incentives to such employees, directors, and consultants by aligning their interests with those of the Companys shareholders; and c promote the success of the business of the Company. The Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors establishes vesting schedules for each option issued under the Plan. Under the 1997 Plan, outstanding options generally vested over a period of up to four years while non-vested equity shares vested over five years.
Under the 2006 Plan, outstanding options generally vest over a period of up to three years while non-vested equity shares generally vest over two, three, four and five year periods. All outstanding options expire 10 years from the date of grant under the 1997 Plan and five years from the date of grant under the 2006 Plan. Accounting for Share-Based Compensation Prior to fiscal 2006, as permitted under SFAS No. 123, Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation, the Company applied Accounting Principles Board APB Opinion No25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees, and related 38 interpretations in accounting for awards made under the Plan. No compensation cost was recognized in prior periods for the stock options granted, as exercise prices were not less than the fair value of the underlying stock on the date of grant. Compensation expense was recognized under APB 25 for restricted stock awards based on the fair market value of the stock on the date of grant. As of January 1, 2006, the Company adopted SFAS No. 123R, Share-Based Payment, which requires recognition of expense related to the fair value of stock-based compensation awards. The Company elected the modified prospective transition method as permitted by SFAS No. 123R; accordingly, results from prior periods have not been restated. Under this transition method, compensation cost must be recognized in the financial statements for all awards granted after the date of adoption as well as for existing stock awards for which the requisite service had not been rendered as of the date of adoption. Under the provisions of SFAS 123R, share-based compensation cost is estimated at the grant date based on the awards fair-value as calculated by an option pricing model, and is recognized as expense ratably over the requisite service period. The option pricing models require judgmental assumptions
including volatility, forfeiture rates, and expected option life. If any of the assumptions used in the model change significantly, share-based compensation expense may differ in the future from that recorded in the current period. The fair value of each option grant is estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option pricing model with the following weighted average assumptions

Had the Company determined employee share-based compensation cost based on a fair value model at the grant date for its stock options under SFAS 123, the Companys net earnings per share for the year ended December 31, 2005 would have been adjusted to the pro forma amounts as follows $ in thousands, except per share amounts:

No monetary consideration was paid by employees who received the non-vested equity shares for these two grants. In May 2007, the Company granted 32 shares of non-vested equity shares to its non-employee directors and a non-employee advisor. No monetary consideration was given by the non-employee directors and non-employee advisor who received the non-vested equity shares. The 32 shares vest 100% in May 2008. Until the restricted shares vest they are restricted from sale, transfer or assignment in accordance with the
terms of the agreements under which they were issued. The Company calculates compensation cost for restricted stock grants to employees and non-employee directors by using the fair market value of its Common Stock at the date of grant and the number of shares issued. This compensation cost is amortized over the applicable vesting period. The following table details the status and changes in non-vested equity shares for the year ended December 31, 2007 40

$8,972  The Company or one of its subsidiaries files income tax returns in the U.S. federal jurisdiction and various state and foreign jurisdictions. With certain exceptions, the Company is no longer subject to U.S. federal, state and local or non-U.S. income tax examinations by tax authorities for years prior to 2004. The Company adopted the provisions of FIN 48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes an interpretation of SFAS No. 109 on January 1, 2007 with no material impact to the financial statements. A reconciliation of the beginning and ending balance of unrecognized tax benefits is as follows

Balance at December 31, 2007 
$111  If recognized in future periods, $111 of the total unrecognized tax benefits as of December 31, 2007 would favorably affect the effective income tax rate. The Company is not aware of any tax positions for which it is reasonably possible that the total amounts of unrecognized tax benefits will significantly increase or decrease within the next twelve months. The Company includes interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits in income tax expense. For 2007, tax expense includes a benefit of $10 related to a net reduction in penalties and interest in the statement of income. The total amount of interest and penalties recognized related to uncertain tax provisions at December 31, 2007 was approximately $29.

$8,550  Current deferred income tax assets of $1,708 and $981 are included in other current assets as of December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively. Applicable U.S. income and foreign withholding taxes have not been provided on approximately $2,400 of undistributed earnings of the Companys foreign subsidiary at December 31, 2007. These earnings are considered to be permanently invested and, under certain tax laws, are not subject to taxes unless distributed as dividends, loaned to the Company or a U.S. affiliate, or if the Company sold its investment in the foreign subsidiary. Tax on such potential distributions would be partially offset by foreign tax credits. If the earnings were not considered permanently invested, approximately $520 of deferred income taxes would need to be provided.   
16. 
SALES OF EQUIPMENT RENTED TO OTHERS:  Periodically, customers who rent X-ray equipment from the Company elect to purchase the equipment. The Company recognizes revenue for the proceeds of such sales and records as cost of goods sold the net book value of the equipment. Net sales of equipment consistent with this practice were $1,512, $1,452, and $1,623 for 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively, and gross profit from these sales was $782, $716 and $806 for 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively.   
17. 
EMPLOYEE BENEFITS:  The Company has defined contribution 401k plans covering substantially all full-time employees meeting service and age requirements. Contributions to the Plan can be made by an employee through deferred compensation and through a discretionary employer contribution. Compensation expense related to this plan was $476, $406, and $224, for 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. The Company also offers certain healthcare insurance benefits for substantially all employees.   
18. 
RELATED-PARTY TRANSACTIONS:  The Company paid consulting fees of $50, $50 and $54, in 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively, to a corporation which is wholly owned by George E. Richmond, the Companys Chairman. The Company paid fees of $85, $89 and $123, in 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively, to a corporation which is wholly owned by George E. Richmond, the Companys Chairman, for corporate use of an aircraft owned by that corporation. In August 2007, the Company purchased 1,000 shares of its Common Stock from trusts controlled by George E. Richmond, the Companys Chairman and principal stockholder, for an aggregate purchase price of $26,000.   
19. 
EARNINGS PER SHARE:  Basic earnings per share Basic EPS is computed by dividing net income by the weighted average number of shares of Common Stock outstanding during the period. Diluted earnings per share Diluted EPS includes the dilutive effect of stock options and restricted stock, if any, using the treasury stock method. The following table sets forth the computation of basic and diluted earnings per share

COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES:  The Company leases certain office and warehouse space, manufacturing facilities, automobiles, and equipment under non-cancelable operating leases. The total rental expense for all operating leases was $893, $951, and $887 for 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. Rental commitments amount to: $578 for 2008, $296 for 2009, $181 for 2010, $71 for 2011 and $16 for 2012. The Company and its subsidiaries from time to time are parties to various legal proceedings arising in the normal course of business. Management believes that none of these proceedings, if determined adversely, would have a material adverse effect on the Companys financial position, results of operations or liquidity. The Company generally warrants its products against defects, and its most generous policy provides a two-year parts and labor warranty on X-ray machines. The accrual for warranty costs was $318 and $293 at December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively. 22. SUBSEQUENT EVENTS On January 16, 2008, the Company completed the sale of the majority of its X-ray equipment loans to a third party for approximately $3,500. As the transaction does not qualify as a sale of assets under SFAS 140 Accounting for Transfers and Servicing of Financial Assets and Extinguishment of Liabilities, the transaction will be treated as a financing and loans will remain on the Companys balance sheet. A recourse holdback pool has been set up on the limited recourse the third party buyer has on the loans. On February 4, 2008, the Board of Directors declared a quarterly dividend of $004 per share, payable March 14, 2008 to shareholders of record on February 15, 2008. On February 12, 2008, the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors issued an aggregate of 299 shares of restricted stock and options to purchase an aggregate of 375 shares of Common Stock, to certain employees. On February 28, 2008, the Company made a capital contribution of $750 to its private equity investment see footnote 4. 44

NEW ACCOUNTING STANDARDS:  In December 2007, the FASB issued SFAS141 revised 2007Business Combinations SFAS141R. SFAS141R establishes principles and requirements for how the acquirer of a business recognizes and measures in its financial statements the identifiable assets acquired, the liabilities assumed, and any noncontrolling interest in the acquiree. SFAS141R also provides guidance for recognizing and measuring the goodwill acquired in the business combination and determines what information to disclose to enable users of the financial statements to evaluate the nature and financial effects of the business combination. SFAS 141R is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2008. We are currently evaluating the potential impact, if any, of the adoption of SFAS141R on our consolidated financial statements. 45 Item 1B. Unresolved Staff Comments. None. 12 Item 2. Controls and Procedures.
Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures.
The Companys Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded, based on their evaluation as of the end of the period covered by this report, that our disclosure controls and procedures are effective to ensure that information required to be disclosed in the reports that we file or submit under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure and that the information is recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the time periods specified in the Securities and Exchange Commissions rules and forms. Managements Annual Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting.
The Companys management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as such term is defined in Exchange Act Rule 13a-15f. The Companys management assessed the effectiveness of the Companys internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2007. In making this assessment, it used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission COSO in Internal ControlIntegrated Framework. Managements assessment included an evaluation of the design of the Companys internal control over financial reporting and testing of the operational effectiveness of its internal control over financial reporting. Based on this assessment, management believes that, as of December 31, 2007, the Companys internal control over financial
reporting is effective based on those criteria. Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting.
There have been no changes in our internal controls over financial reporting that occurred during the quarterly period ended December 31, 2007 that have materially affected, or that are reasonably likely to materially affect our internal control over financial reporting. Attestation Report of the Registered Public Accounting Firm The attestation report of KPMG LLP, the Companys independent registered public accounting firm, on the effectiveness of the Companys internal control over financial reporting is set forth under Item 8 in this Annual Report on Form 10-K and is incorporated herein by reference. Item 1B. Unresolved Staff Comments. None. 12 Item 2. Directors, Officers and Corporate Governance. Directors and Executive Officers Certain information required by Item401 of Regulation S-K will be included under the caption Proposal 1: Election of Directors in our 2008 Proxy Statement, and that information is incorporated herein by reference. The information required by Item405 of Regulation S-K will be included under the caption Section 16a Beneficial Ownership Reporting Compliance in our 2008 Proxy Statement, and that information is incorporated herein by reference. Such proxy statement will be filed with the Commission within 120 days after the close of the 2007 fiscal year. A listing of and certain information about our executive officers is included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K under Item1 of Part I, and that information is incorporated herein by reference. No family relationships exist among any of the executive officers, directors or director nominees. Corporate Governance There have been material changes to the procedures by which stockholders recommend nominees to our Board of Directors. On May 8, 2007, our Board of Directors approved amendments to our Amended and Restated By-Laws modifying the advance notice requirements for stockholders who wish to nominate directors at annual meetings of stockholders or special meetings of stockholders called for the purpose of electing directors. Specifically, the advance notice requirements were amended to provide that all stockholder nominations for directors submitted by stockholders for consideration at an annual meeting must be delivered to the Companys Secretary at least 90 days, and not earlier than 120 days, before the first anniversary of the preceding years annual meeting. In the event the date of the annual meeting is advanced by more than 30 days or delayed by more than 60 days from such anniversary date, notice by
the stockholder must be delivered not earlier than 120 days prior to such annual meeting and not later than the close of business on the later of the 90th day prior to such annual meeting or the 10th day following the day on which public announcement of the date of such meeting is first made. With respect to an election of directors to be held at a special meeting of stockholders, written notice must be delivered to the Companys Secretary not later than the close of business on the 10th day following the date on which public announcement of the date of such meeting is first made. Previously, in accordance with the rules and regulations of the SEC, stockholder proposals for an annual meeting were to be received by the Company not less than 120 days before the date of the Companys proxy statement released to stockholders in connection with the previous years annual meeting. If the date of the current years annual meeting had been changed by more than 30 days from the date of the prior years meeting, then the deadline was a reasonable time before we began to print and send out the proxy materials. The Company did not have specific notice deadlines with respect to director nominations. Audit Committee The information required by Item407d4 and d5 of Regulation S-K will be included under the caption Audit Committee in the 2008 Proxy Statement, and that information is incorporated by reference herein. Code of Ethics We have adopted a Code of Ethics applicable to all employees. This code is applicable to all of our directors and employees, including our principal executive officer, principal financial officer and principal accounting officer. Our Code of Ethics is available on the Companys website at www.ydnt.com under the subheading Corporate Governance under Investor Relations. We intend to post on our website any amendments to, or waivers from, our Code of Ethics. Shareholders may request a copy of the Code of Ethics by writing to the Companys Secretary at the Companys address. 47
