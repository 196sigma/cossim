INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements Note 1. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies A summary of the
significant accounting policies applied in the preparation of the accompanying
consolidated financial statements follows Principles of Consolidation The consolidated financial
statements include the accounts of Blyth, Inc. and its direct and indirect
subsidiaries, the Company. The company consolidates entities in which it owns or controls more than
50% of the voting shares. The unowned
portion is reflected as minority interest.
Investments in companies that are not consolidated are reported using
the equity method and are recorded in other assets in the Consolidated
Balance Sheet. All significant inter-company balances and transactions have been
eliminated in consolidation. In January
2003, the FASB issued Interpretation No. 46, Consolidation of Variable
Interest Entities, an Interpretation of Accounting Research Bulletin No. 51
FIN 46. FIN 46 requires that factors
in addition to the voting interest in an entity be considered in determining
whether an entity should be consolidated.
In preparing these financial statements, the company was required
to apply the provisions of FIN 46. Certain of the Companys
subsidiaries operate on a 52 or 53-week fiscal year ending on the Saturday
nearest to January 31. European
operations maintain a calendar year accounting period, which is consolidated
with the Companys fiscal period. Estimates The preparation of
financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting
principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect
the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent
assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported
amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those
estimates. Areas of the financial
statements involving significant estimates include inventory reserves, bad debt
reserves, chargeback reserves, impairment charges, taxes, and other accrued
liabilities. Credit Concentration The Companys credit
sales are principally to department and gift stores, mass merchandisers and
distributors, which purchase the Companys products for resale. The Company performs ongoing credit evaluations
of its customers and generally does not require collateral. The Company makes provisions for estimated
credit losses. Foreign Currency Translation The Companys
international subsidiaries use their local currency as their functional
currency. Therefore, all balance sheet
accounts of international subsidiaries are translated into US dollars at the
year-end rate of exchange, and statement of earnings items are translated at
the weighted average exchange rates for the period. Resulting translation adjustments are included in accumulated
other comprehensive income loss. Gains and losses on foreign currency
transactions, which are included in income, were not material. Reclassifications Certain reclassifications
have been made in prior years financial statements to conform to
classifications used in the current year. Investments The Company makes
investments from time to time in the ordinary course of its business that may
include selected assets and product lines, long-term investments and/or joint
ventures that either complement or expand its existing business. The equity method of accounting is used to
account for investments in common stock in which the Company has the ability to
exercise significant influence over the operating and financial policies of the
investee. 43 Derivatives and Other Financial Instruments The Company applies the
provisions of Financial Accounting Standards Board Statement No. 133 SFAS
133, Accounting for Derivative and Hedging Activities and its corresponding
amendment under SFAS 138. These statements establish the accounting and
reporting standards for derivative instruments and hedging activities and
require that all derivative instruments be recorded on the balance sheet at
fair value. The Company uses forward
foreign exchange contracts to hedge the impact of foreign currency fluctuations
on certain committed capital expenditures, certain inventory purchases, Canadian
intercompany payables and certain intercompany loans. The Company does not hold
or issue derivative financial instruments for trading purposes. With regard to
commitments for machinery and equipment in foreign currencies, upon payment of
each commitment the underlying forward contract is closed and the corresponding
gain or loss is included in the measurement of the cost of the acquired
asset. With regard to forward exchange
contracts used to hedge Canadian intercompany payables and foreign purchases of
inventory, gain or loss on such hedges is recognized in earnings in the period
in which the underlying hedged transaction is settled. Gains or losses on foreign
currency forward contracts related to intercompany loans are recognized
currently through income and generally offset the transaction gains or losses
in the foreign currency cash flows which they are intended to hedge. If a hedging instrument is sold or terminated prior to
maturity, gains and losses are deferred until the hedged item is settled. However, if the hedged item is no longer
likely to occur, the resultant gain or loss on the terminated hedge is
recognized in earnings. For
consolidated financial statement presentation, net cash flows from such hedges
are classified in the categories of the cash flow with the items being hedged. Approximately $820,000 of hedge losses are
included in accumulated OCI at January 31, 2004, and are expected to be
transferred into earnings within the next twelve months. On July 10, 2003, the
Company terminated the interest rate swap agreement in relation to $500
million of our outstanding 790% Senior Notes, which mature on October 1,
2009. This termination resulted in a
deferred gain of approximately $50 million, which will be amortized over the
remaining term of the Notes. Fair Value of Financial Instruments The Companys financial
instruments include accounts receivable, accounts payable, short-term and
long-term debt. Management believes the
carrying value of these items approximates their estimated fair values, except
for long-term debt, as discussed in Note 11 to the Consolidated Financial
Statements. Cash Equivalents The Company considers all
highly liquid debt instruments purchased with an original maturity of three
months or less to be cash equivalents. Inventories Inventories are valued at
the lower of cost or market. Cost is
determined by the first-in, first-out method.
The elements of cost are primarily material, labor and overhead. Shipping and Handling The Company classifies
shipping and handling fees billed to customers in revenue, and shipping and
handling costs are classified as cost of goods sold. 44 Property, Plant and Equipment Property, plant and
equipment are stated at cost, less accumulated depreciation and amortization. Depreciation and amortization are provided
principally by use of the straight-line method for financial reporting
purposes. Leasehold improvements are
amortized over the lives of the respective leases or the service lives of the
improvements, whichever is shorter. The
Company records gains and losses from the sale of property, plant and equipment
in interest income and other. The principal estimated
lives used in determining depreciation and amortization are as follows 
Buildings

to 40 years
Leasehold improvements
5
to 10 years
Machinery and equipment
5
to 12 years
Office furniture, data processing equipment and software

Excess
of Cost Over Fair Value of Assets Acquired Prior to February 1,
2002, excess of costs of acquisitions over fair value of identifiable net
assets acquired less liabilities assumed goodwill was being amortized on a
straight-line basis over estimated lives ranging from 15-40 years. Amortization
of goodwill ceased on February 1, 2002, upon adoption of the new goodwill rules
under SFAS 142. In June 2001, the FASB
issued SFAS No. 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets. Under SFAS No. 142, goodwill and any other
intangibles deemed to have indefinite lives are no longer subject to amortization;
however, goodwill is subject to an assessment for impairment using a two-step
fair value-based test and such other intangibles are also subject to impairment
reviews, which must be performed at least annually, or more frequently if
events or circumstances indicate that goodwill or other indefinite lived
intangibles might be impaired. The Company performs its annual assessment of
impairment in the fourth fiscal quarter.
For goodwill the first step compares the fair value of a reporting unit
to its carrying amount, including goodwill. If the carrying amount of the
reporting unit exceeds its fair value, the second step is performed. The second
step compares the carrying amount of the goodwill to the fair value of the
goodwill. If fair value is less than
the carrying amount, an impairment loss is reported as a reduction to the asset
and a charge to operating expense, except at the transition date, when the loss
was reflected as a cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle. As of January 31, 2002,
Blyths Consolidated Balance Sheets reflected approximately $1081 million in
goodwill net of accumulated amortization, including $272 million related to
the Wholesale Home Fragrance segment businesses, $422 million related to the
All Other segment and $387 million related to the Wholesale Creative
Expressions segment businesses. The Company adopted SFAS 142, effective
February 1, 2002. In accordance with the new standard, Blyth ceased
amortization of goodwill and performed an assessment for impairment of its
goodwill. As a result of the impairment review, Blyth reduced the carrying
value of the goodwill related to its 1997 acquisition of the Sterno
brand by $74 million, which is
included in the All Other segment. In
addition, a recent revision of its operating and reporting segments by the
Company See Note 2, required changes in the Companys reporting units for
purposes of goodwill impairment reviews under SFAS 142, retroactive to the
February 1, 2002 adoption date of SFAS 142.
This resulted in the need to perform impairment reviews of several
additional reporting units as of February 1, 2002 and each subsequent year-end
balance sheet date thereafter. These
impairment reviews have indicated the need to record additional impairment
charges as of the February 1, 2002 adoption of SFAS 142, specifically to
write-off $209 million in goodwill associated with the 1999 acquisition of the
Gies Group and $63 million in goodwill associated with the 1999 acquisition of
the Colony Group. Both of these businesses
are components of the Wholesale Home Fragrance Segment, and the impairment
charges reduced goodwill in that segment to zero at February 1, 2002. The fair values of the Sterno Group, the
Gies Group and the Colony Group were determined through independent valuations
utilizing market-comparable analysis, as well as 45 discounted cash flow
models reflecting the expected range of future cash flow outcomes
over the life of the models. These cash flows were discounted to February 1,
2002 using a risk-adjusted discount rate.
The impairment of the Sterno Groups goodwill, which was recorded as a cumulative effect
of a change in accounting principle, had the effect of reducing net income by
$45 million after tax or $010 per share.
The impairments of the Gies Group and Colony Group goodwill, which were
not deductible for tax purposes, were, via restatement of the fiscal 2003
financial statements, also recorded as a cumulative effect of change in accounting
principle, and had the effect of reducing net income by $272 million or $058
per share. The carrying amount of goodwill on the Companys Consolidated
Balance Sheet increased approximately $54 million, from $1081 million at
January 31, 2002 to $1135 million at January 31, 2003. The change in goodwill was the result of the
acquisition of CBK See Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, which
increased goodwill by approximately $400 million, offset by the previously
discussed impairment charges, which decreased goodwill by $346 million. As of January 31, 2003,
the $1135 million in goodwill was comprised of $348 million related to the
All Other segment and $787 million related to the Wholesale Creative
Expressions segment businesses. The carrying amount of
goodwill on the Companys Consolidated Balance Sheet increased approximately
$906 million, from $1135 million at January 31, 2003 to $2041 million at
January 31, 2004. The change in goodwill
was primarily the result of the acquisitions of Miles Kimball, Kaemingk and
Walter Drake See Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, which
increased goodwill by approximately $456 million, $176 million and $254
million, respectively, together with an increase in goodwill resulting from a
foreign currency translation adjustment of approximately $20 million.
Of the $2041 million of goodwill on the balance sheet as of January 31,
2004, $348 million is related to the All Other segment, $196 million is
related to the Wholesale Home Fragrance segment, $787 million is related to
the Wholesale Creative Expressions segment and $710 million is related to the
Catalog Internet segment. 46 The following table sets
forth Blyths net income and earnings per share adjusted to exclude fiscal 2002
amortization expense related to goodwill and certain other intangibles that are
no longer being amortized and to reflect the cumulative effect of change in
accounting principle related to the adoption of SFAS 142 recorded in fiscal
2003.

47 Impairment of Long-Lived Assets We review long-lived
assets, including property, plant and equipment for impairment whenever events
or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of such an asset
may not be recoverable. Management will
determine whether there has been a permanent impairment on such assets held for
use in the business by comparing anticipated undiscounted future cash flows
from the use and eventual disposition of the asset or asset group to the
carrying value of the asset. The amount
of any resulting impairment will be calculated by comparing the carrying value
to the fair value, which may be estimated using the present value of the same
cash flows. Long-lived assets that meet
the definition of held for sale are valued at the lower of carrying amount or
net realizable value. Comprehensive Income Comprehensive income
loss includes net income loss and other comprehensive income loss. Other comprehensive income loss is
classified separately into foreign currency items, unrealized gains and losses
on certain investments in debt and equity securities and the net gains and
losses on cash flow hedging instruments.
The Company reports, by major components and as a single total, the
change in comprehensive income loss during the period as part of the
Consolidated Statements of Stockholders Equity. The
following table presents the components of the Companys accumulated other
comprehensive income loss, net of tax, for the years ended January 31, 2002,

48 Income Taxes Income tax expense is
based on pre-tax financial accounting income.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the expected tax
consequences of temporary differences between the tax basis of assets and
liabilities and their reported amounts.
The management of the corporation, along with third-party advisers,
periodically estimates the probable tax obligations of the corporation using
historical experience in tax jurisdictions and informed judgments. There are inherent uncertainties related to
the interpretation of tax regulations in the jurisdictions in which the
corporation transacts business. The
judgments and estimates made at a point in time may change based on the outcome
of tax audits, as well as changes to or further interpretations of
regulations. If such changes take
place, there is a risk that the tax rate may increase or decrease in any
period. Revenue Recognition Revenue recognition 
Revenues consist of sales to customers, net of returns and allowances. The Company recognizes revenue upon
delivery, when both title and risk of loss are transferred to the customer. Generally, sales orders
are received via signed customer purchase orders with stated fixed prices based
on published price lists. The Company
records estimated reductions to revenue for customer programs, which may
include special pricing agreements for specific customers, volume incentives
and other promotions. Should market
conditions decline, the Company may increase customer incentives with respect
to future sales. The Company also
records estimated reductions to revenue, based primarily on historical
experience, for customer returns and chargebacks that may arise as a result of
shipping errors, product damage in transit or for other reasons that can only
become known subsequent to recognizing the revenue. If the amount of actual customer returns and chargebacks were to
increase significantly from the estimated amount, revisions to the estimated
allowance would be required. In some instances, the
Company receives payment in advance of product shipments. Such advance payments occur primarily in our
direct selling and direct marketing channels and are recorded as deferred
revenue. Upon delivery of product
shipments for which advance payment has been made, the related deferred revenue
is reclassified to revenue. Most of the Companys
sales made on credit are made to an established list of customers. Although the collectibility of sales made on
credit is reasonably assured, the Company has established an allowance for
doubtful accounts for its trade and note receivables. The allowance is determined based on the Companys evaluation of
specific customers ability to pay, aging of receivables, historical experience
and the current economic environment.
While the Company believes it has appropriately considered known or
expected outcomes, its customers ability to pay their obligations, including
those to the Company, could be adversely affected by declining sales at retail
resulting from such factors as contraction in the economy or a general decline
in consumer spending. Some of the Companys
business units offer seasonal dating programs pursuant to which customers that
qualify for such programs are offered extended payment terms for seasonal
product shipments. As with other
customers, customer orders pursuant to such seasonal dating programs are
generally received in the form of a written purchase order signed by an
authorized representative of the customer.
Sales made pursuant to seasonal dating programs are recorded as revenue
only upon delivery either to the customer or to an agent of the customer
depending on the freight terms for the particular shipment and consistent with
the concept of risk of loss. The
sales price for the 49 Companys products sold
pursuant to such seasonal dating programs is fixed prior to the time of
shipment to the customer. Customers do
not have the right to return product except for rights to return that the
Company believes are typical of our industry for such reasons as damaged goods,
shipping errors or similar occurrences. The Company is not required to
repurchase products from its customers, nor does the Company have any regular
practice of doing so. The Company
believes that it is reasonably assured of payment for products sold pursuant to
such seasonal dating programs based on its historical experience with the established
list of customers eligible for such programs.
In addition, the Company minimizes its exposure to bad debts by
utilizing established credit limits for each customer. If, however, product sales by our customers
during the seasonal selling period should fall significantly below
expectations, such customers financial condition could be adversely affected,
increasing the risk of not collecting these seasonal dating receivables and,
possibly, resulting in additional bad debt charges. The Company does not make any sales under consignment or similar
arrangements. Earnings per Common
and Common Equivalent Share Earnings per common and
common equivalent share are computed based upon the weighted average number of
shares outstanding during the period, which includes outstanding options for
common stock, when dilutive. Employee Stock Option Plans The Company has elected to adopt the
disclosure only provisions of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards
SFAS No. 148, Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation Transition and
Disclosure, and continues to follow Accounting Principles Board APB opinion
No. 25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees and related interpretations
in accounting for stock options granted to its employees and directors under
the intrinsic value method.
Accordingly, no compensation expense is recorded for the stock options
issued to employees unless the option price is below market at the measurement
date. The Company does not at this time
issue stock options below market value; therefore no compensation expense has
been recorded in the financial statements.
Had compensation expense for the Companys stock options been determined
in accordance with the fair value method in SFAS No. 123, Accounting for
Stock-Based Compensation and SFAS No. 148, the Companys reported net income
and earnings per share would have been adjusted to the pro forma amounts
indicated below

Classification of Sales Incentives In November 2001, the
Emerging Issues Task Force issued EITF Issue No. 01-09, Accounting for
Consideration Given by a Vendor to a Customer/Reseller, which addresses the
accounting for consideration given by a vendor to a customer, including both a
reseller of the vendors products and an entity that purchases the vendors
products from a reseller. EITF 01-09 also codifies and reconciles related
guidance issued by the EITF including EITF Issue No. 00-25, Vendor Income
Statement Characterization of Consideration Paid to a Reseller of the Vendors
Products, and EITF Issue No. 00-14, Accounting for Certain Sales
Incentives. Effective February 1,
2002, the company adopted EITF 01-09, EITF 00-14 and EITF 00-25. These statements require that the Company
classify certain sales incentives as a reduction of net sales rather than
selling expenses. Prior year amounts
were reclassified to conform with the new presentation. Advertising and Catalog Costs The Company expenses the costs
of advertising as incurred, except the costs for direct-response advertising,
which are capitalized and amortized over the expected period of future
benefits. Direct-response advertising
relates to the Companys Miles Kimball and Walter Drake businesses and consists
primarily of the costs to produce direct-mail order catalogs that include order
forms for the Companys products. The capitalized
production costs are amortized for each specific catalog mailing over the
period following catalog distribution in proportion to revenues orders
received, compared to total estimated revenues for that particular catalog
mailing. The amortization period is
generally from three to six months and does not exceed twelve months. Deferred direct-response advertising costs
of $74 million and $0 were reported as assets at January 31, 2004 and January
31, 2003, respectively. In certain of the Companys
wholesale businesses, catalog production costs are capitalized and expensed as
the catalogs are distributed, generally over less than a twelve month
period. The Consolidated Balance Sheets
reflect $05 million and $06 million of these costs at January 31, 2004 and
2003, respectively. Note 2. Restatement Prior to January 31,
2004, the Company reported its financial results in two reporting segments, the
Candles Home Fragrance segment and the Creative Expressions segment. The Company has reevaluated its operating
segments based on the application of FASB Statement No. 131, Disclosures about
Segments of an Enterprise and Related Information SFAS 131, and determined
that the appropriate number of reportable segments should have been five during
fiscal 2004 and four during fiscal 2003 and 2002 The increase in segments in
fiscal 2004 was due to the acquisitions that were consummated in fiscal
2004. See Note 18 for further details. This revision of segments had the related
effect of requiring changes in the Companys reporting units for purposes of
goodwill impairment reviews under SFAS 142, retroactive to the February 1, 2002
adoption date of SFAS 142. This 51 resulted in the need to perform impairment
reviews of several additional reporting units as of February 1, 2002 and each
subsequent year-end balance sheet date, thereafter. These impairment reviews have indicated the need to record
additional impairment charges as of the February 1, 2002 adoption of SFAS 142,
specifically to write-off $209 million in goodwill associated with the 1999
acquisition of the Gies Group and $63 million in goodwill associated with the
1999 acquisition of the Colony Group.
Both of these businesses are components of the Wholesale Home Fragrance
Segment. The Companys fiscal 2003
financial statements have been restated to reflect the recording of these $272
million in goodwill impairment charges as part of the cumulative effect of
adopting SFAS 142 as of February 1, 2002.
There was no income tax impact for these impairment charges. A summary of the effects of the restatement on the Companys financial
statements is as follows

Pronouncements In June 2002, the FASB
issued SFAS No. 146, Accounting for Costs Associated with Exit or Disposal
Activities. This standard addresses
financial accounting and reporting for costs associated with exit or disposal
activities and nullifies EITF Issue No. 94-3, Liability Recognition for
Certain Employee Termination Benefits and Other Costs to Exit an Activity
including Certain Costs incurred in a Restructuring. This standard has been adopted by the
Company for exit and disposal activities initiated after December 31, 2002. In November 2002, the
FASB issued Financial Interpretation No. 45, Guarantors Accounting and
Disclosure Requirements for Guarantees, Including Indirect Guarantees of
Indebtedness of Others, which elaborates on the disclosures to be made by a
guarantor in its interim and annual financial statements about its obligations
under certain guarantees that it has issued. It also clarifies that a guarantor
is required to recognize, at the inception of a guarantee, a liability for the
fair value of the obligation undertaken in issuing the guarantee. The initial
recognition and initial measurement provisions of this interpretation are applicable
on a prospective basis to guarantees issued or modified after December 31, 2002
and the disclosure requirements in this interpretation are effective for
financial statements of interim or annual periods ending after December 15,
2002. The implementation of this interpretation did not have an impact on our
financial statements. In January 2003, the
Financial Accounting Standards Board FASB issued Financial Interpretation No.
46 FIN 46, Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities. FIN 46 clarifies the application of
Accounting Research Bulletin No. 51, Consolidated Financial Statements. FIN 46 requires consolidation of entities in
which the Company absorbs a majority of the entitys expected losses, receives
a majority of the entitys expected residual returns, or both, as a result of
ownership, contractual or other financial interests in the entity. Previously, entities were consolidated only
when the Company had a controlling financial interest through ownership of a
majority voting interest in an entity.
The interpretation was immediately applicable to variable interest
entities VIEs created after January 31, 2003, and to VIEs in which an
enterprise obtains an interest after that date. As originally issued, it applied in the fiscal year or interim
period beginning after June 15, 2003, for VIEs in which an enterprise acquired
a variable interest prior to February 1, 2003.
In December 2003, the FASB issued FIN 46R, which defers the effective
date for FIN 46 to the first interim or annual period ending after December 15,
2003 for VIEs created before February 1, 2003. The implementation of this standard has not had and is not
expected to have a material impact on our financial statements. In April 2003, the FASB
issued SFAS No. 149, Amendment of Statement 133 on Derivative Instruments and
Hedging Activities. This statement
amends and clarifies financial accounting and reporting for derivative
instruments, including certain derivative instruments embedded in other
contracts collectively referred to as derivatives and for hedging activities
under FASB Statement No. 133, Accounting for Derivative Instruments and
Hedging Activities. This standard is
effective for derivative contracts entered into or modified after June 30,
2003. The implementation of this
standard had no impact on our financial statements. In May 2003, the FASB
issued SFAS No. 150, Accounting for Certain Financial Instruments with
Characteristics of Both Liabilities and Equity. As originally issued, SFAS 150 is effective for mandatorily
redeemable financial instruments of public entities entered into or modified
after May 31, 2003, and for all other instruments for interim periods beginning
after June 15, 2003. In November 2003,
the FASB issued FASB Staff Position No. 150-3, Effective Date, Disclosures,
and Transition for Mandatorily Redeemable Financial Instruments of Certain
Nonpublic Entities and Certain Mandatorily Redeemable Noncontrolling Interests
under FASB Statement No. 150, which defers indefinitely the classification and
measurement provisions for certain mandatorily redeemable noncontrolling
interests associated with finite-lived subsidiaries pending further FASB
action. For other mandatorily
redeemable noncontrolling interests that were issued before November 5, 2003,
only the measurement provisions of SFAS 150 are deferred indefinitely, both for
the parent in consolidated financial statements and for the subsidiary that
issued the instruments that result in the mandatorily redeemable noncontrolling
interest, pending further FASB action.
The original implementation of SFAS 150 had no impact on our financial
statements and we do not expect the deferral provisions of FSP FAS 150-3 to
have a significant impact on our financial statements. 53 Note 4. Business
Acquisitions On April 11, 2001, the Company acquired 100% of
Midwest of Cannon Falls, Inc. Midwest, a leading Wholesale Creative
Expressions company in the seasonal decorative products and giftware industry
for approximately $610 million in cash.
The excess of the purchase price over the estimated fair value of the
net assets acquired approximated $254 million. Midwest is included in the Wholesale Creative Expressions
segment. The Consolidated Financial
Statements include the results of operations of Midwest since the date of
acquisition. On
May 10, 2002, the Company purchased all of the interests in CBK, Ltd., LLC
CBK, now known as CBK Styles, Inc., a designer and marketer of premium everyday
home dcor, for approximately $515 million in cash. The excess of the
purchase price over the estimated fair value of the net assets acquired
approximated $400 million, which will be deductible for income tax purposes
over 15 years. CBK is also included in
the Wholesale Creative Expressions segment.
The Consolidated Financial Statements include the results of operations
of CBK since the date of acquisition. On April 1, 2003, the
Company acquired 100% of the Miles Kimball Company MK, a direct marketer of
giftware, home dcor and household convenience items, premium photo albums,
frames and holiday cards under the Miles Kimball and Exposures catalog titles
for approximately $662 million in cash.
The acquisition of MK aligns with the Companys growth strategy, which
includes selected acquisitions. The
excess of the purchase price over the estimated fair value of the net assets
acquired approximated $456 million, which will not be deductible for income
tax purposes. The other intangibles acquired
consist of $161 million of trade names and trademarks, which are deemed to
have an indefinite life and will not be amortized, plus $90 million of
customer lists, which will be amortized on an accelerated basis over 12 years. Amortization expense recorded in fiscal 2004
totaled $14 million. Estimated
amortization expense for the next 5 fiscal years is as follows: $15 million, $15 million, $12 million 09 million and $09 million. The
results of operations of MK are included in the Consolidated Statements of
Earnings of the Company since April 2, 2003.
For segment reporting purposes, MK is included in the Catalog 
Internet segment. The following provides an allocation of the

54 On June 20, 2003, the Company
acquired a 100% interest in Kaemingk B.V. Kaemingk, a designer and marketer
of a wide range of premium seasonal decorations. Kaemingks product lines
feature Christmas dcor, including ornaments, lighting, trim, glassware, candles
and plush animals, as well as spring and summer decorative accents.
The acquisition of Kaemingk aligns with the Companys growth strategy,
which includes selected acquisitions.
The cash purchase price was approximately $362 million less cash acquired
of $77 million resulting in net cash paid of $285 million. Approximately $306 million of the cash
purchase price was borrowed under the Companys $200 million unsecured
revolving credit facility. The Company
also assumed Kaemingks long-term debt of approximately $144 million. The excess of the purchase price over the
estimated fair value of the net assets acquired approximated $176 million,
which will not be deductible for income tax purposes. During the quarter ended October 31, 2003, an adjustment was
recorded to reflect the final appraised value of the acquired property, plant
and equipment. In addition to the fixed
purchase price, there is contingent consideration payable in the form of a
three-year earn out provision based on a pre-defined formula related to a
multiple of earnings before interest and income taxes. The results of operations of Kaemingk are
included in the Consolidated Statements of Earnings of the Company since June
21, 2003. For segment reporting
purposes, Kaemingk is included in the Wholesale Home Fragrance segment. The following provides an

cards under the Walter Drake and The Home Marketplace catalog titles, for
approximately $538 million. The acquisition of WD aligns with the
Companys growth strategy, which includes selected acquisitions. The excess of the purchase
price over the estimated fair value of the net assets acquired approximated

The
unaudited pro forma combined results of operations are not necessarily
indicative of, and do not purport to represent, what the Companys results of
operations or financial condition actually would have been had the acquisitions
been made as of February 1, 2002. Note 5. Restructuring
and Impairment Charges The Company recorded
restructuring and impairment charges of $238 million pre-tax during fiscal
2004 of which $230 was recorded in the fourth quarter and $08 million was
recorded in the third quarter. These charges were primarily a result of ongoing
efforts by the Company to rationalize and align its Wholesale Home Fragrance
segment operations with the changing marketplace and global supply chain
requirements. The following summarizes
the components of these charges The Company recognized
pre-tax impairment losses of $84 million for long-lived assets disposed of and
$23 million for long-lived assets to be held and used, during the fourth
quarter of fiscal 2004 on certain equipment in the Companys primary North
American manufacturing facilities. The Company anticipates cost savings in the
form of reduced depreciation expense related to the assets disposed of somewhat
offset by increased depreciation due to reductions in remaining useful lives of
assets held and used. The asset
disposals resulted from significant productivity increases in recent years, as
well as product shift from candle forms such as pillars and tapers towards
filled containers, votives and tealights. 57 The Company also recorded
an impairment charge of $42 million pre-tax related to the Canterbury brand
acquired in fiscal 1997. Within its
home fragrance business, the Company acquired several consumer wholesale brands
over the past decade and is focusing its sales and marketing resources to fewer
brands. In the fourth quarter of fiscal
2004 the Company decided to discontinue the Canterbury brand. During the third and
fourth quarters of fiscal 2004 the Company recorded asset impairments of
facilities and equipment totaling $34 million pre-tax and severance payments
to employees of $05 million pre-tax related to the closure of its Hyannis,
manufacturing facility. In conjunction with the closing, the Company eliminated
43 jobs, comprised of manufacturing and management positions. This
manufacturing facility, which was the Companys smallest, is located in a busy
downtown area of Cape Cod, making transportation of raw materials and finished
products to and from the location challenging. Operations are being
consolidated into Blyths manufacturing facility in Batavia, Illinois. During the fourth quarter, the
Company recorded additional pre-tax charges of $50 million. These charges consist of $21 million
related to severance costs primarily associated with the restructuring of Blyth
HomeScents International North America and the consolidation of the Companys
Temecula, California potpourri operations, $09 million of lease termination
costs associated with the closure of five of the Companys candle outlet
stores, and $20 million of fixed asset write-downs primarily associated with
the aforementioned changes. As a
result of these restructuring activities, the Company eliminated 40 jobs,
comprised of administrative and management positions. In total, approximately
15% or $36 million of the $238 million in charges were cash charges. During the fourth quarter
of fiscal 2003, the Company recorded an impairment charge of $26 million
pre-tax as a result of putting Wax Lyrical, our UK specialty retailer, into
administrative receivership. Wax
Lyrical had cash balances of approximately $33 million, which were required to
be turned over to the receiver. Wax
Lyrical has been included in the consolidated financial statements of the
Company since fiscal 2001 during which time Wax Lyrical had annual revenues of
approximately $16 - 18 million and incurred annual operating losses of
approximately $2 - 3 million. During the fourth quarter
of fiscal 2002, the Company recorded restructuring and impairment charges of
approximately $141 million pre-tax.
The following summarizes the components of these charges The
Company recorded a charge of approximately $73 million pre-tax related to the
closure of the Companys 62nd Street Chicago facility effected to address
overall manufacturing over-capacity.
This charge includes asset impairments of facilities and equipment
totaling $67 million and severance payments to employees of $06 million. Charges
of $52 million pre-tax were recorded relating primarily to other
rationalization within Blyths North American consumer wholesale businesses and
included severance payments following several changes in management of $20
million, lease write-offs of $16 million and asset impairments of $16 million. The
remainder of the fourth quarter charges of approximately $16 million were
associated with the Companys European activities, including an asset
impairment charge of $10 million on property held for sale at one of our Gies
Group units and redundancy payments made to employees and lease exit costs at
our Colony Group in the UK. Fiscal 2002 results also
include $50 million in cost of sales charges in the fourth quarter, reflecting
the impact of marketplace conditions on the realizable value of obsolete
inventory. In addition to the fourth
quarter charges the Company recorded a $63 million pre-tax unusual charge to
cost of sales in the second quarter of fiscal 2002 relating to the revaluation
of US mass market inventory, due in large part to Wal-Marts change to a
private label candle program. 58 The following is a

Note 6. Assets Held
for Sale During the fourth quarter of
fiscal 2004, the Company decided to divest of one of its business units in the
Wholesale Creative Expressions segment through a sale to the business units
senior management. Therefore the assets
of this business unit are classified as assets held for sale in the Companys
Consolidated Balance Sheet as of January 31, 2004. The assets held for sale related to this business divestiture are
comprised principally of accounts receivable of $3 million, inventory of $3
million and property, plant and equipment of $2 million. The operating results related to this
business unit were immaterial to the consolidated operating results of the
Company. On April 6, 2004 the Company
sold the business to the units management and associated investors for $10
million in cash. There is an additional $1
million classified as assets held for sale in the Consolidated Balance Sheet as
of January 31, 2004 related to the Hyannis, MA manufacturing facility as
discussed in Note 5. The amount classified as assets
held for sale in the Consolidated Balance Sheet as of January 31, 2003 related
to property located in Thomasville, GA, which was sold during fiscal 2004 at an
amount approximately equal to the assets carrying value. Note 7. Inventories The major components of

In July 1995, the Company
privately placed $250 million aggregate principal amount of 754% Senior Notes
due 2005. As of January 31, 2004, $71
million of principal remained outstanding.
Such senior notes contain, among other provisions, requirements for
maintaining certain financial ratios and net worth. At January31, 2004, the Company was in compliance with such
provisions. Payment on the notes
commenced in June 1999 and annual installments of principal and interest are
required to be paid through June 2005. In May 1999, the Company
filed a shelf registration statement for issuance of up to $2500 million in
debt securities with the Securities and Exchange Commission. On September 24, 1999, the Company issued
$1500 million of 790% Senior Notes due October 1, 2009 at a discount of
approximately $14 million, which is being amortized over the life of the
notes. Such notes contain, among other
provisions, restrictions on liens on principal property or stock issued to
collateralize debt. At January 31,
2004, the Company was in compliance with such provisions. Interest is payable semi-annually on April 1
and October 1. On October 20, 2003, the
Company issued $1000 million, 550% Senior Notes due on November 1, 2013 at a
discount of approximately $02 million, which is being amortized over the life
of the notes. Such notes contain
provisions and restrictions similar to those in the 790% Senior Notes. At January 31, 2004, the Company was in
compliance with such covenants.
Interest on the notes will accrue from October 23, 2003 and will be
payable semiannually in arrears on May 1 and November 1 of each year,
commencing May 1, 2004. The notes may
be redeemed in whole or in part at any time at a specified redemption
price. The proceeds of the debt
issuance will be used for general corporate purposes, which may include
repayment of certain debt. The Company has a $200
million unsecured revolving credit facility, which matures on August 5, 2005
the Credit Facility. The Company
has the ability to increase the Credit Facility, under certain circumstances,
by an additional $50 million. The
Credit Facility may be used for general corporate purposes, which includes
funding for strategic acquisitions and seasonal working capital needs. The Credit Facility contains, among other
provisions, requirements for maintaining certain financial ratios including,
among others, a minimum level of net worth and a maximum level of
leverage. The Credit Facility also
imposes limitations on, among other things, certain payments, the imposition of
liens on our assets, indebtedness that may be incurred by our subsidiaries,
investments we may make and sales of our assets. At January 31, 2004, the Company was in compliance with such
covenants. Amounts outstanding under
the Credit Facility bear interest, at the Companys option, at JPMorgan Chase
Banks prime rate 40% at January 31, 2004 or at the Eurocurrency rate plus a
credit spread ranging from 0525% to 15%, calculated on the basis of a
combination of the Companys senior unsecured long-term debt rating and the
Companys usage of the Credit Facility.
On January 31, 2004, $32 million letters of credit were outstanding
under the Credit Facility. At
January 31, 2004, Miles Kimball had approximately $104 million of long-term
debt outstanding under a real estate mortgage note payable to John Hancock Life
Insurance Company, which matures June 1, 2020. Under the terms of the note,
payments of principal and interest are required monthly at a fixed interest
rate of 789%. At December 31, 2003,
Kaemingk had approximately $86 million of long-term debt outstanding under six
loans with ING Bank N.V. at a weighted average interest rate of 58%. The bank loans have maturity dates ranging
from 2005 through 2020. The loans are
collateralized by certain real estate and equipment owned by Kaemingk. 61 At January 31, 2004, CBK
had $46 million of long-term debt outstanding under an Industrial Revenue Bond
IRB, which matures on January 1, 2025.
The bond is backed by an irrevocable letter of credit issued by La Salle
Bank National Association. The loan is
collateralized by certain of CBKs assets.
The amount outstanding under the IRB bears interest at short-term floating
rates, which equaled a weighted average interest rate of 12% at January 31,
2004. Maturities under debt obligations for the fiscal years ending January
31 are as follows In

The
estimated fair value of the Companys $2803 million and $1691 million total
long-term debt including current portion at January 31, 2004 and 2003 was
approximately $2904 million and $1916 million, respectively. The fair value is determined by quoted
market prices, where available, and from analyses performed by investment
bankers using current interest rates considering credit ratings and the
remaining terms to maturity. 62 Note 12.
Employee Benefit Plans Substantially all employees of Miles Kimball are covered by the Miles
Kimball Company Retirement Plan the Plan.
This non-contributory, defined benefit retirement plan provides benefits
based on years of service and employee compensation for specified periods. When the Company acquired Miles Kimball on
April 1, 2003, a decision was made to cease the accrual of benefits for all
Plan participants, except to the extent that a benefit accrual is required to
comply with Section 416 of the Internal Revenue Code. The Plan was frozen effective May 31, 2003. All vested benefits that have been accrued
as of May 31, 2003 will continue to be held for participants under the terms of
the Plan. The following provides a

The Plans assets at January 31,
2004 consist of 715% equity securities, 268% fixed income securities and 17%
of cash equivalents. 63 The Company has defined
contribution employee benefit plans in both the United States and certain of
its foreign locations, covering substantially all eligible non-union
employees. Contributions to all such
plans are principally at the Companys discretion except for the Section 401k
Company matching contributions, which became guaranteed effective April 1, 2002. The Gies Group contributes to a Swedish
government-sponsored retirement system, which provides retirement benefits to
certain of its employees. The Company
has a supplemental pension benefit agreement with one of its key corporate
executives. Benefits pursuant to the
agreement will be provided by a purchased annuity insurance policy. Total expense related to all defined
contribution plans for the years ended January 31, 2002, 2003 and 2004 was $38
million, $50 million and $60 million, respectively. Note 13.
Commitments and Contingencies The Company utilizes
operating leases for a portion of its facilities and equipment. Generally, the leases provide that the
Company pay real estate taxes, maintenance, insurance and other occupancy
expenses applicable to leased premises.
Certain leases provide for renewal for various periods at stipulated
rates. The minimum future rental commitments under operating leases are as

Rent expense for the
years ended January 31, 2002, 2003 and 2004 was $216 million, $260 million
and $212 million, respectively. The Company leases
certain office and warehouse space used in its businesses in the Wholesale
Creative Expressions segment from related parties. Under the terms of the leases, the Company is responsible for all
real estate taxes, maintenance and insurance costs. The lease rates were determined based on market rates for
comparable property at the time of entering into the contract. At January 31, 2004 the total future lease
commitments under the related party leases were approximately $32 million and
the leases expire on various dates through fiscal 2008. The Company has
contingent liabilities that have arisen in the ordinary course of its business,
including pending litigation. The
Company believes the outcome of these matters will not have a material adverse
effect on its consolidated financial position, results of operations, or cash
flows. On June 2, 2003, the
parties agreed in open court to settle and resolve all matters involving or in
any way relating to the previously reported legal proceedings by and between
the Company and its wholly-owned subsidiary, Endar Corp., on the one hand, and
Ennio Racinelli, Darlene Racinelli and others, on the other hand, by means of a
written settlement and release agreement, without any payment by any
party. On August 25, 2003, the case was
dismissed by the Riverside Superior Court. The Company has entered
into an employment agreement with its Chairman and CEO, Mr. Robert Goergen,
dated as of August 1, 2000, as amended by Amendment No. 1 dated as of June 15,
2002 and Amendment No. 2 dated as of March 31, 2004 sometimes herein referred
to as agreement or employment agreement.
Pursuant to the employment agreement, upon the death of both Mr. Goergen
and his spouse, the Company will, upon the demand of the estate of either Mr.
Goergen or his spouse, buy back from such estate up to 7,500,000 shares of
Company Common Stock within 90 days of such demand at the fair market value
thereof as defined in the employment agreement or register the public offer
and sale by such estate of up to 7,500,000 shares of Company Common Stock. 64 In connection with the
employment agreement, the Company and Mr. Goergen entered into a registration
rights agreement relating to the registration of up to 7,500,000 shares of
Company Common Stock as described above in the event that the Company chooses
not to purchase such shares upon the death of both Mr. Goergen and his
spouse. There is no specified effective
date or stock price requirement in the agreements. The Company will not be obligated to purchase or register such
shares, notwithstanding the death of both Mr. Goergen and his spouse, if the
survivors estate, or his or her beneficiaries, as the case may be, can then
sell all of the shares of the Company Common Stock owned by them without
registration. The Company engaged
independent consultants to perform a valuation to determine the fair value of
the potential obligation under the share buy back provision in Mr. Goergens
employment agreement. The results of the
valuation indicated that the current value of the buy back provision was
deminimus and therefore no liability has been recorded. Note 14. 401k and Profit Sharing Plan During the third quarter
of fiscal 2004, the Company became aware of an issue involving its 401k and
profit sharing plan. This issue arose
effective April 1, 2002 when the Company amended the plan to allow participants
to direct voluntary contributions to be invested in the Companys common stock,
and to permit other investments in the plan to be transferred into the
Companys common stock. These
amendments may have caused the continued operation of the plan since April 1,
2002 to be deemed to be an offering of securities that should have been
registered under the Securities Act of 1933
the 1933 Act. If interests
should have been registered, the failure of the Company to register interests
in the plan may entitle participants to remedies under the 1933 Act, including
rescission or damages. The Company
ceased allowing participants to make new investments in Company common stock
effective October 17, 2003. The Company
has elected to adopt the so-called restorative approach with respect to
persons who invested in the Plan on or after April 1, 2002 and on or before
October 17, 2003, the last day on which participants in the Plan could make
investments in the Company Stock Fund.
Under the restorative approach the Company will make additional
contributions to the Plan accounts of 179 participants in the total amount of
approximately $3,000. In the case of a
limited number of former participants, payments in the amount of contributions
that were due to be made to such participants Plan accounts will be mailed
directly to such former participants. Note 15. Guarantees From time to time, the Company is
party to agreements under which it may be obligated to indemnify a third party
with respect to certain matters.
Typically, these obligations arise as a result of leases entered into by
the subsidiaries, under which Blyth agrees to indemnify a third party against
losses arising from a breach of representations related to lease obligations
assumed. In these circumstances,
payment by Blyth is conditioned on the other party making a claim pursuant to
the procedures specified in the lease.
These procedures generally allow Blyth to challenge the other partys
claims. In addition, Blyths
obligations under these agreements may be limited in terms of time and amount.
Historically, payments made by Blyth under these arrangements have not had a
material effect on the business, financial condition or results of
operations. Blyth believes that if it
were to incur a loss in any of these matters, such loss would not have a
material effect on the Companys business, financial condition or results of
operations. The maximum potential
amount of future payments due under these lease arrangements, approximate $225
million. These amounts are included as
part of the Companys consolidated lease commitments as reported in Note 13,
Commitments and Contingencies. 65 Note 16. Income

66 The valuation allowance
relates to certain non-US tax loss carryforwards, for which the Company
believes, due to various limitations in these foreign jurisdictions, it is more
likely than not that such benefits will not be realized and to a US loss
carryforward where the benefit is limited by the US tax regulations. The increase in the valuation allowance from
the prior year is due principally to the net operating loss received as part of
a recent US acquisition. At January 31,
2004, the Company has a $164 million net operating loss carryforward, which
consists of approximately $79 million of federal net operating loss that
expires on January 31, 2023 and foreign net operating losses of $85 million,
which have an indefinite expiration. As of January 31, 2004,
undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries considered permanently invested
for which deferred income taxes have not been provided were approximately $689
million. A

Note 17. Stock
Based Compensation At January 31, 2004, the Company had three
stock-based compensation plans, which are described below. The Companys Amended and
Restated 1994 Employee Stock Option Plan the Employee Option Plan, provides
for the grant to officers and employees of both incentive stock options and
stock options that are non-qualified for Federal income tax purposes. The total number of shares of common stock
for which options may be granted pursuant to the Employee Option Plan shall not
exceed the sum of 2,880,000 shares plus an additional number of shares, which
were to be added on February 1, 2001, and each anniversary thereof during the
term of Employee Option Plan, equal to the lesser of x 075% of the total
outstanding shares of common stock of the Company on the applicable anniversary
date and y 600,000 shares up to a maximum of 5,280,000 shares. The exercise price of
incentive stock options granted under the Employee Option Plan may not be less
than 100% of the fair market value of the common stock at the time of grant,
and the term of any option may not exceed 10 years. Options generally become exercisable over a five-year
period. With respect to any employee
who owns stock representing more than 10% of the voting power of the
outstanding capital stock of the Company, the exercise price of any incentive
stock option may not be less than 110% of the fair market value of such shares
at the time of grant, and the term of such option may not exceed five
years. On April 1, 2003, the Board of
Directors of the Company unanimously approved an amendment to the Employee Option
Plan providing that no awards will be made under such plan after May 31, 2003. The Company has also
adopted the Amended and Restated 1994 Stock Option Plan for Non-Employee
Directors the Non-Employee Director Plan.
A total of 270,000 shares of common stock may be issued through the exercise
of options granted pursuant to the Non-Employee Director Plan. No option may be granted under the
Non-Employee Director Plan after May 31, 2003. 67 Options granted pursuant
to the Non-Employee Director Plan become exercisable as follows: each Initial
Grant vests over a two year period at the rate of 50% on each anniversary of
the date of grant and each Annual Grant vests in full on the sooner of x the
first anniversary of the date of the grant or y the date of the next Annual
Meeting of shareholders of Blyth. On
April 1, 2003, the Board of Directors of the Company unanimously approved an
amendment to the Non-Employee Director Plan providing that no awards will be
made under such plan after May 31, 2003. On April 1, 2003, the Board of Directors of the Company unanimously
approved the adoption of the 2003 Long-Term Incentive Plan the 2003 Plan
and the stockholders approved the 2003 Plan on June 4, 2003. The 2003 Plan provides for grants of incentive
and nonqualified stock options, stock appreciation rights, restricted stock,
performance shares, performance units, dividend equivalents and other stock
unit awards to officers and employees.
The 2003 Plan also provides for grants of nonqualified stock options to
directors of the Company who are not, and who have not been during the
immediately preceding 12-month period officers or employees of the Company or
any of its subsidiaries. Currently, each
non-employee director who is elected to office for the first time is, upon such
date, automatically granted an option to acquire 10,000 shares of common stock
Initial Grant. Each non-employee
director who is in office with at least six months of service receives, on the
date of the Annual Meeting of Shareholders of Blyth beginning in June 2003 and
thereafter, an option to acquire 5,000 shares of common stock Annual
Grant. The price of shares that may
be purchased upon exercise of an option is the fair market value of the common
stock on the date of grant. On
March 31, 2004, the Board of Directors of the Company unanimously approved
Amendment No. 1 to the 2003 Plan. If
the stockholders approve Amendment No. 1 to the 2003 Plan at the Annual Meeting
of Stockholders on June 24, 2004 the 2004 Annual Meeting, effective as of
such approval, non-employee directors will no longer receive formulaic option
grants. Instead, annual awards will be
determined by the Companys full Board of Directors, subject to an annual limit
of awards of 5,000 shares of Common Stock or share equivalents for new
non-employee directors and 2,500 shares of Common Stock or share equivalents
for continuing non-employee directors.
At the 2004 Annual Meeting, if the stockholders approve Amendment No. 1
to the Long-Term Incentive Plan, each non-employee director with at least six
months service will be granted 1,500 restricted stock units vesting in two
equal installments beginning on the first anniversary of the date of grant
instead of the Annual Grant. Transactions involving
stock options are summarized as follows

members of the Companys management have been granted phantom stock
appreciation rights SARs. These SARs vest in equal installments as of the
end of each fiscal year and are subject to a term as specified in each
individual agreement. Upon exercise of
the SARs, the participant is entitled to receive a payout amount as defined in
the agreement. At the expiration of the
term, any outstanding portion of vested SARs is deemed to be exercised, and the
participant is entitled to a payout.
The Companys Consolidated Balance Sheets reflect a liability for these
SARs in the amount of $05 million and $02 million at January 31, 2004 and
2003, respectively. Note 18. Segment

Candles Home Fragrance segment and the Creative Expressions segment. The Company has reevaluated its operating
segments based on the application of FASB Statement No. 131, Disclosures about
Segments of an Enterprise and Related Information, and determined that the
appropriate number of reportable segments should have been five in fiscal 2004
and four in fiscal 2003 and 2002 The increase in segments in fiscal 2004 was
due to the acquisitions that were consummated in fiscal 2004. The Companys financial statement footnotes
have been restated to reflect the revised segments. The Companys reportable and operating segments are based on
financial information regularly evaluated by the chief operating decision maker
in determining resource allocation and assessing performance. Revenues are not reported by product or

Loss In July 2003, the
Companys manufacturing facility located in Monterrey, Mexico was destroyed by
fire. Products manufactured at this
leased facility were primarily for the North American mass market. Customer service disruptions were minimal as
other Company facilities and third party suppliers met the production
requirements and are expected to meet production requirements for the
foreseeable future. The Company has
decided not to rebuild the Monterrey facility.
The loss of fixed assets and inventory totaled approximately $80
million. The Company incurred
additional costs of $19 million through January 31, 2004, primarily for the
additional production costs of manufacturing product at different
facilities. Some of these costs remain
in ending inventory at January 31, 2004.
The Company is insured for losses related to this fire and has received
$76 million in insurance proceeds as of February 6, 2004. 72 Note 22. Selected
