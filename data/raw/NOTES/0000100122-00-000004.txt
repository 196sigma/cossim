See Item 14, page 88, for a list of the Consolidated
Financial Statements which are included in the following
pages.  See Note 16 of Notes to Consolidated Financial
Statements. INDEPENDENT AUDITORS' REPORT UniSource Energy Corporation and its Stockholders
Tucson Electric Power Company We have audited the accompanying consolidated statements of
income, changes in stockholders' equity, and cash flows of
UniSource Energy Corporation and its subsidiaries the Company
for the year ended December 31, 1997. We have also audited the
accompanying consolidated statements of income, changes in
stockholder equity, and cash flows of Tucson Electric
Power Company and its subsidiaries TEP for the year ended
December 31, 1997. These financial statements are the
responsibility of the Company and TEP management. Our
responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial
statements based on our audits.
We conducted our audits in accordance with generally
accepted auditing standards. Those standards require that
we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance
about whether the financial statements are free of material
misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis,
evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the
financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the
accounting principles used and significant estimates made by
management, as well as evaluating the overall financial
statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide
a reasonable basis for our opinion.
In our opinion, such consolidated financial statements
present fairly, in all material respects, the results of
operations and cash flows of the Company and TEP for the
year ended December 31, 1997 in conformity with generally
accepted accounting principles. Deloitte & Touche LLP

respect to 1997 in Note 3 and in Note 11        Report of Independent Accountants To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of
UniSource Energy Corporation and to the
Board of Directors and Stockholder of
Tucson Electric Power Company In our opinion, the accompanying consolidated balance sheets

consolidated statements of income, of cash flows, and of
changes in stockholders' equity present fairly, in all
material respects, the financial position of UniSource
Energy Corporation and its subsidiaries the Company and
Tucson Electric Power Company and its subsidiaries TEP at
December 31, 1999 and 1998, and the results of their
operations and their cash flows for the years then ended in
conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in
the United States. These financial statements are the
responsibility of the Company and TEP management; our
responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial
statements based on our audits. We conducted our audits of
these statements in accordance with auditing standards
generally accepted in the United States, which require that
we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance
about whether the financial statements are free of material
misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis,
evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the

used and significant estimates made by management, and
evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We
believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for the
opinion expressed above. The consolidated financial
statements of the Company and TEP as of December 31, 1997
and for the year then ended were audited by other
independent accountants whose report dated February 23,
1998, except as to the information with respect to 1997 in
Notes 3 and 11 which is as of March 11, 1999, expressed an
unqualified opinion on those statements. PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
NOTE 1. NATURE OF OPERATIONS AND SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
- 
NATURE OF OPERATIONS
UniSource Energy Corporation UniSource Energy is an exempt holding
company under the Public Utility Holding Company Act. UniSource Energy has no
significant operations of its own, but holds the stock of Tucson Electric
Power Company TEP and Millennium Energy Holdings, Inc. Millennium. TEP, a
regulated public utility incorporated in Arizona since 1963, is UniSource
Energy largest operating subsidiary and represents substantially all of
UniSource Energy assets. Millennium holds the energy-related businesses
described in Note 4.
TEP generates, transmits and distributes electricity. TEP serves retail
customers in a 1,155 square mile area in Southern Arizona. TEP also sells
electricity to other utilities and power marketing entities primarily located
in the Western United States. Approximately 60% of TEP work force is
subject to a collective bargaining unit. The collective bargaining agreement
in place at December 31, 1999 terminates on January 6, 2003.
BASIS OF PRESENTATION
On January 1, 1998, TEP and UniSource Energy completed a transaction by
exchanging all the outstanding common stock of TEP on a share-for-share basis
for the common stock of UniSource Energy. Following the share exchange, in
January 1998 TEP transferred the stock of Millennium to UniSource Energy for a
$95 million ten-year promissory note from UniSource Energy. Approximately $25
million of this note represents a gain to TEP. TEP has not recorded this
gain. Instead, this gain will be reflected as an increase in TEP common
stock equity when UniSource Energy pays the principal portion of the note. In
accordance with the ACC order authorizing the formation of the holding
company, the note bears interest at 978% payable every two years beginning
January 1, 2000.  In 1999, UniSource Energy paid TEP $19 million for the
interest owed under this note.
UniSource Energy consolidated financial statements include the
financial results of operations of UniSource Energy and its wholly owned
subsidiaries as if UniSource Energy current holding company structure had
existed in all periods shown. For periods prior to January 1998, UniSource
Energy operations and those of TEP are the same.
UniSource Energy and TEP use the following three methods to report
investments in their subsidiaries or other companies - Consolidation: When we own a majority of the voting stock of a subsidiary,
we combine the accounts of the subsidiary with our accounts. We eliminate
intercompany balances and transactions when we combine these accounts.
- The Equity Method: We use the equity method to report corporate joint
ventures, partnerships, and affiliated companies when we hold a 20% to 50%
voting interest or we have the ability to exercise significant influence over
the operating and financial policies of the investee company. Under the
equity method, we report   -- Our interest in the equity of an entity as an investment on our balance
sheet; and
-- Our percentage share of the net income loss from the entity as other
income in our income statements.
- The Cost Method: We use the cost method when we hold less than a 20% voting
interest in an investment. Under the cost method, we report our investment at
cost on our balance sheet.
All non-utility operating transactions are included in the Other Income
Deductions section of the income statements.
USE OF ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES
Management makes estimates and assumptions when preparing financial
statements under Generally Accepted Accounting Principles GAAP. These
estimates and assumptions affect - A portion of the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the dates of
the financial statements;
- Our disclosures regarding contingent assets and liabilities at the dates of
the financial statements; and
- A portion of the reported revenues and expenses during the financial
statement reporting periods.
Because these estimates involve judgments, the actual amounts may differ from
the estimates.
REGULATION
The Arizona Corporation Commission ACC and the Federal Energy
Regulatory Commission FERC regulate portions of TEP utility accounting
practices and electricity rates. TEP generally uses the same accounting
policies and practices used by unregulated companies for financial reporting
under GAAP. However, sometimes these principles, such as FAS 71, require
special accounting treatment for regulated companies to show the effect of
regulation. These effects are described in Note 2.
TEP UTILITY PLANT
We report TEP utility plant on our balance sheets at its original cost.
Utility plant includes - Material and labor,
- Contractor costs,
- Construction overhead costs where applicable, and
- An Allowance for Funds Used During Construction AFUDC or capitalized
interest.
AFUDC reflects the cost of financing construction projects with borrowed
funds and equity funds. The component of AFUDC attributable to borrowed funds
is included as a reduction of Other Interest Expense on the income statement.
The equity component is included in Other Income Deductions. In 1999, 1998
and 1997, we imputed the cost of capital on construction expenditures at
704%, 630% and 555%, respectively, to reflect the cost of using borrowed
and equity funds to finance construction.
Upon discontinuance of FAS 71 to our generation operations effective
November 1, 1999, as described in Note 2, we complied with Statement of
Financial Accounting Standard No. 34, Capitalization of Interest Cost. FAS
34 replaces the previous AFUDC calculation for generation-related construction
projects and provides guidance on calculating the costs during construction of
debt funds used to finance our construction projects.
Depreciation
We compute depreciation for owned utility plant on a straight-line basis
at rates based on the economic lives of the assets. These rates are
authorized by the ACC and averaged 368%, 353% and 344% in 1999, 1998 and
1997, respectively. The economic lives for generation plant are based on
remaining lives. The economic lives for transmission plant, distribution
plant, general plant and intangible plant are based on average lives. The
rates also reflect estimated removal costs, net of estimated salvage value.
Minor replacements and repairs are expensed as incurred. Retirements of
utility plant, together with removal costs less salvage, are charged to
accumulated depreciation.
TEP UTILITY PLANT UNDER CAPITAL LEASES
TEP financed the following generation assets with leases - Springerville Common Facilities,
- Springerville Unit 1,
- Springerville Coal Handling Facilities, and
- Irvington Unit 4.
Under GAAP, these leases qualify as capital leases. However, for ACC
rate-making purposes, these leases have been treated as operating leases with
recovery as if rent payments were made in equal amounts annually during the
lease term. We recorded lease expense interest and depreciation on a basis
which reflected the rate-making treatment for periods prior to November 1,
1999, the date our generation operations became deregulated. We deferred the
differences between GAAP capital lease accounting used by unregulated
companies and the ACC rate-making method used by us prior to November 1, 1999.
See Deferred Lease Expense and Income Statement Impact of Applying FAS 71 in
Note 2. We describe the lease terms in Capital Lease Obligations in Note 6.
The following table shows the amount of lease expense incurred for these
four leases and TEP remaining generation-related leases.

LONG-TERM DEBT
We defer all costs related to the issuance of long-term debt. These
costs include underwriters' commissions, discounts or premiums, and other
costs such as legal, accounting and regulatory fees and printing costs. We
amortize these costs over the life of the debt.
Prior to November 1, 1999, gains and losses on debt that we retired
before maturity were amortized over the remaining original life of the debt to
interest expense. Effective November 1, 1999, we recognize gains and losses
on reacquired debt associated with the generation portion of TEP operations
as incurred. We reclassified any remaining generation-related unamortized
gains and losses on reacquired debt at November 1, 1999, which had been
included in Other Regulatory Assets in our balance sheets, to the Transition
Recovery Asset. See Note 2. We continue to defer and amortize the gains and
losses on reacquired debt associated with TEP regulated operations to
interest income or expense over the remaining life of the original debt.
UTILITY OPERATING REVENUES
We record utility operating revenues when we deliver electricity to
customers. Operating revenues include unbilled revenues which are earned
service has been provided but not billed by the end of an accounting period.
FUEL COSTS
Fuel inventory, primarily coal, is recorded at weighted average cost.
TEP uses full absorption costing. Under full absorption costing, all costs
incurred in the production process are included in the cost of the inventory.
Examples of these costs are direct material, direct labor and overhead costs.
INCOME TAXES
We are required by GAAP to report some of our assets and liabilities
differently for our financial statements than we do for income tax purposes.
The tax effects of differences in these items are reported as deferred income
tax assets or liabilities in our balance sheets. We measure these assets and
liabilities using income tax rates that are currently in effect.
See Note 2 for discussion of the following income tax items - Income Taxes Recoverable Through Future Revenues
- Deferred Investment Tax Credits Regulatory Liability
The income tax benefits included in Other Income Deductions in the 1997
income statements primarily resulted from the recognition of a portion of the
net operating loss carryforwards. See Note 10.
We allocate income taxes to the subsidiaries based on their taxable
income and deductions used in the consolidated tax return.
EMISSION ALLOWANCES
Emission Allowances are issued by the EPA and each permits emission of
one ton of sulfur dioxide. These allowances can be sold. Prior to November
1, 1999, based on expected future regulatory treatment, TEP recorded Emission
Allowance purchases in a noncurrent inventory account included in Investments
and Other Property on the balance sheets. Emission allowance inventory was
recorded at weighted average cost. Gains on sales of Emission Allowances were
deferred as an Emission Allowance Gain Regulatory Liability in the balance
sheets. At November 1, 1999, the Emission Allowance inventory account and the
Emission Allowance Gain Regulatory Liability were written off and the result
was included in Extraordinary Income in the income statements in accordance
with the provisions of FAS 101. See Note 2.
NEW ACCOUNTING STANDARDS
In June 1998, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Statement
of Financial Accounting Standards No. 133 FAS 133, Accounting for Derivative
Instruments and Hedging Activities. A derivative financial instrument or
other contract derives its value from another investment or designated
benchmark. This Statement requires all derivative instruments to be
recognized as either assets or liabilities in the balance sheet. Some
derivative instruments offset, or hedge, exposure to a specific risk. If the
derivative is not a hedging instrument, measurement is at fair value and
changes in fair value i.e., gains and losses are recognized in earnings in
the period of change. If a derivative qualifies as a hedge, the accounting
for changes in fair value will depend on the specific exposure being hedged.
We are required to comply with FAS 133 effective January 1, 2001. We are
still in the process of quantifying the effect, if any, that compliance with
FAS 133 will have on our financial statements.
In November 1998, the Emerging Issues Task Force issued guidance on
accounting for energy trading activities EITF 98-10. Energy trading
activities are intended to generate profits from changes in the market prices
for energy-related commodities such as electricity, natural gas and coal.
These activities include certain purchase power and transmission contracts.
This guidance would require us to measure the difference between cost and
market value for our energy contracts and include any resulting gains or
losses in earnings. TEP does purchase and sell electricity but does not engage
in the type of activities defined in EITF 98-10 as energy trading. Therefore
compliance with the guidance in EITF 98-10 had no effect on our financial
statements.
RECLASSIFICATIONS
We have made reclassifications to the prior year financial statements for
comparative purposes. These reclassifications had no effect on net income. NOTE 2. REGULATORY MATTERS
-    TEP generally uses the same accounting policies and practices used by
unregulated companies for financial reporting under GAAP. However, sometimes
these principles, such as FAS 71, require special accounting treatment for
regulated companies to show the effect of regulation. For example, in setting
TEP retail rates, the ACC may not allow TEP to currently charge its
customers to recover certain expenses, but instead requires that these
expenses be charged to customers in the future. In this situation, FAS 71
requires that TEP defer these items and show them as regulatory assets on the
balance sheet until TEP is allowed to charge its customers. TEP then amortizes
these items as expense to the income statement as those charges are recovered
from customers. Similarly, certain revenue items may be deferred as regulatory
liabilities, which are also eventually amortized to the income statement.
The conditions a regulated company must satisfy to apply the accounting
policies and practices of FAS 71 include - an independent regulator sets rates;
- the regulator sets the rates to cover specific costs of delivering service;
and
- the service territory lacks competitive pressures to reduce rates below the
rates set by the regulator.
The financial statement impact of applying FAS 71 changed between 1998
and 1999 due to a change in the way we are regulated. The following sections
of this note explain the chronology of events and the impact on our financial
statements.
REGULATORY ASSETS AND LIABILITIES AT DECEMBER 31, 1998
TEP applied FAS 71 to the generation, transmission and distribution
portions of its business during 1998. The regulatory assets and liabilities
at December 31, 1998 were  
- Millions of Dollars -
Regulatory Assets
Income Taxes Recoverable Through Future Revenues   $ 152
Deferred Springerville Generation Costs         102
Deferred Lease Expense                  10
Other Regulatory Assets                 19
Springerville Unit 1 Allowance-contra-asset      171
Total Regulatory Assets               $ 112
Regulatory Liabilities
Deferred Investment Tax Credits Regulatory Liability $ 10
Emission Allowance Gain Regulatory Liability       31
Total Regulatory Liabilities            $ 41
A description of these assets and liabilities follows Income Taxes Recoverable Through Future Revenues: Represents the portion of
the total deferred income tax liability attributable to our utility business
for which we have not charged our customers. This balance was amortized as
the temporary differences reversed. Effective November 1, 1999, the
generation-related portion of this balance became part of the Transition
Recovery Asset.
Deferred Springerville Generation Costs: Represents deferred costs related to
Springerville Generating Station operations, including - Springerville Common Facilities costs incurred between the in-service dates
of Springerville Unit 1 and Springerville Unit 2. We were amortizing these
costs over the initial term of the Common Facilities Leases 2017 and 2021 - Fees incurred in 1997 to renegotiate the Springerville coal supply
contract. These fees were being amortized over the life of the new contract
2010; and
- Non-fuel costs of Springerville Unit 2 incurred from January 1, 1991
through October 14, 1991 which were amortized over a three-year period from
1996 through 1999.
Deferred Lease Expense: Represents differences which arose as a result of the
ACC regulatory treatment of TEP capital leases. The ACC treated these
leases as operating leases for ratemaking purposes, resulting in deferral of
certain lease and interest costs.
Springerville Unit 1 Allowance: This allowance represents the portion of
Springerville Unit 1 non-fuel expenses that the ACC did not allow TEP to
recover through retail rates. The allowance, a contra-asset account,
increased by interest expense which was shown as Interest Imputed on Losses
Recorded at Present Value in the Interest Expense section in the income
statements and decreased by the Amortization of Springerville Unit 1
Allowance, which was a contra-expense included in Operating Expenses.
At November 1, 1999, the unamortized balance of the Springerville Unit 1
Allowance reduced the Springerville Unit 1 capital lease asset amount. This
offset reduces the amount of post-FAS 71 Springerville Unit 1 lease
depreciation expense that will be recognized in the income statements and
eliminates any further interest and amortization expense related to the
Springerville Unit 1 Allowance.
Deferred Investment Tax Credits Regulatory Liability: Represents the deferred
benefit relating to ITC claimed on tax returns. This amount was being
amortized over the tax lives of the related property.
Emission Allowance Gain Regulatory Liability: Represents the net deferred
gain on emission allowance sales. These gains would have been amortized as
the related emission allowances were used.
NOVEMBER 1999 ACC APPROVAL OF SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT
The Settlement Agreement
In November 1999, the ACC approved a Settlement Agreement between TEP and
certain customer groups relating to recovery of TEP transition costs and
standard retail rates. The major provisions of the Settlement Agreement
include - Consumer choice: Consumer choice for energy supply was approved to begin in
January 2000 after the approval by the ACC of certain filings, and will be
phased in as required by the ACC retail competition rules. Initially, over
20 percent of TEP retail customers are eligible to choose competitive energy
suppliers. By January 1, 2001, consumer choice will be available to all
customers.
- Rate freeze: In accordance with the Rate Settlement approved by the ACC in
1998, TEP decreased rates to retail customers by 11% on July 1, 1998, 1% on
July 1, 1999 and will decrease rates an additional 1% on July 1, 2000. These
reductions apply to all retail customers except for certain customers that
have negotiated non-standard rates. The Settlement Agreement provides that,
after these reductions, TEP retail rates will be frozen until December 31,
2008, except under certain circumstances. TEP expects to recover the costs of
transmission and distribution under regulated unbundled rates.
- Recovery of transition costs: TEP frozen rates include Fixed and Floating
Competition Transition Charge CTC components which are designated for the
recovery of transition costs, including generation-related regulatory assets
and a portion of TEP generation plant assets. Retail rates will decrease by
the Fixed CTC amount after TEP has recovered $450 million or on December 31,
2008, whichever occurs first. The Floating CTC will allow TEP to recover
stranded costs not collected through the Fixed CTC and will terminate no later
than December 31, 2008.
- By June 1, 2004, TEP will be required to file a general rate case including
an updated cost-of-service study. Any rate change resulting from this rate
case would be effective no sooner than June 1, 2005 and would not result in a
net rate increase.
In accordance with the Settlement Agreement, TEP will transfer its
generation and other competitive assets to a wholly-owned subsidiary by
December 31, 2002. TEP, as a utility distribution company, will acquire energy
in the wholesale market for its retail customer energy requirements through a
competitive bidding process. Under the ACC electric competition rules, TEP
will be required to provide energy to any distribution customer who does not
choose another energy service provider. TEP generation subsidiary will sell
energy into the wholesale market.
Accounting Implications
In 1997, the Emerging Issues Task Force of the Financial Accounting
Standards Board concluded that application of FAS 71 should be discontinued
once sufficiently detailed deregulation guidance is issued for a separable
portion of a business. However, a company may continue to recognize
regulatory assets formerly associated with the deregulated portion of the
business, to the extent the transition plan provides for their recovery
through the regulated transmission and distribution portion of the business.
Effective November 1, 1999, we stopped applying FAS 71 to our generation
operations because the Settlement provided sufficient details regarding the
deregulation of TEP generation operations. As a result, we changed the
effects of rate regulation that we had reflected in our financial statements
as a result of applying FAS 71 to our generation operations. This included - Increasing accumulated capital lease depreciation by $197 million to
reflect the depreciation that would have accumulated had we not applied FAS
71 - Reclassifying $175 million of generation-related regulatory assets to the
Transition Recovery Asset, a distribution-related regulatory asset, because we
believe we will recover these assets through the Fixed CTC component of our
standard rates in our distribution business; and
- Recording $23 million of extraordinary income for balances that needed to
be eliminated to reflect discontinuance of FAS 71 but that could not be
reclassified as part of the Transition Recovery Asset.
The Transition Recovery Asset and extraordinary income recorded as a result of
the discontinuation of application of FAS 71 are summarized below.
Transition Recovery Asset
As of November 1, 1999, we recorded a Transition Recovery Asset as
follows  
-Millions of Dollars-
Generation-Related Regulatory Assets
Capital Lease Deprecation Adjustment                $ 197
Deferred Springerville Generation Costs                95
Income Taxes Recoverable Through Future Revenues            65
Other                                 15
Total Reclassified to Transition Recovery Asset on the Balance Sheet  372
Generation-Related Plant Assets                     42
Excess Capacity Deferrals Off Balance Sheet              36
Total Transition Costs Being Recovered Through the Fixed CTC   $ 450
The Generation-Related Plant Assets are included in Plant in Service on
the balance sheet. The Excess Capacity Deferrals are not reflected on our
balance sheet and relate to operating and capital costs associated with
Springerville Unit 2 capacity which were previously expensed when incurred.
Prior to discontinuation of application of FAS 71, these costs were amortized
as an off-balance sheet regulatory asset.
During the period from November 1, 1999 through December 31, 1999, we
recognized total amortization of $24 million related to the Total Transition
Costs Being Recovered Through the Fixed CTC. On the income statement, we
reflected amortization of $22 million related to the Transition Recovery
Asset recorded on the balance sheet. The remaining balance will be amortized
as costs are recovered through rates.
Extraordinary Income
As a result of the discontinuance of FAS 71 and the adoption of FAS 101
for generation operations, we recognized $23 million in extraordinary income,
net of tax, primarily as a result of recognition of deferred investment tax
credits. In accordance with previous actions of the ACC, TEP had deferred
recognition of the benefit of approximately $31 million in investment tax
credits. These benefits were recognized as part of the discontinuation of FAS
71 as we no longer had a regulatory deferral requirement. This gain was
partially offset by approximately $14 million in generation-related costs for
which TEP did not receive regulatory recovery as part of its Transition
Recovery Asset. These costs included approximately $11 million of generation-
related property taxes and approximately $3 million of net deferred losses
related to the sale of emission allowances. We recorded a net tax benefit of
$6 million related to the write-off of these costs.
REGULATORY ASSETS AT DECEMBER 31, 1999
These various accounting adjustments leave the balances of regulatory
assets at December 31, 1999 as noted in the table below. There are no
remaining regulatory liabilities recorded on the balance sheet at December 31,
1999. All of the remaining regulatory assets relate to TEP distribution and
transmission business.
- Millions of Dollars -

INCOME STATEMENT IMPACT OF APPLYING FAS 71
The amortization of the regulatory assets and liabilities discussed in
the previous sections of this note have had the following effect on our income
statements                            Years Ended December 31,

Long-Term Debt                     3    2    1
Interest Imputed on Losses Recorded at Present Value  29   34   33
If TEP had not applied FAS 71 in these years, the above amounts would
have been reflected in the income statements in prior periods, except for the
amortization and interest expense related to the MSR Option Gain Regulatory
Liability. These MSR amounts would not have been recorded. The above table
does not include capital lease expense. Capital lease expense would have been
recognized at different annual amounts if TEP had not applied FAS 71 although
the total would be the same over the life of the leases. Lease expense
included on our income statements amounted to $116 million in 1999 and $114
million in 1998 and 1997. If we had not applied FAS 71, the Springerville
Unit 1 Allowance would have been offset against the Springerville Unit 1
capital lease asset and the depreciation would have been calculated on a
straight-line method. Our lease expense would have been $124 million in 1999
and $125 million in 1998 and in 1997 if we had not applied FAS 71 in these
years. See Deferred Lease Expense above.
The reclassification of our generation-related regulatory assets to the
Transition Recovery Asset shortened the amortization period for these assets
to nine years.
FUTURE IMPLICATIONS OF CEASING TO APPLY FAS 71 TO OUR REGULATED BUSINESS
We continue to apply FAS 71 for the distribution and transmission
portions of TEP business, our regulated operations. We periodically assess
whether we can continue to apply FAS 71. If we stopped applying FAS 71 to
TEP remaining regulated operations, we would write off the related balances
of TEP regulatory assets as a charge in our income statement. Based on the
balances of TEP regulatory assets at December 31, 1999, if we had stopped
applying FAS 71 to TEP remaining regulated operations, we would have
recorded an extraordinary loss of approximately $275 million, net of the
related income tax benefit of $183 million. While regulatory orders and
market conditions may affect our cash flows, our cash flows would not be
affected if we stopped applying FAS 71. NOTE 3. SEGMENT AND RELATED INFORMATION
- 
In 1998, we began complying with Statement of Financial Accounting
Standards No131 FAS 131, Disclosures about Segments of an Enterprise and
Related Information, which requires that we report financial and descriptive
information about our operating segments. These segments are determined based
on the way we organize our operations and evaluate performance. UniSource
Energy principal business segment is TEP, an electric utility business. The
other reportable business segment is the unregulated energy businesses of
Millennium - Advanced Energy Technologies, Inc. AET which currently owns 50 percent of
Global Solar Energy, L.L.C., a developer and manufacturer of photovoltaic
materials. In November 1999, Millennium entered into an agreement whereby
Millennium share of Global Solar will increase to 67%. See Note 4 regarding
this agreement - Nations Energy Corporation Nations which is an independent power
developer; and
- MEH Corporation MEH which held a 50 percent interest in NewEnergy, Inc.
NewEnergy, an energy buyer representative. See Note 4 regarding the sale of
our interest in NewEnergy.
As discussed in Note 1, we record our percentage share of the earnings of
affiliated companies when we hold a 20% to 50% voting interest. Our portion
of the net income loss of the entities held by Millennium Energy
Businesses is shown below in Net Income Loss from Equity Method Entities.
See Note 4 for more information on Millennium Energy Businesses.
Intersegment revenues are not material. The accounting policies of the
segments are described in Note 1. We disclose selected financial data for our
business segments in the following tables                   Segments

show this activity in the Other Income Deductions section of UniSource
Energy income statements, and
- Elimination of intercompany activity and balances. NOTE 4. MILLENNIUM ENERGY BUSINESSES
- 
On January 1, 1998, TEP transferred the stock of its subsidiary,
Millennium Energy Holdings, Inc. to UniSource Energy. See Basis of
Presentation in Note 1. Millennium now owns 100% of the stock of the entities
described below which were established to pursue various unregulated energy-
related investment opportunities. See Note 3.
INTERNATIONAL POWER PROJECTS - NATIONS ENERGY CORPORATION
Nations and its subsidiaries develop independent power projects in
domestic and foreign energy markets. Nations owns 100% of the stock of the
following entities - Nations Energy Holland Holding Nations Holland - In January 2000, Nations
sold Nations Holland, including its minority interest in a power project
located in the Czech Republic. Nations recorded a pre-tax gain of $3 million
on the sale. At December 31, 1999, Nations' investment in Nations Holland and
its subsidiaries was $15 million.
- Nations-Colorado Energy Corporation Nations-Colorado - In September 1998,
Nations-Colorado sold a 48% interest in Trigen-Nations Energy, which owns and
operates the 40 MW Coors Brewing Company power plant in Golden, Colorado. The
$6 million after-tax gain on the sale is included in Millennium Energy
Businesses in UniSource Energy income statements. In June 1999, Nations
Energy sold its remaining 1% interest in Trigen-Nations Energy at book value.
- Nations International Ltd. Nations International - In December 1999,
Nations International recorded a $3 million decrease in the market-value of
its minority interest investment in Corporation Panamena de Energia, S.A.
COPESA. COPESA is an independent power producer that owns and operates a 43
MW power plant near Panama City. The energy is sold under an agreement with
an unrelated party. At December 31, 1999, Nations International investment
in COPESA was $5 million.
ENERGY MARKETING - MEH CORPORATION
On July 23, 1999, MEH sold its 50% ownership interest in NewEnergy to The
AES Corporation AES for approximately $50 million in consideration,
resulting in a pre-tax gain from the sale of approximately $35 million. The
consideration consisted of - Shares of AES common stock valued at $27 million as of July 23, 1999 which
were sold in the third quarter at a slight gain; and
- Two $114 million promissory notes, totaling $228 million, issued by
NewEnergy. The notes are collateralized by AES stock, bear interest at 95 and mature July 23, 2000 and July 23, 2001, respectively.
As part of the sale agreement, AES repaid a $10 million loan NewEnergy
obtained from an unrelated party that was guaranteed by UniSource Energy.
Previously, UniSource Energy provided guarantees of up to $56 million of
certain performance bonds and contractual obligations relating to NewEnergy
purchases and sales of electricity. On October 1, 1999, termination notices
were sent on all guarantees and the master surety agreement so that UniSource
Energy will not incur any additional liability under these agreements. All
obligations incurred prior to the terminations have been extinguished, except
for one in the amount of up to $1 million, which is scheduled to expire in
March 2000 and is fully collateralized.
MEH originally acquired its 50% ownership in NewEnergy in September 1997
with an $08 million capital contribution. In the first quarter of 1999, MEH
transferred its ownership in New Energy Ventures Southwest NEV SW to
NewEnergy. In 1999, 1998 and 1997, MEH recorded pre-tax losses related to
NewEnergy, including NEV SW, of $1 million, $16 million and $8 million,
respectively. These pre-tax losses were approximately 1%, 42%, and 13% in
1999, 1998 and 1997, respectively, of UniSource Energy pre-tax income.

Because we have no continuing involvement with NewEnergy, other than the
collateralized promissory notes from NewEnergy and a $1 million guarantee, we
do not believe that the results of NewEnergy operations will affect our
continuing operations. At December 31, 1999, the market value of the
collateral supporting the promissory notes exceeded the amount of the
promissory notes by 57%. The promissory notes represent less than 1% of
UniSource Energy total assets at December 31, 1999.
PHOTOVOLTAIC MANUFACTURING - ADVANCED ENERGY TECHNOLOGIES, INC.
AET currently owns 50% of Global Solar Energy, L.L.C., which develops and
manufactures photovoltaic materials. The other 50% is owned by ITN Energy
Systems, Inc. ITN. In November 1999, Millennium and ITN entered into an
Agreement Agreement in which Millennium share of Global Solar will
increase to 67%. Under the Agreement, ITN agreed to transfer its rights to
certain assets and proprietary and intellectual property, including thin-film
battery technology, to Global Solar. In addition, Millennium will contribute
to Global Solar up to $14 million in additional equity upon the occurrence of
certain agreed-upon production and business milestones. Millennium and ITN
are in the process of finalizing the structure of the transaction. As of
December 31, 1999, Millennium had funded $2 million under this Agreement. NOTE 5. TEP'S UTILITY PLANT AND JOINTLY-OWNED FACILITIES

BONDS - 1999
In 1999 TEP made $2 million of sinking fund payments on First Mortgage
Bonds.
Sale and Redemption of Bonds - 1998
During 1998, TEP issued $387 million in new bonds and redeemed $416
million of previously outstanding bonds. TEP achieved the following objectives
with this refinancing activity - extended maturities
- replaced variable rate debt with fixed rate debt, and
- eliminated restrictive covenants contained in the original 1222% Series
First Mortgage Bonds.
When TEP redeemed all of its First Mortgage Bonds due in 1999, 2001,
2002, and 2003, as well as $32 million of 1222% First Mortgage Bonds due 2000
not tendered for exchange, it eliminated covenants that restricted the payment
of common stock dividends.
The proceeds from the issuance of certain bonds were held by a trustee
and subsequently used, by the trustee, to redeem previously outstanding bonds
in 1999, 1998 and 1997. See Note 14 for a description of the non-cash
financing activities related to the sale and redemption of bonds.
TEP OTHER LONG-TERM DEBT AND AGREEMENTS
FIRST AND SECOND MORTGAGE
TEP General First Mortgage and General Second Mortgage are
collateralized by a lien on TEP utility plant, with the exception of
Springerville Unit 2. San Carlos, a subsidiary of TEP, holds title to
Springerville Unit 2.
BANK CREDIT AGREEMENT
TEP has a $441 million Credit Agreement which provides a $100 million
Revolving Credit Facility and a $341 million Letter of Credit Facility. These
credit facilities mature on December 30, 2002 and are collateralized by $441
million of Second Mortgage Bonds. The Credit Agreement contains certain
financial covenants, including cash coverage, leverage and net worth tests.
As of December 31, 1999, TEP was in compliance with these covenants.
The Revolving Credit Facility can be used for general corporate purposes.
At December 31, 1999, TEP had no outstanding borrowings under this facility.
If we were to borrow under the Revolving Credit Facility, the variable
interest rate that we would pay would be dependent, in part, on the credit
rating on TEP senior collateralized debt. We pay an annual commitment fee
on the unused portion of the Revolving Credit Facility. This fee is also
dependent on TEP credit ratings. At December 31, 1999, the commitment fee
equaled 038% per year.
The $341 million Letter of Credit Facility secures the payment of
principal and interest on $329 million of tax-exempt variable rate bonds
IDBs. The amount of commitment fee on the Letter of Credit Facility depends
on TEP credit ratings. At December 31, 1999, the commitment fee equaled
150% per year.
In December 1999 and early January 2000, TEP bond ratings were upgraded
by three rating agencies. As a result, on January 3, 2000, the commitment fee
decreased to 025% per year, and the letter of credit fee decreased to 125%
per year.
CAPITAL LEASE OBLIGATIONS
The terms of TEP capital leases are as follows - The Irvington Lease has an initial term to January 2011 and provides for
renewal periods of two or more years through 2020.
- The Springerville Common Facilities Leases have an initial term to 2017 for
one lease and 2021 for the other two leases, subject to optional renewal
periods of two or more years through 2025.
- The Springerville Unit 1 Leases have an initial term to January 2015 and
provide for renewal periods of three or more years through 2030.
- The Springerville Coal Handling Facilities Leases have an initial term to
April 2015 and provide for one renewal period of six years, then additional
renewal periods of five or more years through 2035.

In addition to the capital lease obligations above, we must ensure $70
million of notes underlying the Springerville Common Facilities leases are
refinanced by June 30, 2003 to avoid a special event of loss under the lease.
This special event of loss would require us to repurchase the Springerville
Common Facilities at the higher of the stipulated loss value of $125 million
or the fair market value of the facilities. Upon such purchase, the lease
would be terminated.
In December 1999, TEP refinanced $70 million of notes underlying the
Springerville Common Facility lease to avoid a special event of loss under the
lease. As a result of refinancing at a higher interest rate, we recorded an
additional $26 million of capital lease obligations and capital lease assets. NOTE 7. FAIR VALUE OF TEP'S FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS

TEP intends to hold the investment in Springerville Lease Debt Securities
to maturity $16 million matures through January 1, 2009 and $29 million
matures through January 1, 2013. These Springerville Lease Debt Securities
are stated at amortized cost, which means the purchase cost has been adjusted
for the amortization of the premium and discount to maturity. We base the
fair value of this investment on quoted market prices for the same or similar
debt. The $27 million purchase of additional Springerville Lease Debt
Securities in 1999 is reflected in the investing activity in our 1999 cash
flow statement.
TEP considers the principal amounts of variable rate debt outstanding to
be reasonable estimates of their fair value. We determined the fair value of
TEP fixed rate obligations including the Corporate First Mortgage Bonds, the
First Mortgage Bonds-IDBs, First Collateral Trust Bonds and the Unsecured IDBs
by calculating the present value of the cash flows of each fixed rate
obligation. We used a rate consistent with market yields generally available
as of December 1999 for 1999 amounts and December 1998 for 1998 amounts for
bonds with similar characteristics with respect to: credit rating, time-to-
maturity, and the tax status of the bond coupon for Federal income tax
purposes. The use of different market assumptions and/or estimation
methodologies may yield different estimated fair value amounts. NOTE 8. DIVIDEND LIMITATIONS
-  UNISOURCE ENERGY
In December 1999, UniSource Energy declared a dividend to the
shareholders of $008 per share of common stock. The dividend, totaling
approximately $3 million, will be paid on March 10, 2000 to shareholders of
record as of February 15, 2000.
Our ability to pay cash dividends on common stock outstanding depends, in
part, upon cash flows from our subsidiaries, TEP and Millennium.
TEP
In December 1999 and 1998, TEP paid a dividend of $34 million and $30
million, respectively, to UniSource Energy, the holder of all of TEP common
stock. TEP met the following requirements before paying these dividends to
UniSource Energy - Bank Credit Agreement
TEP bank Credit Agreement allows TEP to pay dividends as long as TEP
maintains compliance with the agreement and meets financial covenants.
- ACC Holding Company Order
The ACC Holding Company Order does not allow TEP to pay dividends to UniSource
Energy in excess of 75% of its annual earnings until TEP equity ratio equals
375% of total capitalization, excluding capital lease obligations.
- Federal Power Act
This Act states that dividends shall not be paid out of funds properly
included in capital accounts. TEP 1999 and 1998 dividends to UniSource
Energy were paid from current year earnings.
MILLENNIUM
In August 1999, Millennium paid a dividend of $10 million to UniSource
Energy. Millennium does not have any dividend restrictions. NOTE 9. COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES
- 
TEP COMMITMENTS - FUEL PURCHASE
TEP has the following commitments to purchase coal and rail - The Springerville coal contract expires in 2010, but includes an option to
extend the initial term for ten years. See Deferred Springerville Generation
Costs in Note 2. The Springerville rail contract expires in 2009.
- The Irvington coal and rail contracts expire in 2015 or at the end of the
useful life of the coal-fired unit, whichever is earlier.
- The contracts for jointly-owned facilities expire at various dates from
2005 to 2017. See Jointly-Owned Facilities in Note 5.
The Springerville and Irvington coal contracts combined require TEP to
take 21 million tons of coal per year through 2009 at an estimated annual
cost of $49 million for the next 5 years.  The Springerville and Irvington
rail contracts combined require TEP to transport 19 million tons of coal per
year through 2015 at an estimated annual cost of $13 million for the next 5
years. The contracts to purchase coal, including rail transportation, for use
at the jointly-owned facilities require TEP to take 15 million tons of coal
per year through 2005 at an estimated annual cost of $45 million for the next
5 years. All of these contracts include a price adjustment clause that will
affect the future cost of coal. The total amount paid under these contracts
depends on the number of tons of coal purchased and transported. The
aggregate total that TEP incurred under all of these contracts was $152
million in 1999, $150 million in 1998, and $160 million in 1997.
Each of TEP coal purchase contracts requires TEP to pay a take-or-pay
charge if certain minimum quantities of coal are not purchased. Our present
fuel requirements are in excess of the take-or-pay minimums. However,
sometimes TEP purchases coal from other suppliers or switches fuel burn from
one generating station to another to reduce overall fuel costs, resulting in
take-or-pay minimum charges. TEP incurred take-or-pay charges of $4 million
in 1999 and 1998, and none in 1997.
TEP COMMITMENTS - ENVIRONMENTAL REGULATION
The 1990 Federal Clean Air Act Amendments require reductions of sulfur
dioxide SO2 and nitrogen oxide NOx emissions in two phases, more complex
facility permits and other requirements. TEP is subject only to Phase II of
the SO2 and NOx emission reductions which was effective January 1, 2000. All
of TEP generating facilities except existing internal combustion turbines
are affected. TEP spent approximately $1 million in each of 1999, 1998 and
1997 and expects to spend approximately $1 million annually in 2000 and 2001
complying with these requirements.
In 1993, TEP generating units affected by Phase II were allocated SO2
Emission Allowances based on past operational history. Beginning in the year
2000, Phase II generating units must hold Emission Allowances equal to the
level of emissions in the compliance year or pay penalties and offset excess
emissions in future years. Due to increased energy output, TEP may have to
purchase additional Emission Allowances to comply with the Phase II SO2
regulations. Based on current estimates of additional required Emission
Allowances and market prices, TEP believes that purchases of additional
Emission Allowances will not have a material effect on TEP.
TEP may incur additional costs to comply with recent and future changes
in federal and state environmental laws, regulations and permit requirements
at existing electric generating facilities. Compliance with these changes may
result in a reduction in operating efficiency.
CONTINGENCIES
Income Tax Assessments
In February 1998, the IRS issued an income tax assessment for the 1992
and 1993 tax years. The IRS is challenging our treatment of various items
relating to a 1992 financial restructuring, including the amount of NOL and
ITC generated before December 1991 that may be used to reduce taxes in future
periods.
Due to the financial restructuring, a change in TEP ownership occurred
for tax purposes in December 1991. As a result, our use of the NOL and ITC
generated before 1992 may be limited under the tax code. The IRS is
challenging our calculation of this limitation. At December 31, 1999, pre-
1992 federal NOL and ITC carryforwards were approximately $153 million and $20
million, respectively. In addition to the pre-1992 NOL and ITC, which are
subject to the limitation, $167 million of federal NOL at December 31, 1999,
is not subject to the limitation.
We do not expect the resolution of these issues to have a material
adverse impact on the financial statements.
Resolution of Contingency - Arizona Sales Tax Assessments
Since 1990 TEP has contested the following sales tax assessments - Coal Sales Assessments: The Arizona Department of Revenue ADOR issued
sales tax assessments which alleged that a former TEP subsidiary was liable
for sales tax on gross income from coal sales, transportation and coal-
handling services provided to TEP from November 1985 through May 1996. On May
31, 1996, the former subsidiary was merged into TEP. Because TEP now acquires
coal directly from unaffiliated companies, we are not liable for sales tax
computed on a basis similar to these assessments after May 31, 1996.
- Lease Assessments: The ADOR issued sales tax assessments to some of the
lessors of TEP generation-related facilities and equipment. Under the
indemnification provisions in the lease agreements, we are required to pay any
sales tax assessments owed by the lessors. The assessments alleged sales tax
liability on a component of rents we paid on the Springerville Unit 1 Leases,
the Springerville Common Facilities Leases, the Irvington Lease and the
Springerville Coal Handling Facilities Lease from August 1, 1988 to June 30,
1997. Because the applicable sales tax rate went to zero on July 1, 1997, no
additional assessments are expected.
In August 1999, a settlement was reached with the ADOR to settle these
issues for $475 million. The settlement agreement became effective in
November 1999 when the lessors and their trustees agreed to the settlement.
TEP previously paid $251 million of the settlement amount in order to file an
appeal in the Arizona courts. Under the terms of the agreement, the remaining
$224 million was deposited into an escrow account and the funds are to be
released to the ADOR in 5 equal installments.  During 1999, two of the
installments totaling $9 million were released to the ADOR. At December 31,
1999, the escrow balance, shown as the Tax Settlement Deposit on the balance
sheet, was $134 million. In January 2000, another installment of $45
million was released to the ADOR. The remaining installments are scheduled to
be paid on April 15 and July 15, 2000. This settlement does not result in
additional sales tax expense because we have previously recorded an expense
for the settlement amount. NOTE 10. INCOME TAXES

We record a Deferred Tax Assets Valuation Allowance for the amount of
Deferred Tax Assets that we do not believe we can use to reduce income taxes
on a future tax return. The $32 million decrease in the Deferred Tax Assets
Valuation Allowance in 1999 consists of - $23 million of recognized ITC Carryforward - The income tax benefit
attributable to the recognition of the ITC Carryforward is included in
Extraordinary Income - see Note 2.; and
- $9 million reversal of a tax reserve: Income Taxes included in Operating
Expenses includes $7 million of tax benefit attributable to the improved
likelihood of favorable resolution of tax items. The remaining $2 million
benefit is included in Income Taxes in Other Income Deductions.
In 1998 the Deferred Tax Assets Valuation Allowance decreased $11 million
due primarily to the use of capital loss and investment tax credit
carryforwards. In 1997, the Deferred Tax Assets Valuation Allowance decreased
$43 million due primarily to the use of NOL carryforwards and an increase in
the estimated amount of NOLs that we believe we will use to reduce future
taxable income.

9. NOTE 11. EMPLOYEE BENEFITS PLANS
- 
PENSION AND OTHER POSTRETIREMENT BENEFIT PLANS
TEP maintains noncontributory, defined benefit pension plans for all
regular employees. Benefits are based on years of service and the employee
average compensation. TEP makes annual contributions to the plans sufficient
to meet the minimum funding requirements set forth by the Employee Retirement
Income Security Act of 1974, plus such additional tax deductible amounts as
may be advisable. TEP provides supplemental retirement benefits to employees
whose benefits are limited by IRS benefit or compensation limitations.
TEP also provides health care and life insurance benefits for retirees.
All regular employees may become eligible for these benefits if they reach
retirement age while working for TEP. The ACC allows TEP to recover through
rates postretirement costs only as benefit payments are made to or on behalf
of retirees. The postretirement benefits are currently funded entirely on a
pay-as-you-go basis. Under current accounting guidance, TEP cannot record a
regulatory asset for the excess of expense calculated per Statement of
Financial Accounting Standards No. 106, Employers' Accounting for
Postretirement Benefits Other Than Pensions, over actual benefit payments.
The actuarial present value of the benefit obligations are measured at
October 1 for our pension plans and December 31 for our other postretirement
benefit plan. The change in benefit obligation and plan assets and
reconciliation of the funded status are as follows:

We recorded a transition asset or obligation when we adopted accounting
standards requiring recognition of pension and other postretirement benefit
obligations and costs in the financial statements. The transition asset or
obligation equaled the difference between the fair value of plan assets and
the accumulated benefit obligation. The transition asset on the pension plans
is being amortized over 15 years. The transition obligation on the
postretirement benefit plan is being amortized over 20 years.   The components of net periodic benefit costs are as follows   Pension Benefits

The accumulated postretirement benefit obligation was determined using a

care cost trend rates have a significant effect on the amounts reported for
health care plans. The health care cost trend rates were assumed to be 75%
for 2000, gradually declining to 45% in 2003 and thereafter. A one-
percentage-point change in assumed health care cost trend rates would have the

DEFINED CONTRIBUTION PLANS
All regular employees may contribute up to 15 percent of their pre-tax
compensation, subject to certain limitations, in TEP voluntary, defined
contribution 401k plans. TEP contributes cash to the account of each
participant based on each participant contributions not exceeding 45% of
the participant compensation. Participants direct the investment of
contributions to certain funds in their account. In 1999, 1998 and 1997, TEP
incurred approximately $2 million annually in expense related to these plans.
STOCK OPTION PLANS
On May 20, 1994, the Shareholders approved two stock option plans, the
1994 Outside Director Stock Option Plan 1994 Directors' Plan and the 1994
Omnibus Stock and Incentive Plan 1994 Omnibus Plan.
The 1994 Directors' Plan provided for the annual grant of 1,200 non-
qualified stock options to each eligible director at an exercise price equal
to the market price of the common stock at the grant date, beginning January
3, 1995. These options vest over three years, become exercisable in one-third
increments on each anniversary date of the grant and expire on the tenth
anniversary. In December 1998, the Board of Directors approved an increase in
the annual grant of non-qualified stock options to 2,000 beginning January
1999.
The 1994 Omnibus Plan allows the Compensation Committee, a committee of
non-employee directors, to grant the following types of awards to each
eligible employee: stock options; stock appreciation rights; restricted stock;
performance units; performance shares; and dividend equivalents. The total
number of shares of UniSource Energy Common Stock that may be awarded under
the Omnibus Plan cannot exceed 16 million.
The Compensation Committee granted stock options to key employees during
1999, 1998, and 1997 and to most employees in 1999. These stock options were
granted at exercise prices equal to the market price of the common stock at
the grant date. These options vest over three years, become exercisable in
one-third increments on each anniversary date of the grant and expire on the
tenth anniversary.
A summary of the activity of the 1994 Directors' Plan and 1994 Omnibus
Plan is as follows              1999       1998       1997

We apply Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 25, Accounting for Stock
Issued to Employees, in accounting for our stock option plans. Accordingly,
we have not recognized any compensation cost for the plans during 1997 though
1999. We have also adopted the disclosure-only provisions of Statement of
Financial Accounting Standards No. 123, Accounting for Stock-Based
Compensation FAS 123. Had our compensation costs for the stock option plans
been determined based on the fair value at the grant date for awards in 1999,
1998 and 1997 consistent with the provisions of FAS 123, net income and net
income per average share would have been reduced to the pro forma amounts

NOTE 12. WARRANTS
-  UniSource Energy
At December 31, 1999, 15 million of UniSource Energy Warrants which
expire on December 15, 2000 were outstanding. Each UniSource Energy Warrant
entitles the holder to purchase one share of UniSource Energy Common Stock for
$1600.
TEP
At December 31, 1999, 46 million of TEP Warrants which expire on
December 15, 2002 were outstanding. The TEP Warrants entitle the holder of
five warrants to purchase one share of TEP common stock for $1600. The TEP
common stock that would be issued upon the exercise of TEP Warrants cannot be
converted into UniSource Energy Common Stock. Currently, UniSource Energy
owns 100% of the common stock of TEP and TEP common stock is not publicly
traded. NOTE 13. SHAREHOLDER RIGHTS PLAN
- 
In March 1999, UniSource Energy adopted a Shareholder Rights Plan. As of
April 1, 1999, each Common Stock shareholder receives one Right for each share
held. Each Right initially allows shareholders to purchase UniSource Energy
Series X Preferred Stock at a specified purchase price. However, the Rights
are exercisable only if a person or group the acquirer acquires or
commences a tender offer to acquire 15% or more of UniSource Energy Common
Stock. Each Right would entitle the holder except the acquirer to purchase a
number of shares of UniSource Energy Common or Preferred Stock or, in the
case of a merger of UniSource Energy into another person or group, common
stock of the acquiring person having a fair market value equal to twice the
specified purchase price. At any time until any person or group has acquired
15% or more of the Common Stock, UniSource Energy may redeem the Rights at a
redemption price of $0001 per Right. The Rights trade automatically with the
Common Stock when it is bought and sold. The Rights expire on March 31, 2009. NOTE 14. SUPPLEMENTAL CASH FLOW INFORMATION

NewEnergy Investment             15,351      -      These items were reflected on TEP financial statements
The non-cash change in capital lease obligations represents interest
accrued for accounting purposes in excess of interest payments as well as a
$26 million increase in the capital lease obligation and asset resulting from
the Springerville Common Facilities Lease refinancing. See Note 6.
When issuing new bonds and redeeming outstanding bonds, a trustee may
hold the proceeds from our issuance of new long-term debt and use the proceeds
to redeem previously outstanding long-term debt. When this occurs, the
Proceeds from the Issuance of Long-Term Debt and the related Payments to
Retire Long-Term Debt are not reported in our cash flow statements because
these transactions did not affect our cash balances.
Non-cash consideration received upon the sale of NewEnergy in 1999
included two NewEnergy promissory notes, as well as AES common stock.
Concurrent with the receipt of these notes and stock, we removed the NewEnergy
investment from our balance sheet and recorded a gain on the sale. See Note
4. NOTE 15. EARNINGS PER SHARE EPS
- 
Basic EPS is computed by dividing net income before the extraordinary
item by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the
period. Diluted EPS assumes that proceeds from the hypothetical exercise of
stock options and other stock-based awards are used to repurchase outstanding
shares of stock at the average fair market price during the reporting period.
The following table shows the amounts used in computing earnings per share and
the effects of potential dilutive common stock on the weighted average number
of shares.

Options to purchase 1,115,000 shares of common stock at $1228 to $1813
per share were outstanding at the end of the year 1999 but were not included
in the computation of diluted EPS because the options' exercise price was
greater than the average market price of the common shares.
46 million of the 61 million warrants outstanding are exercisable into
TEP common stock. See Note 12. However, the dilutive effect is the same as
it would be if the warrants were exercisable into UniSource Energy Common
Stock. NOTE 16. QUARTERLY FINANCIAL DATA UNAUDITED
