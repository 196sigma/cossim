REPORT OF INDEPENDENT CERTIFIED PUBLIC ACCOUNTANTS To the Board of Directors and Shareholders
of Sun Hydraulics Corporation
In our opinion, the accompanying consolidated balance sheets and the related
consolidated statements of income, changes in shareholders' equity and
comprehensive income, and of cash flows present fairly, in all material
respects, the financial position of Sun Hydraulics Corporation and its
subsidiaries the Company at December 31, 1998 and 1997, and the results of
their operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period
ended December 31, 1998, in conformity with generally accepted accounting
principles. These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company
management; our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial
statements based on our audits. We conducted our audits of these statements in
accordance with generally accepted auditing standards which require that we
plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the
financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes
examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in
the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and
significant estimates made by management, and evaluating the overall financial
statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis
for the opinion expressed above. PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP

2.    REORGANIZATION AND INITIAL PUBLIC OFFERING
The consolidated financial statements of the Company consist of the
financial position and results of operations of Sun Hydraulics, Sun Holdings,
and Sun Korea. Sun Hydraulics and Suninco, Inc. Suninco completed a merger
on June 28, 1996 by exchanging Sun Hydraulics' common stock for all of the
outstanding stock of Suninco. The share exchange was accounted for in a manner
similar to a pooling of interest, except for shares held by the minority
shareholders which were accounted for at the fair market values of the
proportionate share of related assets and liabilities. The fair value of their
minority interest shares in excess of net book value were allocated to Sun
Hydraulics' long-term assets on a pro-rata basis, resulting in an increase of
$38 and $245 to land and buildings, respectively.
In January 1997, Sun Hydraulics effected a 990372627 for 1 stock
split. All prior year share amounts reflected in the financial statements
include the effect of the stock split. Additionally, Sun Hydraulics issued
374,811 shares of common stock and made a nominal cash payment of $52 in
exchange for all of the issued and outstanding stock of Sun Holdings the
Reorganization. The Reorganization was accounted for in a manner similar to
a pooling of interests except for shares held by the minority shareholders
which were accounted for at the fair market value of their proportionate share
of related assets and liabilities, which approximated book value on the date of
the transaction.
The Company filed a Registration Statement on Form S-1 with the
Securities and Exchange Commission effective January 9, 1997, and issued
2,300,000 shares of common stock in an initial public offering IPO, with an
initial offering price of $950. The IPO net proceeds of $19,252, the exchange
of shares with Sun Holdings, and the distribution of previously taxed S
Corporation retained earnings are reflected in the statement of changes in
shareholders' equity and comprehensive income.                    37
38     Prior to December 31, 1996, Sun Hydraulics had elected to be taxed
under the S Corporation provisions of the Internal Revenue Code. Effective
December 31, 1996, Sun Hydraulics converted to C Corporation status and Sun
Hydraulics' subsequent earnings are subject to corporate income taxes.
The $19,252 of net proceeds from the IPO were used as follows: an S
Corporation distribution of $9,446, representing 90% of the total distribution
of $10,545 was made, $7,676 was paid to extinguish debt, $1,000 was paid to
reduce the mortgage on the United States construction loan, and $1,130 was
retained as working capital.
The Company has 20,000,000 authorized shares of common stock, par
value $0001, with 6,360,922 shares outstanding at December 31, 1998. The
Company also has 2,000,000 authorized shares of preferred stock, par value
$0001, with no shares outstanding. 3.    ACQUISITION AND JOINT VENTURE
On September 30, 1998, Sun Hydraulics acquired 100% of the equity
shares of Korea Fluid Power Co. Ltd. KFP, which had been the Company
exclusive distributor in South Korea since 1988. This wholly-owned subsidiary
name was changed to Sun Hydraulics Korea Corporation in January 1999. The
acquisition price paid by the Company was $860. The amounts paid in excess of
the net book value have been capitalized as goodwill, and are amortized over a
period of 15 years. Goodwill is recorded under other assets in the Company
financial statements, and was $558 as of December 31, 1998.
On November 1, 1998, Sun Hydraulics entered into a 50/50 joint venture
agreement joint venture with Links Lin, the owner of Sun Hydraulics
Corporation Taiwanese distributor. This agreement provides for an initial
capital contribution of $250, which is recorded in other assets in the
Company financial statements. 4.    RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS
In June 1998, the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants
AICPA issued Statement of Position 98-5, Reporting on the Costs of
Start-up Activities SOP 98-5. SOP 98-5 requires that all costs incurred in
start-up activities be expensed as incurred. Start-up activities include the
costs associated with one-time activities related to opening a new facility,
introducing a new product or service, conducting business with a new class of
customer or initiating a new process in an existing facility. SOP 98-5 is
effective for financial statements for fiscal years beginning after December
15, 1998. The Company organization cost of $41 related to the acquisition of
Sun Korea is required to be written off as a change in accounting policy in
fiscal 1999.                    38
39 5.    SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
A summary of the significant accounting policies followed in the
preparation of the Company consolidated financial statements is set forth
below PRINCIPLES OF CONSOLIDATION
The consolidated financial statements include the accounts and
operations of Sun Hydraulics and its direct and indirect subsidiaries. All
significant intercompany accounts and transactions are eliminated in
consolidation. As a result of the Reorganization in 1997 See Note 2,
financial statements for 1998 and 1997 are on a consolidated basis and
financial statements for 1996 are on a combined basis.
MANAGEMENT ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally
accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and
assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and
disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial
statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the
reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.
52 WEEK FISCAL YEAR
Commencing in fiscal year 1999, the Company implemented a fiscal year
which ends on the Saturday nearest to the end of the month of December. Each
quarter consists of two 4-week periods and one 5-week period.
CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS
The Company considers all short-term highly liquid investments
purchased with an original maturity of three months or less to be cash
equivalents.
INVENTORIES
Inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market, cost being
determined on a first-in, first-out basis.                    39
40
PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT
Property, plant and equipment is stated at cost. Expenditures for
repairs and improvements that significantly add to the productive capacity or
extend the useful life of an asset are capitalized. Repairs and maintenance are
expensed as incurred. Depreciation is computed using the straight line method
over the following useful lives                                Years
Software and computer equipment           3 - 5
Machinery and equipment               4 - 12
Furniture and fixtures               4 - 10
Leasehold and land improvements           5 - 15
Buildings                        40     Capitalized interest was $90, $160, and $293, for the years ended
December 31, 1998, 1997 and 1996, respectively.
CAPITALIZED SOFTWARE COSTS
Capitalized software costs are accounted for under Accounting for the
Costs of Computer Software Developed or Obtained for Internal Use SOP 98-1
and are recorded at cost less accumulated depreciation. Software is capitalized
upon the successful testing of the system. Depreciation is charged to income
over the estimated useful life of the software. The amount recorded under SOP
98-1 as of December 31, 1998, was $681, is recorded as Project in Process, and
will be capitalized upon completion. Since the systems are still in process, no
depreciation expense related to capitalized software have been recorded as of
December 31, 1998.
VALUATION ASSESSMENT OF LONG-LIVED ASSETS
Management periodically evaluates long-lived assets for potential
impairment and will reserve for impairment whenever events or changes in
circumstances indicate the carrying amount of the assets may not be fully
recoverable. As of December 31, 1998, management does not believe that an
impairment reserve is required.
OTHER ASSETS
Other assets include goodwill of $558 and other acquisition costs of
$144 related to the acquisition of Sun Korea, and an equity investment in the
Company joint venture of $247, which are discussed further in Note 3.
Goodwill, which represents the excess of purchase price of acquisitions over
the fair value of the net assets acquired, is carried at cost, net of
accumulated amortization and amortized on a straight-line basis over fifteen
years. Other acquisition costs are carried at cost, net of accumulated
amortization and amortized on a straight-line basis over fifteen years. The
equity investment is established at cost and adjusted for investment income or
loss and dividend distributions for each period.                    40
41
REVENUE RECOGNITION
Sales are recognized when products are shipped. Sales incentives are
granted to customers based upon the volume of purchases. These sales incentives
are recorded at the time of sales as a reduction of gross sales.
RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT EXPENSE
Included in selling, engineering and administrative expenses are
amounts incurred for research and development costs paid to third parties for
the Company manufacturing processes and related software which approximated
$466, $630, and $1,007 for the years ended December 31, 1998, 1997 and 1996,
respectively.
ADVERTISING COSTS
The Company expenses the costs for advertising and promotional
literature during the year incurred. Included in selling, engineering and
administrative expenses are amounts incurred for advertising and promotional
literature which approximated $262, $719, and $641 for the years ended December
31, 1998, 1997 and 1996, respectively.
FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSLATION AND TRANSACTIONS
The Company follows the translation policy provided by Statement of
Financial Accounting Standards No. 52, Foreign Currency Translation. The
Pound Sterling is the functional currency of Sun Ltd. The Deutsche Mark is the
functional currency of GmbH. The South Korean Won is the functional currency of
Sun Korea. The U.S. Dollar is the functional currency for Sun Hydraulics and
the reporting currency for the consolidated group. The monetary assets and
liabilities of Sun Ltd., GmbH, and Sun Korea are translated at the exchange
rate in effect at the balance sheet date, while all other assets, liabilities,
and shareholders' equity, income and expense items are translated at the
average annual rate of exchange for the period. The resulting unrealized
translation gains and losses are included in the component of shareholders'
equity designated as accumulated comprehensive income. Realized gains and
losses from foreign currency translations are included in miscellaneous
income expense.
INCOME TAXES
The Company follows the income tax policy provided by Statement of
Financial Accounting Standards No. 109, Accounting for Income Taxes. This
Statement provides for a liability approach under which deferred income taxes
are provided for based upon enacted tax laws and rates applicable to the
periods in which the taxes become payable. These differences result from items
reported differently for financial reporting and income tax purposes, primarily
depreciation and stock options.
Prior to December 31, 1996, Sun Hydraulics had elected to be taxed
under the S Corporation provisions of the Internal Revenue Code. Historically,
the shareholders of Sun Hydraulics included their pro rata share of income or
loss in their individual returns. A portion of the distributions to
shareholders was related to their individual income tax liabilities, resulting
From S Corporation taxable earnings see Note 13. Effective December 31, 1996,
Sun Hydraulics converted to C Corporation status and Sun Hydraulics' subsequent
earnings are subject to corporate income taxes. Accordingly, for informational
purposes, the December 31,                    41
42
1996 statement of income reflects an unaudited pro forma income tax provision
which would have been recorded if Sun Hydraulics had been a C Corporation,
based on the tax laws in effect during those periods.
STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION
The Company adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No.
123, Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation FAS 123 during 1996. Upon
adoption, the Company retained the intrinsic value method of accounting for
stock-based compensation and has disclosed the effects of adopting this
pronouncement in the notes to the financial statements see Note 14.
RECLASSIFICATIONS
Certain prior year balances have been reclassified to be consistent
with current year presentation. Such reclassifications had no effect on total
assets, equity, net income, or total cash flows.
6.    FAIR VALUE OF INVESTMENTS
The fair value of a financial instrument is the amount at which the
instrument could be exchanged in a current transaction between willing parties,
other than in a forced sale or liquidation. The following methods and
assumptions were used to estimate the fair value of each class of financial
instruments.
The carrying amounts of cash and cash equivalents, accounts
receivable, other current assets, accounts payable, accrued expenses and other
liabilities approximate fair value due to the nature of their short maturities.
The carrying amount of long-term debt approximates fair value, as the
interest rates on the debt approximate rates currently available to the Company
for debt with similar terms and remaining maturities.
The fair value of the notes payable to related parties is estimated
based on the current rates offered to the Company for similar debt. The
estimated fair value of the Company related party notes payable is
approximately $1,133, and $1,630 at December 31, 1998 and 1997, respectively.                    42

The Company has three revolving lines of credit: one in the United
States, one in England, and one in Germany. None of these arrangements contain
pre-payment penalties.
The United States had a $1,700 revolving credit agreement, secured by
all inventory and accounts receivable, bearing interest at the lender prime
rate with a maturity date of March 1, 1997. In February 1997, the Company
negotiated a one-year, unsecured revolving credit facility to replace the
$1,700 revolving credit agreement. This credit facility provided for a maximum
availability of $10,000, payable on demand at the lender prime rate of
interest, and contained no debt covenants. In February 1998, the Company
renegotiated this unsecured credit facility for an additional one year term and
an interest rate equal to the bank lender prime rate less 1%, or                    44
45
LIBOR plus 19% for predetermined periods of time at the Company option. At
December 31, 1998, the interest rate was 675%, and $3,940 was outstanding
under this credit facility.
In England, the Company has a $1,200 line of credit, denominated in
British pounds, which bears interest at a floating rate equal to 225% over the
bank base rate and is payable on demand. At December 31, 1998, there was no
balance outstanding on this credit facility.
The German line of credit is a demand note denominated in German marks
with interest payable at the lender prime rate. At December 31, 1998, the
interest rate was 85%, and $34 was outstanding under this credit facility.
In February 1999, the Company secured three loans in Germany, a ten
year 51% fixed interest rate loan for approximately $300, a ten year 51%
fixed interest rate loan for approximately $1,000, and a ten year 35% fixed
interest rate loan for approximately $800.
Sun Korea has various notes denominated in Korean Won, and secured by
property, plant and equipment, with interest payable at fixed rates ranging
from 6% to 75% and maturities ranging from February 1999 to March 2005. At
December 31, 1998, $177 was outstanding under these credit facilities.
A 10-year mortgage loan of $6,187 was obtained at a fixed interest
rate of 825% for construction of the Manatee facility. Terms on the
construction note were interest-only on the balance drawn down through the
completion of construction and then conversion to a 10-year mortgage note with
a 15-year amortization schedule. The Company applied $1,000 of the IPO proceeds
toward repayment of this note. In February 1998, this mortgage note was
renegotiated to an interest rate of 7875%. Effective April 1999, this mortgage
note will have an interest rate of 7375%. Terms are monthly principal and
interest payments of $43 for 825 years with remaining principal due July 1,
2006. At December 31, 1998, $4,864 was outstanding under this mortgage note.
In May 1996, the Company obtained a mortgage loan of approximately
$2,400, denominated in German marks, for the new facility in Erkelenz, Germany.
The loan has a term of 12 years and bears interest at 647%. At December 31,
1998, $1,748 was outstanding under this mortgage note.                    45

14. STOCK OPTION PLANS
During 1995 and part of 1996, the Company maintained a phantom stock
option plan the Plan. Compensation cost was measured as the amount by which
the market value, as defined in the Plan, of the stock on the measurement date
exceeded the market value on the date the phantom stock options were granted.
The market value was defined in the Plan as the higher of: the last arm
length sale price of said stock between unrelated parties if there had been a
sale in the preceding six-months period, or the book value of said stock.
Compensation cost was accrued over the service period and adjusted in periods
subsequent to the measurement date for changes in the market value of the
stock.
During 1996, the Company adopted the 1996 Stock Option Plan the
Stock Option Plan, which provides for the grant of incentive stock options
and nonqualified stock options for the purchase of up to an aggregate of 1,000
shares of the Company common stock by officers, employees and Directors of
the Company. Under terms of the plan, incentive stock options may be granted to
employees at an exercise price per share of not less than the fair value per
common share on the date of the grant not less than 110% of the fair value in
the case of holders of more than 10% of the Company voting stock.
Nonqualified stock options may be granted at the discretion of the Company
Board of Directors. The maximum term of an option may not exceed 10 years, and
options become exercisable at such times and in such installments as determined
by the Board of Directors.
In February 1997, the FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting
Standards No. 128, Earnings per Share SFAS 128. SFAS 128 establishes new
standards for computing and presenting earnings per share EPS. Specifically,
SFAS 128 replaces the presentation of primary EPS with a presentation of basic
EPS, requires dual presentation of basic and diluted EPS on the face of the
income statement, and requires a reconciliation of the basic EPS computation to
the diluted EPS computation.                    49

expense over the vesting period and additional options may be granted in future
years. The fair value of each option grant is estimated on the date of grant
using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model with the following
weighted-average assumptions used for grants in 1998, 1997 and 1996: cumulative
volatility of 4309%, 3956%, and 3671% for 1998, 1997 and 1996, respectively;
dividend yields of 168%, 168%, and 135% for 1998, 1997 and 1996,
respectively; risk-free interest rate of 557%, 572%, and 660% for 1998, 1997
and 1996, respectively; and expected term of 659 years. 604 and 50 years for
1998, 1997 and 1996, respectively. 15.   EARNINGS PER COMMON SHARE     In February 1997, the FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting
Standards No. 128, Earnings per Share SFAS 128. SFAS 128 establishes new
standards for computing and presenting earnings per share EPS.
Specifically, SFAS 128 replaces the presentation of primary EPS with a
presentation of basic EPS, requires dual presentation of basic and diluted EPS
computation on the face of the income statement, and requires a reconciliation
of the basic EPS computation to the diluted EPS computation.
Basic EPS is calculated as net income divided by the weighted average
number of shares of common stock outstanding.
Diluted EPS is calculated using the treasury stock method under which
net income is divided by the weighted average number of common and common
equivalent shares outstanding during the year. Common stock equivalents consist
of options.                    51

The Company has a defined contribution retirement plan covering
substantially all of its eligible United States employees. Employer
contributions under the retirement plan amounted to approximately $982, $993
and $586 during 1998, 1997 and 1996, respectively.
During 1997, the Company terminated its medical benefit trust and
established a new health care plan. These plans cover substantially all
eligible United States employees. Employer contributions to the health care
plan and the trust amounted to approximately $2,569, $1,954 and $1,348 during

53 17.   SEGMENT REPORTING
In 1998, the Company adopted Statement of Accounting Standards No.
131, Disclosures about Segments of Enterprise and Related Information SFAS
131. SFAS 131 supersedes SFAS 14, Financial Reporting for Segments of a
Business Enterprise, replacing the industry segment approach with the
management approach of determining reportable segments of an organization.
The management approach designates the internal organization that is used by
management for making operation decisions and addressing performance as the
source of determining the Company reportable segments. Management bases its
financial decisions by the geographical location of its operations.
The individual subsidiaries comprising the Company operate
predominantly in a single industry as manufacturers and distributors of
hydraulic components. The subsidiaries are multinational with operations in the
United States, the United Kingdom, Germany, and Korea. In computing earnings
from operations for the foreign subsidiaries, no allocations of general
corporate expenses, interest or income taxes have been made.
Identifiable assets of the foreign subsidiaries are those assets
related to the operation of those companies. United States assets consist of
all other operating assets of the Company.

Total liabilities attributable to foreign operations were $4,182 3,867, and $4,940 at December 31, 1998, 1997 and 1996, respectively. Net
foreign currency gains losses reflected in results of operations were $35 192 and $104 for the years ended 1998, 1997 and 1996, respectively.
Operating profit is total sales and other operating income less operating
expenses. In computing segment operating profit, interest expense and net
miscellaneous income expense have not been deducted added.
Included in U.S. sales to unaffiliated customers were export sales,
principally to Canada and Asia, of $6,415, $7,431, and $6,090 during 1998, 1997
and 1996, respectively. 18.   COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES
The Company is not a party to any legal proceedings other than routine
litigation incidental to its business. In the opinion of management, the amount
of ultimate liability with respect to these actions will not materially affect
the financial position of the Company.
In 1996, the Company was awarded a grant of 711 Deustche Marks
approximately $426, by the German government, which helped to offset the cost
of the German facility. This grant required that the German operation employ 26
people by June 30, 1998. The Company did not meet this headcount requirement
and was granted an extension to September 30,1999. If the Company fails to meet
the terms of the grant, approximately 50% of the grant will be repaid. This
amount has been recorded as a deferred grant. The repayment would affect cash
and would have no effect on net income.
The Company received a business interruption insurance claim of $1,821
$1,661, net of expenses, from its insurance carrier in 1998. The claim was
related to a fire in the Manatee County facility which occurred while the plant
was under construction. The Company believes that this fire delayed the opening
of the new plant which in turn delayed the rearrangement of the cartridge
operation and the creation of the cellular production for high volume models.
