REPORT OF INDEPENDENT ACCOUNTANTS To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of
The Boston Beer Company, Inc.
We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of The Boston Beer
Company, Inc. formerly Boston Beer Company Limited Partnership as of December
27, 1997 and December 28, 1996, and the related consolidated statements of
income, stockholders' equity, and cash flows for each of the three fiscal years
in the period ended December 27, 1997. These financial statements are the
responsibility of the Company management. Our responsibility is to express an
opinion on these financial statements based on our audits.
We conducted our audits in accordance with generally accepted auditing
standards. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material
misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting
the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes
assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by
management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.
We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in
all material respects, the consolidated financial position of The Boston Beer
Company, Inc. as of December 27, 1997 and December 28, 1996, and the
consolidated results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three
fiscal years in the period ended December 27, 1997, in conformity with generally
accepted accounting principles.                 Coopers & Lybrand L.L.P. Boston, Massachusetts

THE BOSTON BEER COMPANY, INC.
NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
A.  Basis of Presentation The Boston Beer Company, Inc. the Company, is engaged in the business of
brewing and selling beer, ale and cider products throughout the United States
and in select international markets. On November 20, 1995, in connection with
the initial public offering of the Company stock effected that date, the non-
corporate limited partners transferred their respective partnership interests to
the Company and the owners of the general partner and corporate limited partners
transferred their respective ownership interests in such entities to the
Company. In exchange, the transferors received an aggregate of 16,641,740 shares
of the Company common stock on a pro rata basis, based on their then
respective percentage equity interests in the Partnership. The aforementioned
transactions are collectively referred to hereinafter as the Recapitalization.
B.  Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Fiscal Year
Effective in fiscal 1996, the Company changed its fiscal year to end on the last
Saturday in December. The impact on the last two years of operations was not
material.
Principles of Consolidation
The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company, its
subsidiaries, and the Partnership. All intercompany accounts and transactions
have been eliminated.
Revenue Recognition
Revenue is recognized when goods are shipped to customers.
Cash and Cash Equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents include cash in hand and short-term, highly liquid
investments with original maturities of three months or less at the time of
purchase.
Short Term Investments and Restricted Investments
Short term investments consist primarily of marketable equity securities and
money market funds backed by U.S. Government securities. All short term
investments have been classified as available-for-sale and are reported at fair
value with unrealized gains and losses included in stockholders' equity. Fair
value is based on quoted market prices as of December 27, 1997.
Restricted investments consisted solely of the unexpended proceeds from the
$2,200,000 loan the Company took out in 1988 with the Massachusetts Industrial
Finance Authority MIFA. The loan was paid in full in 1997.
Inventories
Inventories, which consist principally of hops, bottles, and packaging, are
stated at the lower of cost, determined on a first-in, first-out FIFO basis,
or market.
Risks & Uncertainties
The Better Beer segment is an extremely competitive environment and the Company
faces competition from many companies considerably larger and with more
resources than the Company. As the industry continues to consolidate the
historical growth rate of the Company may not be maintained and price pressures
may reduce the revenue the Company may earn. Packaging and raw material prices
may also increase and because of the competitive market place the Company may
not be able to pass these increases on. The continued supply of raw materials
could also be affected since they are mainly agricultural and supply may be
effected by many reasons.
Use of Estimates
The preparation of the financial statements in conformity with generally
accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and
assumptions that affected the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the
date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and
expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those
estimates.                    25
THE BOSTON BEER COMPANY, INC.
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
Continued
B.  Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Continued Concentrations of Credit Risk
Financial instruments which potentially subject the Company to concentrations of
credit risk consist principally of temporary cash, short-term investments, and
trade receivables. The Company places its temporary cash and short-term
investments with high credit quality financial institutions. The Company sells
primarily to independent beer and ale distributors across the United States.
Receivables arising from these sales are not collateralized; however, credit
risk is minimized as a result of the large and diverse nature of the Company
customer base. The Company establishes an allowance for doubtful accounts based
upon factors surrounding the credit risk of specific customers, historical
trends, and other information.
Equipment and Leasehold Improvements
Equipment and leasehold improvements are recorded at cost. Expenditures for
maintenance, repairs, and renewals are charged to expense; major improvements
are capitalized. Upon retirement or sale, the cost of the assets disposed of and
the related accumulated depreciation are removed from the accounts and any
resulting gain or loss is included in the determination of net income. Provision
for depreciation is computed on the straight-line method based upon the
estimated useful lives of the underlying assets as follows  Kegs               3 to 5 years
Office equipment and furniture  3 to 5 years
Leasehold improvements      5 years, or the life of the lease,
whichever is shorter
Plant and equipment        10 to 20 years
Deposits
The Company recognizes a liability for estimated refundable deposits in kegs and
for unclaimed deposits on bottles which are subject to state regulations. Total
redemption associated with reusable bottles during the years ended December
27, 1997, December 28, 1996, and December 31, 1995 were $2,284,000, $3,053,000,
and $1,441,000 respectively.
Fair Value of Financial Instruments
The carrying amount of the Company long term debt, including current
maturities, approximates fair value because the interest rates on these
instruments change with market interest rates. The carrying amounts for accounts
receivable and accounts payable approximate their fair values due to the short
term maturity of these instruments.
Advertising and Sales Promotions
Advertising and sales promotional programs are charged to expense during the
period in which they are incurred. Total advertising and sales promotional
expense for the years ended December 27, 1997, December 28, 1996, and December
31, 1995, were $33,469,000, $35,730,000, and $35,039,000 respectively.
Purchase Commitments
The Company recognizes losses on hop purchase commitments when amounts from the
sale price of the related product are expected to be less than the cost of the
product. The Company has not historically experienced any losses related to hop
purchase commitments.
Forward Exchange 
Unrealized gains and losses on contracts designated as hedges of existing
purchase commitments are recorded as exchange rates change and are recorded as a
component of Stockholders' Equity. Realized gains and losses are recognized when
the contracts are exercised.
The Company enters into foreign currency forward exchange contracts to protect
itself from adverse currency rate fluctuations on foreign currency commitments
entered into in the ordinary course of business. These commitments are for terms
of less than one year. The foreign currency forward exchange contracts are
executed with creditworthy banks and are denominated in German Marks, English
Pounds and French Francs. The gains and losses relating to these foreign
currency exchange contracts are deferred and included in the measurement of the
foreign currency transaction subject to the hedge.                    26

B.  Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Continued Income Taxes
The Company records income taxes under the asset and liability method whereby
deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on differences between
financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities, and are measured
by applying enacted tax rates for the taxable years in which those differences
are expected to reverse.
Pro Forma Income Taxes unaudited
The financial statements of the Company for the periods prior to the
Recapitalization do not include a provision for income taxes because the taxable
income of the Company, up until the effective date of the Recapitalization, is
included in the income tax returns of the Partnership partners and former
Subchapter S corporation shareholder. The statements of income include a pro
forma income tax provision on taxable income for financial statement purposes
using an estimated effective federal and state income tax rate which would have
resulted if the Partnership and Subchapter S corporation had filed a corporate
income tax return during those periods.
Earnings Per Share
Earnings per share is based on the weighted average number of shares outstanding
during the period after consideration of the dilutive effect, if any, for stock
options. Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 128 Earnings Per
Share, requires dual presentation of basic and diluted EPS. SFAS 128 has been
adopted in the Company 1997 financial statements with comparable disclosures
for the prior years.
Pro Forma Earnings Per Share unaudited
Pro forma earnings per share is based on the weighted average number of common
and common equivalent shares outstanding during the period assuming a
conversion of partnership units for the period prior to the Recapitalization,
and an additional 3,109,279 shares issued during November 1995 in connection
with the Company initial public offering. In addition, pursuant to the rules
of the Securities and Exchange Commission, approximately 273,000 shares in 1995
have been included in the share calculation representing distributions in excess
of net income. The calculation includes 686,000 common equivalent shares for the
year ended December 31, 1995, using the treasury stock method.
New Accounting Pronouncements
In June 1997, the Financial Accounting Standards Board FASB issued Statement
of Financial Accounting Standards SFAS No. 130, Reporting Comprehensive
Income. This statement requires that changes in comprehensive income be shown
in a financial statement that is displayed with the same prominence as other
financial statements. The statement is effective for annual periods beginning
after December 15, 1997 and the Company will adopt its provisions in fiscal
1998. Reclassification for earlier periods is required for comparative purposes.
While this pronouncement will effect additional disclosure, the statement will
not have an impact on its financial position or results of operations.
In June 1997, the FASB issued SFAS No. 131, Disclosure about Segments of an
Enterprise and Related Information, which changes the manner in which public
companies report information about their operating segments. SFAS No. 131, which
is based on the management approach to segment reporting, establishes
requirements to report selected segment information quarterly and to report
entity-wide disclosures about products and services, major customers, and the
geographic locations in which the entity holds assets and reports revenue.
Management is currently evaluating the effects of this change on its reporting
of segment information. The Company will adopt SFAS No. 131 for its fiscal year
ending 1998.
Reclassifications
Beginning in 1996, certain expenses which were previously classified as general
and administrative expenses were reclassified as advertising, promotional, and
selling expenses. All financial information has been restated to conform with
the 1996 presentation. Certain other prior year amounts have also been
reclassified to conform with the current year presentation.                    27

C.  Acquisition of certain assets of the Schoenling Brewery Company Effective March 1, 1997, the Company acquired all of the equipment and other
brewery related personal property of an independent brewing company located in
Cincinnati, Ohio at a purchase price of approximately $4,438,000, which
approximates the fair value of the assets purchased. The Company believes this
acquisition will complement the contract breweries currently utilized by giving
the Company greater flexibility for brewing production and adding to the
existing brewing capacity. The Cincinnati Brewery is currently managed by the
Samuel Adams Brewery Company, Ltd., a wholly owned affiliate of the Company. The
results of operations of the Samuel Adams Brewery Company, Ltd., since the date
of acquisition, are included in the accompanying consolidated financial
statements. The pro forma effect of this acquisition was immaterial.
D.  Short Term Investments Short term investments consist of a marketable security having a cost of
$4,286,000 and a market value of $2,063,000 in 1997 and $3,844,000 in 1996,
which results in an unrealized loss of $2,223,000 in 1997 and $442,000 in 1996.
The Company also has investments in money market funds backed by U.S. Government
securities having a cost of $33,725,000 and $32,082,000 at December 27, 1997 and
December 28, 1996, respectively, which approximates fair value.

H.  Long-Term Debt and Line of Credit During 1988, the Company entered into a $2,200,000 loan with the Massachusetts
Industrial Finance Authority MIFA. As of December 28, 1996, $1,875,000 was
outstanding. During 1997, the Company paid off the loan in full.
On March 21, 1997, the Company entered into a credit agreement to increase its
existing $14,000,000 line of credit to $15,000,000 the $15,000,000 line and
to establish an additional $30,000,000 line of credit the $30,000,000 line.
On March 31, 1999, the $15,000,000 line expires and the balance outstanding
under the $30,000,000 line converts to a term note. Principal payments on the
term note are payable in twenty quarterly installments, with the final payment
due at maturity, December 31, 2003. Through March 31, 1999, interest is payable
either quarterly or upon expiration on terms of 30, 60 or 90 days at the Prime
Rate 850% and 825% at December 27, 1997 and December 28, 1996, respectively
or the applicable Adjusted Libor Rate plus 50%, respectively. After March 31,
1999, interest on the term note is payable quarterly at either the Prime Rate or
the applicable Adjusted Libor Rate plus 75%.
As of December 27, 1997, $ 0 and $10,000,000 are outstanding under the
$15,000,000 and $30,000,000 lines, respectively. The Company must pay a
commitment fee of 15% per annum on the average daily unused portion of the
total $45,000,000 commitment. Additionally, the Company is obligated to meet
certain financial covenants, including the maintenance of specified levels of
tangible net worth and net income. As of December 28, 1996 the Company had no
borrowings outstanding under the line of credit.
I.  Income Taxes Income Taxes
Effective with the Recapitalization described in Note A, the Company became
subject to federal and state income taxes. The historical income tax benefit
reflects the recording of a one-time tax benefit of $1,960,000 upon the change
in tax status of the entity as required by SFAS 109, and a tax benefit of
$235,000 for the period from November 21 to December 31, 1995. Significant
components of the Company deferred tax assets and liabilities as of December
27, 1997 and December 28, 1996 are as follows                                           In thousands

J.  Commitments and Contingencies Purchase Commitments
In the normal course of business, the Company has entered into various supply
agreements with brewing companies. These agreements are cancelable by the
Company and by the brewing companies with advanced written notice. Title to beer
products brewed under these arrangements remains with the brewing company until
shipped by it and accordingly, the liquid is not reflected as inventory by the
Company in the accompanying financial statements. The Company is required to
reimburse the supplier for all unused material and beer products on termination
of the agreements and under certain conditions to purchase excess materials. At
December 27, 1997, there was approximately $3,180,000 of material and beer
products in process at the brewing companies which had not yet been transferred
to the Company. Purchases under these agreements for the years ended December
27, 1997, December 28, 1996, and December 31, 1995 were approximately
$43,075,000, $57,766,000, and $41,199,000, respectively. The reduction of
purchases under the agreements are attributed to production being done at the
Samuel Adams Brewery Company.
The Company has entered into contracts for the supply of a portion of its hops
requirements. These purchase contracts, which expire at various dates through
2004, specify both the quantities and prices the Company is committed to. The
prices are denominated in German marks and English pound sterling. The amount of
the hop commitments outstanding at December 27, 1997 in U.S. dollars, is
$43,337,000. Purchases under these contracts for the years ended December 27,
1997, December 28, 1996, and December 31, 1995 were approximately $8,908,000 10,000,000, and $5,924,000 respectively. The performance of the dealers under
such contracts may be materially affected by factors such as adverse weather,
the imposition of export restrictions and changes in currency exchange rates
resulting in increased prices.
At December 27, 1997, the Company had outstanding purchase commitments of
approximately $9,300,000 principally related to capital expenditures and
advertising expenditures. There is a possibility the Company could expend
additional capital investments at the brewing locations in the approximate range
of $25,000,000 during 1998.

respectively.
Distribution
The Company two largest distributors combined accounted for approximately 8%
of the Company net sales.
License Agreement
The Company signed a contract in March, 1996, with a major beverage company with
respect to a transaction in which that company will license and sell a new craft
brew beer whose trademark and trade names are owned by the Company. The Company
has expensed approximately $805,000 and $1,435,000 during 1997 and 1996,
respectively, and does not expect to spend any additional money on this project.
The agreement also sets forth the circumstances in which the relationship can be
terminated and the terms on which rights to the product will revert to the
Company or may be reacquired by the Company, as well as the royalty payments
which are to be received beginning in 1998. These payments are not expected to
be material.
Litigation
In early 1996, Boston Brewing Company, Inc. Boston Brewing, an affiliate of
both Boston Beer Company Limited Partnership and The Boston Beer Company, Inc.,
had an action filed against it in a court in England by one of its distributors.
The action was settled in 1997 and was not material.
In addition, the Company is subject to legal proceedings and claims which arise
in the ordinary course of business. In the opinion of management, the amount of
ultimate liability with respect to these actions will not materially affect the
financial position or results of operations of the Company.
K.   Common Stock Initial Public Offering
On November 20, 1995, the Company completed an initial public offering and sold
an aggregate of 3,109,279 shares of Common Stock, of which 990,000 shares were
sold for $1500 per share in a best efforts offering and 2,119,279 shares were
sold for $2000 in an underwritten offering, resulting in net proceeds, after
deducting underwriting discounts and expenses, of $49,691,000. In addition, as
described in Note A, upon Recapitalization the owners of the general and
corporate limited partners transferred their respective ownership interests to
the Company. In exchange, the transferors received an aggregate of 16,641,740
shares of the Company common stock on a pro rata basis based on their then
respective equity interest in the Partnership. The total number of shares of
Class A and Class B Common Stock outstanding after completion of the offering

K.   Common Stock: Continued Upon Recapitalization, the Company recognized no gain or loss upon receipt of
the units of the Partnership from individual partners, and no gain or loss upon
receipt of stock in the corporate partners from the stockholders of the
corporate partners in exchange for the Company stock based upon an opinion
from the Company legal counsel interpreting the Internal Revenue Code of 1986,
as amended the Code, the regulations of the Treasury Department the
Regulations, and judicial opinions interpreting the Code. The opinion is
qualified by detailed and material limitations set forth in the opinion
concerning, among other things, the possibility of Regulations being adopted
with a retroactive effect. Any new legislation, changes to and clarifications of
the administrative positions of the IRS, including by way of amendments to
existing Regulations or adoption of new Regulations, and subsequent judicial
decisions including any retroactive effects could have a material consequence to
the Company.
Stock Compensation Plan
The Company Employee Equity Incentive Plan the Equity Plan was amended
effective December 19, 1997. The equity plan was the successor to the
Partnership 1995 Management Option Plan, which was, in turn, the successor to
a series of the Partnership Incentive Share Plans. In connection with the
Recapitalization, the grants under the Partnership Incentive Share Plans, as
adjusted for the one and one half conversion of partnerships units, became
grants to acquire Class A Common Stock. On October 20, 1997 and December 19,
1997, respectively, the Equity Plan was amended to delete the provision which
allowed management options to be granted at $01 per share and to add an
additional 1,000,000 authorized shares to the Equity Plan.
The Plan permits the grant of discretionary options and investment shares. The
Plan is administered by the Board of Directors, based on recommendations
received from the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors. The
Compensation Committee consists of non-employee directors.
The Committee may also grant to eligible employees discretionary options to
acquire shares of Class A Common Stock upon such terms and conditions, including
exercise price, as the Committee shall determine.
Information related to the options granted under the Equity Plan is as follows                                  Weighted

As of December 27, 1997, 292,364 stock options were exercisable.
The Equity Plan also permits Company employees who have been with the Company
for at least one year to invest up to ten percent of their annual earnings in
Class A Common Stock Investment Shares. The price at which Investment Shares
are issued to participating employees is at a discount from current market value
of from 0% to 40% based on the employee tenure with the Company. These shares
vest ratably over a five year period. At December 27, 1997 and December 28,
1996, there were 23,766 and 66,249 investment shares issued and outstanding, of
which 11,340 and 55,269 shares were vested.
Prior to the Recapitalization, the Partnership had various other employee
investment unit plans in which eligible employees could purchase the economic
equivalent of partnership units at not less than 60% of the unit value. The
total expense recognized for the years ended December 31, 1995 and 1994,
approximated $20,000 representing all discount amortized over the related
vesting period.

K.   Common Stock: Continued Upon Recapitalization, the investment units were replaced with 67,731 investment
shares. Effective with the issuance of the shares, approximately $411,000 of the
investment unit plan accrued liability recorded was reclassified as equity in
consideration of the stock issued.
The Company has reserved 1,085,812 and 235,594 shares of Class A Common Stock
for issuance pursuant to the Equity Plan at December 27, 1997 and December 28,
1996, respectively.
In October 1995, the FASB issued SFAS 123, Accounting for Stock-Based
Compensation. SFAS is effective for periods beginning after December 15, 1995.
The Company adopted the disclosure provisions of SFAS 123 in 1996 and has
applied APB Opinion 25 and related Interpretations for its stock option plan.
Had compensation cost for the Company stock-based compensation plans been
determined based on the fair value at the grant dates as calculated in
accordance with SFAS 123, the Company net income and earnings per share for
the years ended December 28, 1996 and December 31, 1995 would have been reduced
to the pro forma amounts indicated below           in thousands, except per share amounts

Pro forma - Diluted     $7,117   $035    $8,305      $041
The fair value of each stock option is estimated on the date of grant using the
Black-Scholes option-pricing model with the following weighted average
assumptions: an expected life of from 55 years to 65 years for stock options,
expected volatility of 45%, a dividend yield of 0%, and a risk-free interest
rate that ranges from 543% to 779%, depending upon the term of the respective
stock options. The weighted average fair value of stock options granted in 1997
and 1996 was $546 and $706, respectively.
Because some options vest over several years and additional awards may be made
each year, the pro-forma amounts above may not be representative of the effects
on net income for future years.
In 1997, there were no options granted with an exercise price that exceeded fair
value. In 1997, there were 7,857 management options granted, net of forfeiture,
at an exercise price of $01 per share, which was less than fair value.
Therefore, the weighted average exercise price of these grants were $01. In
1996, there were 10,000 discretionary options granted with an exercise price
that exceeded fair value, and the weighted average exercise price of this single
option grant was $2556.

L.   Financial Instruments During 1997 the Company entered into forward exchange contracts to reduce
exposure to currency movements affecting existing foreign currency denominated
firm commitments. At the time the Company entered into the foreign exchange
contracts, those contracts' durations matched the duration of the currency
position. The future value of the contracts and the related currency position
are subject to offsetting market risk resulting from foreign currency exchange
rate volatility. The carrying amounts of the contracts and the unrealized gain
loss recognized as a component of Stockholders' Equity totaled $9,254,000 and
$290,000 respectively, at December 27, 1997 versus $1,195,000 and $31,070,
respectively, at December 28, 1996. Fair value of the contracts approximates the
carrying value adjusted for gains and losses.
M.   Related Party Transactions The Company has a deferred compensation agreement with its Chief Financial
Officer which calls for specific payments upon retirement on or after April 1,
2000 with pro-rated annual payments called for upon early retirement. The
Company has expensed approximately $61,000, $59,000, and $56,000 for the three
years ended December 27, 1997, December 28, 1996 and December 31, 1995,
respectively.

all of the Company employees. Participants may make voluntary contributions of
their annual compensation. The Company made contributions to the Plan in each of
the three years ended December 27, 1997, December 28, 1996, and December 31,1995
of $356,000, $280,000, and $175,000 respectively.
Certain hourly paid workers in Cincinnati are covered by the Samuel Adams Local
Union #1199 Defined Benefit Pension Plan. The Company contributes approximately
$50,000 per year to this plan. Certain hourly paid workers in Cincinnati are
also covered by two Multi Employer Retirement Plans. The Company contributes
approximately $20,000 per year to these plans.
O.   Sale of Distribution Rights In September 1995, the Company sold its distribution rights to a major
metropolitan area and associated receivables and inventories for approximately
$1,200,000 and the assumption of certain deposit liabilities and truck leases.
On closing approximately $420,000 was paid in cash with the remainder in the
form of a note which is payable in equal monthly installments of $13,000 plus
interest at 10% per annum. This transaction resulted in a gain to the Company of
approximately $807,000 and is included in other income.
