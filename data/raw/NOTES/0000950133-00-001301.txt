INDEPENDENT AUDITORS REPORT The Board of Directors LCC International, Inc. and Subsidiaries We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of
LCC International, Inc. and Subsidiaries the
Company as of December31, 1998 and 1999, and
the related consolidated statements of operations,
shareholders equity, and cash flows for each of the years
in the three-year period ended December31, 1999. In
connection with our audits of the consolidated financial
statements, we have also audited the related financial statement
schedule. These consolidated financial statements and financial
statement schedule are the responsibility of the Companys
management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these
consolidated financial statements and financial statement
schedule based on our audits. We conducted our audits in accordance with generally accepted
auditing standards. Those standards require that we plan and
perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether
the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An
audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting
the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit
also includes assessing the accounting principles used and
significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating
the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our
audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to
above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial
position of LCC International, Inc. and Subsidiaries as of
December31, 1998 and 1999, and the results of their
operations and their cash flows for each of the years in the
three-year period ended December31, 1999, in conformity
with generally accepted accounting principles. Also in our
opinion, the related financial statement schedule, when
considered in relation to the consolidated financial statements
taken as a whole, presents fairly, in all material respects, the
information set forth therein. KPMG LLP Washington, D.C. February7, 2000, except for notes16 and 21 which are as of March7, 2000 28 Table of Contents

0108million shares of ClassA Common Stock in
exchange for a $1625million note receivable from the

increase in notes receivable from shareholders. The accompanying notes are an integral part of the Consolidated
Financial Statements.

LCC INTERNATIONAL, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Years ended December31, 1997, 1998 and 1999 1Description of Operations LCC International, Inc. and subsidiaries also referred to herein
as the Company is a leading provider of end to end
services relating to the design, engineering, deployment and
operation of wireless communications systems. The Company operates in a highly competitive environment subject
to rapid technological change and emergence of new technologies.
Future revenues are dependent upon the re-engineering of existing
wireless communications systems, introduction of existing
wireless technologies into new markets, the entrance of new
wireless providers into existing markets, the introduction of new
technologies and the retention of existing management and
professional staff. Although the Company believes that its
services are transferable to emerging technologies, rapid changes
in technology could have an adverse financial impact on the
Company.
2Summary of Significant Accounting Policies
Principles of Consolidation The accompanying consolidated financial statements include the
accounts of the Company and its subsidiaries. All significant
intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated in
consolidation.
Cash Equivalents Cash equivalents include all highly liquid investments purchased
with original maturities of three months or less.
Short-Term Investments Short-term investments consist primarily of municipal bonds with
maturity dates of more than three months from the date of
acquisition. The portfolio of municipal bonds held by the Company
has been classified based on managements intentions as to
future investment activity. Such investments are not intended to
be held to maturity and are classified as available for
sale and carried at market value with temporary unrealized
gains lossescharged directly to shareholders
equity. At December31, 1999 and 1998, the market value of
the municipal bonds held by the Company approximated its cost.
Other short-term investments are carried at cost plus accrued
interest which approximates their market value. All short-term
investments have maturity dates of one year or less.
Concentration of Credit Risk Financial instruments that potentially expose the Company to
concentration of credit risk consist primarily of trade
receivables. The Company sells its services globally. Generally,
the Company does not require collateral or other security to
support customer receivables. The Company performs ongoing credit
evaluations of its customers financial condition and
maintains reserves for potential credit losses. The Company had
the following significant concentrations of trade receivables
from customers located outside the United States at
December31, 1998 and 1999 1998 1999 In thousands Latin America 3,887 1,086 Europe 4,776 5,412 Middle East 29 2,245 Asia-Pacific 1,675 583 34 Table of Contents The Companys existing and potential customer base is
diverse and includes start-up companies and foreign enterprises.
Although the Company believes that the diversity of its customer
base has historically minimized the risk of incurring material
losses due to concentrations of credit risk, it may be exposed to
a declining customer base in periods of market downturns, severe
competition, exchange rate fluctuations or other international
developments see notes 7 and 18. Revenues generated from one customer were approximately
$154million or 168% of total revenues for 1997. Revenues
generated from another customer were approximately
$160million and $150million, or 175% and 172% of
total revenues for 1997 and 1998, respectively. In addition,
revenues from another customer were approximately
$139million or 159% of revenues in 1998. Revenues
generated from another customer were approximately
$103million or 136% of total revenues for 1999. Revenues
generated from another customer were approximately
$85million or 112% of 1999 revenues.
Property and Equipment Property and equipment are stated at cost, less an allowance for
depreciation. Replacements and major improvements are
capitalized; maintenance and repairs are charged to expense as
incurred. Depreciation is calculated using the straight-line method over
the estimated useful lives of the related assets. Furniture and
equipment are depreciated over useful lives which range from
eighteen months to seven years. RF transmission towers are
depreciated over a useful life of 25years see
note21. The costs of leasehold improvements are
capitalized and amortized using the straight-line method over the
shorter of their estimated useful lives or the terms of the
respective leases.
Recovery of Long-Lived Assets The Companys policy is to review its long-lived assets for
impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate
that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. The
Company recognizes an impairment loss when the sum of the
expected undiscounted future cash flows is less than the carrying
amount of the asset. The measurement of the impairment losses to
be recognized is based upon the difference between the fair
value and the carrying amount of the assets.
Investments in Joint Ventures The Company uses the equity method of accounting for its
investments in, advances to and equity in the earnings and losses
of its joint ventures.
Revenue Recognition The Companys principal sources of revenues are engineering
and design services, program management and system deployment
services, and lease revenues from its tower business see note
21. The Company recognizes revenues from long-term fixed price
contracts using the percentage-of-completion method, based on
individual contract costs incurred to date compared with total
estimated contract costs. Anticipated contract losses are
recognized as soon as they become known and estimable. The
Company also recognizes revenues on time and materials contracts
as the services are performed. Lease revenues from the tower
business are recognized over the term of the related lease.
Revenues earned but not yet billed are reflected as unbilled
receivables in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. The
Company expects substantially all unbilled and billed receivables
to be collected within one year.
Income Taxes Deferred income taxes are determined in accordance with Statement
of Financial Accounting Standards SFAS
No109. Under this statement, temporary differences arise
as a result of the differences between the reported amounts of
assets and liabilities and their tax basis. Deferred tax assets
are reduced by a valuation allowance when, in the opinion of
management, it is more likely than not that some portion or all
of the
35 Table of Contents deferred tax assets will not be realized. Deferred tax assets and
liabilities are adjusted for the effects of changes in tax laws
and rates on the date of enactment. 351 Table of Contents Certain of the Companys international operations are
subject to local income taxation. Currently, the Company is
subject to taxation on income from certain operations in Europe,
Latin America, the Far East, the Middle East and the non-U.S.
portions of North America where the Company has subsidiaries, has
established branch offices or has performed significant services
that constitute a permanent establishment for tax
reporting purposes. Foreign taxes account for a significant
portion of the provision for income taxes as reflected in the
Companys consolidated statements of operations see
note10. The foreign taxes paid or accrued by the Company
represent a potential credit for the Company against its Federal
income taxes.
Foreign Currency Translation Gains and losses on translation of the accounts of the
Companys foreign operations where the local currency is the
functional currency are accumulated and included in other
comprehensive loss within the accompanying consolidated statement
of shareholders equity. Foreign currency transaction gains
and losses are recognized currently in the consolidated
statements of operations.
Pervasiveness of Estimates The preparation of the consolidated financial statements in
conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires
management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the
reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of
contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial
statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses
during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from
those estimates.
Stock-Based Compensation In October1995, the Financial Accounting Standards Board
FASB issued SFAS No123, Accounting for
Stock-Based Compensation, which establishes financial
accounting and reporting standards for stock-based compensation
plans. This statement establishes a fair value based method of
accounting for stock based compensation plans. The Corporation will continue to account for stock-based
compensation plans using the method of accounting prescribed by
APB Opinion No25, Accounting for Stock Issued to
Employees. The Corporation will make pro-forma disclosures of
net income as if the fair value based method of accounting as
defined in SFAS No123 had been applied see note 14.
Other Comprehensive Income Loss During 1998, the Company adopted SFAS No130, Reporting
Comprehensive Income, which established standards for
reporting and displaying comprehensive income and its components
in a financial statement that is displayed in equal prominence as
other financial statements. Comprehensive income is defined as
net income plus the changes in equity of a business enterprise
during a period from transactions and other events and
circumstances from non-owner sources. Other comprehensive income
refers to revenues, expenses, gains and losses that under
generally accepted accounting principles are included in
comprehensive income, but excluded from net income. Other
comprehensive income loss consists solely of foreign currency
translation adjustments in 1997, 1998 and 1999. Changes in
components of other comprehensive income lossare reported
net of income tax, as follows in thousands. 1997 1998 1999 Pretax Tax Expense Net Pretax Tax Expense Net Pretax Tax Expense Net Amount Credit Amount Amount Credit Amount Amount Credit Amount Foreign currency translation adjustments 2,179 767 1,412 222 78 144 327 98 229 Reclassification of Prior Years Balances Prior years balances have been reclassified to conform with
the current-year presentation.

3Discontinued Operations In March1999, the Companys Board of Directors adopted
a plan to discontinue the operations comprising its software and
hardware products segments. On October22, 1999, the
Company sold its products businesses, which consist of the
design, development, manufacture, marketing, sale and servicing
of field testing and measurement products and related software
and network planning software for the wireless communications
industry the Products Businesses, to Ericsson Radio
Systems AB, a Swedish corporation, and certain of its affiliates
Ericsson, pursuant to an Asset Purchase Agreement,
dated as of August25, 1999. Pursuant to the Asset Purchase Agreement, the company transferred
substantially all of the assets of the Products Businesses for a
purchase price of approximately $223million, which
included an estimate of approximately $19million for the
collection of certain accounts receivable of the Products
Businesses sold to Ericsson. In addition, Ericsson assumed
certain of the liabilities of the Products Businesses, including,
among others, certain liabilities arising with respect to the
Products Businesses in the ordinary course of business consistent
with past practice and certain liabilities arising under assumed
contracts. As part of the transaction, the Company entered into
product supply agreements and a software license and related
support agreement with Ericsson pursuant to which the Company
will purchase or license certain of the products which were sold
to Ericsson. Revenues from the Products Businesses were approximately
$640million and $338million for the years ended
December31, 1997 and 1998, respectively, and approximately
$195million for the period from January1, 1999 to
October22, 1999. Net income losswas approximately
$22million and $178 million for the years ended
December31, 1997 and 1998, respectively. The gain on
disposal in 1999 was approximately $08million, net of
losses during the phase out period of approximately
$89million, and related tax expense of approximately $03
million and includes $19million of receivables to be
remitted to the Company upon collection. The components of net assets of discontinued operations included
in the Consolidated Balance Sheet at December31, 1998 were
as follows in thousands 1998 Receivables, net Trade accounts receivable 9,429 Due from related parties 56 Unbilled receivables 801 Inventory 6,841 Prepaid expenses and other current assets 190 Property and equipment, net 3,170 Software development costs, net 1,168 Other noncurrent assets, net 3,432 Note payable 2,368 Accounts payable 2,593 Accrued expenses 4,379 Deferred revenue 4,721 Other liabilities 1,887 9,139 37 Table of Contents

commercial paper and short-term money market funds approximate
their carrying value.
5Related Party Transactions During 1997, 1998, and 1999 the Company provided services to
Telcom Ventures and various other companies owned, in part, by
Telcom Ventures or its members. Telcom Ventures owns the
ClassB Common Stock shares outstanding, which has
preferential voting rights over the ClassA Common Stock
shares outstanding of ten-to-one representing approximately 88%
of voting control. Revenues earned during 1997, 1998 and 1999 for
services provided to these customers were approximately
$11million, $08million, and $16million,
respectively. Receivables from these related parties were
$119,000 and $299,000 at December31, 1998 and 1999,
respectively, and are included in due from related parties and
affiliates in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. Also
included in due from related parties and affiliates are unbilled
receivables and advances to employees aggregating approximately
$381,000 and $291,000 at December31, 1998 and 1999,
respectively. During calendar 1997 and through July22,
1998, program management services were provided to the Company by
Koll Telecommunications Services L.L.C. Koll see
note9, a joint venture of the Company. During 1998, the Company made certain payments on behalf of
Telcom Ventures and its members which consisted primarily of
payroll services, fringe benefit payments, facility related
charges, business insurances, interest and foreign tax payments.
During 1999, the Company made certain payments on behalf of
Telcom Ventures which consisted primarily of fringe benefit
payments. At December31, 1998 and 1999, outstanding amounts
associated with these payments totaling $111,000, and $246,000,
respectively, are included in due from related parties and
affiliates within the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. In September1996, the Company lent $35million to
Telcom Ventures to assist in the payment of taxes due in
connection with the assumption by the Company of
$300million of convertible subordinated debt from Telcom
Ventures see note12. The note is payable over five years
with equal annual principal payments over the term. Interest
accrues at the rate of LIBOR plus 175% and is payable annually.
In November1997, the Company received a payment of
approximately $10million from Telcom Ventures representing
payment of $07million principal and approximately
$03million interest under the terms of the note. In
October 1998, the Company received a payment of approximately
$09million from Telcom Ventures representing payment of
$07 million principal and approximately $02 million interest.
In November1999, $07million of principal and
approximately $02million of interest were offset against
the Companys $11million promissory note with Telcom
Ventures see below. The note is reflected as a reduction of
shareholders equity in the accompanying statement of
shareholders equity. On January30, 1997, a significant customer of the Company
acquired 81% of the outstanding shares of Wireless Ventures of
Brazil, Inc. WVB, an operator of specialized mobile
radio systems in Brazil, for $186million in the
customers stock. WVB was principally owned by Telcom
Ventures. In January1999, the Company entered into a
$50million convertible promissory note with Telcom
Ventures. Under the terms of the note, anytime after
August1, 1999, the entire principal balance and accrued
interest thereon at a rate of 90percent could be converted
into shares of the Companys ClassA Common
38 Table of Contents Stock based on a conversion price of $622 per share, subject to
adjustment for stock split, stock dividend, recapitalization or
similar events. On August24, 1999 Telecom Ventures elected
to convert its note into 845,087 shares of the Companys
Class A Common Stock. On September10, 1999 the Company entered into a
$11million promissory note with Telcom Ventures. Under the
terms of the note, the entire principal balance and accrued
interest thereon would be due on September1, 2000. The
interest was initially established at 105%, with increments in
the interest rate of 15% every 3months beginning
March1, 2000. The proceeds of the note were used to finance
the Companys investment in Italtel Sistemi see
note9. In November1999, the Company paid the note
and accrued interest thereon. In December1999, the Company issued approximately 108,000
shares of Class A Common Stock in exchange for a
$1625million note receivable from the Companys
President and Chief Executive Officer. The note is payable in
December2004 or the date he is no longer the Companys
President and Chief Executive Officer. Upon the event of a
change in control of ownership of the Company, the note will be
forgiven. Interest accrues at the federal mid-term rate on the
date of the note and is payable quarterly. The note is reflected
as a reduction of shareholders equity in the accompanying
statement of shareholders equity.
6Property and Equipment At December31, 1998 and 1999, property and equipment
consisted of the following 1998 1999 In thousands Computer equipment 8,756 12,964 Furniture and office equipment 3,533 6,371 Purchased computer software 4,696 1,248 Leasehold improvements 3,019 3,152 RF transmission towers 17,461 32,785 Vehicles 129 380 37,594 56,900 Less accumulated depreciation and amortization 15,462 19,138 22,132 37,762 7Special Charge In March1996, the Company made investments in Pocket
Communications, Inc. Pocket, formerly known as DCR
Communications, Inc. and NextWave Telecom, Inc.
NextWave of $65million and
$50million, respectively. The $65million investment
in Pocket consists of loans convertible into shares of
non-voting common stock upon the satisfaction of certain
conditions. In connection with this investment, the Company
obtained a commitment from Pocket for the purchase of services
and products aggregating $650million over the subsequent
five-year period. The $50million investment in NextWave
consists of an equity investment of approximately
17million shares. In connection with this investment, the
Company obtained a commitment from NextWave for the purchase of
services and products aggregating $500million over the
subsequent five-year period. Through December31, 1996,
revenues recognized under the commitments with Pocket and
NextWave were approximately $22million and
$113million, respectively, and related amounts receivable
were approximately $22million and $96million,
respectively. Included in the amounts receivable are notes
receivable from Pocket and NextWave of approximately $950,000 and
$59million, respectively. The notes bear interest at
prime plus 2%, and were payable upon maturity of the notes on
March31, 1997. Both customers were development stage
enterprises pursuing the buildout and operation of networks
pursuant to licenses obtained in the auction of C-Block licenses
by the FCC and subject to risks typically associated with
start-up entities, such as ithe uncertainty of securing
sufficient financing 39 Table of Contents iicompetition from other providers of telecommunications
services, iiidependence on key vendors and strategic
partners, and ivdelays encountered in the development and
successful operation of their PCS networks. On March31, 1997, Pocket failed to pay interest due the
Company under the $65million convertible loan agreement
and failed to pay principal and interest due the Company under
the $950,000 note agreement. Also on March31, 1997,
NextWave failed to pay principal and interest due under the
$59million note agreement. In addition, on April1,
1997, Pocket announced that it had voluntarily sought court
protection under Chapter11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code.
Given these developments and the uncertainty related to
Pockets and NextWaves ability to meet their future
obligations under the agreements outlined above, the Company
fully reserved its exposure with these customers and consequently
recorded a special charge of $289million pre-tax
$238million after tax or $195 per share at
December31, 1996. The $289million special charge
consisted of a reserve against the Companys aggregate
receivable exposure at December31, 1996 of
$121million net of payments of $04million received
in January1997, the recognition of an other than
temporary impairment of the Companys investments of
$115million and accruals of approximately
$53million related to loss contracts under which the
Company was obligated to perform at December31, 1996. On April15, 1997, the Company and NextWave agreed to a
revised payment schedule for amounts outstanding under the note
receivable and other receivables due from NextWave to the
Company. Under the terms of the agreement, the Company was to
receive approximately $10million per month from
May15, 1997 through May15, 1998. In addition, under
certain circumstances, in the event of the sale or issuance of
any debt or equity instruments/securities or the sale of any
assets by NextWave, the Company would be entitled to a prepayment
equal to 30% of the gross proceeds from such transactions. In
May and June1997, the Company agreed to defer
NextWaves obligations to prepay the foregoing obligations
out of the proceeds of NextWaves debt or equity financing
to August20, 1997. Payments of $20million were
received under the revised payment schedule through June30,
1997. NextWave failed to make the $10million monthly
payments which were due July15, 1997 through
October15, 1997, as well as any payment that would have
been due on August20, 1997 related to any debt or equity
financing. During September1997, the Company recognized an approximate
$39million recovery of the $289million special
charge. Of the $39million, $20million represents
the payments received through June1997 under the revised
payment schedule and $19million represents additional
payments received in April1997 from NextWave, net of
related expenses. For financial reporting purposes, the recovery
of the $39million balance was deferred pending the lapse
in the third quarter of a 90day window during which such
funds could have been subject to being treated as preference
payments recoverable by NextWave had it filed for protection
under the bankruptcy laws. During calendar 1998, NextWave also
sought court protection under Chapter11 of the U.S.
Bankruptcy Code. Pocket has filed a plan of reorganization, which is still under
consideration, but provides for little if any recovery for the
Company. NextWave has filed a plan of reorganization that has not
been confirmed pending the resolution of certain litigation
between NextWave and the Federal Communication Commission
FCC involving the FCCs right to reauction
NextWaves licenses in July, 2000.
8Restructuring Charge On October20, 1998, the Companys Board of Directors
approved a restructuring plan that resulted in a total fourth
quarter charge of approximately $25million, including
approximately $12million related to continuing operations.
The restructuring charge included $01million related to
the Companys Services businesses, $11million related
to corporate general and administrative expenses and
$13million related to the Companys products
businesses. The charge was taken to cover the one-time costs
associated with the closure of the Companys office in
Dusseldorf, Germany, a reduction in non-billable positions of
approximately 70 full and part-time employees and approximately
30 contractors. As of December31, 1999, a total liability
of approximately $01million remained, after the recovery
of approximately $03million of reserves recorded
40 Table of Contents in 1998 that were not required. The $08million is included
in other current liabilities in the accompanying consolidated
1999 balance sheet. 9Investments in Joint Ventures The Companys investment in joint ventures at
December31, 1997 consisted of a 333% interest in Koll,
which was formed in October1994 with two other unrelated
entities. Koll provides site acquisition and construction
management services to operators of wireless communications
systems in the United States. Operating costs and expenses of the
Company include services provided by Koll, in the amount of
$37,000 in 1997. The unaudited condensed financial statements of Koll as of and

membership interest in Koll bringing its total membership
interest to 1000%. Prior to the acquisition, the Company owned
333% of the membership interest, Castle Rock Telecommunications
Co., LLC CRTheld approximately 367% of the membership
interest, and Koll Management Services, Inc. KMS, held the
remaining 300%. In the transaction, Koll redeemed the ownership
interests of KMS in exchange for KMSs assumption of certain
contract rights and associated assets and liabilities. Koll also
redeemed the membership interests of CRT in exchange for an
earn-out agreement entitling CRT to 400% of the pre-tax income,
after certain adjustments, derived by Koll from certain contracts
with specified customers. During 1996, the Company entered into master service, convertible
note and stock option agreements with Communication Consulting
Services, Inc. CCS, a provider of radio frequency
engineering services in connection with the design, optimization
and operation of wireless systems. Under the master service
agreement, CCS provided the Company with radio frequency
engineers effective November1, 1996. Under the convertible
note agreement, the Company lent CCS a total of approximately
$602,000 which, at December31, 1996, was included in
long-term notes receivable in the accompanying consolidated
balance sheet. Interest accrued on the loan at a variable rate
equal to the prime rate plus 15%. Interest was payable in
arrears on the last day each of March1997, June 1997,
September1997, and December1997. The entire principal
balance, together with any unpaid interest, was due
January2, 1998. The loan was convertible, at the
Companys option, into shares representing 50% of the
authorized capital stock and/or equity securities of CCS. The
stock option agreement gives the Company an option to purchase an
additional 10% of the common stock of CCS for a total purchase
price of $150,000. On April7, 1997, the Company exercised
both the conversion right in the convertible note and the 10%
purchase right set forth in the stock option agreement. On September30, 1998, the Company sold its interest in CCS
to CCS Management for $12million. The $12million is
payable in two installments consisting of i$600,000 due
on May31, 1999 and ii$600,000 due on
November30, 1999. CCSs management failed to make
either payment during 1999 and is currently in default of the
note. Interest, equal to 9%, is due monthly on the first day of
each month, beginning January1, 1999. The initial interest
payment is for the period from October1, 1998 to
January1, 1999. As of December31, 1999, the Company
has recorded a reserve of approximately $557,000 related to the
transaction.
41 Table of Contents In September1999, the Company, through its wholly-owned
subsidiary, LCC, United Kingdom, Limited, acquired 199% of
Tecnosistemi S.p.A. formerly, Italtel Sistemi, S.p.A. for
$11million. Tecnosistemi is an Italian telecommunications
services company, and is a recently spun off division of the

described above have been included in the accompanying balance
sheet as of December31, 1998 and 1999 as follows 1998 1999 Current asset 12,050 5,083 Noncurrent asset 12,705 11,562 24,755 16,645 At December31, 1999, the Company had $221million of
U.S. Federal and state operating loss carryforwards from
continuing operations which expire between 2011 and 2019 and
foreign tax credits for U.S. tax purposes of $46million
which expire between 2001 and 2004. The Company also had $34million of foreign operating loss
carry forwards from discontinued operations which expire between
2006 and 2008. In addressing the realizability of deferred tax assets,
management considers whether it is more likely than not that some
portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized.
The ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon
the generation of future taxable income during the periods in
which those temporary differences become deductible. Management
considers the scheduled reversal of deferred tax liabilities,
projected future taxable income and tax planning strategies in
making this assessment. Avaluation allowance has been
provided for deferred tax assets which management believes are
not more likely than not to be realized. Foreign income tax expense is generated from business conducted
in countries where the Company has subsidiaries or has
established branch offices or has performed significant services
that constitute a permanent establishment for tax
reporting purposes.
11Note Payable In March1999, the Company amended and restated the credit
facility with the Chase Manhattan Bank, as Administrative Agent
Chase, together with the LCC Europe Credit
Facility the Credit Facility which was established
in 1996. The Credit Facility, consisted of a revolving loan and
letter of credit facility in an aggregate principal amount not to
exceed $200million for the Company and $25million
for LCC Europe the LCC Europe Credit Facility. Approximately $45million was outstanding under the Credit
Facility at December31, 1999. Approximately
$24million was outstanding under the LCC Europe Credit
Facility at December31, 1998 and is included in net assets
of discontinued operations in the accompanying consolidated
balance sheets. Outstanding letters of credit were
$58million and $08million at December31, 1998
and 1999, respectively. In March2000, the Credit facility
was paid-off in its entirety see note21.
12Convertible Subordinated Debt In June1994, the Company issued to MCI Worldcom
MCIa $200million convertible Subordinated Note Due
2000 the Subordinated Note. The Subordinated Note
bore interest at a rate equal to 68%, payable semiannually. The
entire principal amount of the Subordinated Note was due in
June2000. In June1994, Telcom Ventures issued a $300million
convertible Subordinated Note Due 2000 the Telcom Ventures
Subordinated Note to the same investor. The Telcom
Ventures Subordinated Note bore interest at a rate equal to 68 payable semiannually. Effective September27, 1996, in
connection with the Companys initial public offering of
ClassA Common Stock, the Company assumed the
$300million Telcom Ventures Subordinated Note from Telcom
Ventures. As a result of this assumption the Company has the
exclusive right to exercise all Telcom Ventures rights
under the Telcom Ventures Subordinated Note and is solely
responsible for the payment of interest and principal thereunder.
44 Table of Contents On October23, 1997, the Company announced it had agreed
with MCI to defer the Companys option to convert the notes
in 1997. As per the arrangement, interest payable was reduced
from 68% to 44% per annum. On July13, 1999, the Company received notice of conversion
from MCI of its convertible subordinated notes in the aggregate
principal amount of $500million. The notes were converted
into 2,841,099 shares of the Companys Class A Common Stock

13Health and Retirement Plans The Company has a defined contribution profit sharing plan under
Section 401k of the IRC that provides for voluntary employee
contributions of 10 to 150percent of compensation for
substantially all employees. The Company makes a matching
contribution of 500percent of an employees
contribution up to 60percent of each employees
compensation. Company contributions and other expenses associated
with the plan were approximately $444,000, $652,000 and $548,000
for the years ended December31, 1997, 1998, and 1999,
respectively. The Company is self-insured for group health, life, and short and
long-term disability claims up to certain stop losses.
14Incentive Plans At December31, 1997, 1998, and 1999 the Company had two
stock-based incentive plans, an employee stock purchase plan and
an employee stock option plan, which are described below. The
Company applies APB Opinion No25 and related
interpretations in accounting for its plans. Accordingly, no
compensation cost has been recognized for its fixed stock option
plans and employee stock purchase plan. Had compensation cost for
the Companys stock-based compensation plans and employee
stock purchase plan been determined on the fair value at the
grant dates for awards under those plans, consistent with
Financial Accounting Standards Board Statement No123
SFAS No123, the Companys income
lossfrom continuing operations and income
lossfrom continuing operations per share would have been
reduced to the pro forma amounts indicated below. 1997 1998 1999 Pro forma Pro forma Pro forma In thousands, except per share data Income loss from continuing operations As reported 5,390 6,958 6,212 Pro forma 3,262 9,312 7,613 Income lossfrom continuing operations per share As reported Basic 037 045 036 Diluted 034 045 036 Pro forma Basic 022 060 044 Diluted 020 060 044 Income lossfrom continuing operations reflects only
options granted in 1997, 1998 and 1999. Therefore, the full
impact of calculating compensation cost for stock options under
SFAS No123 is not reflected in the pro forma net income
lossamounts presented above as compensation cost is
reflected over the options vesting period of up to
five-years.
45 Table of Contents The per share weighted-average fair value of stock options
granted during 1997, 1998 and 1999 was $841, $1002 and $388,
respectively, on the date of grant using the Black Scholes
option-pricing model with the following weighted-average
assumptions 1997 1998 1999 Expected dividend yield 0 0 0 Risk-free interest rate 60 50 60 Expected life 2-8 years 2-8 years 3-5 years Volatility 650 650 600 Under the Companys Employee Stock Purchase Plan, 360,000
shares of Class A Common Stock were available for purchase by
eligible employees of the Company beginning in 1997. Rights to
purchase shares are deemed granted to participating employees as
of the beginning of each applicable period, as specified by the
Compensation and Stock Option Committee of the Companys
Board of Directors. The purchase price for each share is not less
than 85% of the fair market value of the share of ClassA
Common Stock on the first or last trading day of such period,
whichever is lower. Under the Employee Stock Purchase Plan, the
Company sold 65,448 shares to employees in 1997, 100,710 shares
to employees in 1998, and 55,898 shares in 1999. Compensation
cost of approximately $161,000, $175,000, and $54,000,
respectively, would have been recognized under SFAS No123
for the fair value of the employees purchase rights and is
included in proforma net income loss from continuing operations
above. Compensation cost was estimated using the Black Scholes
model with the following assumptions. 1997 1998 1999 Expected dividend yield 0 0 0 Expected life 3 months 3 months 1-3 months Volatility 65 65 60-70 Risk-free interest rate 3 25-30 3 The weighted average fair value of the purchase rights granted in
1997, 1998, and 1999 was $246, $174, and $096, respectively. In April1994, the Company adopted the Phantom Membership
Plan the Phantom Membership Plan. Under the Phantom
Membership Plan, the Members Committee was authorized to grant
awards Phantom Membership Awards to those employees
of the Company whose responsibilities and decisions, in the
Members Committees opinion, affect the long-term sustained
growth and profitability of the Company. Each Phantom Membership
Award entitled the recipient thereof to receive, no later than
May 1 of each year, an annual award based on a specified
percentage of the Companys net income for the preceding
fiscal year. The Phantom Membership Plan also included a
long-term award. Under the long-term award, once a Phantom
Membership Award was fully vested, the recipient had the right to
require the Company to purchase, and the Company had the right
to require such recipient to sell, all or any portion of the
recipients Phantom Membership Award based on the fair
market value of the Company as defined under the Phantom
Membership Plan. In connection with the Companys initial
public offering, all long-term awards granted under the Phantom
Membership Plan were replaced with options granted under the 1996
Employee Stock Option Plan and the annual award feature of the
Phantom Membership Plan was terminated. The options vest over the
original vesting period of the Phantom Membership Plan awards,
generally ratably over, or at the end of, 3 or 5years. Non-cash compensation related to the long-term award feature of
the Phantom Membership Plan, including compensation expense for
membership awards converted to stock options under the 1996
Employee Stock Option Plan, was $05 million, $04million,
and $3,000 for 1997, 1998, and 1999, respectively. The liability
for which was included in paid-in capital in the accompanying
consolidated balance sheets. In connection with its initial public offering, the Company
established the 1996 Employee Stock Option Plan, which authorized
the issuance of up to 3,224,000 shares of ClassA Common
Stock pursuant to options
46 Table of Contents granted under the plan. An additional 1,501,000 shares of
ClassA Common Stock were reserved under the 1996 Employee
Stock Option Plan in 1998. Options granted pursuant to the plan
vest ratably over a period of four years and expire ten years
after the date of grant. In July1999, the Board amended the
1996 Employee Stock Option Plan to provide for accelerated
vesting in the event of a change in control of the Company or a
sale of all or substantially all of its assets. In late 1999 and
early 2000, the Board of Directors adopted amendments to the 1996
Employee Stock Option Plan increasing the total number of shares
reserved by 4,100,000 shares so that the aggregate number of
shares reserved for issuance is 8,825,000. This increase adopted
by the Board of Directors is subject to approval of the
Companys shareholders at the year 2000 annual meeting on
May16, 2000. Also in connection with the Companys initial public
offering, the Company established the 1996 Directors Stock
Option Plan. The Directors Plan provides for the
formula grant of options, and authorizes the issuance
of up to 60,000 shares of ClassA Common Stock and 250,000
shares of ClassB Common Stock. An additional 80,000 shares
of ClassA Common Stock were reserved under the
Directors Plan in 1998 and, subject to shareholder
approval, an additional 110,000 shares of ClassA Common
Stock will be reserved under the Directors Plan in 2000.
The option exercise price for options granted under the
Directors Plan is 100% of the fair value of the shares on
the date of grant. Each eligible director who is not eligible to
hold shares of ClassB Common Stock was granted an initial
option to purchase 10,000 shares of ClassA Common Stock in
connection with the offering. Each eligible director who is
eligible to hold shares of ClassB Common Stock and who was
a director as of the offering was granted an initial option to
purchase 35,000 shares of ClassB Common Stock in connection
with the offering, and will be granted additional options to
purchase 22,500 shares of ClassB Common Stock as of each of
the next four annual meetings of the stockholders of the Company
if the director continues to be an eligible director. Options
granted with respect to ClassA Common Stock will become
immediately exercisable with respect to directors who were
directors of the Company prior to July1, 1996, and will
become exercisable with respect to one-third of the shares of
ClassA Common Stock that are subject to the options on each
of the first three anniversaries of the date of grant subject to
acceleration of vesting on a change of control with respect to
directors who became directors of the Company after July1,
1996. The Company has reserved 85,000 shares of ClassA Common
Stock for issuance pursuant to options to be granted to a person
or entity designated by The Carlyle Group. The option exercise
price for these options are and will be 100% of the fair market
value of the ClassA Common Stock on the date of grant of
the option. An initial option to purchase 25,000 shares of
ClassA Common Stock was granted in connection with the
Offering, and an additional option was or will be granted to
purchase 15,000 shares of ClassA Common Stock on each of
the next four anniversaries of the initial date of grant. Options
granted will vest immediately. The options will expire no later
than the fifth anniversary of the date of grant. On December11, 1998, the Company re-priced substantially
all options previously granted under the 1996 Employee Stock
Option Plan to $500 per share which exceeded the fair market

Under the Incentive Compensation Plan, the Members Committee was
authorized to grant awards Incentive Awards to
those employees of the Company whose responsibilities and
decisions, in the Members Committees opinion, affect the
long-term sustained growth and profitability of the Company. Each Incentive Award entitles the recipient thereof to receive a
cash payment on the date specified in the corresponding award
agreement. As of December31, 1994 and 1995, 20 and 60
employees, respectively, had been granted Incentive Awards under
the Incentive Compensation Plan. No new grants were made
subsequent to 1995. Compensation expense accrued in connection

$409,000 and $4,000 for the years ended December31, 1997
and 1998, respectively, which has been included in other current
liabilities in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. As

Incentive Compensation Plan were paid in full.
15Lease Commitments The Company leases office facilities and certain equipment,
principally in the United States, under operating leases expiring
on various dates over the next eight years. The lease agreements
include renewal options and provisions for rental escalations
based on the Consumer Price Index and require the Company to pay
for executory costs such as taxes and insurance. The lease
agreements also allow the Company to elect an early out provision
by giving notice and paying certain lease termination penalties. Benefits associated with a rent abatement period and certain
lease incentives for office facilities are reflected ratably over
the period of the lease. For leases which have been terminated
see below, the applicable portion of the benefit has been
offset against the lease termination penalty. The total deferred
rent benefit was approximately $763,000 and $874,000 at
December31, 1998 and 1999, respectively. Future minimum rental payments and receivables under
non-cancelable operating leases, excluding executory costs, are

and claims incidental to its business. Management does not
believe that these matters will have a material adverse effect on
the consolidated results of operations or financial condition of
the Company. Albert Grimes et al. V LCC International, Inc. et al.,
Civil Action No16957-NC, in the Court of Chancery of the
State of Delaware, Castle County. On February12, 1999, the
minority shareholders of the Companys majority-owned
Microcell subsidiary filed a suit against the Company, the
directors appointed by the Company to the Microcell Board and
Microcell itself, seeking rescission of the shareholders
agreement between the Company and the minority shareholders
which concerns management of Microcell, funding commitments and
other matters, the appointment of a custodian or receiver, and
unspecified monetary damages. In connection with the sale of the
Company towers to Pinnacle Towers, Inc., the parties settled all
pending litigation, and all claims were dismissed with prejudice
on March7, 2000.
17Earnings Per Share During 1997 the Company adopted Financial Accounting Standards
Board Statement No128, Earnings per Share
SFAS No128. SFAS No128
supersedes Accounting Principles Board Opinion No15, 
Earnings per Share and its related
interpretations and promulgates new accounting standards for the
computation and manner of presentation of the Companys
earnings per share data. Under SFAS No128 the Company is
required to present basic and diluted earnings per share. Basic
earnings per share excludes dilution and is computed by dividing
income available to common stockholders by the weighted average
number of common shares outstanding for the period. Diluted
earnings per share reflects the potential dilution that could
occur if securities or other contracts to issue common stock were
exercised or converted into common stock or resulted in the
issuance of common stock that shared in the earnings of the
Company. The reconciliation of
49 Table of Contents the basic and diluted earnings per share computations for the

into 28million shares of the Companys ClassA
Common Stock during 1999. The convertible subordinated debt, was
outstanding during calendar 1997 and 1998, but was not included
in the computation of diluted earnings per share because the
effect of which would have been anti-dilutive. Options to
purchase 22million and 28million shares of
ClassA Common Stock were outstanding during 1998 and 1999,
respectively, but were not included in the computation of diluted
earnings per share because the effect of which would have been
anti-dilutive.
18Segment Reporting The Company adopted SFAS No131, Disclosures about
Segments of an Enterprise and Related Information, during the
fourth quarter of 1998. SFAS No. 131 established standards for
reporting information about the operating segments in interim and
annual financial reports issued to stockholders. It also
established standards for related disclosures about products and
services and geographic areas. Operating segments are defined as
components of an enterprise about which separate financial
information is available that is evaluated regularly by the chief
operating decision maker, or decision making group, in deciding
how to allocate resources and assess performance. The
Companys chief operating decision making group is the
Executive Committee which is comprised of the Chief Operating
Officer and the lead executives of each of the Companys
operating segments. The operating segments are managed separately
because each operating segment represents a strategic business
unit that offers distinct services. The Companys operating segments include Services
Engineering and Design Services and Program Management Services
and Tower ownership and management. Engineering and Design
Services provides engineering and design services for cellular
phone system operators, personal communication system
PCS operators and other wireless communication
systems providers. Program Management Services provides program
and construction management services related to the build-out of
wireless communication systems. Tower ownership and management
acquires, builds, owns and manages telecommunications towers. The accounting policies of the operating segments are the same as
those described in the summary of significant accounting
policies. The Company evaluates performance based on stand alone
operating segment
50 Table of Contents profit or loss from operations before income taxes not including
nonrecurring gains and losses, and generally accounts for
intersegment sales and transfers as if the sales or transfers
were to third parties, that is, at current market prices.
Interdivisional transactions are eliminated in consolidation.
Revenues are attributed to geographic areas based on the location
of the assignment.

cash equivalents, accounts and notes receivable, and accounts
payable approximated fair value as of December31, 1998 and
1999 because of the relatively short duration of these
instruments. Convertible subordinated debt the fair value
at December31, 1998 is based on the fair market value of
the ClassA Common Stock assuming conversion into 2,841,099
shares. Notes receivable from shareholders the
carrying value of the notes receivable approximated the fair
value as the instruments included a market rate of interest.
55 Table of Contents Letters of credit the fair value of letters of
credit was estimated based on fees currently charged for similar
agreements or the estimated cost to terminate or settle the
obligations. Financial guarantees are conditional commitments issued by the
Company to guarantee the payment of certain liabilities of
unconsolidated affiliates. No such guarantees were outstanding at
December31, 1998 or 1999.
21Subsequent Events From January1, 2000 to March3, 2000 the Company
borrowed a total of $97million under its Credit Facility
with Chase. In March2000, the Company used approximately
$144million of the proceeds from the sale of its tower
portfolio see below to repay the Companys outstanding
balance under the Credit Facility. The Credit Facility was then
terminated and all of Chases liens and security interests
in the Companys assets were released. On February15, 2000, Microcell Management, Inc., a
subsidiary of LCC International, Inc., and the Company entered
into a Settlement and Release Agreement Settlement
Agreement with the minority shareholders of Microcell.
Pursuant to the Settlement Agreement, the 1625% minority
shareholder interest was redeemed for approximately
$42million. Pursuant also to the Settlement Agreement, the
pending litigation involving LCC, Microcell, and the minority
shareholders was settled and dismissed with prejudice. As a
result of the redemption, Microcell became a wholly-owned
subsidiary of the Company. On March3, 2000, Microcell completed the initial closing of
the sale of its telecommunication tower portfolio to Pinnacle
Towers Inc. Pinnacle pursuant to an Asset Purchase
Agreement between Pinnacle and Microcell. Pursuant to the Asset
Purchase Agreement, Microcell agreed to sell up to 197tower
sites owned or to be constructed by Microcell for a total
purchase of $80million in cash payable when the sites are
conveyed to Pinnacle. At the initial closing, 134 tower sites
were conveyed to Pinnacle for proceeds of $567million. The
Company used approximately $144million of the proceeds
from the initial closing to repay the Companys outstanding
obligations under the Credit Facility. In addition, approximately
$40million was applied to or reserved for transaction
costs, $42million was applied to redeem the minority
shares under the Settlement Agreement as described above and the
balance of $341million held for current operating
activities. As a part of the sale transaction, Microcell and
Pinnacle entered into a Master Antenna Site Lease pursuant to
which Microcell has agreed to lease, until December31,
2002, the unoccupied space on each telecommunication tower sold
to Pinnacle see note15. Microcell and Pinnacle have also
entered into a Tower Services Agreement pursuant to which
Microcell will provide Pinnacle with site audit, maintenance, and
program management services regarding site improvements and
capacity upgrades for an initial 204sites and additional
sites for which Pinnacle deems the services are necessary. The
Services Agreement provides for minimum annual payments to
Microcell of $10million for project management and site
audit services; it also provides for approximately
$10million per year for maintenance services based on the
current number of sites as to which Microcell has been engaged.
