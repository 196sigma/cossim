1. Description of
Business and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Description
of Business and Company Organization. We
deliver chemistry products and services, software products and services along
with analytical services that advance customers' creativity and productivity in
pharmaceutical, biotechnology and related life sciences research enterprises
worldwide. A substantial portion of our business is conducted with
pharmaceutical companies.
During 2005, 46% of our revenue came from our relationships with Pfizer, Inc.
while in 2004, 54% and in 2003, 52%, of our global revenue was from Pfizer.
Our four-year file enrichment project with Pfizer was completed during the
fourth quarter of 2005. Basis
of Consolidation. The accompanying
consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Tripos and its wholly
owned subsidiaries. All significant intercompany accounts and transactions are
eliminated in consolidation. Investments in affiliates, owned more than 20 but not in excess of 50%, are recorded on the equity method. Investments in
unconsolidated affiliates less than 20% owned are accounted for under the cost
method, except for those investments classified as marketable securities. Our
ownership in un-consolidated affiliates is at or below 2% owned at December 31,
2005. Cash
and Cash Equivalents are highly
liquid investments with maturities of three months or less from the date
purchased. Marketable
Securities consist of investments in
equity securities of unconsolidated affiliates that are held as
available-for-sale and foreign currency exchange contracts that do not qualify
for hedge accounting. We account for securities that can be sold within the
next 12 months as marketable securities. Amounts presented are the fair values
of the investments on the balance sheet date determined using then current
market quotes. Unrealized gains and losses are recorded as increases or
decreases in the assets' value pre-tax basis with corresponding entries
reflected in Other Comprehensive Income and Deferred Taxes until the assets are
sold. See Note 9 Financial Instruments for a further discussion of
foreign currency exchange instruments. During the first and second quarters of
2005 we sold our remaining shares of NuVasive, Inc. We had no marketable securities
at December 31, 2005. Marketable securities at December 31, 2004 consisted of
33 shares of NuVasive, Inc. which had a market value of $341. Other
Comprehensive Income at December 31, 2005 and 2004 included an accumulated
unrealized after-tax gain of $0 and $96, respectively, as calculated on an
average cost per share basis. Investments
Recorded at Cost consist of
investments in common stock and limited partnerships that are accounted for
under the cost method as permitted under Accounting Principles Board Opinion
No. 18. Accounts
Receivable includes current
outstanding invoices billed to customers. Invoices are typically issued with
Net 30-day terms upon shipment of product or upon achievement of billable
events for service-based contracts. Our bad debt experience from uncollectible
accounts has historically been immaterial. As a result, we provide a reserve
for bad debts on a specific account basis if and when customer payment problems
arise. Capitalization and Valuation of Chemical Compound
Costs. Initial
costs to develop our LeadQuest compounds chemical compounds for sale for
use in drug discovery are categorized as research and development expense
until such time as it is probable that a salable library can be successfully
produced. Therefore, costs for design, research, and analytical procedures for
every library of compounds are expensed as incurred. Our research chemists
review the results of analytical procedures to determine if the chemical
reactions completed are as expected and the product purity and product yields
are within acceptable tolerances. This validation process
determines whether the chemistry is successful and if a saleable product will
result. We capitalize costs to inventory once the validation process is completed
and successful production is reasonably assured. If the core reaction is
unsuccessful, the library template is abandoned and no further development
takes place. Similarly, we capitalize the costs of
LeadDiscovery packages once we achieve validation and are reasonably assured of
the success of the underlying chemistry. After this point we capture the costs
of labor, chemicals and screening activity into work in process inventory.
Should a LeadDiscovery library not reach its full potential as a standalone
offering, we can utilize the products within discovery research contracts for
customers or in our LeadQuest compound library. Inventory amounts shown in the Consolidated
Balance Sheet are net of an obsolescence reserve. In calculating the reserve
for inventory held for sale, the age and sales trends of each category in the
inventory are taken into account to determine the net realizable value. Any
shortfall between the carrying cost of the inventory and 1.
Description of Business and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies
continued the net realizable value is provided for in the
reserve. A portion of the LeadQuest inventory is used in discovery research
projects. This portion of the inventory asset is depreciated over its 10-year
expected useful life. Accounting
Estimates. The preparation of
financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally
accepted in the United States requires management to make estimates and
assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities and the
disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial
statements as well as the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the
reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. Property
and Equipment are stated at cost.
Depreciation is computed by applying an accelerated method over the estimated
useful lives of the assets, which range from five to ten years for equipment
and furniture, twenty-five to thirty-nine years for buildings, the shorter of
the useful life of the improvement or the life of the related lease term for
leasehold improvements, and three years for purchased software. We seek to match
the book useful life of our assets to their expected productive lives. Assets
deemed to be impaired or no longer productive, are written down to their net
realizable value. Capitalized
interest. The interest cost
associated with major development and construction projects is capitalized and
included in the cost of the project or asset. Capitalization of interest
ceases when the project is substantially complete. Capitalized interest for
2005, 2004 and 2003 was $0, $39 and $257, respectively. Development Costs primarily consist of
software development costs related to new products that are capitalized after
the establishment of technological feasibility working model in accordance
with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards SFAS No. 86.
During 2005, 2004 and 2003 capitalized costs were $1,715, $639 and $1,272,
respectively related to development work on our Benchware Notebook, Benchware
Dock and GALAHAD products in 2004 and 2005. For 2003, capitalized costs
related to a laboratory research and inventory support system, ChemCore RIO, to
be marketed to external customers. Amortization of capitalized software
development costs is provided on a product-by-product basis as the greater of
a the ratio of current gross revenues for a product to the total current and
anticipated future gross revenues or b the straight-line method over the
remaining estimated economic life of the product. Currently, we use an
estimated economic life of three to five years for all capitalized software
development costs. We assess the recoverability of capitalized software
development costs by comparing the remaining unamortized balance to the net
realizable value of the related product. Any excess is written off. During
the fourth quarter of 2005 and 2004 we wrote down one of our capitalized
products, ChemCore RIO, by $1,313 and $890, respectively, to properly reflect
the current net realizable value of the product based upon the change in target
market customer base. This software product remains valuable to the company
for future projects, but is not currently projected to generate revenue in the
near term. For 2005, 2004 and 2003, amortization of software developed for
sale was $270, $6 and $258, respectively. At times, we capitalize development
costs attributable to internal use software in accordance with AICPA Statement
of Position 98-1 Accounting for the Costs of Computer Software Developed
or Obtained for Internal Use. Amortization of internal use software is
over the estimated useful life or three years, which ever is less. During 2004
we wrote off the cost and accumulated amortization for fully amortized
capitalized software assets for internal use in the amount of $544. Goodwill
and Other Intangible Assets. Goodwill
represents the excess of the cost of the net assets acquired in acquisitions
over their fair value. Beginning in 2002, we have adopted Statement of
Accounting Standard No. 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets
FAS 142, that suspends amortization of goodwill in favor of
annual evaluations of impairment by comparing the fair value of the business to
which the goodwill relates to its carrying value. If it is determined that the
carrying value exceeds the fair value, we would recognize an impairment loss in
earnings at that time. Other identifiable intangible assets with finite lives,
such as patents and software products acquired in an acquisition, are amortized
on a straight-line basis over their estimated lives as follows: acquired
software 5 to 20 years; non-compete agreements 2 to 4 years; and trademarks and
patents 10 to 17 years. See Note 12 Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets for
further discussion. Long-Lived Assets. In accordance with
Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 144, Accounting for the
Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets, the Company reviews
identified intangible and other long-lived assets for impairment whenever
events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the
asset may not be recoverable. If such events or changes in circumstances are
present, an impairment loss would be recognized if the sum of the expected
future net cash flows is less than the carrying amount of the asset. During
the fourth quarter of 2005, we completed our four-year $90 million file
enrichment contract with Pfizer. At that time, we reviewed the carrying values 1.
Description of Business and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies
continued of our long-lived assets related to our
discovery research business in the UK and determined that a temporary
laboratory building was no longer required and thus impaired. We recorded an
impairment loss related to this building in the amount of $861K, equating to
its net book value. This charge is reflected in the Restructuring line on our
Consolidated Statements of Operations. Foreign
Currency Translation. The local
foreign currency is the functional currency for each of our foreign
operations. Assets and liabilities of foreign operations are translated to
U.S. dollars at the current exchange rates as of the applicable balance sheet
date. Revenues and expenses are translated at the average exchange rates
prevailing during the period. Adjustments resulting from translation are
reported as a separate component of shareholders' equity. Net gains and losses
from foreign currency transactions were significant during 2005, 2004 and 2003
due to fluctuations in the exchange rate between the U.S. dollar and the Euro
and Great Britain pound. We hedged a portion of our exposure and recorded the
gains and losses from this activity in other income expense, as they did not
qualify for hedge accounting under FAS 133. Derivative
Instruments. The
Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Statement No. 133, Accounting
for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities FAS 133,
which requires us to recognize all derivatives on the balance sheet at fair
value. We enter into derivative contracts, principally currency hedges, to
limit the risk of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates on the value
of certain sales transactions. Additionally, we have previously entered
interest rate swap contracts that effectively convert portions of our floating
rate debt to a fixed rate and therefore mitigate interest rate risk. No
interest rate swaps were outstanding as of December 31, 2005. We do not
attempt to speculate on the direction of currency rates nor interest rates.
See Note 9 for a further discussion of Financial Instruments. Warranty.
We warrant our application software
products to perform in accordance with written user documentation and the
agreements negotiated with our customers. Since we do not customize our
applications software, warranty costs are insignificant and expensed as
incurred. Income
Taxes We account for income taxes in
accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 109 FAS109,
Accounting for Income Taxes, which prescribes the use of the asset
and liability method whereby deferred tax assets or liabilities are calculated
at the balance sheet date using current tax laws and rates in effect.
Valuation allowances are established when necessary to reduce deferred tax
assets when it is more likely than not that a portion or all of the deferred
tax assets will not be realized. In accordance with FAS No. 109, income tax
expense includes 1 deferred tax expense, which generally represents the net
change in the deferred tax asset or liability balance during the year plus any
change in valuation allowances, and 2 current tax expense, which represents
the amount of tax currently payable to or receivable from a taxing authority.
The primary difference between financial statement income and taxable income
results from the use of different methods of computing depreciation,
capitalized development costs, certain revenue recognition activities, other
timing differences and the valuation of net operating loss carryforwards.
Deferred taxes do not reflect temporary differences relating to our investment
in foreign subsidiaries as these amounts have been deemed to be permanently
invested. Estimating the deferred tax position on these amounts is not
practical. Revenue
Recognition Discovery
Informatics Products and Support We recognize revenues in accordance with the
American Institute of Certified Public Accountants AICPA Statement of
Position SOP 97-2, Software Revenue Recognition, as amended.
Revenues from software license agreements are recognized when all of the
following criteria are met as set forth in paragraph 8 of SOP 97-2: 1
persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, 2 delivery has occurred, 3
the fee is fixed or determinable, and 4 collectibility is probable. Our largest sources of software license revenue
are from Term and Bundled licenses that are time-based arrangements for one or
multiple software products that are sold together with maintenance and support
for the term of the license arrangement. We do not have Vendor Specific
Objective Evidence VSOE to determine fair value of the maintenance and
support in term arrangements and therefore recognize revenues from these
bundled time-based licenses ratably over the license term, which typically
range from 1 to 3 years. We allocate revenues from perpetual software
arrangements involving multiple elements to each element based on the relative
fair values as determined by the VSOE for each element. We limit our
assessment of VSOE for each element to the price charged when the same element
is sold separately. We have analyzed all of the elements included in our multiple 1.
Description of Business and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies continued element arrangements and determined that we have
sufficient VSOE to allocate revenues to maintenance and support services, and
training. We sell training separately and have established VSOE on this
basis. VSOE for maintenance and support is determined based upon the renewal
rates in contracts themselves, which is based on a fixed percentage of the
current perpetual license list price. Accordingly, assuming all other revenue
recognition criteria are met, revenues from perpetual licenses are recognized
upon delivery of the software using the residual method in accordance with SOP
98-9, Modification of SOP 97-2, Software Revenue Recognition, with
Respect to Certain Transactions. Software maintenance agreements provide
technical support and the right to unspecified enhancements and upgrades on a
when-and-if-available basis. Post-contract support revenues on
perpetual agreements are recognized ratably over the term of the support period
generally one year, and training and other service revenues are recognized as
the related services are provided. Any unrecognized portion of amounts paid in
advance for licenses and services is recorded as deferred revenue. Discovery
Informatics Services Discovery Informatics Services DIS represent
contracts for the development of packaged Tripos software and/or for the
development and delivery of enterprise-wide customized software such as
laboratory information systems or database integration projects.
Technological feasibility exists on these software arrangements as they
normally leverage our existing products or techniques. These arrangements
typically include installation at the customer site. We account for these
arrangements in accordance with SOP 81-1, as required by SOP 97-2 since the contract
to deliver software and installation requires significant production,
modification or customization of software. In applying the provisions of SOP 81-1 the
percentage of completion is utilized. For contracts where customer approval of
contractually required tasks must occur at each distinct milestone, and where
amounts billable are indicative of progress-to-completion, we record revenues
when a milestone has been met and accepted by the customer. For contracts
without distinct milestones, we measure progress using the cost-to-cost method
cumulative costs as a percentage of total expected costs to complete, which
approximates progress towards completion. When current estimates of total
contract revenue and contract cost indicate a loss, a provision for the entire
loss on the contract is made in the period that the loss becomes evident. DIS also includes software development
SD projects that are contractual arrangements with customers for
use of our software developers in an effort to develop a scientific software
tool for use in drug discovery. Billings may be on a time and materials basis;
accordingly, we record the related revenue when the time and costs are incurred
at the stated contractual rates. Other contracts may be accounted for under
milestone or completed contract basis depending on the negotiated terms. For
these arrangements, cost and revenues are deferred until achievement of the
milestone or completion of the contract. Discovery Research
Products and Services Discovery research sales include: 1 sales of
chemical compounds from inventory, 2 sales of compounds with associated
exclusive intellectual property, 3 long-term contracts to design and produce
chemical compounds to customer specifications, or 4 contracts to perform
discovery research activities. We recognize revenue from the sale of chemical
compounds upon shipment of the products, FOB shipping point to the customer.
This practice is consistent with the four criteria required for revenue
recognition listed in paragraph 1 of Staff Accounting Bulletin SAB 104
issued by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission SEC. For chemical
compound transactions, persuasive evidence of an agreement exists upon the
receipt of a contract outlining the purchase and usage terms of the compounds.
A purchase order may also be received as confirmation. As stated above,
revenue is not recognized until the compounds have been shipped to the
customer. The selling price for compounds is fixed according to the terms of
the contract or customer purchase order. Payment terms for chemical compound
transactions are Net 30 days. We have experienced very few bad debts arising
from these product transactions; as a result, collectibility is reasonably
assured. In accordance with SOP 81-1, sales derived from
long-term contracts to design and produce chemical compounds to customer
specifications are recorded using the percentage of completion method as the
finished goods are delivered under the units of delivery method. The
contract costs related to delivered compounds are recorded to cost of sales as
the 1.
Description of Business and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies
continued compounds are delivered and revenue is
recognized. Discovery research activities involve lead
compound optimization projects, custom synthesis, and compound design. These
contracts generally call for non-refundable contractual fees tied to time and
materials. Accordingly, revenues under contracts of this type are recorded on
a time and material basis. When contracts to perform discovery research
activities require a specific deliverable, the direct and incremental contract
costs are deferred. Revenue and the contract costs are then recognized upon
delivery and acceptance. An access fee for our LeadDiscovery programs is
recognized upon completion of a materials transfer agreement and shipment of
selected compounds to the customer for screening purposes. Should the customer
decide to retain exclusive rights to promising compounds in the selection, an
additional fee is required. Customers may engage Tripos for discovery research
services to further refine the lead compound for additional fees. Hardware Sales Hardware sales are recorded upon delivery unless
delivered in connection with a contractual arrangement involving term software
licenses. When hardware is sold in conjunction with a term or bundled license,
the entire contractual revenue amount is recognized ratably over the term or
bundled software license period and the related hardware costs are deferred and
recorded in cost of sales ratably over the same period. Stock-Based
Compensation. At December 31, 2005,
Tripos had the stock-based employee compensation plans described in Note 24.
We account for stock option plans under the intrinsic value method as permitted
under Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 25 APB 25,
Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees, and related
Interpretations. Under APB 25, generally no compensation expense is recognized
because the exercise price of the options equal the fair value of the stock at
the grant date. The
following table illustrates the effect on net income and earnings per share if
the Company had applied the fair value recognition provisions of SFAS No. 123,
Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation, to stock-based employee
compensation. Our stock option plans have fixed stock option awards grants
that vest over a period of four years pro-rata. The impact shown below
reflects the proforma expense method of applying SFAS No. 123.

earnings loss per common share is computed using the weighted average number
of common shares outstanding during the year. Diluted earnings loss per
common share is computed using the weighted average number of common shares and
potential dilutive common shares that were outstanding during the period.
Potential dilutive common shares may consist of outstanding stock options and
warrants. See Note 14 for additional information regarding earnings per share. Reclassifications. Certain reclassifications have been made to prior
years' balances to conform with the current year presentation. 1. Description of
Business and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies continued Comprehensive Income. Financial Accounting
Standards Board SFAS No. 130, Reporting Comprehensive Income
establishes standards for reporting and display of comprehensive income and its
components revenue, gains and losses in a full set of general purpose
financial statements. SFAS No. 130 requires that all components of
comprehensive income, including net income, be reported in a financial statement
that is displayed with the same prominence as other financial statements.
Comprehensive income is defined as the change in equity during a period from
transactions and other events and circumstances from non-owner sources. Net
income and other comprehensive income, including foreign currency translation
adjustments, and unrealized gains and losses on investments, shall be reported,
net of their related tax effect, to arrive at comprehensive income. The components of

New Accounting Pronouncements. In November 2004, the Financial Accounting Standards
Board FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards
SFAS No. 151 Inventory Costs-an amendment of ARB No. 43,
Chapter 4 FAS 151. FAS 151 clarifies the accounting for
abnormal amounts of idle facility expense, freight, handling costs, and wasted
material spoilage to require that these items be included as current-period
charges and not included in overhead. In addition, FAS 151 requires that
allocation of fixed production overheads to the costs of conversion be based on
the normal capacity of the production facilities. The provisions in FAS 151
are effective for inventory costs incurred during fiscal years beginning after
June 15, 2005. We have adopted FAS 151 for the fiscal year beginning January
1, 2006 and are estimating $900,000 to $10 million of idle facility costs in
2006 which will be recorded as current period costs in general and
administrative expenses. The upcoming adoption of FAS 151 coincides with the
generation of excess plant capacity resulting from the completion of the Pfizer
contract in December 2005. In
December 2004, the FASB issued SFAS No. 123 revised 2004, Share-Based
Payment FAS 123R, which revises and replaces SFAS No. 123,
Accounting for Stock-Based Payment and supersedes APB Opinion No.
25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees. FAS 123R requires
the measurement of all share-based payments to employees, including grants of
employee stock options, using a fair-value based method and the recording of
such expense in our consolidated statements of operations. The pro-forma
disclosures previously permitted under SFAS No. 123 will no longer be an
alternative to financial statement recognition. The provisions of FAS 123R
were to have been effective for reporting periods beginning after June 15,
2005. At the end of March, the SEC staff released Staff Accounting Bulletin
No. 107 SAB 107, providing guidance for implementing FASB Statement No. 123
revised 2004, Share-Based Payment Statement 123R. Subsequently, the
Commission delayed the implementation dates for Statement 123R to the start of
a Company fiscal year. As a result, we will be required to comply with the
provisions of FAS 123R beginning January 1, 2006. Based upon information
available we are expecting net income to be reduced by approximately $570 in
2006 related to additional compensation expense for outstanding stock options
and issuances under our Employee Stock Purchase Plan using the modified
prospective application. In
May 2005, the FASB issued SFAS No. 154 Accounting Changes and Error
Corrections-a replacement of APB Opinion No. 20 and FASB Statement No. 3
FAS 154. FAS 154 requires retrospective application to prior
periods' financial statements of changes in accounting principle, unless it is
impracticable to determine either the period-specific effects or the cumulative
effect of the change. When it is impracticable to determine the
period-specific effects of an accounting change on one or more individual prior
periods presented, FAS 154 requires that the new accounting principle be
applied to the balances of assets and liabilities as of the beginning of the
earliest period for which retrospective application is practicable and that a
corresponding adjustment be made to the opening balance of retained earnings
for that period rather than being reported in an income statement. When it is
impracticable to determine the cumulative effect of applying a change in
accounting principle to all prior periods, then FAS 154 requires that the new
accounting principle be applied as if it were adopted prospectively from the
earliest date practicable. The provisions of FAS 154 are effective for
accounting changes and corrections of errors made in fiscal years beginning
after December 15, 2005. In May 2005, the FASB issued
FASB Staff Position No. EITF 00-19-1 Application of EITF Issue No. 00-19
to Freestanding Financial Instruments Originally Issued as Employee Compensation
FSP EITF 00-19-1. FSP EITF00-19-1 provides guidance on how to
assess whether an issuer has the ability to control the form of settlement for
options and share 1. Description of
Business and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies continued rights
originally issued as employee compensation. When these options and shares
originally issued as employee compensation can only be settled by delivering
registered shares, then FSP EITF 00-19-1 nullifies the provisions of EITF 00-19
that require the assumption of cash settlement and thus classified as an asset
or liability. The terms of such instruments are to be evaluated using
paragraph 34 of FAS 123R to determine whether they should be recorded as equity
or liabilities. The guidance in FPS EITF 00-19-1 is applied in accordance with
the effective date and transition provisions of FAS 123R. In February 2006, the FASB
issued SFAS No. 155 Accounting
for Certain Hybrid Financial Instruments-an amendment of FASB Statements No.
133 and 140 FAS 155. FAS 155 addresses the following: a permits fair value remeasurement for any hybrid financial
instrument that contains an embedded derivative that otherwise would require
bifurcation; b clarifies which interest-only strips and principal-only strips
are not subject to the requirements of Statement 133; c establishes a
requirement to evaluate interests in securitized financial assets to identify
interests that are freestanding derivatives or that are hybrid financial
instruments that contain an embedded derivative requiring bifurcation; d
clarifies that concentrations of credit risk in the form of subordination are
not embedded derivatives; and e amends Statement 140 to eliminate the
prohibition on a qualifying special-purpose entity from holding a derivative
financial instrument that pertains to a beneficial interest other than another
derivative financial instrument. FAS 155 is effective for all
financial instruments acquired or issued after the beginning of an entity
first fiscal year that begins after September 15, 2006. We are currently
evaluating the requirements of FAS 155, but do not expect that the adoption
will have a material effect on our financial statements.  
2.
Benefit Plan In 1994, we established a
defined contribution 401k Plan covering all U.S. employees who are at least
21 years of age. Employees may contribute to the plan up to 50% of their
compensation, which is further limited by law. In addition, employees who
reached the age of 50 during the calendar year 2005 are eligible to make an
additional catch up contribution in the amount of $4,000, subject to income
limitations. We match employee contributions for an amount up to 50% of the
employee deferral limited to the first 6% of each employee compensation.
Contributions made by the Company were $357 in 2005, $351 in 2004, and $378 in
2003. 
3.
Concentrations of Credit Risk Financial
instruments that potentially subject us to concentrations of credit risk have
consisted principally of investments and trade receivables. We invest
available cash in bank deposits, investment-grade securities, and short-term
interest-producing investments, including government obligations and other
money market instruments. We have adopted credit policies and standards to
evaluate the risk associated with our sales and require collateral, such as letters
of credit or bank guarantees, whenever deemed necessary. Our management
believes that any risk of loss is significantly reduced due to the nature of
the customers and distributors with which we do business.

Inventory We maintain a physical inventory of chemical compound
libraries in various states of completion for LeadQuest, LeadDiscovery and
customer-specific chemistry research projects. Costs associated with the
manufacture of compounds are calculated using the standard cost method and are
carried at the lower of cost standard cost method approximating FIFO or
market. Compounds that are acquired from third parties are also carried at the
lower of cost or market. In calculating the reserve for obsolescence,
collections of compounds are reviewed for their age, possible chemical
degradation and cumulative sales trends, and if necessary, a reserve provision
is made so that the carrying value is at or below the respective net realizable
values. If there is, in our opinion, a significant adverse deviation in sales
trends for a specific compound collection or library, an additional reserve
provision is taken. A
portion of the inventory is used in discovery research projects. Depreciation
of this portion of the inventory is recorded in the reserve for obsolescence
over its 10-year expected useful life. Work
in process and finished goods inventory includes the accumulated cost of
compounds in production or awaiting shipment to customers under discovery
research or custom synthesis contracts. Inventory balances at December 31 are

Lease Obligations We
lease certain office facilities and equipment under noncancelable operating and
capital leases with terms from one to ten years. The capital leases
specifically pertain to the acquisition or financing of certain laboratory and
computer equipment totaling $11,297. In June 2005, we sold certain equipment
at our research laboratory and leased the equipment back under a three-year capital
financing lease. The proceeds received of $20 million were equal to the net
book value of the equipment, resulting in no gain or loss on the transaction,
and were recorded as a capital lease liability. The equipment is still
actively utilized in our operations, remains on our books and continues to be
depreciated. Quarterly payments go to reduce the capital lease liability. The
total accumulated amortization associated with equipment under capital leases
was approximately $7,310 and $3,846 at December 31, 2005 and 2004,
respectively. The related amortization expense is included in depreciation
expense. Rent expense under the operating leases was $1,081, $1,118 and $871
in 2005, 2004, and 2003, respectively. Noncancelable future minimum
lease commitments as of December 31, 2005 are:

9.
Financial Instruments Periodically,
we enter into foreign currency hedge transactions to protect us from
unfavorable changes in the exchange rate of currencies on certain customer
contracts. For transactions qualifying as effective hedges, as determined
using either the dollar offset method or regression methods, we record these
foreign exchange contracts at fair value in our Consolidated Balance Sheet and
the related gains or losses on these contracts are deferred in accumulated
other comprehensive income. These gains or losses are recognized in income in
the period in which the transactions being hedged are recognized. To the
extent any contract is not considered to be perfectly effective in offsetting
the change in fair value of the hedged transaction, the ineffective portion of
the contract is immediately recognized in income. When hedge accounting is discontinued because it
is determined that the derivative no longer qualifies as an effective fair
value hedge, the derivative will continue to be carried in the statement of
financial position at its fair value. When hedge accounting is discontinued
because it is probable that a forecasted transaction will not occur, the
derivative will continue to be carried in the Consolidated Balance Sheet at its
fair value, and gains and losses that were accumulated in other comprehensive
income are recognized immediately in earnings. In all other situations in
which hedge accounting is discontinued, the derivative will be carried at its
fair value in the Consolidated Balance Sheet, with changes in its fair value
recognized in current period earnings. For transactions that do not qualify as effective hedges,
there will be a gain or loss reflected in our Consolidated Statement of
Operations for the change in currency rates. Gains and losses on foreign
currency exchange contracts are included in other income expense net. The
counter-party to these foreign currency hedge contracts is LaSalle N.A. At
December 31, 2005 and 2004 there were no foreign currency future contracts in
place.

Grants In
2002, Tripos, Inc. and its U.K. subsidiary, Tripos Discovery Research Ltd.
TDR, were awarded two grants related to the expansion of the
chemistry laboratories in Bude, Cornwall. The U.K. Department of Trade and
Industry DTI awarded GBP2,400 based on the creation of jobs in
the region and capital investment. Additionally, the South West of England
Regional Development Agency awarded GBP1,300 tied to costs to construct the
laboratory. At December 31, 2002, TDR had met all criteria for the first
installment of the DTI grant and was approved to receive a payment of GBP550
that was recorded in 2002. Approximately GBP99 of the payment was attributed
to the reduction of expenses while the remainder was treated as a reduction in
the cost of capital expenditures. During 2003, TDR achieved multiple
thresholds under the South West of England Regional Development Agency grant
and made claims of GBP1,300 which were recorded as reductions in the amounts of
capital expenditures. In 2004, the second installment of the DTI grant was
approved and a payment was received for GBP990. Approximately GBP205 of the
payment was attributed to reduction in expenses while the remaining GBP785 was
recorded as a reduction of our capital expenditures. At December 31, 2004,
GBP860 remained to be awarded if certain criteria are met. During 2005 we did
not meet the criteria to receive additional grant funding. The grant from the
DTI expires on December 31, 2006 if not claimed. Additionally, for a period of
up to 24 months after our last draw under the grant programs, we are obligated
to repay portions or all of the grant money received if we eliminate jobs or
exit the property. On December 19, 2005, we issued a press release announcing
that that we intended to streamline our Discovery Research business and
initiated a 30-day consultation period with employees mandated by U.K. law when job losses are expected to be in the range of 20 to 99 positions.
Calculation of any amounts repayable to the U.K. government are based on
employee staffing levels at December 31, 2006. The Company is not able to
estimate any potential liability at this time as staffing levels may continue
to fluctuate. See additional discussion under Note 26, Subsequent Event and
Note 25 Contingent Liability. In early 2005, Tripos was awarded an
$850 phase II Small Business Innovation Research SBIR grant from the U.S. National
Institutes of Health NIH. The two-year grant will help fund creation of a
full-scale library design system. Based on topomer technology, this
proprietary system will have the capacity to search more than one million times
the number of structures previously possible, providing a richer universe of
synthetic chemistries. Scientists will be able to extend their knowledge of
similar molecules, resulting in improved success rates for all stages of drug
discovery. This system which will initially be used at the Company own
chemistry laboratory in the U.K., also has the potential to be licensed to
other drug discovery research operations under the appropriate technology
transfer agreements. As of December 31, 2005, the Company had recorded $387 of
grant funding as revenue and a corresponding amount has been reclassified from
RD expenses to cost of sales, representing staff time spent on the project. 
11.
Time-based Software License Arrangements Certain time-based software license arrangements are
covered by non-cancelable agreements whose terms range from one to five years.
The typical term of the contracts is three years. Revenue from these time-based
license arrangements is recognized ratably over the agreed term. The following
table shows the amount of future revenues to be recognized from these
non-cancelable arrangements as of December 31, 2005.

No. 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, the Company performed formal impairment tests of goodwill in 2005 and
2004 by using a discounted cash flow approach to estimate fair value. Based on
our evaluations, we determined there was no impairment of the remaining
goodwill. We will continue to do so on an annual basis and between annual
tests if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than
not reduce the fair value of Tripos Discovery Research Ltd. or Optive Research,
Inc. below their respective carrying values.

Relationship with Accenture LLP. On
February 8, 2002, we entered into a marketing alliance agreement with Accenture
LLP intended to market and sell a fully integrated solution to automate drug discovery
operations of the largest global pharmaceutical companies. As part of this
arrangement, we issued 33 shares of common stock, valued at $10 million, to
Accenture upon entry into this arrangement. This upfront fee paid to Accenture
was in consideration of the marketing effort to be expended by Accenture over
the term of the relationship. The fee covered the development of joint
marketing materials, a joint product demo presentation, and marketing time and
effort on behalf of Accenture. We applied EITF 96-18 Accounting for Equity
Instruments That Are Issued to Other Than Employees for Acquiring, or in
Conjunction with Selling, Goods or Services. In applying EITF 96-18, since
the $10 million of our stock was granted to Accenture at the inception of the
contract in exchange for three years of marketing services and the stock is
non-forfeitable and fully vested we determined that the date of issuance of the
equity securities is the appropriate measurement date. Accordingly, we
recorded the equity issuance and an Other Asset at the contract
inception date, based on the fair value of the stock issued. Performance of
the services was required over the contractual term, therefore we amortized the
Other Asset ratably over the contractual term as a sales and marketing
expense. Total expense recorded in the years ended December 31, 2005, 2004 and
2003 related to the arrangement was $22, $265 and $265, respectively.

Business Combination On January 5, 2005 we acquired Optive Research, Inc. Optive, a U.S. software company offering discovery informatics products complementary with our 
own to the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industry. We acquired Optive to maintain access to products presently being distributed by us and to gain access to 
new technologies being developed. The transaction consideration included cash and stock. Under the terms of the agreement, we issued 600 shares of our common 
stock with a value of $3,200 a portion of which is restricted and will vest evenly on a semi-annual basis over 2 years and $4,770 in cash to Optive former
shareholders. The value of the shares issued was computed based on the average closing stock price of our common stock for a period of 5 days before and after 
the announcement date. The cash portion was funded by a group of new investors through the issuance of $3,500 of subordinated debt bearing an interest rate of 
1142%, 112 shares of common stock with a negotiated value of $500 and warrants to purchase 156 shares of common stock at $448 per share. The warrants 
are exercisable upon issuance, up to 5 years from the date of grant. Optive operating revenues prior to the acquisition were approximately $2,400, including
nearly $900 of royalty payments made by us. The purchase price, including direct acquisition costs, has been allocated as follows

differences for 2005 include prior years RD tax credits in the U.K. that
were not able to be recognized until such time as it was more likely than not
that they would be approved by the tax authorities. A valuation allowance
has been recorded on the deferred tax assets due to the uncertainty whether it
is more likely than not that such assets will be realized. In 2004 and 2005,
additional valuation allowances were applied to the current year increase in
deferred tax assets primarily from losses generated in the United States and United Kingdom operations. 16. Income Taxes continued There are $613 of tax
benefits from stock option exercises with offsetting valuation allowances that
upon realization will be credited to additional paid-in-capital. Under the new
American Jobs Creation Act of 2004, the carryforward period for foreign tax
credits has been extended to 10 years. Therefore the foreign tax credits will
expire in 2011 and 2012. RD credits generated before 1998 have a 15-year
carryforward period and a 20-year period for credits arising after 1997.
Therefore the RD credits will expire between 2011 and 2024. Income tax payments for 2005, 2004 and 2003 were $25 217 and $4, respectively. Tripos' U.K. subsidiaries had group loss
carryforwards at December 31, 2005, with a pre-tax value of approximately
$24,346 that have no expiration date. Additionally, Tripos' U.S. entity had loss carryforwards of $14,300 on a pre-tax basis that expire between 2022 and 2025.
At December 31, 2005, there were no undistributed earnings from our foreign
subsidiaries.  
17.
Loss Contract In March 2004, we announced the completion of a
significant milestone in our collaboration with Schering AG. Schering accepted
Tripos' AUSPYX data cartridge for Oracle as the foundation of their Enterprise
Chemical Information Management System ECIMS. Having successfully completed
this milestone, the two companies were in talks regarding the specifications
and financial arrangements necessary to complete the development and deployment
of ECIMS. This required a scope change to the then existing contract. Because
these discussions were not finalized, Tripos recorded a charge in 2003 for the
estimated project costs in excess of the revenues that it expected under the
then current contract terms. In calculating the amount of the charge to be
recorded, Tripos assumed that the project would not continue past delivery and
rollout of the production system in mid-2004. This assumption led to a
corresponding reduction of approximately $802 in the total revenues available
under the contract through the expected mid-2004 delivery. In addition, we
recorded a charge of approximately $813 for the estimated project costs in
excess of the revenues expected under the previous contract terms. In
calculating the amount of the charge to be recorded, Tripos was required to
utilize the then existing contract terms, and could not assume that the project
would continue past delivery and rollout of the production system in mid-2004.
Tripos was required to accrue these excess costs so that its year-end financial
statements fairly reflected the project status as of December 31, 2003. The
negotiations were completed in mid-2004 and the project progressed to
completion in 2005. Under the revised financial terms, we received payments
equal to our costs to complete the project and therefore reflected no margin. 
18.
Investment in A.M. Pappas Life Science Ventures II Fund. Since 2001, we have invested
in the A.M. Pappas Life Science Ventures II fund administered by A.M. Pappas.
This fund invests in new and developing companies in the life science sector.
Our investment commitment of $2,500 represents approximately 20% of the total
capital of the fund. As of December 31, 2005 we had invested $2,075 or 83% of
our total commitment. In 2004 we received a distribution of 33 shares of
NuVasive, Inc. from the fund manager upon NuVasive initial public offering.
The value of these shares, $341 as of December 31, 2004 was recorded as
marketable securities. During 2005, we sold all 33 shares of NuVasive, Inc, realizing
a gain of $240. In July 2005 we received a distribution from the fund in the
form of $319 cash and shares in Cerexa, Inc. valued at $14. As a result of
this transaction, we recognized a gain in the amount of $305. The fund records investment impairments when
identified, for which we recognize our pro-rata share of such impairments. In
2005, 2004 and 2003, the fund managers determined that certain investments
were impaired, and we recorded our pro-rata share of the fund investment
impairments, totaling $204, $58 and $110, respectively. Our net investment
balance in the A.M. Pappas Life Science Ventures II Fund at December 31, 2005
totals $1,504, reflected in Investments recorded at cost on the balance sheet. 
19.
Investment in Infinity Pharmaceuticals During 2005, we received shares of Infinity
Pharmaceuticals, a private cancer drug discovery and development company,
valued at $191 as part of an early termination agreement for a software license
contract. The early termination agreement consisted of cash and shares and
represented the full value of our software license agreement. Our investment
in the shares is recorded in the balance sheet under Investments at cost. 
20.
Investment in Arena Pharmaceuticals, Inc. During the period from 1997 through 1999, we invested in
the start up of Arena Pharmaceuticals, Inc. Arena, a San Diego, California biotechnology company. Our investment in Arena totaled $3,200. In
July of 2000, Arena successfully completed its initial public offering
IPO of common stock on the NASDAQ market. During June 2001, Arena
completed a secondary offering of additional shares of common stock. We
participated in the offering by selling 100 shares and realizing a pre-tax gain
of $2,387. During 2002 we sold 619 shares under a controlled sale program
realizing a pre-tax gain of $3,560. Again in 2003, we sold 1,266 shares of
Arena and realized a pre-tax gain of $6,659. Finally, in 2004 we sold our
remaining 31 shares, realizing a pre-tax gain of $144. 
21.
Investment in Signase, Inc. During 2001 and 2002 Tripos made in-kind
contributions of chemical compounds in exchange for shares of Signase, Inc., a
Texas-based biotechnology company that researches cancer therapeutics. The transactions
were recorded as an increase in investments in unconsolidated affiliates and
sales of chemical compounds. Valuation of the shares received was consistent
with recent equity placements of similar shares to other investors by Signase.
The $500 sales value of the chemical compounds was consistent with average
market values received in comparable transactions from other customers for
similar volumes of compounds sold from our existing inventory. Early in 2003, Signase advised its shareholders
of its intent to seek additional financing at rates below those of the original
investors. We determined this reduced level of market value to be other
than temporary and as a result, wrote down our investment to approximate
the then current offering price. Our total in-kind investment was $552 prior
to the write-down of $405 in 2002, leaving a carrying value of $150. Tripos
took a further write-down of the remainder of its investment in Signase, $150,
as of March 31, 2003, after receiving information from Signase that attempts to
raise capital were unsuccessful and that the company may be liquidated. Signase
was liquidatedduring 2005 with no proceeds being realized by
shareholders, including Tripos.  
22.
Long-term Debt As
of December 31, 2005, we had a credit agreement with LaSalle Bank N.A. for a
$3,697 mortgage note for property with a book carrying value of $3,926. The
mortgage is due to mature on April 18, 2008. We also had a $6,500 one-year
revolving line of credit agreement with LaSalle Bank. The Bank has committed
to amend the line of credit facility to $6,000 and extend it to January 01, 2007.
Both credit agreements are collateralized by substantially all of our U.S. assets and stock pledges for each of the U.S. and U.K. subsidiaries. Payment of dividends to
stockholders or the incurring of debt from other sources by Tripos, Inc. and
its subsidiaries must be approved in advance by LaSalle Bank. The agreements
also required us to meet certain financial covenants, including minimum debt
service coverage, minimum shareholders' equity, maximum capital expenditure
excluding the chemistry laboratory expansion and an annual clean-down period
of 30 consecutive days in which no borrowings are outstanding on the revolving
credit facility. We met the annual clean down provision for the current year
in September 2005. As of December 31, 2005, Tripos was in violation of the
minimum debt services coverage and minimum shareholders' equity covenants of
its loan agreement with LaSalle Bank. The bank has waived these violations as
of December 31, 2005. The amended line of credit will have a borrowing base of
85% of domestic and insured foreign accounts receivable plus $18 million allowance
for excess equity in U.S. real estate, a revised minimum shareholders' equity
covenant tested quarterly and a minimum consolidated cash balance covenant
tested monthly. The annual clean-down requirement was eliminated. The mortgage note under the credit agreement calls for
even quarterly principal payments based on a twenty-year amortization
schedule. Borrowings under the mortgage were subject to a variable interest
rate at LIBOR plus 225%. Under the amended agreement the interest rate will
be LIBOR plus 300%. Interest rates paid on the mortgage averaged 55% during
2005. At December 31, 2004 the balance owed on the mortgage note of $3,914 was
presented as a current liability on the balance sheet since at the time it was
due within a one-year period. The $6,000 revolving line of credit under the
credit agreement requires quarterly interest-only payments with any remaining
borrowings due at the end of the agreement period. The line of credit carries
a commitment fee of 3/8% of the unused portion of the line. Borrowings under
the revolving line of credit bear interest at variable rates tied to LIBOR or
the bank prime rate. We averaged $2,418 of outstanding borrowings during
2005. The weighted average interest rate on line of credit borrowings was 65%
in 2005. 22.
Long-term Debt continued In connection with the Optive acquisition, the Company
issued a subordinated promissory note to Horizon Technology Finance with a face
value of $3,500 and a stated interest rate of 1142%. The repayment terms of
the promissory note require monthly interest only payments of $33 for the first
18 months, followed by 30 monthly payments of $135 beginning on August 1,
2006. Each payment of principal will be accompanied by payment of accrued but
unpaid interest to the date of the payment. The subordinated promissory note
contains prepayment penalties. In addition, as part of the financing
transaction, 112 shares of common stock were issued to Horizon and Sand Hill
Capital at a discounted price of $448 per share. 156 warrants to purchase
common stock were issued to Horizon at a negotiated price of $448. These
transactions resulted in original issuance debt discounts of $89 related to the
common stock issued at a discount and $432 related to the warrants, calculated
based upon relative fair values. The debt discounts are being amortized to
interest expense over the life of the loan. Short-term

maturities of $1,357 in 2007, $1,387 in 2008 and $133 in 2009. Interest
expense incurred, net of capitalized interest, for the years ended December 31,
2005, 2004 and 2003 were $837, $265 and $515, respectively, while total
interest payments, inclusive of capital lease interest, were $1,668, $1,116 and
$769, respectively.

Most
of our services are provided on an integrated worldwide basis. Because of the
integration of U.S. and non-U.S. services, it is not practical to separate
precisely the U.S.-oriented services from services resulting from operations
outside the United States and performed for customers outside the United States; accordingly, the separation set forth in the preceding table is based upon
internal allocations, which involve certain management judgments. Net sales
and long-lived assets in the preceding table are attributable to the country or
territory in which our subsidiaries or distributors are located. Revenues
from Pfizer, utilizing products and services in each of our reporting segments,
represents 46%, 54%, and 52% of our consolidated net revenues for 2005, 2004,
and 2003 respectively. 
24.
Stock-based Compensation Plans In
2002, we adopted the 2002 Employee Stock Purchase Plan that allows eligible
employees to purchase stock at the lower of 85% of the fair market value of the
stock on the enrollment date or exercise date as defined by the plan. Pursuant
to the plan, employee purchases are limited to 10% of annual compensation. The
plan originally had 250 shares reserved for issuance. In 2004 the shareholders
approved an increase in the reserve of 450 shares. The plan is in effect for
ten years unless terminated or amended sooner by the Board of Directors. At
December 31, 2005, 339 shares have been purchased under this plan leaving 361
shares available for issuance. In
1994, we adopted the 1994 Stock Option Plan that is administered by the
Compensation Committee and provided for incentive stock options, non-statutory
stock options and stock purchase rights to be granted to our employees and
consultants. Pursuant to the plan, incentive stock options could be exercised
at a price which is not less than the fair value of the stock on the grant
date, and non-statutory stock options and stock purchase rights could be
exercised at a price which is determined by the Compensation Committee.
Options vested at the rate of 25% on the first anniversary of each grant and
1/48th per month over the next three years. All options granted have 10-year
terms. The plan, which was amended in 2001 to increase the number of shares of
common stock reserved for issuance from 2,560 to 2,960, was in effect for ten
years from the date of inception 24.
Stock-based Compensation Plans continued and
expired during 2004. The outstanding 1,366 options granted prior to the
expiration of the plan will remain outstanding until their exercise, expiration
or forfeiture. In 1994, we adopted the 1994 Director Option Plan that
provided for non-statutory stock options to be granted to non-employee
directors at the fair market value of the stock at the date of grant. Options
vested in 25% increments on the anniversary of date of grant. The plan, which
was amended in 2002 to increase the number of shares of common stock reserved
for issuance from 480 to 600, was in effect for ten years from the date of
inception and expired during 2004. This plan was amended in 2001 to allow for
discretionary grants of options. The outstanding 417 options granted prior to
the expiration of the plan will remain outstanding until their exercise,
expiration or forfeiture. In 2005, we adopted the 2005 Equity Incentive
Plan 2005 Plan that is administered by the Compensation Committee
Administrator and provides for incentive and/or non-statutory stock
options, stock appreciation rights, restricted stock, restricted stock units,
performance shares and units, deferred stock units and dividend equivalents to
be granted to our employees, consultants and directors. A total of 800,000
shares are available for issuance under the 2005 Plan. In addition, any
outstanding options under the Company 1994 Employee Stock Option Plan that
subsequently expire unexercised, up to a maximum of 300,000 shares, may be
recaptured issued under the 2005 Plan. Under the 2005 Plan, the Administrator
may grant nonqualified stock options and/or incentive stock options and stock
appreciation rights at an exercise price set by the Administrator but not less
than 100% of the fair market value on the date of grant. Options and rights
issued under the 2005 Plan become exercisable at the times and on the terms
established by the Administrator. The Administrator also establishes the time
at which options expire, but the expiration of an incentive stock option and
stock appreciation right may not be later than ten years after the grant date
such term to be limited to 5 years in the case of an incentive stock option
granted to a participant who owns stock possessing more than 10% of the total
combined voting power of all classes of stock of the Company or any of parent
or subsidiary of the Company. The Administrator will determine the number of
Shares of restricted stock granted to any employee, consultant or director and,
unless the Administrator determines otherwise, shares of restricted stock will
be held by the Company as escrow agent until any restrictions on the shares
have lapsed. The Administrator may accelerate the time at which any
restriction may lapse or be removed. The Administrator determines the number
of restricted stock units granted to any employee or consultant. In
determining whether an award of restricted stock units should be made, and/or
the vesting schedule for any such award, the Administrator may impose whatever
conditions to vesting it determines to be appropriate. The number of
restricted stock units paid out to the participant will depend on the extent to
which the vesting criteria are met. The Administrator may set vesting criteria
based upon the achievement of Company-wide, business unit or individual goals,
which may include continued employment or service, or any other basis
determined by the Committee. Upon satisfying the applicable vesting criteria,
the participant shall be entitled to the payout specified in the award
agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, at any time after the grant of
restricted stock units, the Administrator may reduce or waive any vesting
criteria that must be met to receive a payout. The Administrator, in its sole
discretion and as set forth in the restricted stock unit agreement, may pay
earned restricted stock units in cash, shares, or a combination thereof.
Performance shares may be granted to employees, consultants or directors at any
time as shall be determined by the Administrator in its sole discretion.
Subject to the terms of the Plan, the Administrator will have complete
discretion to determine the number of shares subject to a performance share
award and the conditions that must be satisfied, which typically will be based
principally or solely on achievement of performance milestones but may include
a service based component, upon which is conditioned on the grant or vesting of
performance share. Performance units are similar to performance
shares, except that they shall be settled in cash equivalent to the fair market value of the underlying
shares, determined as of the vesting date. The shares available for issuance
under the 2005 Plan shall not be diminished as a result of the settlement of a
performance unit. Deferred stock units shall consist of a restricted stock,
performance share or performance unit award that the Administrator, in its sole
discretion, permits to be paid out in installments or on a deferred basis, in
accordance with rules and procedures established by the Administrator. A
dividend equivalent is a credit, payable in cash, awarded at the discretion of
the Administrator, to the account of a participant in an amount equal to the
cash dividends paid on one share for each share represented by an award. Pro-forma
information regarding net income and earnings per share is required by SFAS 123
and has been determined as if we had accounted for employee and director stock
options under the fair value method of that Statement see Note 1. The fair
value for these options was estimated at the date of grant using a
Black-Scholes option pricing model with the following weighted average
assumptions: risk-free interest rates ranging from 30% to 45% for 2005, 146%
to 443% for 2004 and 110% to 423% for 2003; volatility factor of 063 for
2005, 090 for 2004 and 097 for 2003; and a weighted average expected life of
the option of 62 years for 2005, 53 year for 2004 and 53 years for 2003.
For the Tripos Employee Stock Purchase Plan, compensation expense was also
estimated using a Black-Scholes option pricing model with the following assumptions:
risk-free interest rates 24. Stock-based Compensation Plans continued ranging
from 415% to 441% for 2005, 129% to 457% for 2004 and 110% to 423% for
2003; volatility factors of 082 for 2005, 090 for 2004 and 097 for 2003; and
a weighted average expected life of the option of 6 months. For all years
presented, we used a dividend rate of zero. The Black-Scholes option
valuation model was developed for use in estimating the fair value of traded
options which have no vesting restrictions and are fully transferable. In
addition, option valuation models require the input of highly subjective
assumptions including the expected stock price volatility. Because our
employee and director stock options have characteristics significantly
different from those of traded options and because changes in the subjective
input assumptions can materially affect the fair value estimate, in
management opinion, the existing models do not necessarily provide a reliable
single measure of the fair value of its employee and director stock options. Additional
information relating to the plans is as follows in thousands, except for
earnings per share information

Contingent Liability
As discussed in Note 10, for a period of up to 24
months after our last draw under the DTI grant programs, we are obligated to
repay portions or all of the grant money received if we eliminate jobs or exit
the property. On January 24, 2006 we reduced headcount as described in Note 26
by seventy-six positions. Calculation of any amounts repayable to the U.K. government is based on employee staffing levels at December 31, 2006. Actual staffing
levels at that date will be compared to staffing levels previously funded by
the grant. Any shortfall in actual staffing may require repayment to the DTI
calculated at a rate of GBP17 per employee up to a maximum amount of GBP1,500.
The Company is not able to estimate any potential liability at this time as
staffing levels may continue to fluctuate throughout 2006.  
26.
Subsequent Event
On January 24, 2006 we completed a reduction in force for our Discovery Research
business based in Bude, England which was previously announced on December 19, 2005.
This action coincided with the conclusion of the 30-day consultation period
with employees mandated by U.K. law. We reduced the number of employees by 76
positions to streamline and refine our Discovery Research business and associated
cost structure as a result of our fourth quarter 2005 completion of the four-year $90 million
file enrichment project with Pfizer Inc. Before this action was taken, our Discovery Research
business had 161 employees. More than half of the employees affected left the Company
under a voluntary separation plan. Severance packages and assistance with outplacement services
services were offered to all employees affected by this action. As a result, we expect to
incur a restructuring charge in the first quarter of 2006 for approximately $900 for severance
and outplacement services.
The
company also closed a 6,000-square-foot temporary laboratory building in Bude
and is exploring alternate uses for or disposition of the excess property. At
December 31, 2005, we determined that this building was impaired and took an
impairment charge of $861 reflected as Restructuring charge on our consolidated
statements of operations. Costs to dispose of the building or proceeds from a
potential sale of the property are not determinable.

Legal Proceedings Securities Class Action Litigation
On or about July 24, 2003, the Company and two
of its executive officers, Dr. John P. McAlister and Mr. B. James Rubin, were
sued in federal district court in St. Louis, Missouri on behalf of purchasers
of the Company common stock during the first half of 2002. The consolidated
class action complaint alleged that statements made by the Company in press
releases and other public disclosures contained materially false and misleading
information in violation of the federal securities laws. On or about May 5,
2004, plaintiffs filed a second amended complaint on behalf of a purported
class of purchasers of the Company common stock between February 9, 2000 and
July 1, 2002 the Class Period. The second amended complaint
generally alleges that, during the Class Period, defendants made false or
misleading statements of material fact about the Company prospects and failed
to follow generally accepted accounting principles in violation of the federal
securities laws. The second amended complaint also names Ernst Young
LLP, the Company former independent registered public accounting firm, as a
co-defendant. In August 2004, the Company and the individual defendants and
Ernst Young filed motions to dismiss the second amended complaint. On
September 30, 2005, the Company was informed that its motion to dismiss was
denied; however, the motion to dismiss filed by Ernst Young was granted. On March 21, 2006, the parties reached a verbal
agreement to settle the class action litigation. The total amount of the
settlement is $3,150 which is to be paid by our insurers. The settlement is
subject to court approval after notice and an opportunity to object is provided
to the putative shareholder class. There can be no assurance that the
settlement will be approved in which case, we will continue to defend ourselves
against these claims vigorously. Shareholder Derivative Litigation
On or about February 10, 2006, a shareholder
derivative action was filed in the Circuit Court of the County of St. Louis. The complaint names certain of the Company officers and directors as defendants
and names the Company as a nominal defendant. The complaint alleges that
certain of the Company officers and directors breached their fiduciary duties
to the Company by engaging in alleged wrongful conduct including conduct
complained of in the securities class action litigation described above. On March 21, 2006, the parties reached a verbal
agreement to settle this litigation, subject to final documentation and court
approval, involving the implementation of certain policies and procedures by
the Company and the payment of attorneys' fees of $200 to plaintiffs' counsel.
All fees are to be paid by our insurers. There can be no assurance that the
settlement will be approved in which case, we will continue to defend ourselves
against these claims vigorously.

accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Tripos, Inc. as of December 31,
2005 and 2004, and the related consolidated statements of operations,
shareholders' equity and cash flows for the years then ended. We have also
audited the schedule listed in a 2. These financial statements and
schedules are the responsibility of the Company management. Our
responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements and
schedules based on our audits. We conducted our audits
in accordance with the standards of the Public Accounting Oversight Board United States. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain

free of material misstatement. The Company is not
required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal
control over financial reporting. Our audit included consideration of internal
control over financial reporting as a basis for designing audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the
purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company internal
control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. An audit also includes examining, on a test basis,
evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements and
schedules, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates
made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial
statements and schedules. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable
basis for our opinion. In our opinion, the
consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all
material respects, the financial position of Tripos, Inc. at December 31, 2005
and 2004, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for the years then
