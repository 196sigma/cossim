Pixelworks, Inc: We have audited the
accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Pixelworks, Inc. andsubsidiaries as of December31, 2010 and 2009, and the related consolidated statements of operations, shareholders equity deficit and comprehensive income loss, and
cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended December31, 2010. These consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the Companys management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these
consolidated financial statements based on our audits. We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company
Accounting Oversight Board United States. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test
basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement
presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements
referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Pixelworks, Inc. and subsidiaries as of December31, 2010 and 2009, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the years in the
three-year period ended December31, 2010, in conformity with U.S.generally accepted accounting principles. We also have audited,
in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board United States, Pixelworks, Inc.s internal control over financial reporting as of December31, 2010, based on criteria established in Internal

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 
In thousands, except share and per share data 
NOTE1.BASIS OF PRESENTATION Nature of Business We are an innovative designer, developer and marketer of video and
pixel processing semiconductors and software for high-end digital video applications and hold 138 patents related to the visual display of digital image data. Our solutions enable manufacturers of digital display and projection devices, such as
large-screen flat panel televisions and digital front projectors, to differentiate their products with a consistently high level of video quality, regardless of the contents source or format. Our core technology leverages unique proprietary
techniques for intelligently processing video signals from a variety of sources to ensure that all resulting images are optimized. Additionally, our products help our customers reduce costs and differentiate their display and projection devices, an
important factor in industries that experience rapid innovation. Pixelworks was founded in 1997 and is incorporated under the laws of the state of Oregon. Consolidated Financial Statements Our consolidated financial statements include the
accounts of Pixelworks and its wholly-owned subsidiaries. Intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated. All foreign subsidiaries use the U.S. dollar as the functional currency, and as a result, transaction gains and losses are
included in the statement of operations. Transaction gains losses were $6, $69 and $121 for the years ended December31, 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively. Use of Estimates The preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with
U.S. generally accepted accounting principles GAAP requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes. Our significant estimates and judgments include those
related to product returns, warranty obligations, bad debts, inventories, property and equipment, intangible assets, impairment of long-lived assets, valuation of investments, amortization of prepaid royalties, valuation of share-based payments,
income taxes, litigation and other contingencies. The actual results experienced could differ materially from our estimates. 
Reclassifications Certain
reclassifications have been made to the 2009 and 2008 consolidated financial statements to conform with the 2010 presentation, including the reclassification of the reversal of uncertain tax positions within operating activities in the consolidated
statements of cash flow. 
NOTE2.SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES 
Cash and Cash Equivalents We classify
all cash and highly liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less at the date of purchase as cash and cash equivalents. Cash equivalents totaled $15,835 and $17,073 at December31, 2010 and 2009, respectively. 
Marketable Securities Our investments
in marketable securities are classified as available-for-sale. Available-for-sale securities are stated at fair value based on quoted market prices with unrealized holding gains or losses, net of tax, included in accumulated other comprehensive
income, a component of shareholders equity. The cost of securities sold is based on the specific identification method. 
47 Table of Contents
We periodically evaluate whether declines in fair values of our investments below their cost are
other-than-temporary. This evaluation includes qualitative and quantitative factors regarding the severity and duration of the unrealized loss, the financial condition and near-term prospects of the issuer, including any specific events which may
influence the operations of the issuer, and our ability and intent to hold the investment for a period of time to allow for an anticipated recovery in market value. Short-term marketable debt securities have remaining maturities of less than twelve months. 
Accounts Receivable Accounts receivable
are recorded at invoiced amount and do not bear interest when recorded or accrue interest when past due. We maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses that may result from the inability of our customers to make required
payments. At the end of each reporting period, we estimate the allowance for doubtful accounts based on an account-by-account risk analysis of outstanding receivable balances. The determination to write-off specific accounts receivable balances is
made based on likelihood of collection and past due status. Past due status is based on invoice date and terms specific to each customer. 
Inventories Inventories consist of
finished goods and work-in-process, and are stated at the lower of standard cost which approximates actual cost on a first-in, first-out basis or market net realizable value, net of a reserve for slow-moving and obsolete items. 
Property and Equipment Property and
equipment are stated at cost. Depreciation is calculated on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful life of the assets which are generally as follows:  Software
Lesser of 3 years or contractual license term Equipment, furniture and fixtures
2 years Tooling
2 - 4 years Leasehold improvements
Lesser of lease term or estimated useful life
The cost of property and equipment repairs and maintenance is expensed as incurred. 
Acquired Intangible Assets Intangible
assets are amortized on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives. Licensed Technology 
We have capitalized licensed technology assets in other long-term assets. These assets are stated at cost and are amortized on a straight-line basis over
the term of the license or the estimated life of the asset, if the license is not contractually limited, which is generally three to five years. Useful Lives and Recoverability of Equipment and Other Long-Lived Assets We evaluate the
remaining useful life and recoverability of equipment and other assets, including identifiable intangible assets with definite lives, whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not be recoverable.
If there is an indicator of impairment, we prepare an estimate of future, undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use of each asset and its eventual disposition. If these cash flows are less than the carrying value of the asset, we
adjust the carrying amount of the asset to its estimated fair value. 
48 Table of Contents
Revenue Recognition We recognize revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, the product has been delivered, the price is fixed and determinable, and collection is reasonably assured. We require customers to
provide purchase orders prior to shipment and we consider delivery to occur upon shipment provided title and risk of loss have passed to the customer based on the shipping terms. These conditions are generally satisfied upon shipment of the
underlying product. There are no customer acceptance provisions associated with our products, and except for replacement of defective
products under our warranty program discussed below, we have no obligation to accept product returns from end customers; however, we have accepted returns on a case-by-case basis as customer accommodations in the past. As a result, we provide for
estimated reductions to gross profit for these sales returns in our reserve for sales returns and allowances. At the end of each reporting period, we estimate the reserve based on historical experience and knowledge of any applicable events or
transactions. The reserve is included in accrued liabilities in our consolidated balance sheet. A portion of our sales are made to
distributors under agreements that grant the distributor limited stock rotation rights and price protection on in-stock inventory. The stock rotation rights allow these distributors to exchange a limited amount of their in-stock inventory for other
Pixelworks product. We analyze historical stock rotations at the end of each reporting period. To date, returns under the stock rotation provision have been nominal, and as a result, we have not recorded a reserve for stock rotations. 
Under price protection provisions, we grant distributors credit if they purchased product for a specific end customer and we subsequently lower the price
to the end customer such that the distributor can no longer earn its negotiated margin on in-stock inventory. At the end of each reporting period, we estimate a reserve for price protection credits based on historical experience and knowledge of any
applicable events or transactions. The reserve for price protection, if required, is included in our reserve for sales returns and allowances, which is included in accrued liabilities in our consolidated balance sheet. 
Warranty Program We warrant that our
products will be free from defects in material and workmanship for a period of twelve months from delivery. Warranty repairs are guaranteed for the remainder of the original warranty period. Our warranty is limited to repairing or replacing
products, or refunding the purchase price. At the end of each reporting period, we estimate a reserve for warranty returns based on historical experience and knowledge of any applicable events or transactions. The reserve for warranty returns is
included in accrued liabilities in our consolidated balance sheet. Stock-Based Compensation 
We currently sponsor a stock incentive plan that allows for issuance of employee stock options and restricted stock awards, including restricted stock
units. We also have an employee stock purchase plan for all eligible employees. The fair value of share-based payment awards is expensed straight-line over the requisite service period, which is generally the vesting period, for the entire award. If
we were to modify any awards, additional charges would be taken. The fair values of our stock option grants and purchase rights under our
employee stock purchase plan are estimated as of the grant date using the Black-Scholes option valuation model which is affected by our estimates of the risk free interest rate, our expected dividend yield, expected term and the expected share price
volatility of our common shares over the expected term. The fair values of our restricted stock awards are based on the market value of our stock on the date of grant, adjusted for the effect of estimated forfeitures. 
49 Table of Contents
Research and Development Costs associated with research and development activities are expensed as incurred, except for materials with alternate future uses which are capitalized and depreciated over their estimated useful life.
Interest Income Expense and Other, net Interest income expense and other, consists of the following:  Year Ended December31 2010 2009 2008 Interest income 63 242 2,102 Interest expense 500 640 1,695 Amortization of debt issuance costs 74 124 426 Other income 218 511 522 199 Income Taxes 
We account for income taxes under the asset and liability method. This approach requires the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the
expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between financial statement carrying amounts and tax bases of assets and liabilities. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable
income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date. We
establish a valuation allowance to reduce deferred tax assets if it is more likely than not that a portion or all of the asset will not be realized in future tax returns. An uncertain tax position represents our expected treatment of a tax position taken in a filed tax return, or planned to be taken in a future tax return, that has not been reflected in measuring income
tax expense for financial reporting purposes. Until these positions are sustained by the taxing authorities, we do not recognize the tax benefits resulting from such positions and report the tax effects as a liability for uncertain tax positions in
our consolidated balance sheet. Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income Accumulated other comprehensive income, net of tax, consists of the following:  December31 2010 2009 Accumulated net unrealized holding gain onavailable-for-sale and long-term marketable securities 231 1,128 Accumulated transition pension obligation 48 48 Actuarial gain loss on pension obligation 16 7 Accumulated other comprehensive income 167 1,087 Leases Our
various office space and equipment leases are classified as operating leases. Certain of our leases for office space contain provisions under which monthly rent escalates over time and certain leases also contain provisions for reimbursement of a
specified amount of leasehold improvements. When lease agreements contain escalating rent clauses, we recognize rent expense on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease. When lease agreements provide allowances for leasehold improvements, we
capitalize the leasehold improvement assets and amortize them on a straight-line basis over the lesser of the lease term or the estimated useful life of the asset, and reduce rent expense on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease by the
amount of the asset capitalized. 
50 Table of Contents
Fair Value of Financial Instruments See Note 4 for information regarding accounting policies related to the fair value of our financial instruments. Risks and Uncertainties Concentration of Suppliers 
We do not own or operate a semiconductor fabrication facility and do not have the resources to manufacture our products internally. We rely on four
third-party foundries to produce all of our wafers and three assembly and test vendors for completion of finished products. We do not have long-term agreements with any of these suppliers. In light of these dependencies, it is reasonably possible
that failure to perform by one of these suppliers could have a material impact on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Risk of Technological Change The markets in which we compete, or seek to compete, are
subject to rapid technological change, frequent new product introductions, changing customer requirements for new products and features, and evolving industry standards. The introduction of new technologies and the emergence of new industry
standards could render our products less desirable or obsolete, which could harm our business. Concentrations of Credit Risk
Financial instruments that potentially subject us to concentrations of credit risk consist of cash equivalents, short- and long-term
marketable securities and accounts receivable. We limit our exposure to credit risk associated with cash equivalent and marketable security balances by placing our funds in various high-quality securities and limiting concentrations of issuers and
maturity dates. We limit our exposure to credit risk associated with accounts receivable by carefully evaluating creditworthiness before offering terms to customers.

have on hand at December31, 2010. However, it is possible that a customer will decide in the future to purchase a portion of the reserved inventory. During the years ended December31, 2010, 2009, and 2008, sales of previously reserved
inventory were primarily due to unanticipated demand for products nearing end-of-life. Prepaid Expenses and Other Current Assets

before the fifth business day after the applicable fiscal month or quarter end. Amounts advanced under the Revolving Line bear interest at an
annual rate equal to the lenders prime rate plus 025%. Interest on the Revolving Line is due monthly, with the balance due on December21, 2012, which is the scheduled maturity date for the Revolving Line. 
The Revolving Loan Agreement contains customary affirmative and negative covenants, including with respect to the following: compliance with laws,
provision of financial statements and periodic reports, payment of taxes, maintenance of inventory and insurance, maintenance of operating accounts at the Bank, the Banks access to collateral, formation or acquisition of subsidiaries,
incurrence of indebtedness, dispositions of assets, granting liens, changes in business, ownership or business locations, engaging in mergers and acquisitions, making investments or distributions and affiliate transactions. The covenants also
require that the Company maintain a minimum ratio of qualifying financial assets to the sum of qualifying financial obligations. The
Revolving Loan Agreement also contains customary events of default, including the following: defaults with respect to covenant compliance, the occurrence of a material adverse change, the occurrence of certain bankruptcy or insolvency events,
cross-defaults, judgment defaults and material misrepresentations. The occurrence of an event of default could result in the acceleration of the Companys obligations under the Revolving Loan Agreement and an increase to the applicable interest
rate, and would permit the Bank to exercise remedies with respect to its security interest. To secure the repayment of any amounts borrowed
under the Revolving Loan Agreement, the Company granted to the Bank a security interest in substantially all of its assets, which assets do not include its intellectual property assets. The Company has agreed not to pledge or otherwise encumber its
intellectual property assets without prior written permission from the Bank. Short-term borrowings outstanding under the Revolving Line as of
December31, 2010 consisted of a non-formula advance of $3,000 which was repaid within required terms. The weighted-average interest rate on short-term borrowings outstanding as of December31, 2010 was 35%.

Debentures Currently Payable In 2004, we issued $150,000 of 175% convertible subordinated debentures the debentures due 2024. In 2006, we repurchased and retired $10,000 principal amount of the debentures. In 2008, we
repurchased and retired $79,366 principal amount of the debentures for $58,554 in cash. We recognized a net gain of $19,670 on the repurchase, which included a $21,567 discount, offset by legal and professional fees of $755 and a write-off of debt
issuance costs of $1,142. In 2009, we repurchased and retired $44,855 principal amount of the debentures for $31,532 in cash. We recognized a net gain on the repurchase of $12,860, which included a $13,357 discount, offset by a write-off of debt
issuance costs of $463 and other fees of $34. Gains on the repurchase of our debentures are included in other income in our statement of operations. As of December31, 2010, $15,779 of the debentures are outstanding. The remaining debentures are convertible, under certain circumstances, into our common stock at a conversion rate of 136876 shares
of common stock per $1 principal amount of debentures for a total of 215,977 shares. This is equivalent to a conversion price of approximately $7306 per share. The debentures are convertible if aour stock trades above 130% of the conversion
price for 20 out of 30 consecutive trading days during any calendar quarter, bthe debentures trade at an amount less than or equal to 98% of the if-converted value of the debentures for five consecutive trading days, ca call for
redemption occurs, or din the event of certain other specified corporate transactions. If our debentures are converted into common stock, they cannot be settled in cash or other assets. 
We may redeem some or all of the debentures for cash on or after May15, 2011 at a price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the debentures
plus accrued and unpaid interest. The holders of the debentures have the right to require us to purchase all or a portion of their debentures on May15, 2011,May15, 2014 and May15, 2019 at a price equal to 100% of the
principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest. As of December31, 2010 we have classified the debentures as current liabilities as we expect the holders to require us to purchase all of the debentures on May15, 2011. 
The debentures are unsecured obligations and are subordinated in right of payment to all our existing and future senior debt, and are effectively
subordinated to all existing and future debt of our subsidiaries. At December31, 2010, we had $3,000 in senior debt outstanding and our subsidiaries had approximately $2,616 of liabilities to which the debentures were effectively subordinated.
Although repayment of our debentures would consume a significant portion of our cash and marketable securities, we anticipate that our existing working capital, as well as funds available under our Revolving Line, will be adequate to fund our
operating, investing and financing needs for the next twelve months. We have evaluated each of the put, call and conversion features of the
debentures and concluded that none of these features constitute embedded derivatives that must be bifurcated from the host contract and accounted for as derivatives. The fees associated with the issuance of the convertible debentures included $4,500 withheld from the proceeds and $462 paid in cash. These debt issuance costs have been capitalized and are included in
other assets, net in the consolidated balance sheets. The debt issuance costs are being amortized over seven years on a straight-line basis, which approximates the effective interest rate method. Debt issuance costs at December31, 2010 and
2009 were $31 and $105, respectively. 
55 Table of Contents NOTE 4. MARKETABLE SECURITIES AND FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS 
At December31, 2010 and 2009, all of our marketable securities are classified as available-for-sale and consist of the following: Cost UnrealizedGainLoss FairValue Short-term marketable securities As of December31, 2010 US government agencies debt securities 5,513 3 5,516 Commercial paper 5,747 5,747 Corporate debt securities 1,104 1 1,103 12,364 2 12,366 As of December31, 2009 US government agencies debt securities 6,286 3 6,283 Commercial paper 2,996 2,996 Corporate debt security 542 1 543 9,824 2 9,822  Cost UnrealizedGain Fair Value Long-term marketable securities As of December31, 2010 Equity securities 348 255 603 As of December31, 2009 Equity securities 2,110 1,130 3,240
Unrealized holding gains and losses
are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income, a component of shareholders equity, in the consolidated balance sheets. During the years ended December31, 2010 and 2009, we sold available-for-sale marketable securities for gross
proceeds of $6,759 and $1,798, respectively, and gross realized gains of $1,397 and $3, respectively. Net unrealized holding gains of $944 on available-for sale marketable securities were reclassified out of accumulated other comprehensive income
during the year ended December31, 2010. Fair Value Measurements Fair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. Three levels of
inputs may be used to measure fair value:  Level
1: Valuations based on quoted prices in active markets for identical assets and liabilities. Level
2: Valuations based on inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability,
either directly or indirectly.  Level
3: Valuations based on unobservable inputs in which there is little or no market data available, which require the reporting entity
to develop its own assumptions. 
56 Table of Contents
The following tables present information about our assets measured at fair value on a recurring basis in the
consolidated balance sheets at December31, 2010 and 2009:  Level 1 Level 2 Level3 Total As of December31, 2010 Money market funds 13,933 13,933 Certificates of deposit 200 200 U.S. government agencies debt securities 5,516 5,516 Commercial paper 6,947 6,947 Corporate debt securities 1,605 1,605 Long-term marketable securities 603 603 Total 14,736 14,068 28,804 As of December31, 2009 Money market funds 16,873 16,873 Certificates of deposit 200 200 U.S. government agencies debt securities 6,283 6,283 Commercial paper 2,996 2,996 Corporate debt security 543 543 Long-term marketable securities 3,240 3,240 Total 20,313 9,822 30,135 The fair value of our current assets and liabilities, including accounts receivable, accounts payable, and our debentures

GAAP. 
NOTE 5.RESTRUCTURINGS In December 2008, we initiated a restructuring plan to reduce our operating expenses in response to decreases in current and forecasted revenue which resulted primarily from the global economic crisis.
This plan reduced operations, research and development and administrative headcount in our San Jose, Taiwan and China offices and was completed during the second quarter of 2009. In November 2006, we initiated a restructuring plan to reduce operating expenses. This plan included consolidation of our operations in order to reduce compensation and rent expense. As part of this plan,
we also narrowed and redefined our product development strategy which resulted in the write-off of intellectual property assets, tooling, software development tools and charges for related non-cancelable contracts. Although this plan was completed
in the fourth quarter of 2008, lease termination costs were recorded in 2010 and 2009 due to decreases in estimated future sublease income and related professional fees. 
57 Table of Contents
Total restructuring expense included in our consolidated statements of operations is comprised of the
following:  Year Ended December31 2010 2009 2008 Cost of revenuerestructuring Termination and retention benefits 43 91 Operating expensesrestructuring Consolidation of leased space 94 160 508 Termination and retention benefits 75 1,081 94 235 1,589 Total restructuring expense 94 278 1,680 Termination and retention benefits included severance and retention payments for terminated employees and retention payments
for certain continuing employees. Expenses related to the consolidation of leased space included future non-cancelable rent payments due for vacated space net of estimated sublease income and related professional fees. 
Total cumulative restructuring expense recorded in our statement of operations related to the restructuring plans initiated in November 2006 and December
2008 is comprised of net write-off of assets and reversal of related liabilities of $15,296, termination and retention benefits of $8,133, consolidation of leased space of $2,192, a contract termination fee of $1,693, payments on non-cancelable
contracts of $827, and other expenses of $88. Accrued expenses related to the restructuring plans are included in current and non-current
accrued liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets. The following is a roll-forward of the accrued liabilities related to the restructuring plans for the years ended December31, 2010 and 2009: Balance as ofDecember31,2009 Expensed Payments Balance as ofDecember31,2010 Lease termination costs 408 94 211 291

Deferred Tax Assets, Liabilities and Valuation Allowance 
Deferred income taxes reflect the net tax effects of temporary differences between the carrying amount of assets and liabilities for financial reporting
purposes and the amounts for income tax purposes. Significant components of our deferred tax assets and liabilities are as follows:  December31 2010 2009 Deferred tax assets Net operating loss carryforwards 65,111 65,666 Research and experimentation credit carryforwards 11,444 12,471 Foreign tax credit carryforwards 5,260 8,717 Depreciation 2,373 2,304 Deferred stock compensation 2,360 2,705 Capital loss carryforwards 1,849 Reserves and accrued expenses 1,495 1,316 Other-than-temporary impairment of marketable securities 373 2,873 Other 1,854 2,208 Total gross deferred tax assets 92,119 98,260 Deferred tax liabilities Amortization 382 Foreign earnings 553 129 Other 240 275 Total gross deferred tax liabilities 793 786 Less valuation allowance 90,866 96,767 Net deferred tax assets 460 707 The current portion of the net deferred tax asset balance is $151 and $155 as of December31, 2010 and 2009,
respectively, and is included in prepaid expenses and other current assets in the consolidated balance sheets. The non-current portion of the net deferred tax asset balance is $356 and $608 as of December31, 2010 and 2009, respectively, and is
included in other assets, net in the consolidated balance sheets. Long-term deferred tax liabilities were $47 and $56 as of December31, 2010 and 2009, respectively, and are included in long-term liabilities, net of current portion in the
consolidated balance sheets. We continue to record a full valuation allowance against our U.S. and Canadian net deferred tax assets at
December31, 2010 and 2009 as it is not more likely than not that we will realize a benefit from these assets in a future period. We have not provided a valuation allowance against any of our other foreign net deferred tax assets as we have
concluded it is more likely than not that we will realize a benefit from these assets in a future period because our subsidiaries in these jurisdictions are cost-plus taxpayers. The net valuation allowance decreased $5,901, $7,323 and $8,246 for the
years ended December31, 2010, 2009, and 2008, respectively. As of December31, 2010, we have federal, state and foreign net
operating loss carryforwards of approximately $173,063, $73,525 and $424, respectively, which will expire between 2011 and 2027. As of December31, 2010, we have available federal, state and foreign research and experimentation tax credit
carryforwards of approximately $7,246, $2,431 and $1,884, respectively, which begin expiring in 2011. We have a general foreign tax credit of $2,786 which will begin expiring in 2018. We had undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries of approximately $607 as of December31, 2010, for which deferred taxes have not been provided because they are considered indefinitely invested
outside of the United States. If repatriated, some of these earnings could generate foreign tax credits that may reduce the federal tax liability associated with any future foreign dividend. We have recorded a deferred tax liability for the
undistributed earnings and profits of subsidiaries in which we are no longer considered indefinitely reinvested. 
60 Table of Contents
During the year ended December31, 2007, our Chinese subsidiary achieved designation as an integrated
circuit design company, allowing us to benefit from a tax holiday resulting in reductions to our tax rates of 10%, 11% and 12% in 2009, 2010 and 2011, respectively. Our corporate tax rate will return to 25% in 2012 upon the expiration of the tax
holiday. Uncertain Tax Positions We have recorded tax reserves to address potential exposures involving positions that could be challenged by taxing authorities. As of December31, 2010 and 2009, the amount of our uncertain tax
positions was a liability of $3,574 and $9,462, respectively. The following is a summary of the change in our liability for uncertain tax
positions and interest and penalties for the years ended December31, 2010 and 2009:  2010 2009 Uncertain tax positions Balance at beginning of year 7,186 8,257 Accrual for positions taken in a prior year 95 150 Accrual for positions taken in current year 1 159 Reversals due to lapse of statute of limitations 4,657 1,380 Balance at end of year 2,625 7,186 Interest and penalties Balance at beginning of year 2,276 2,324 Accrual for positions taken in prior year 210 391 Reversals due to lapse of statute of limitations 1,537 439 Balance at end of year 949 2,276 We recognize interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions in income tax expense in our consolidated statements
of operations. We file income tax returns in the U.S. and various foreign jurisdictions. A number of years may elapse before an uncertain tax
position is resolved by settlement or statute of limitations. Settlement of any particular position could require the use of cash. If the uncertain tax positions we have accrued for are sustained by the taxing authorities in our favor, the reduction
of the liability will reduce our effective tax rate. We reasonably expect reductions in the liability for unrecognized tax benefits of approximately $961 within the next twelve months due to the expiration of statutes of limitations in foreign
jurisdictions. We are no longer subject to U.S. federal examinations for years before 2007. We are subject to potential tax examinations in
foreign locations for years 2004 through 2010. We do not anticipate that any potential tax adjustments will have a significant impact on our financial position or results of operations. We were not subject to, nor had we received any notice of, income tax examinations as of December31, 2010. 
NOTE 7.COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES Royalties We license technology from third parties and have agreed to pay certain
suppliers a royalty based on the number of chips sold or manufactured, the net sales price of the chips containing the licensed technology or a fixed non-cancelable fee. Royalty expense is recognized based on our estimated average unit cost for
royalty contracts with non-cancelable prepayments and the stated contractual per unit rate for all other agreements. Royalty expense was $1,489, $1,119 and $1,378 for the years ended December31, 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively, which is
included in cost of revenue in the consolidated statements of operations. 
61 Table of Contents
401k Plan We sponsor a 401k plan for eligible employees. Participants may defer a percentage of their annual compensation on a pre-tax basis, not to exceed the dollar limit that is set by law. A discretionary
matching contribution by the Company is allowed and is equal to a uniform percentage of the amount of salary reduction elected to be deferred, which percentage will be determined each year by the Company. The Company made no contributions to the
401k plan during the years ended December31, 2010, 2009 or 2008. Leases 
At December31, 2010, future minimum payments under operating leases are as follows:  Year Ending December31 2011 1,690 2012 1,043 2013 384 3,117 Minimum lease payments above are net of expected sublease rental income of $414, $266 and $135 for the years ending
December31, 2011, 2012 and 2013, respectively. Rent expense for the years ended December31, 2010, 2009 and 2008 was $2,004, $2,014 and $2,421, respectively. Contract Manufacturers In the normal course of business, we commit to purchase products
from our contract manufacturers to be delivered within the next 90 days. In certain situations, should we cancel an order, we could be required to pay cancellation fees. Such obligations could impact our immediate results of operations but would not
materially affect our business. Indemnifications Certain of our agreements include limited indemnification provisions for claims from third-parties relating to our intellectual property. It is not possible for us to predict the maximum potential amount
of future payments or indemnification costs under these or similar agreements due to the conditional nature of our obligations and the unique facts and circumstances involved in each particular agreement. We have not made any payments under these
agreements in the past, and as of December31, 2010, we have not incurred any material liabilities arising from these indemnification obligations. In the future, however, such obligations could immediately impact our results of operations but
are not expected to materially affect our business. Legal Proceedings Effective October1, 2010, the Company and Intersil Corporation Intersil entered into an agreement to resolve the previously disclosed dispute between the parties Superior Court of the
State of California for the County of Santa Clara, Case No1-10-CV-164894 the Action.The agreement includes an amendment to the license agreement between Intersil and the Company reducing the total amount of remaining
prepaid royalties to be paid by the Company from $1,250 to $900. Intersil and the Company each also agreed to dismiss with prejudice their respective claims against the other party in the Action and the Action was dismissed, with prejudice, on
October6, 2010. In addition to the specific issue described above, we are subject to legal matters that arise from time to time in the
ordinary course of our business. Although we currently believe that resolving such matters, individually or in the aggregate, will not have a material adverse effect on our financial position, our results of operations, or our cash flows, these
matters are subject to inherent uncertainties and our view of these matters may change in the future. 
62 Table of Contents NOTE 8.EARNINGS PER SHARE Basic earnings per share amounts are computed based on the weighted average number of common shares outstanding.Diluted weighted average shares outstanding include the weighted average number of
common shares outstanding plus potentially dilutive common shares outstanding during the period. Potentially dilutive common shares from
employee equity incentive plans are determined by applying the treasury stock method to the assumed exercise of outstanding stock options, the assumed vesting of outstanding restricted stock awards and units, and the assumed issuance of common stock
under the stock purchase plan. Potentially dilutive common shares issuable upon conversion of our convertible subordinated debentures are computed using the if-converted-method. The following schedule reconciles the computation of basic net income per share and diluted net income per share in thousands, except per share data: Year Ended December31 2010 2009 2008 Net income used in basic net income per share 373 6,455 7,978 Basic weighted average shares outstanding 13,442 13,318 14,399 Dilutive effect of employee equity incentive plans 942 369 11 Diluted weighted average shares outstanding 14,384 13,687 14,410 Net income per common share Basic 003 048 055 Diluted 003 047 055 The following weighted average shares were excluded from the calculation of diluted weighted average shares outstanding as

NOTE 10.SHAREHOLDERS EQUITY 
Preferred Stock The Company is
authorized to issue 50,000,000 shares of preferred stock with a par value of $0001 per share. The Board of Directors is authorized to fix or alter the rights, preferences, privileges and restrictions granted to, or imposed on, each series of
preferred stock. There are no shares of preferred stock issued as of December31, 2010 and 2009. Common Stock 
The Company is authorized to issue 250,000,000 shares of common stock with a par value of $0001 per share. Shareholders of common stock have unlimited
voting rights and are entitled to receive the net assets of the Company upon dissolution, subject to the rights of the preferred shareholders, if any. Reverse Stock Split On June4, 2008, we effected a one-for-three reverse split of our
common stock. The exercise price and number of shares of common stock issuable under our stock incentive plans, as well as the conversion price and number of shares issuable upon conversion of our debentures, were proportionately adjusted to reflect
the reverse stock split. Basic and diluted weighted average shares outstanding and earnings per share have been calculated to reflect the reverse stock split in all periods presented, as have all disclosures that include a reference to the number of
shares of our common stock or a related calculation. Employee Equity Incentive Plans 
On May23, 2006, our shareholders approved the adoption of the Pixelworks, Inc. 2006 Stock Incentive Plan the 2006 Plan. Our
shareholders approved increases to the total authorized shares of 1,000,000, 1,150,000, and 1,000,000 on May18, 2010,May19, 2009, and May20, 2008, respectively, increasing the total authorized shares available for issuance as
equity awards to employees and non-employee directors to 4,483,333 shares. The 2006 Plan replaced our previously existing stock incentive plans including our 1997 Stock Incentive Plan, as amended, our 2001 Nonqualified Stock Option Plan, the Equator
Technologies, Inc. 1996 Stock Incentive Plan, as amended, and Equator Technologies, Inc. stand-alone option plans collectively, Old Stock Incentive Plans. Upon adoption of the 2006 Plan, no additional options could be issued under the
Old Stock Incentive Plans, although awards previously granted under the Old Stock Incentive Plans remain outstanding according to their original terms. As of December31, 2010, 1,551,929 shares were available for grant under the 2006 Plan.
Stock Options Options
granted must generally be exercised while the individual is an employee. In May 2009, the 2006 Plan was modified to reduce the contractual life of newly issued stock awards from ten to six years. Our new hire vesting schedule provides that each
option becomes exercisable at a rate of 25% on the first anniversary date of the grant and 2083% on the last day of every month thereafter for a total of 36 additional increments. Our merit vesting schedule provides that merit-type awards become
exercisable monthly over a period of three years.

$2,919. Options outstanding that have vested and are expected to vest as of December31, 2010 are as follows: Number ofshares Weightedaverageexerciseprice  Aggregateintrinsicvalue Vested 1,623,520 743 589 1,610,775 Expected to vest 1,062,037 247 612 1,135,039 Total 2,685,557 547 598 2,745,814 The fair value of options vested in each of the years ended December31, 2010, 2009 and 2008 approximates total
stock-based compensation expense recorded in our statement of operations during each of the respective years. Restricted Stock Awards
The 2006 Plan provides for the issuance of restricted stock, including restricted stock units, to employees and non-employee directors.
During the years ended December31, 2010 and 2009, we granted 48,000 and 100,000 shares, respectively, of restricted stock with a fair value of $426 and $060 per share, respectively. No restricted stock was granted during the year ended
December31, 2008. As of December31, 2010 there were 81,666 unvested shares of restricted stock outstanding. Employee Stock
Purchase Plans On January31, 2010, the 2000 Employee Stock Purchase Plan 2000 ESPP expired. During the years ended
December31, 2010, 2009 and 2008, we issued 12,382, 18,326, and 23,553 shares, respectively, for proceeds of $18, $11 and $45, respectively, under the 2000 ESPP. On May18, 2010, our shareholders approved the adoption of the 2010 Pixelworks, Inc. Employee Stock Purchase Plan the ESPP for U.S. employees and for certain foreign subsidiary
employees. The ESPP provides for separate offering periods commencing on February1 and August1, with the first offering period 
65 Table of Contents
beginning August1, 2010. Each offering period continues for a period of 18 months with purchases every six months. Each eligible employee may purchase up to 3,000 shares of stock on each
purchase date, with a maximum annual purchase amount of $25.The purchase price is equal to 85% of the lesser of the fair market value of the shares on the offering date or on the purchase date. A total of 1,300,000 shares of common stock have
been reserved for issuance under the ESPP. As of December31, 2010, there were no shares issued under the ESPP. Stock-Based
Compensation Expense The fair value of stock-based compensation was determined using the Black-Scholes option pricing model and the
following weighted average assumptions:  YearEndedDecember31 2010 2009 2008 Stock Option Plans Risk free interest rate 211 224 271 Expected dividend yield 0 0 0 Expected term in years 46 50 48 Volatility 92 84 68 Employee Stock Purchase Plan Risk free interest rate 033 033 205 Expected dividend yield 0 0 0 Expected term in years 11 05 05 Volatility 94 137 85
% The weighted average
fair value of options granted during the years ended December31, 2010, 2009 and 2008 was $227, $095 and $113, respectively. The risk free interest rate is estimated using an average of treasury bill interest rates. The expected dividend
yield is zero as we have not paid any dividends to date and do not expect to pay dividends in the future. Expected volatility is estimated based on the historical volatility of our common stock over the expected term as this represents our best
estimate of future volatility. For the year ended December31, 2008 and from January 2009 to April 2009, the expected term of options was estimated using historical exercise behavior. Subsequent to the May 2009 amendment of our 2006 Stock
Incentive Plan, which shortened the contractual life of newly issued stock options from ten to six years, we have elected to use the simplified method to estimate expected term. Under the simplified method, an options expected term
is calculated as the average of its vesting period and original contractual life. The expected term of ESPP purchase rights is based on the estimated weighted average time to purchase. As of December31, 2010, unrecognized stock-based compensation cost is $2,190, which is expected to be recognized as compensation expense over a weighted average period of 21 years.

26 PART II  Item5.Controls and Procedures. Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
As of the end of the period covered by this report, we conducted an evaluation under the supervision and with the participation of our Chief Executive
Officer and Chief Financial Officer of our disclosure controls and procedures as defined in Rule 13a-15e and Rule 15d-15f of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended the Exchange Act. Based on this evaluation, the Chief
Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that, as of December31, 2010, our disclosure controls and procedures were effective to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our periodic reports filed or submitted under
the Securities Exchange Act is irecorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the Securities and Exchange Commissions rules and forms, and iiaccumulated and communicated to our management,
including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding disclosure. Our
management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, does not expect that our disclosure controls and procedures will prevent or detect all errors and all fraud. Disclosure controls and procedures, no matter how well
designed, operated and managed, can provide only reasonable assurance that the objectives of the disclosure controls and procedures are met. Because of the inherent limitations of disclosure controls and procedures, no evaluation of such disclosure
controls and procedures can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, have been detected. 
Managements Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining a system of internal control over financial reporting as defined in Rules13a-15f and 15d-15f under the Exchange Act to provide
reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. All internal control systems, no matter how
well designed, have inherent limitations. 
68 Table of Contents
We conducted an assessment of the effectiveness of our system of internal control over financial reporting
as of December31, 2010, the last day of our fiscal year. This assessment was based on criteria established in the framework Internal ControlIntegrated Framework, issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway
Commission and included an evaluation of elements such as the design and operating effectiveness of key financial reporting controls, process documentation, accounting policies, and our overall control environment. Based on our assessment,
management has concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of the end of the fiscal year to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements
for external reporting purposes in accordance with U.S.generally accepted accounting principles. We reviewed the results of managements assessment with the Audit Committee of our Board of Directors. 
The effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December31, 2010 has been audited by KPMG LLP, our independent registered
public accounting firm, as stated in their report, which is presented below. Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting
There were no changes to our internal control over financial reporting as defined in Rules 13a-15f and 15d-15f under the Exchange
Act that occurred during the period covered by this report that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm 
The Board of Directors and Shareholders 
Pixelworks, Inc.: We have audited Pixelworks,
Inc.s internal control over financial reporting as of December31, 2010, based on criteria established in Internal ControlIntegrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission
COSO. Pixelworks, Inc.s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying
Management Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Companys internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board United States. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable
assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material
weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audit also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe
that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion. A companys internal control over financial reporting is a process designed
to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A companys internal control over
financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that 1pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; 2provide
reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in
accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and 3provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the companys assets that could
have a material effect on the financial statements. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not
prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies
or procedures may deteriorate. In our opinion, Pixelworks, Inc. maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over
financial reporting as of December31, 2010, based on criteria established in Internal ControlIntegrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. 
We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board United States, the consolidated balance sheets
of Pixelworks, Inc. and subsidiaries as of December31, 2010 and 2009, and the related consolidated statements of operations, shareholders equity deficit and comprehensive income loss, and cash flows for each of the years in the
three-year period ended December31, 2010, and our report dated March9, 2011 expressed an unqualified opinion on those consolidated financial statements. /s/ KPMG LLP Portland, Oregon March9, 2011
