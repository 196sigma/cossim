Item 8, at January 31, 2000 and at various
prior quarters the Company was not in compliance with certain financial
covenants under its Facility and the Senior Notes. The Company obtained a series
of waivers on its breach of the covenant requirements to January 31, 2000 and
through June 12, 2000.
Effective as of June 12, 2000, the Company entered into an amendment of the
Facility and an amendment and restatement of the Note Purchase Agreement for the
Senior Notes. As part of the amendments to the Facility and the Senior Notes,
the combined borrowings are jointly collateralized on a pari passu basis by
substantially all of the assets of the Company and its subsidiaries.
The Facility, as amended, allows for maximum borrowings of up to $50
million. The aggregate amount outstanding under the Facility and the Senior
Notes is limited to a borrowing base predicated on eligible inventory, as
defined, and rental video assets, net. The Facility bears interest based on the
lender base rate plus 10% base rate plus 175% on the amount in excess of
the normal amount in the over-advance period or LIBOR plus 250% LIBOR plus
325% on the amount in excess of the normal advance rate amount in the
over-advance period, at the Company option. In addition the Company is
required to pay a quarterly commitment fee of 050% on the unused Facility.
Borrowings under the Facility are limited to an advance rate of 55% of eligible
inventory eligible inventory is defined as 6122% of inventory, net and 50% of
rental video assets net of accumulated amortization, less the outstanding
borrowings under the Senior Notes and any required rental reserve. The Facility
provides for an increase in the advance rate to cover additional working capital                    22
23 requirements through the Christmas selling season the seasonal over-advance.
The advance rate increases to 65% of eligible inventory from August 1 through
September 30 and to 70% of eligible inventory from October 1 through December
31, 2000 and December 16, 2001, respectively the seasonal over-advance
periods. The Facility includes revised covenants requiring the maintenance of
specific financial ratios and minimum tangible net worth requirements. In
addition, a covenant was added to the Facility requiring the Company income
before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization EBITDA to be at least
equal to specified levels for future periods. Further, the Facility imposes
certain restrictions with respect to indebtedness, dividend payments, investment
and capital expenditures. The Facility expires on December 16, 2001.
The Senior Notes, as amended, have a stated interest rate of 1025%. The
amended and restated Note Purchase Agreement evidencing the amended Senior Notes
has financial covenants that are the same as those contained in the amended
Facility including financial ratios, minimum adjusted net worth requirements and
restrictions on indebtedness, investment, capital expenditures, and the payment
of dividends.
The Company believes it will be able to comply with the financial covenants
relating to both the amended Facility and the amended Senior Notes for the next
twelve months; however, there can be no assurance of such compliance. The breach
of any of the covenants contained in the amended Facility or the amended Senior
Notes could result in a default under the amended Facility and the amended
Senior Notes which could result in further advances under the revolving credit
facility no longer being available from the lender and could enable the
respective lenders to require immediate repayment of the borrowings including
accrued interest under the agreements. If the lenders were to accelerate the
repayment of borrowings, including accrued interest, the Company cannot be
certain that its assets would be sufficient to repay such obligations. The
amended Facility and the amended Senior Notes are guaranteed by each of the
Company three consolidated subsidiaries, and are in part secured by first
priority liens on all of the capital stock and substantially all of the assets
of each subsidiary.
The Company primary sources of liquidity are currently, cash flows from
operating activities and borrowings under the Facility. As of June 7, 2000 194 million was borrowed under the Facility. The Company believes that, based
on current and anticipated financial performance, cash flows from operating
activities and borrowings under the amended Facility will be adequate to meet
anticipated requirements for capital expenditures, working capital and required
principal and interest payments under the amended Senior Notes and the amended
Facility. The ability of the Company to satisfy its capital requirements will be
dependent upon future financial performance of the Company, which in turn is
subject to general economic conditions and to financial issues and other
factors, including factors beyond the Company control. See - Risk Factors
As described above under Item 1. Business, the Company plans to slow its
growth rate from that previously described and focus on the expansion and
remodeling of its existing superstores. The Company invests generally between $1
million and $2 million in a new superstore, with the largest components of that
amount being merchandise, videos, fixtures and leasehold improvements. The
Company expanded seven superstores in fiscal 1999 and plans to expand
approximately four superstores in fiscal 2000. The Company generally invests
between $05 million to $10 million to expand a superstore.
At January 31, 2000, the Company had one other debt obligation totaling
$05 million. The principal on this obligation is payable quarterly until
maturity in May 2002. In addition, the Company maintains two capitalized lease
obligations with initial terms of 15 years. The total amount of these
obligations was $15 million at January 31, 2000.
Seasonality and Inflation
As is the case with many retailers, a significant portion of the Company
revenues, and an even greater portion of its operating profit, is generated in
the fourth fiscal quarter, which includes the Christmas selling season. As a
result, a substantial portion of the Company annual earnings has been, and
will continue to be, dependent on the results of this quarter. The Company
experiences reduced rentals of video activity in the spring because customers
spend more time outdoors. Major world or sporting events, such as the Super
Bowl, the Olympic Games or the World Series, also have a temporary adverse
effect on revenues. Future operating results may be affected by many                    23
24 factors, including variations in the number and timing of store openings, the
number and popularity of new book, music and videocassette titles, the cost of
the new release or best renter titles, changes in comparable-store revenues,
competition, marketing programs, increases in the minimum wage, weather, special
or unusual events, and other factors that may affect retailers in general and
the Company in particular.
The Company does not believe that inflation has materially impacted net
income during the past three years. Substantial increases in costs and expenses
could have a significant impact on the Company operating results to the extent
such increases are not passed along to customers.
Recent Accounting Pronouncements
In June 1998, the Financial Accounting Standards Board FASB issued
Statement on Financial Accounting Standards SFAS No. 133, Accounting for
Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities that impacts the Company
accounting treatment and/or its disclosure obligations. The statement
establishes accounting and reporting standards for derivative instruments,
including derivative instruments embedded in other contracts, and for hedging
activities. It requires that an entity recognize all derivatives as either
assets or liabilities in the statement of financial position and measure those
instruments at fair value. The statement, as amended by SFAS No. 137,
Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities - Deferral of the
Effective Date of FASB Statement No. 133, is effective for all fiscal quarters
of fiscal years beginning after June 15, 2000. The adoption of SFAS No. 133 is
not expected to have a material impact on the Company.
In March 2000, the FASB issued Interpretation No. 44, Accounting for
Certain Transactions Involving Stock Compensation - an Interpretation of APB
Opinion No. 25 FIN 44. Among other issues, this interpretation clarifies
the definition of employee for purposes of applying APB Opinion No. 25,
Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees APB 25, the criteria for
determining whether a plan qualifies as a non-compensatory plan, the accounting
consequence of various modifications to the terms of previously fixed stock
options or awards, and the accounting for an exchange of stock compensation
awards in a business combination. This Interpretation is effective July 1, 2000,
but certain conclusions in this Interpretation cover specific events that
occurred after either December 15, 1998, or January 12, 2000. Management
believes that FIN 44 will not have a material effect on the financial position
or the results of operations of the Company upon adoption.                    24

ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK
In the ordinary course of its business, the Company is exposed to certain
market risks, primarily changes in interest rates. The Company exposure to
interest rate risk consists of variable rate debt based on the lenders base rate
or LIBOR plus a specified percentage at the Company option. The annual impact
on the Company results of operations of a 100 basis point interest rate change
on the January 31, 2000 outstanding balance of the variable rate debt would be
approximately $03 million. After an assessment of these risks to the Company
operations, the Company believes that its primary market risk exposures within
the meaning of Regulation S-K Item 305 are not material and are not expected to
have any material adverse impact on the Company financial position, results of
operations or cash flows for the next fiscal year. The Company is not party to
any derivative contracts. See notes 1j and 7 to the accompanying
consolidated financial statements.                    25

Hastings Entertainment, Inc. We have audited the consolidated financial statements of Hastings Entertainment,
Inc. and subsidiaries as listed in the accompanying index. In connection with
our audits of the consolidated financial statements, we also have audited the
related financial statement schedule as listed in the accompanying index. These
consolidated financial statements and financial statement schedule are the
responsibility of the Company management. Our responsibility is to express an
opinion on these consolidated financial statements and financial statement
schedule based on our audits.
We conducted our audits in accordance with generally accepted auditing
standards. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material
misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting
the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes
assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by
management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.
We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present
fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Hastings
Entertainment, Inc. and subsidiaries as of January 31, 2000 and 1999, and the
results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the years in the
three-year period ended January 31, 2000, in conformity with generally accepted
accounting principles. Also in our opinion, the related financial statement
schedule, when considered in relation to the basic consolidated financial
statements taken as a whole, presents fairly, in all material respects, the
information set forth therein.
As discussed in Note 2, the accompanying consolidated balance sheet as of
January 31, 1999 and the consolidated statements of operations, shareholders'
equity and cash flows for the years ended January 31, 1999 and 1998 have been
restated.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements
January 31, 2000 and 1999 1 OPERATIONS AND SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
a GENERAL
Hastings Entertainment, Inc. and subsidiaries the Company operates a
chain of retail stores in 22 states, primarily in the Western and
Midwestern United States, with revenues originating from the sale of
music, books, software, periodicals, videocassette, video game and DVD
products and the rental of videocassettes, video games and DVDs.
b BASIS OF CONSOLIDATION
The consolidated financial statements present the results of Hastings
Entertainment, Inc. and its subsidiaries. All significant intercompany
transactions and balances have been eliminated in consolidation.
The Company fiscal years ended January 31, 2000, 1999 and 1998 are
referred to as fiscal 1999, 1998 and 1997, respectively.
c BASIS OF PRESENTATION
Certain prior year amounts have been reclassified to conform with
fiscal 1999 presentation.
d REVENUE RECOGNITION
Merchandise and rental video revenue are presented net of returns and
exclude all taxes. An allowance has been established to provide for
projected merchandise returns.
e CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS
The Company considers all short-term investments with original
maturities of three months or less primarily money market mutual
funds to be cash equivalents.
f MERCHANDISE INVENTORIES
Merchandise inventories are recorded at the lower of standard cost
which approximates the first-in, first-out FIFO method or market.
g PROPERTY AND EQUIPMENT
Property and equipment, excluding rental video assets see note 3,
are recorded at cost and depreciated using the straight-line method.
Furniture, fixtures and equipment are depreciated over their estimated
useful lives of 3 to 5 years. Leasehold improvements are amortized
over the shorter of the related lease term or their estimated useful
lives.
Property recorded pursuant to capital lease obligations is stated at
the present value of the minimum lease payments at the inception of
each lease, not in excess of fair value, and amortized on a
straight-line basis over related lease term.
The Company reviews long-lived assets for impairment whenever events
or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an
asset may not be recoverable. Recoverability of assets to be held and
used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of the asset
to future net cash flows expected to be generated by the asset. If
such assets are considered to be impaired, the impairment to be
recognized is measured by the amount by which the carrying amount of
the assets exceeds the fair value of the assets. Assets to be disposed
of are reported at the lower of the carrying amount or fair value less
costs to sell.                    32
33          HASTINGS ENTERTAINMENT, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements
January 31, 2000 and 1999   h INCOME TAXES
Income taxes are accounted for under the asset and liability method.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax
consequences attributable to differences between the financial
statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and
their respective tax bases and operating loss and tax credit
carryforwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using
enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in
which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or
settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change
in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the
enactment date.
i FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS
The carrying amount of long-term debt approximates fair value as of
January 31, 2000 and 1999 due to the instruments bearing interest at
market rates. The carrying amount of accounts payable approximates
fair value because of its short maturity period.
j DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS
During fiscal year 1998 and 1997, the Company only derivative
position was a non-leveraged off-balance-sheet interest rate swap. The
interest rate swap was accounted for by recording the net interest
received or paid as an adjustment to interest expense on a current
basis. The swap expired in June 1998.
k STOCK OPTION PLANS
The Company accounts for its stock option plans in accordance with the
provisions of Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 25 APB 25,
Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees, and related interpretations.
Compensation expense is recorded on the date of grant only if the
market price of the underlying stock exceeds the exercise price. Under
Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123 SFAS 123,
Accounting for Stock-based Compensation, the Company may elect to
recognize expense for stock-based compensation based on the fair value
of the awards, or continue to account for stock-based compensation
under APB 25 and disclose in the financial statements the effects of
SFAS 123 as if the recognition provisions were adopted. The Company
has elected to continue to apply the provisions of APB 25 and provide
the pro forma disclosure provisions of SFAS 123.
l ADVERTISING COSTS
Advertising costs for newspaper, television and other media are
expensed as incurred. Net advertising expenses for the fiscal years
1999, 1998, and 1997 were $37 million, $13 million and $21 million,
respectively.
m PRE-OPENING COSTS
Pre-opening expenses include human resource costs, travel, rent,
advertising, supplies and certain other costs incurred prior to a
superstore opening and are expensed as incurred.
n INCOME LOSS PER SHARE
Basic income loss per share is computed by dividing net income
loss by the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding
during the period. Diluted income per share includes additional shares
that would have resulted from potentially dilutive securities. Prior
to the Company Common Stock being publicly traded, for purposes of
computing dilution of securities under the treasury stock method, the
price of the Company stock was based upon annual appraisals of the
value of the Company.                    33
34          HASTINGS ENTERTAINMENT, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements
January 31, 2000 and 1999      Options to purchase 1,813,965 shares of Common Stock at exercise
prices ranging from $525 per share to $1500 per share outstanding at
January 31, 2000, 425,600 shares of Common Stock at exercise prices
ranging from $1300 per share to $1500 per share outstanding at
January 31, 1999, 688,656 shares of Common Stock at exercise prices
ranging from $1364 per share to $1929 per share outstanding at
January 31, 1998 were not included in the computation of diluted EPS
because their inclusion would have been antidilutive.
o USE OF MANAGEMENT ESTIMATES
The preparation of the financial statements in conformity with
generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make
estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets
and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at
the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of
revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results
could differ from those estimates.
p COMPREHENSIVE INCOME
Comprehensive income loss is equal to net income loss for all
periods presented.                    34

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements
January 31, 2000 and 1999 3 CHANGE IN ACCOUNTING METHOD
The Company adopted a new, accelerated method of amortizing its rental
video assets in the fourth quarter of fiscal 1998. The Company adopted the
new method upon implementation of a new business model, which includes
revenue-sharing agreements with major studios. Revenue sharing increases
the number of videos in the stores and satisfies customer demand over a
shorter period of time. Revenue sharing allows the Company to acquire
videos at a lower initial cost than traditional buying arrangements. The
Company then shares with studios a percentage of the actual net rental
revenues generated over a contractually determined period of time. Revenue
sharing results in a greater proportion of rental revenue received over a
reduced rental period and, accordingly, the Company has changed its method
of amortizing rental videos in order to better match expenses with
revenues.
Under the new amortization method, revenue-sharing payments are expensed as
revenues are earned under the terms of the specific contracts with
supplying studios. The capitalized cost of all videos is being amortized on
an accelerated basis over six months to a salvage value of $4 per unit,
except for videos purchased for the initial stock of a new store, which are
being amortized on a straight-line basis over 36 months to a salvage value
of $4 per unit.
The adoption of the new amortization method was accounted for as a change
in accounting estimate effected by a change in accounting principle and,
accordingly, the Company recorded a non-cash pre-tax charge of $185
million, which is included in rental video cost of revenues in the fourth
quarter of fiscal 1998, increasing net loss and diluted loss per share for
fiscal 1998 by $115 million and $110 per share, respectively.
The calculation of the change in operating expense attributable to videos
for prior periods would not be meaningful because the new business model
involving revenue-sharing arrangements had not been implemented.
During fiscal 1998, prior to adopting the new method of amortization in the
fourth quarter, the capitalized cost of base unit rental video assets
copies one through four of a title for each store was amortized on a
straight-line basis over 36 months to a salvage value of $5. The
capitalized cost of non-base unit rental video assets copies five and
above of a title for each store was amortized on a straight-line basis
over six months to a salvage value of $5.
During fiscal 1997, the Company amortized the cost of rental video assets
on a straight-line method over an 18-month period to a salvage value of $5.
The Company also recorded markdowns for under-performing rental video
assets. The amortization and markdown policies combined to provide an
average cost allocation period of 8-13 months.
The Company believes its results of operations in fiscal 1997 would not
have been materially different had the Company used the amortization method
that was used in fiscal 1998 prior to the fourth quarter change in method.                    38

Merchandise inventories that are not sold can normally be returned to the
suppliers. The allowance for cost of inventory returns represents estimated
costs related to merchandise returned or to be returned to suppliers for
which credit is pending. Because the amount of credit to be received
requires estimates, it is reasonably possible that the Company estimate
of the ultimate settlement with its suppliers may change in the near term.                    40

At January 31, 2000 and 1999, the Company had borrowings outstanding of
$323 million and $177 million, respectively, under a revolving credit
facility the Facility. The Facility accrued interest at variable rates
based on the lender base rate or LIBOR. The average rate of interest
being charged under the Facility at January 31, 2000 and 1999 was 69% and
73%, respectively.
Also, at January 31, 2000 and 1999, the Company had outstanding with a
financial institution $20 million and $25 million, respectively, aggregate
principal amount of unsecured Series A Senior Notes due June 13, 2003 the
Senior Notes. The Company began making required $50 million annual
principal payments on June 13, 1999. The Senior Notes had a stated interest
rate of 775% at January 31, 2000.
As a result of the restatement adjustments discussed in note 2, at January
31, 2000 and at various prior quarters, the Company was not in compliance
with certain financial covenants under its Facility and the Senior Notes.
The Company obtained a series of waivers on its breach of the covenant
requirements to January 31, 2000 and through June 12, 2000.
Effective as of June 12, 2000, the Company entered into an amendment of the
Facility and an amendment and restatement of the Note Purchase Agreement
for the Senior Notes. As part of the amendments to the Facility and the
Senior Notes, the combined borrowings are jointly collateralized on a pari
passu basis by substantially all of the assets of the Company and its
subsidiaries.
The Facility, as amended, allows for maximum borrowings of up to $50
million. The aggregate amount outstanding under the Facility and the Senior
Notes is limited to a borrowing base predicated on eligible inventory, as
defined, and rental video assets, net. The Facility bears interest based on
the lender base rate plus 10% base rate plus 175% on the amount in
excess of the normal amount in the over-advance period or LIBOR plus 250%
LIBOR plus 325% on the amount in excess of the normal advance rate amount
in the over-advance period, at the Company option. In addition the
Company is required to pay a quarterly commitment fee of 050% on the
unused Facility. Borrowings under the Facility are limited to an advance
rate of 55% of eligible inventory eligible inventory is defined as 6122%
of inventory, net and 50% of rental video assets net of accumulated
amortization, less the outstanding borrowings under the Senior Notes and
any required rental reserve. The Facility provides for an increase in the
advance rate to cover additional working capital requirements through the
Christmas selling season the seasonal over-advance. The advance rate
increases to 65% of eligible inventory from August 1 through September 30
and to 70% of eligible inventory from October 1 through December 31, 2000
and December 16, 2001, respectively the seasonal over-advance periods.
The Facility includes revised covenants requiring the maintenance of
specific financial ratios and minimum tangible net worth requirements. In
addition, a covenant was added to the Facility requiring the Company
income before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization EBITDA be at
least equal to specified levels for future periods. Further, the Facility
imposes certain restrictions with respect to                    41

HASTINGS ENTERTAINMENT, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements
January 31, 2000 and 1999   indebtedness, dividend payments, investment and capital expenditures. The
Facility expires on December 16, 2001.
The Senior Notes, as amended, have a stated interest rate of 1025%. The
amended and restated Note Purchase Agreement evidencing the amended Senior
Notes has financial covenants that are the same as those contained in the
amended Facility including financial ratios, minimum adjusted net worth
requirements and restrictions on indebtedness, investment, capital
expenditures, and the payment of dividends.
The Company believes it will be able to comply with the financial covenants
relating to both the amended Facility and the amended Senior Notes for the
next twelve months; however, there can be no assurance of such compliance.
The breach of any of the covenants contained in the amended Facility or the
amended Senior Notes could result in a default under the amended Facility
and the amended Senior Notes which could result in further advances under
the Facility no longer being available from the lender and could enable the
respective lenders to require immediate repayment of the borrowings
including accrued interest under the agreements. If the lenders were to
accelerate the repayment of borrowings including accrued interest, the
Company cannot be certain that its assets would be sufficient to repay such
obligations. In addition, the ability of the Company to satisfy its capital
requirements will be dependent upon the future financial performance of the
Company, which in turn is subject to general economic conditions and to
financial issues and other factors, including factors beyond the Company
control. The amended Facility and the amended Senior Notes are guaranteed
by each of the Company three consolidated subsidiaries, and are in part
secured by first priority liens on all of the capital stock and
substantially all of the assets of each subsidiary.
The capitalized lease obligations represent two leases on certain retail
space with initial terms of 15 years.
The aggregate maturities of long-term debt and capitalized lease
obligations for years subsequent to fiscal 1999 are as follows dollars in

The Company did not record a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets at
January 31, 2000 or 1999. In assessing the realizability of deferred tax
assets, management considers the scheduled reversal of deferred tax assets
and liabilities, future taxable income and tax planning strategies. The
Company believes it is more likely than not it will realize the benefits of
these deductible differences over the periods which the deferred tax assets
are deductible.
In fiscal 1997 the Company elected to change from the LIFO cost method to
the FIFO cost method of inventory accounting for financial reporting and
income tax purposes. The $47 million deferred tax liability related to the
tax LIFO reserve at January 31, 1997 is being included in taxable income
ratably over a four-year period beginning in fiscal 1997. 10 401k AND ASOP

The 1991 and 1994 Stock Option Plans and the 1996 Incentive Stock Plan
authorize the award of both incentive stock options and non-qualified stock
options to purchase Common Stock to officers, other associates and
directors of the Company. The exercise price per share of incentive stock
options may not be less than the market price of the Company Common Stock
on the date the option is granted. The exercise price per share of
non-qualified stock options is determined by the Board of Directors, or a
committee thereof. The term of each option is determined by the Board of
Directors and generally will not exceed ten years from the date of grant.
The exercise price of options issued to certain executive officers of the
Company included fixed annual increases, which were eliminated in fiscal
1997.
The 1996 Incentive Stock Plan also authorizes the granting of stock
appreciation rights, restricted stock, dividend equivalent rights, stock
awards, and other stock-based awards to officers, other associates,
directors, and consultants of the Company. There have been no grants of
these awards under this plan.
The Company Chief Executive Officer has an option to acquire 404,720
shares of Common Stock, which may be exercised in full or in part through
January 31, 2007. In fiscal 1997, the exercise price of these options was
reduced from $1364 to $1107 and fixed annual increases of the option
exercise price were eliminated. The Company recorded compensation expense
of $10 million and an income tax benefit of $04 million for the change in
exercise price in fiscal 1997.
The Company has a management stock purchase plan that authorizes the
issuance of up to 227,655 shares of Common Stock, pursuant to agreements
providing for the purchase of Restricted Stock Units RSU. The cost of
each RSU is equal to 75% of the fair market value of the Common Stock of

HASTINGS ENTERTAINMENT, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements
January 31, 2000 and 1999    The Company applies APB 25 and related interpretations in accounting for
its Plans. Since the Company grants all stock options, except for options
granted and re-priced to the Company Chief Executive Officer and RSUs
as described above, with an exercise price equal to or greater than the
current market price of the stock on the grant date, compensation expense
recorded is not significant. Had the Company determined compensation cost
based on the fair/minimum value at the date of grant for its stock
options under SFAS 123, the Company net income loss and income loss
per share would have been reduced to the pro forma amounts indicated

14  LITIGATION AND CONTINGENCIES
The Company employees are covered under a self-insured health plan.
Claims in excess of $100,000 per employee are insured by an insurance
company. Estimated claims incurred but not reported have been accrued in
the accompanying financial statements. Health insurance expense during
fiscal 1999, 1998 and 1997 was $20 million, $14 million and $11
million, respectively.
The Company is partially self-insured for workers' compensation. Claims
in excess of $100,000 per accident and $11 million in the aggregate
annually are insured by an insurance company. Estimated claims incurred
but not reported have been accrued in the accompanying consolidated
financial statements. Workers' compensation expense during fiscal 1999,
1998 and 1997 was $03 million, $01 million and $04 million,

Following the Company initial announcement on March 7, 2000 of the
requirement for the accounting restatements, six purported class action
lawsuits were filed in the United States District Court for the Northern
District of Texas against the Company and certain of the current and
former directors and officers of the Company asserting various claims
under Sections 10b and 20a of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.
Although four of the lawsuits were originally filed in the Dallas
Division of the Northern District of Texas, all of the five pending
actions have been or will be transferred to the Amarillo Division of the
Northern District and should be consolidated. One of the Section 10b
and 20a lawsuits filed in the Dallas Division was voluntarily
dismissed. On May 15, 2000, a lawsuit was filed in the United States
District Court for the Northern District of Texas against the Company,
its current and former directors and officers at the time of the
Company June 1998 initial public offering and three underwriters,
Salomon Smith Barney, A.G. Edwards & Sons, Inc. and Furman Selz, LLC
asserting various claims under Sections 11, 122 and 15 of the
Securities Act of 1933.
None of the six pending complaints specify the amount of damages sought.
Although it is not feasible to predict or determine the final outcome of
the proceedings or to estimate the potential range of loss with respect
to these matters, an adverse outcome with respect to such proceedings
could have a material adverse impact on the Company financial position,
results of operations and cash flows.                    49

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements
January 31, 2000 and 1999    The Company is also involved in various other claims and legal actions
arising in the ordinary course of business. In the opinion of management,
the ultimate disposition of these matters will not have a material
adverse effect on the Company financial position, results of operations
and cash flows.
15  SALE OF MALL STORES
During fiscal 1993, the Company sold the assets, primarily inventory and
leasehold improvements, related to 26 mall stores to Camelot Music, Inc.
Camelot. Proceeds from the sales were $94 million and the Company
recognized a gain of $38 million. During fiscal 1994, the Company sold
the assets of an additional 16 mall stores to Camelot. Proceeds from the
1994 sales were $87 million and the Company recognized a gain of $41
million. The leases on all stores were assigned to Camelot in connection
with the transactions. In the initial assignments, the Company was
relieved from any further liability under eight leases.
In August 1996, Camelot filed for protection from creditors under the
federal bankruptcy code. At the time Camelot filed bankruptcy, seven
additional leases had expired, and the Company believed that an
additional seven leases had been terminated or amended by agreement of
Camelot and the lessors such that the Company would have no liability,
leaving a total of 20 leases on which the Company believed it might have
potential liability. In 1996, the Company recorded a $25 million reserve
for future lease obligations related to these stores.
Camelot ultimately rejected six leases in its bankruptcy proceeding, and
the bankruptcy court approved the plan in December 1997. Based on these
events, the Company reduced its recorded reserve for future lease
obligations to $05 million at January 31, 1998.
In fiscal 1998, the Company was released from contingent liability on the
remaining six leases by a bankruptcy court order. Accordingly, in the
fourth quarter of fiscal 1998, the Company reduced the remaining $05
million reserve for future lease obligations to zero and included such
amount in gain loss on sale of mall stores in the Consolidated
Statements of Operations.                    50

The Company has two operating segments, retail stores and Internet
operations. The Internet operations became a reportable segment in
fiscal 1999 and fiscal 1998 information has been included for
comparability. There were no Internet operations in fiscal 1997, and
the Company operated as a single segment for such year. The Company
chief operating decision maker, as that term is defined in the relevant
accounting standard, regularly reviews financial information about each
of the above operating segments for assessing performance and
allocating resources. Revenue for retail stores is derived from the
sale of merchandise and rental of videocassettes, video games and DVD.
Revenue for Internet operations is derived solely from the sale of
merchandise. Segment information regarding the Company retail stores
and Internet operations for fiscal years 1999 and 1998 is presented

fourth quarter of fiscal year 1999 for the write down of inventory to the
lower of cost or market.
b The Company recorded a pre-tax charge of approximately $51 million in the
fourth quarter of fiscal year 1999 related to the closing of two of its
superstores during fiscal 1999 and five of its stores during the first
quarter of fiscal year 2000. This charge includes the net present value of
future minimum lease payments, write-off of property and equipment, and
other costs associated with the closing of these locations.
c The Company adopted a new, accelerated method of amortizing its rental
video assets in the fourth quarter of fiscal 1998. The adoption of the new
amortization method was accounted for as a change in accounting estimate
effected by a change in accounting principle and, accordingly, the Company
recorded a non-cash, non-recurring, pre-tax charge of $185 million in
rental video cost of revenues in the fourth quarter of fiscal 1998.
d In fiscal 1996, the Company established a reserve of $25 million $16
million after-tax charge to cover potential losses related to certain mall
store leases that were sold prior to fiscal 1995 to Camelot Music, Inc.,
which filed for bankruptcy protection in August 1996. In fiscal 1997, the
reserve was reduced to $05 million, and $17 million was included in Gain
on sale of mall stores. In fiscal 1998, the Company was released from any
contingent liability on the remaining leases by order of a bankruptcy
court. Accordingly, the Company reduced the remaining $05 million reserve
to zero as of January 31, 1999.                    53
