REPORT OF INDEPENDENT CERTIFIED PUBLIC ACCOUNTANTS
TMP Worldwide Inc.
New York, New York
We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of TMP
Worldwide Inc. and Subsidiaries as of December 31, 1998 and 1997, and the
related consolidated statements of operations, stockholders' equity deficit,
comprehensive income loss and cash flows for each of the three years in the
period ended December 31, 1998. These financial statements are the
responsibility of the Company management. Our responsibility is to express an
opinion on these financial statements based on our audits.
We conducted our audits in accordance with generally accepted auditing
standards. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material
misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting
the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes
assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by
management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.
We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
As described in Note 17, on January 28, 1999, the Company acquired all of
the outstanding capital stock of Morgan & Banks Limited in a business
combination to be accounted for as a pooling of interests. This transaction will
require the retroactive restatement of the Company financial statements to
reflect the business combination as if the companies had always been together
once the financial statements for the period in which the business combination
occurred are issued. Accordingly, the accompanying consolidated financial
statements will be restated to reflect the effect of this material business
combination.
In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above
present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of TMP
Worldwide Inc. and Subsidiaries as of December 31, 1998 and 1997, and the
results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in
the period ended December 31, 1998 in conformity with generally accepted
accounting principles.

TMP WORLDWIDE INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
IN THOUSANDS, EXCEPT SHARE AND PER SHARE AMOUNTS
NOTE 1--ORGANIZATION AND BASIS OF PRESENTATION
TMP Worldwide Inc. TMP or the Company is the successor to businesses
formerly conducted by TMP Worldwide Inc. and subsidiaries Old TMP, Worldwide
Classified Inc. and subsidiaries WCI, McKelvey Enterprises, Inc. and
subsidiaries MEI and certain other entities under the control of Andrew J.
McKelvey the Principal Stockholder. Immediately prior to the reorganization,
the Principal Stockholder owned 100% of the common stock of MEI which owned
approximately 86% of the common stock of Old TMP and approximately 33% of the
common stock of WCI. In addition to his approximately 33% ownership of WCI, the
Principal Stockholder had voting proxy on the remaining outstanding shares of
WCI.
WCI was organized in 1993 to sell recruitment advertising. On December 9,
1996, Old TMP, which sells yellow page advertising, merged into MEI. Thereafter,
WCI merged into MEI, MEI then merged into Telephone Marketing Programs
Incorporated and MEI acquired the outstanding minority interest of a subsidiary
the 1996 Mergers. Concurrent with the 1996 Mergers, Telephone Marketing
Programs Incorporated changed its name to TMP Worldwide Inc.
Due to the control of these companies by the Principal Stockholder, the
companies have been consolidated on a retroactive basis in a manner similar to a
pooling-of-interests, the interests previously owned by the Principal
Stockholder are carried at predecessor basis, and in December 1996 i goodwill
in the amount of approximately $16 million was recorded for the issuance of
271,278 shares of common stock of the Company to Old TMP stockholders who had
been previously issued shares of Old TMP in exchange for their minority
interests in certain operating subsidiaries in which they were original owners
and, accordingly, were considered to have made a substantive investment, and is
based on an initial public offering price of $1400 per share, less
approximately $22 million previously recorded on the issuance of these shares,
and ii special compensation in the amount of approximately $520 million was
recorded for the issuance of 3,584,790 shares of common stock of the Company to
Old TMP, WCI and the MEI subsidiary stockholders in exchange for their shares in
those companies which they had received for nominal or no consideration, as
employees or as management of businesses financed substantially by the Principal
Stockholder and, accordingly, were not considered to have made substantive
investments for their minority shares, and is based on an initial public
offering price of $1400 per share. The minority stockholders of Old TMP had
received compensation in lieu of their share of earnings of Old TMP in exchange
for waiving their rights to such earnings, and WCI and the MEI subsidiary had
cumulative losses. Accordingly, no amounts were attributable to these minority
interests in the accompanying consolidated financial statements.
In addition, in 1996, the Principal Stockholder sold or contributed to the
Company his majority interests, and in one case a 49% interest, in five
companies primarily engaged in yellow page and Internet-based advertising. Due
to the element of common control of these companies, all of these transactions
have been accounted for in a manner similar to a pooling-of-interests and each
of the five companies has been included in the accompanying consolidated
financial statements from their respective dates of acquisition by the Principal
Stockholder.
The consolidated financial statements of the Company reflect the shares of
the Company that were outstanding after the 1996 Mergers and have been prepared
to give retroactive effect to the mergers with Johnson Smith & Knisely Inc.

to the 1998 Mergers, which have been accounted for using the pooling of
interests method and, as a result, the financial position, results of operations
and cash flows are presented as if the combining companies had been consolidated
for all periods presented. The consolidated statements of stockholders' equity
reflect the accounts of TMP as if the additional common stock issued in
connection with the 1998 Mergers had been issued for all periods presented.
NOTE 2--SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
PRINCIPLES OF CONSOLIDATION
The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company
and all of its wholly-owned and majority-owned subsidiaries. All significant
intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.
Investments in unconsolidated affiliates are accounted for using the equity
method when the Company owns at least 20% but no more than 50% of such
affiliates. Under the equity method, the Company records its proportionate share
of profits and losses based on its percentage interest in earnings of companies
50% or less owned.
USE OF ESTIMATES
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally
accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and
assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and
disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial
statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the
reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.
PROPERTY AND EQUIPMENT
Property and equipment are stated at cost. Depreciation is computed
primarily using the straight-line method over the following estimated useful
lives:
YEARS
Buildings and     8-32
Furniture and      4-8
Transportation     5-18
Leasehold improvements are amortized over their estimated useful lives or
the lives of the related
leases, whichever is shorter.
INTANGIBLES
Intangibles represent acquisition costs in excess of the fair value of net
tangible assets of businesses purchased and consist primarily of the value of
ongoing client relationships and goodwill. These costs are being amortized over
periods ranging from three to thirty years on a straight-line basis.
LONG-LIVED ASSETS
Long-lived assets, such as ongoing client relationships, goodwill and
property and equipment, are evaluated for impairment when events or changes in
circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not be
recoverable through the estimated undiscounted future cash flows resulting from
the use of these assets. When any such impairment exists, the related assets
will be written down to fair value. No impairment losses have been incurred
through December 31, 1998.

NOTE 2--SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES CONTINUED
FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSLATION AND TRANSACTIONS
The financial position and results of operations of the Company foreign
subsidiaries are determined using local currency as the functional currency.
Assets and liabilities of these subsidiaries are translated at the exchange rate
in effect at each year-end. Income statement accounts are translated at the
average rate of exchange prevailing during the year. Translation adjustments
arising from the use of differing exchange rates from period to period are
included in the cumulative translation adjustment account in stockholders'
equity deficit. Gains and losses resulting from foreign currency transactions
are included in other income expense.
REVENUE RECOGNITION AND WORK-IN-PROCESS
A significant portion of our revenues are derived from commissions for
advertisements placed in telephone directories, newspapers and other media, plus
associated fees for related services. In addition, the Company earns fees for
the placement of advertisements on the Internet, including its career Web sites.
Commissions and fees are generally recognized upon placement date for newspapers
and other media and on publication close date for yellow page advertisements.
The Company also earns fees for executive and mid-level search and selection
services. Revenue is recognized as clients are billed. Billings begin with the
client acceptance of a contract. For search, a retainer equal to 33 1/3% of a
candidate first year estimated annual cash compensation is billed in equal
installments over three consecutive months at which time, in general, the
retainer has been substantially earned. A final invoice is issued in the event
that the candidate actual compensation package exceeds the original estimate.
For selection, a fee equal to between 20% and 30% of a candidate first year
estimated annual cash compensation is billed in equal installments over three
consecutive months the average length of time needed to successfully complete a
search.
The Company quarterly commissions and fees are affected by the timing of
yellow page directory closings which currently have a concentration in the third
quarter. Yellow page publishers may change the timing of directory publications
which may have an effect on the Company quarterly results. The Company
yellow page advertising results are also affected by commissions earned for
volume placements for the year, which are typically reported in the fourth
quarter. Amounts reported in the three months ended December 31, 1998, 1997 and
1996 for commissions on volume placements were $09 million, $20 million and
$35 million, respectively. The Company quarterly commissions and fees for
recruitment advertising are typically highest in the first quarter and lowest in
the fourth quarter; however, the cyclicality in the economy and the Company
clients' employment needs have an overriding impact on the Company quarterly
results in recruitment advertising.
Direct operating costs incurred that relate to future revenue, principally
for yellow page advertisements, are deferred recorded as work-in-process in the
accompanying consolidated balance sheets and are subsequently charged to
expense when the directories are closed for publication and the related
commission is recognized as income.
INCOME TAXES
The provision for income taxes is computed on the pretax income loss based
on the current tax law. Deferred income taxes are recognized for the tax
consequences in future years of differences between the tax basis of assets and
liabilities and their financial reporting amounts at each year-end based on
enacted tax laws and statutory tax rates.

NATURE OF BUSINESS AND CREDIT RISK
The Company operates in three business segments, advertising, Internet and
search and selection. The Company primarily earns commission income for selling
and placing yellow page and recruitment advertising to a large number of
customers in many different industries, fees for executive and mid-level search
& selection services, and fees for advertisements placed on its Internet
websites. The Company operates principally throughout North America, Europe and
the Pacific Rim. In June 1997, the Financial Accounting Standards Board FASB
issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards SFAS No. 131,
Disclosures about Segments of an Enterprise and Related Information, which
supersedes SFAS No. 14, Financial Reporting for Segments of a Business
Enterprise. SFAS No. 131 establishes standards for the way that public
companies report information about operating segments in annual financial
statements and requires reporting of selected information about operating
segments in interim financial statements issued to the public. It also
establishes standards for disclosures regarding products and services,
geographic areas and major customers. SFAS No. 131 defines operating segments as
components of a company about which separate financial information is available
and that is evaluated regularly by the chief operating decision maker in
deciding how to allocate resources and in assessing performance.
SFAS 131 became effective for financial statements for periods beginning
after December 15, 1997. As required by SFAS 131, all periods presented have
been restated to comply with the provision of SFAS 131.
Financial instruments which potentially subject the Company to
concentrations of credit risk are primarily accounts receivable. The Company
performs continuing credit evaluations of its customers and does not require
collateral. For the most part, the Company has not experienced significant
losses related to receivables from individual customers or groups of customers
in any particular industry or geographic area.
FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS
The carrying amounts reported in the consolidated balance sheets for cash
and cash equivalents, accounts receivable and accounts payable approximate fair
value because of the immediate or short-term maturity of these financial
instruments. The carrying amount reported for long-term debt approximates fair
value because, in general, the interest on the underlying instruments fluctuates
with market rates.
STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION
The Company accounts for its stock option awards under the intrinsic value
based method of accounting prescribed by Accounting Principles Board Opinion No.
25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees. Under the intrinsic value based
method, compensation cost is the excess, if any, of the quoted market price of
the stock at grant date or other measurement date over the amount an employee
must pay to acquire the stock. The Company makes pro forma disclosures of net
income and earnings per share as if the fair value based method of accounting
had been applied as required by SFAS No. 123, Accounting for Stock-Based
Compensation.
EARNINGS PER SHARE
During 1997, the FASB issued SFAS No. 128, Earnings per Share, which
provides for the calculation of basic and diluted earnings per share. This
Statement became effective for financial statements issued for periods ending
after December 15, 1997. Basic earnings per share includes no dilution and is
computed by dividing income available to common shareholders by the weighted
average number of common shares outstanding for the period. Diluted earnings per
share reflect, in periods in which they
42

NOTE 2--SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES CONTINUED
have a dilutive effect, the effect of common shares issuable upon exercise of
stock options and warrants. As required by the Statement, all periods presented
have been restated to comply with the provisions of SFAS No. 128.
A reconciliation of shares used in calculating basic and diluted earnings
per common and Class B common share follows in thousands:

STATEMENTS OF CASH FLOWS
For purposes of the statement of cash flows, the Company considers all
highly liquid debt instruments and other short-term investments with an initial
maturity of three months or less to be cash equivalents. The Company has
determined that the effect of foreign exchange rate changes on cash is not
material.
COMPREHENSIVE INCOME
In June 1997, the FASB issued SFAS No. 130, Reporting Comprehensive Income,
which establishes standards for reporting and display of comprehensive income,
its components and accumulated balances. Comprehensive income is defined to
include all changes in equity except those resulting from investments by owners
and distributions to owners. Among other disclosures, SFAS No. 130 requires that
all items that are required to be recognized under current accounting standards
as components of comprehensive income be reported in a financial statement that
is displayed with the same prominence as other financial statements. The only
item of comprehensive income loss is foreign currency translation adjustments.
The Company adopted SFAS No. 130 in the first quarter of 1998.
POST RETIREMENT BENEFITS
In February 1998, the FASB issued SFAS No. 132, Employers' Disclosures about
Pensions and Other Postretirement Benefits, which standardizes the disclosure
requirements for pensions and other postretirement benefits. The adoption of
SFAS No. 132 in 1998 did not have a material impact on the Company
disclosures.
EFFECT OF RECENTLY ISSUED ACCOUNTING STANDARDS
In March 1998, the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants
AICPA issued Statement of Position SOP 98-1. Accounting for the Cost of
Computer Software Developed or Obtained for Internal Use SOP 981. SOP 98-1
is effective for financial statements for years beginning after
43

NOTE 2--SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES CONTINUED
December 15, 1998. SOP 98-1 provides guidance over accounting for computer
software developed or obtained for internal use including the requirement to
capitalize specified costs and amortization of such costs. We do not expect the
adoption of this standard to have a material effect on our capitalization
policy.
In June 1998, the FASB issued SFAS No. 133, Accounting for Derivatives and
Hedging Activities SFAS No. 133, which establishes accounting and reporting
standards for derivative instruments, including certain derivative instruments
embedded in other contracts, collectively referred to as derivatives and for
hedging activities. SFAS No. 133 is effective for all fiscal quarters of fiscal
years beginning after June 15, 1999. The Company does not expect the adoption of
this statement to have a significant impact on the Company results of
operations, financial position or cash flows.

ACQUISITIONS ACCOUNTED FOR USING THE PURCHASE METHOD
In addition to the poolings of interest transactions discussed above, the
Company has acquired 39 businesses primarily recruitment advertising
businesses between January 1, 1996 and December 31, 1998 including, on August
26, 1997, all of the outstanding stock of Austin Knight Limited and subsidiaries
Austin Knight for approximately $47,200 net of approximately $11,500 of cash
acquired relating to the sale, in July 1997, of real property by Austin Knight
and on July 2, 1996, all of the outstanding shares of Neville Jeffress Australia
Pty Limited Neville Jeffress. Austin Knight had commissions and fees of
approximately $47,600 for the year ended September 30, 1996, and Neville
Jeffress had commissions and fees of approximately $24,000 for the year ended
June 30, 1996. The total amount of cash paid and promissory notes and Common
Stock of the Company issued for these acquisitions was approximately $30,668 74,500 and $25,400 for 1998, 1997 and 1996, respectively. The shares of Common
Stock issued by the Company in connection with certain of the above mentioned
acquisitions were 200,753 and 135,028 for 1998 and 1997, respectively. These
acquisitions have been accounted for under the purchase method of accounting and
accordingly, operations of these businesses have been included in the
consolidated financial statements from their acquisition dates.
The summarized unaudited pro forma results of operations set forth below for

ACCRUED RESTRUCTURING COSTS
In connection with the acquisitions made in 1997 and accounted for using the
purchase method, the Company began to assess and formulate preliminary plans to
restructure the operations of the acquired companies. Such plans involved the
closure of certain offices of the acquired companies and the termination of
certain management and employees. The objective of the plans was to create a
single brand in the related markets in which the Company operates. The
preliminary plans were finalized in July 1998. These costs and liabilities
include:

Accrued liabilities for surplus property in the amount of $9,228 as of
December 31, 1998 relates to 18 leased office locations of the acquired
companies that were either unutilized prior to the acquisition date or will be
closed by March 31, 1999 in connection with the restructuring plans. The amount
is based on the present value of minimum future lease obligations, net of
sublease revenue on existing subleases.
Other costs associated with the closure of existing offices of acquired
companies in the amount of $2,745 as of December 31, 1998 relates to the
write-off of leasehold improvements and other fixed assets as well as
termination costs of contracts relating to billing systems, external reporting
systems and other contractual arrangements with third parties.
Above market lease costs in the amount of $707 as of December 31, 1998
relates to the present value of contractual lease payments in excess of current
market lease rates.
Estimated severance payments, employee relocation expenses and other
employee costs in the amount of $1,737 as of December 31, 1998 relates to
estimated severance for terminated employees at closed locations, costs
associated with employees transferred to continuing offices and other related
costs. Employee groups affected include sales, service, administrative and
management personnel at duplicate locations as well as duplicate corporate
headquarters management and administrative personnel. As of December 31, 1998
the accrual related to approximately 45 employees including senior management,
sales, service and administrative personnel.
Pension obligations in the amount of $1,753 were assumed in connection with
the acquisition of Austin Knight.
During the year ended December 31, 1998, payments of $2,127 were made to 25
members of senior management and employees for severance and charged against the
reserve.
In connection with the finalization of the restructuring plans, the Company
recorded additional charges of $10,020 as additional costs of the acquired
companies during the year ended December 31, 1998. The Company continues to
evaluate and assess the impact of duplicate responsibilities and office
locations. Additional future costs incurred, resulting from revised plan actions
occurring after December 31, 1998, in excess of the amounts previously recorded
as goodwill will be charged to operations in the period in which they occur.

and amortization EBITDA as defined in the Agreement. At December 31, 1998 the
margin equaled 875%. Borrowings under the Agreement are based on 90% of
eligible accounts receivable, which are amounts billed under 120 days old and
amounts to be billed as defined in the Agreement. Substantially all the assets
of the Company are pledged as collateral for borrowings under the Agreement. The
Agreement contains certain covenants which restrict, among other things, the
ability of the Company to borrow, pay dividends, acquire businesses, guarantee
debts of others and lend funds to affiliated companies and contains criteria on
the maintenance of certain financial statement amounts and ratios, all as
defined in the Agreement. The Agreement also provides for a fee on any unused

Company debt to EBITDA. At December 31, 1998 this rate equaled 25%. In

independently appraised at $600, which amount was being amortized over the
remaining term of the original financing agreement of 30 months from October
1993 until December 1996, when the warrant was exercised. At that time, the
unamortized balance was expensed. In addition, in December 1996, upon the
exercise of such warrant there was an additional interest charge of $2,603 to
reflect the difference between the value of the stock issued 228,768 shares at
the initial public offering price of $1400 per share and the original amount
recorded.

weighted average fair values of options granted during 1998, 1997 and 1996 were

At December 31, 1998, the Company has net operating loss carryforwards for

The Company has concluded that, based on expected future results and the future
reversals of existing taxable temporary differences, it is more likely than not
that the deferred tax assets will be realized. In addition, certain subsidiaries
have operating loss carryforwards which are only useable by such subsidiary.
Consequently, there is no reasonable assurance that the benefit of such loss
carryforward can be used. Accordingly, a valuation allowance has been
established.

Provision has not been made for U.S. or additional foreign taxes on
undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries. Such earnings have been and will
continue to be reinvested but could become subject to additional tax if they
were remitted as dividends, or were loaned to the Company or a U.S. affiliate,
or if the Company should sell its stock in the foreign subsidiaries. It is not
practicable to determine the amount of additional tax, if any, that might be
payable on the foreign earnings; however, the Company believes that foreign tax
credits would substantially offset any U.S. tax. At December 31, 1998, the
cumulative amount of reinvested earnings was approximately $14,000.

respectively.
B CONSULTING, EMPLOYMENT AND NONCOMPETE AGREEMENTS
The Company has entered into various consulting, employment and noncompete
agreements with certain management personnel and former owners of acquired
businesses. These agreements are generally two to five years in length, with one
for a term of fifteen years and two providing aggregate annual lifetime payments
of approximately $135.
Effective November 15, 1996, the Company entered into an employment
agreement with its Principal Stockholder for a term ending on November 14, 2001.
The agreement provides for automatic renewal for successive one year terms
unless either party notifies the other to the contrary at least 90 days prior to
its expiration. Under the agreement, the Principal Stockholder is entitled to a
base salary of $1,500 per year and mandatory bonuses of $375 per quarter through
November 1998 when the bonus provision of the agreement was eliminated. Such
bonuses were waived by the Principal Stockholder. However, in compliance with
the SEC interpretation of the application of Staff Accounting Bulletin 79,
Topic 5T Accounting for Expenses or Liabilities paid by Principal Stockholder,
the Company recorded in 1998 and 1997, $1,250 and $1,500, respectively, in bonus
expense and increased the Additional Paid-in Capital account to complete the
concept that the amount of the waived bonus was contributed to the Company by
the Principal Stockholder. Because the amount was not and will never be paid, no
tax benefit was accrued for this charge. The agreement also provides that the
Company will pay the Principal Stockholder his base salary for the remaining
term of the agreement in the event he is terminated for reasons other than
cause.

C EMPLOYEE BENEFIT PLANS
The Company has a 401k profit sharing plan covering all eligible
employees. Employer matching contributions, which are a maximum of 2% of payroll
of participating employees, amounted to $738, $626 and $600 for the years ended
December 31, 1998, 1997 and 1996, respectively.
Outside of the United States, the Company has employee benefit plans in the
countries in which it operates. The cost of these plans amounted to $1,741 1,264 and $1,007 for the years ended December 31, 1998, 1997 and 1996,
respectively.
In addition, the Company had a defined contribution profit sharing plan
covering all eligible employees. Contributions, which are at the discretion of
the Board of Directors, were not made in the years ended December 31, 1997 and
1996. The plan was terminated during 1997.
D LITIGATION
The Company is subject to various claims, suits and complaints arising in
the ordinary course of business. Although the outcome of these legal matters
cannot be determined, it is the opinion of management that the final resolution
of these matters will not have a material adverse effect on the Company
financial condition, operations or liquidity.
On February 19, 1998, a class action complaint was filed against the Company
by five former employees. The claims brought by the plaintiffs in the complaint
are that the Company a misclassified the named plaintiffs and purported class
members as exempt from the overtime requirements of California wage and hour law
and failed to pay them overtime wages, b failed to pay accrued but unused
vacation days at the time of termination, and c failed to pay accrued but
unused personal days at the time of termination. The plaintiffs purport to
represent a class of 450 former and current employees who are similarly
situated. The Company intends to vigorously defend the claims brought by the
plaintiffs and on March 18, 1998 responded to the complaint by filing an answer
denying all allegations. Management presently believes that the disposition of
these claims will not have a material adverse effect on the Company financial
position, operations or liquidity.
In June 1997, a settlement of $275, which was paid by the Principal
Stockholder under an indemnity agreement with the Company, was made relating to
a November 1996 action of a former employee against
61

NOTE 14--COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES CONTINUED
Old TMP, WCI and the Principal Stockholder. The complaint alleged, among other
things, that the defendants breached purported contractual obligations pursuant
to which the former employee was entitled to an ownership interest in the
Company recruitment advertising business.
E OTHER
i The Company is contingently liable on a note of the Principal
Stockholder in the amount of approximately $1,600.
ii The majority stockholder of an unconsolidated equity investee has an
agreement which requires the Company to purchase his interest, based on a
formula value, upon death. The value of his shares at December 31, 1998 is
approximately $5,741 based on the formula.
NOTE 15--RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS
A In August 1996, the Company entered into an agreement whereby it
acquired the minority interest of a subsidiary for 46,350 shares of common
stock. Such shares, valued at $672, were recorded as special compensation
because the stockholder had received his shares in the subsidiary for no
consideration and, accordingly, was not considered to have made a substantive
investment for his shares.
B The Company charged management and other fees to affiliates for services
provided of approximately $651, $788 and $602 for the years ended December 31,
1998, 1997, and 1996, respectively. Such fees are reflected as a reduction of
salaries and related costs in the accompanying consolidated statements of
operations.
C In January 1994, the Company acquired a 50% interest in an agency
selling real estate advertising. In connection with this acquisition, the
Company agreed to provide the agency with certain office and administrative
services which amounted to $321 for the nine months ended September 31, 1997 at
which time the arrangement was terminated. A payment of $875 was made in the
year ended December 31, 1996, in exchange for 50% of the agency profits, as
defined in the agreement. The Company also entered into three-year employment
and consulting agreements with the two other stockholders of the agency and
granted them the right to convert their agency shares into Company shares after
an initial public offering. That conversion right, as amended, provided that
those two stockholders may convert 25% of the agency stock into unregistered
common stock of the Company with a total value of $1,000 as of the effective
date of conversion. The conversion was exercised in February 1997 and 61,848
shares of common stock were issued to these stockholders pursuant to the above
agreement. Simultaneously, the Company transferred to such stockholders 50% of
its interest in the agency, thus retaining a 25% interest and terminated its
obligation to provide office and administrative services effective October 1,
1997.
D The Company leases three offices from entities in which the Principal
Stockholder and other stockholders have between a 49% and 90% ownership
interest. Annual rent expense under these leases, which expire on various dates
through the year 2013, amounts to approximately $863. In addition, an investee
of the Company leases an office, at an annual rental of approximately $119, from
a partnership in which the Principal Stockholder holds a 49% interest.

M ACQUISITION
On January 28, 1999, the Company acquired all of the outstanding capital
stock, and options to purchase such stock, of Morgan & Banks Limited M for
an aggregate of 5,114,924 shares of the Company common stock and approximately
300,000 shares of the Company common stock which have been reserved for
issuance upon exercise of stock options by the M shareholders. This
acquisition has been accounted for as a pooling-of-interests.
M provides human resource services to both the public and private sectors
in Australasia. Employment-related services provided by M include permanent
recruitment, temporary contracting and consulting. M permanent recruitment
services cover traditional search assignments, which involve the placement of
highly specialized and senior executive level employees, and selection
assignments, which involve the placement of mid-level executives through
semi-skilled employees. M has also developed a proprietary Assessment Center
process which is used by M to recruit numerous employees to fill a set of
similar positions required by the client. The Assessment Center is designed to
simultaneously evaluate the abilities of a group of candidates to perform in a
current or future role through job simulations, behavioral and situational
interviews, leadership and team exercises, group discussions and role plays.
M temporary contracting services place qualified personnel in temporary
positions or on discrete short-term projects, thereby enabling M clients to
gain the full benefit of a flexible workforce in times

clients in formulating and implementing effective human resource strategies
through workplace training, outplacement and career transition management,
psychological services and general human resource consulting.
LAI WORLDWIDE ACQUISITION
On March 11, 1999 the Company and LAI Worldwide LAI announced that they
had entered into an agreement by which the Company will acquire all of the
outstanding shares of LAI and that the transaction is expected to be accounted
for as a pooling of interests.
The acquisition is anticipated to close in the third quarter of 1999. It is
estimated that costs associated with the merger, including a non-cash charge of
$27 million to reflect the accelerated vesting of equity incentives due LAI
employees, will be approximately $60 million.
Under the terms of the agreement, each share of LAI stock will be exchanged
for 01321 shares of the Company common stock, assuming that the average share
price of the Company common stock for the 20 days ending on the 2nd day prior
to closing is between $4200 and $6400 per share. Should such 20-day average
share price fall below $4200 per share, unless the Company elects to terminate
the acquisition, the exchange ratio will be adjusted to that obtained by
dividing $555 by the Company 20-day average stock price measured prior to
closing. Should such 20-day average share price exceed $6400 per share, the
exchange ratio will be adjusted to that obtained by dividing $845 by the
Company 20-day average stock price measured prior to closing, but not below
that which would provide LAI shareholders with a fraction of a share of the
Company common stock equal to $555. Based on the exchange ratio of 01321,
the Company expects to issue approximately 12 million shares, including the
effect of options. The agreement is subject to customary closing conditions,
including approval by the shareholders of LAI Worldwide.
