Stockholders and Board of Directors
Aftermarket Technology Corp.
We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of 
Aftermarket Technology Corp. the Company as of December 31, 1996 and 1997, 
and the related consolidated statements of income, stockholders' equity, and 
cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 1997. 
These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company 
management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial 
statements based on our audits. 
We conducted our audits in accordance with generally accepted auditing 
standards. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to 
obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free 
of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, 
evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. 
An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and 
significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall 
financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a 
reasonable basis for our opinion. 
In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above 
present fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated financial position 
of Aftermarket Technology Corp. at December 31, 1996 and 1997, and the 
consolidated results of the Company operations and cash flows for each of 
the three years in the period ended December 31, 1997, in conformity with 
generally accepted accounting principles.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
In thousands, except share and per share data NOTE 1. THE COMPANY
Aftermarket Technology Corp. and its subsidiaries ATC or the 
Company is a remanufacturer and distributor of drive train products used 
in the repair of vehicles in the automotive aftermarket. The Company 
principal products include remanufactured transmissions, engines, torque 
converters and remanufactured and new parts for the repair of automotive 
drive train assemblies. The Company customers include original equipment 
manufacturers, independent transmission rebuilders, general repair shops, 
distributors and retail automotive parts stores. Established in 1994, the 
Company maintains manufacturing facilities and distribution centers in the 
United States and Canada. 
NOTE 2. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
PRINCIPLES OF CONSOLIDATION
The accompanying consolidated financial statements include the accounts 
of the Company and its wholly owned subsidiaries from the respective dates of 
acquisition. All significant intercompany balances and transactions have 
been eliminated. 
USE OF ESTIMATES
The preparation of the financial statements in conformity with generally 
accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and 
assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and 
accompanying notes. Actual results could differ from those estimates. 
CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS
The Company considers all highly liquid investments with original 
maturities of three months or less to be cash equivalents. 
INVENTORIES
Inventories are stated at the lower of cost first-in, first-out method 
or market and consist primarily of new and used engine and transmission 
parts, cores and finished goods. Appropriate consideration is given to 
deterioration, obsolescence, and other factors in evaluating estimated market 
value. 
EQUIPMENT AND LEASEHOLD IMPROVEMENTS
Equipment and leasehold improvements are stated at cost. Depreciation 
is computed using accelerated and straight-line methods over the estimated 
useful lives of the assets, which range from three to fifteen years. 
Depreciation expense was $1,373, $2,035 and $3,394 for the years ended 
December 31, 1995, 1996 and 1997, respectively. 
FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSLATION
The Company Canadian subsidiaries use the Canadian dollar as their 
functional currency. Accordingly, all balance sheet accounts have been 
translated using the exchange rates in effect at the balance sheet date and 
income statement amounts have been translated using the average exchange rate 
for the year. The translation adjustments resulting from the changes in 
exchange rates have been reported separately as a component of stockholders' 
equity. The effect on the statements of income of transaction gains or losses 
is insignificant for the periods presented.                     31 DEBT ISSUANCE COSTS
Debt issuance costs incurred in connection with the sale of the 12% 
Series B and Series D Senior Notes See Note 7 and revolving credit facility 
See Note 6 are being amortized over the life of the debt of ten, nine, and 
five years, respectively, using a method which approximates the interest 
method. 
COST IN EXCESS OF NET ASSETS ACQUIRED
The excess of cost over the fair market value of the net assets of 
businesses acquired goodwill is amortized on a straight-line basis over 40 
years. Cost in excess of net assets acquired is reflected net of accumulated 
amortization of $8,262 and $12,758 at December 31, 1996 and 1997, 
respectively. 
In accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards SFAS 
No. 121, Accounting for the Impairment of Long-Lived Assets and for 
Long-Lived Assets to be Disposed of, the Company assesses the recoverability 
of cost in excess of net assets acquired by determining whether the 
amortization of the asset balance over its remaining life can be recovered 
through the undiscounted future operating cash flows of the acquired 
operation. The amount of the impairment, if any, is measured based on 
projected discounted future operating cash flows. 
CONCENTRATION OF CREDIT RISK
Financial instruments that potentially subject the Company to a 
significant concentration of credit risk consist of accounts receivable from 
its customers, which are primarily in the automotive aftermarket industry 
throughout the United States and Canada. The credit risk associated with the 
Company accounts receivable is mitigated by its credit evaluation process, 
reasonably short collection terms and, except for one significant customer, 
the geographical dispersion of sales transactions. 
The Company grants credit to certain customers who meet pre-established 
credit requirements. Customers who do not meet those requirements are 
required to pay for products upon delivery. Credit losses are provided for in 
the financial statements and consistently have been within management 
expectations. 
Accounts receivable is reflected net of an allowance for doubtful 
accounts of $1,326 and $1,146 at December 31, 1996 and 1997, respectively. 
WARRANTY POLICY
For certain products on which the Company provides a warranty, the 
warranty period is generally up to twelve months or 12,000 miles. 
STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION
As allowed under the provisions of SFAS No. 123, Accounting for 
Stock-Based Compensation, the Company continues to apply APB Opinion No. 25, 
Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees, and related interpretations in 
accounting for the stock options awarded under the Company 1996 plan. 
Accordingly, a compensation cost is recognized only for those options whose 
price is less than market at the measurement date.
NEW ACCOUNTING STANDARDS
The Financial Accounting Standards Board FASB issued SFAS No. 128, 
Earnings Per Share, in February 1997. This statement, which establishes 
new standards for computing and presenting earnings per share, includes the 
presentation of basic and diluted earnings per share. As of December 31, 
1997, the Company has adopted this statement and prior periods have been 
restated. See Note 11 for further discussion and related disclosures.
The FASB issued SFAS No. 130, Reporting Comprehensive Income, in June 
1997. In addition to net income, comprehensive income includes items 
recorded directly to stockholders' equity such as cumulative foreign currency 
translation adjustments. This statement establishes new standards for 
reporting and displaying comprehensive income and its components in a full 
set of general-purpose financial statements. This statement is effective for 
fiscal years beginning after December 15, 1997. Adoption of this standard 
will only require additional financial statement disclosure detailing the 
Company comprehensive income.                    32   In June 1997, the FASB also issued SFAS No. 131, Disclosures about 
Segments of an Enterprise and Related Information. SFAS No. 131 establishes 
new standards for reporting information about operating segments in interim 
and annual financial statements. This statement is also effective for fiscal 
years beginning after December 15, 1997. The Company will evaluate the 
impact, if any, this statement will have on disclosures in the consolidated 
financial statements.
RECLASSIFICATIONS
Certain prior-year amounts have been reclassified to conform to the 1997 
presentation. 
NOTE 3.  ACQUISITIONS 
During the year ended December 31, 1995, the Company acquired Component 
Remanufacturing Specialists CRS, Mascot Truck Parts Inc. Mascot and 
King-O-Matic King, for a purchase price of approximately $305 million, 
$30 million and $93 million, respectively, including transaction fees and 
related expenses. The CRS and Mascot acquisitions closed on June 1, 1995 and 
June 9, 1995, respectively, and the King acquisition closed on September 12, 
1995 collectively, the 1995 Acquisitions. Goodwill recorded for CRS, 
Mascot and King approximated $246 million, $20 million and $49 million, 
respectively. The Company issued $40 million in principal amount of 12% 
Senior Notes due in 2004 concurrently with the acquisition of CRS, the 
proceeds of which financed the 1995 Acquisitions See Note 7.
The Company acquired Tranzparts, Inc. Tranzparts for $42 million 
and Diverco, Inc. Diverco for $109 million in April 1996 and October 
1996, respectively, including transaction fees and related expenses. 
Goodwill recorded for Tranzparts and Diverco approximated $24 million and 
$66 million, respectively. The operations of Tranzparts and Diverco were 
not material to the Company consolidated operations.
In January 1997, the Company acquired REPCO Industries, Inc. REPCO; 
a Texas based distributor of transmission repair parts, for a purchase price 
of approximately $123 million, including transaction fees and related 
expenses. Goodwill recorded approximated $68 million. The operations of 
REPCO were not material to the Company consolidated operations.   
In July 1997, the Company acquired substantially all of the assets of 
ATS Remanufacturing ATS, a remanufacturer of automatic transmissions and 
related components located in Gastonia, North Carolina. In August 1997, the 
Company acquired all of the outstanding capital stock of Trans Mart, Inc. 
Trans Mart, a distributor of automatic and standard transmission parts 
and related drive train components based in Florence, Alabama. To complete 
these acquisitions, the Company made cash payments totaling $129 million and 
$279 million for ATS and Trans Mart, respectively, including transaction 
fees and related expenses. In addition, the ATS acquisition calls for 
subsequent payments due on each of the first eight anniversaries of the 
closing date. Substantially all of these additional payments, which will 
aggregate up to approximately $190 million present value $136 million as 
of December 31, 1997, are contingent upon the attainment of certain sales 
levels by ATS, which the Company believes are more likely than not to be 
attained. Goodwill recorded for ATS and Trans Mart approximated $261 
million and $209 million, respectively. The operations of ATS and Trans Mart 
were not material to the Company consolidated operations.
In November 1997, the Company acquired Metran Automatic Transmission 
Parts Corp. Metran, a New York based distributor of automatic and manual 
transmission parts and related drive train components, for a purchase price 
of approximately $81 million, including transaction fees and related 
expenses. Goodwill recorded approximated $52 million. The operations of 
Metran were not material to the Company consolidated operations. 
These acquisitions have been accounted for under the purchase method of 
accounting. Accordingly, the allocation of the cost of the acquired assets 
and liabilities has been made on the basis of the estimated fair value. 
Goodwill for all acquisitions is amortized over 40 years on a straight-line 
basis. The consolidated financial statements include the operating results 
of each business from the date of acquisition.                    33
The consolidated financial statements include the operating results of 
each business from the date of acquisition.  Unaudited pro forma net sales 
of $210,958 and net income of $10,043 for the year ended December 31, 1995 
gives effect to the 1995 acquisitions as if such acquisitions had occurred on 
January 1, 1995. The pro forma information includes adjustments for interest 
expense that would have been incurred to finance the acquisitions, additional 
depreciation based on the fair market values of the property, plant and 
equipment acquired, and amortization of intangibles arising from the 
transactions. The pro forma financial information is not necessarily 
indicative of the results of operations as they would have been had the 
transactions been effected on the assumed dates. Pro forma information to 
reflect the 1996 and 1997 acquisitions has not been presented because the 
effect of such acquisitions was not material to prior periods.
NOTE 4. RELATED-PARTY TRANSACTIONS
The Company had liabilities to former owners totaling $2,003 at December 
31, 1996 and $1,614 at December 31, 1997. These amounts are composed 
primarily of additional purchase price payable to the former owners of those 
companies acquired in 1996 and 1997. The remaining amounts are payable during 
1998 and 1999. 
The Company paid Aurora Capital Partners ACP, which controls a 
significant stockholder, approximately $03 million and $14 million in fees 
for investment banking services provided in connection with companies 
acquired in 1996 and 1997, respectively. In addition, ACP was paid management 
fees of $513 and $534 in 1996 and 1997, respectively. ACP is also entitled 
to various additional fees depending on the Company profitability or 
certain significant corporate transactions. No such additional fees were 
paid in 1996 and 1997.

CURRENT LIABILITIES
In September 1997, the Canadian subsidiaries entered into a revolving
credit agreement with Bank of Montreal the BOM Revolving Credit Agreement
for a C$35 million revolving credit facility to accommodate the working capital
needs of the Canadian subsidiaries. Subject to the satisfaction of customary
conditions, advances under the BOM Revolving Credit Agreement may be made, and
letters of credit may be issued, up to an aggregate of C$35 million, due upon
demand, subject to annual review. The funds available to be advanced may not
exceed the aggregate of 75% of the eligible accounts receivable and 50% of the
eligible inventory of the Canadian subsidiaries in each case as defined in the
BOM Revolving Credit Agreement. Amounts advanced are secured by substantially
all assets of the Canadian subsidiaries and are guaranteed by the Company. 
Interest is payable monthly at the Bank of Montreal prime lending rate plus
025%. The agreement contains certain covenants including a tangible net worth
covenant for the combined results of Canadian subsidiaries. At December 31,
1997, $19 million was outstanding under this line of credit.                     34   In January 1996, the Company entered into an agreement with Commerce 
Bank, N.A. providing financing for equipment purchases up to a maximum of 
$29 million, secured by the underlying equipment purchased. Interest is 
payable monthly at a fixed rate equal to 70% of Commerce Bank prime lending 
rate at the date of the advance plus 1%. As of December 31, 1997, $26 
million was outstanding under this loan agreement. The agreement contains 
several covenants including levels of net worth, leverage, interest coverage 
and earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization EBITDA. 
REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY
In February 1997, the Company entered into an agreement with The Chase 
Manhattan Bank the Bank, as agent, providing for a $100 million revolving 
credit facility the Revolving Credit Facility available to the Company 
for acquisitions and working capital purposes. Amounts advanced under 
Revolving Credit Facility are secured by substantially all assets of the 
Company and will become due on December 31, 2001, although the Company may 
prepay outstanding advances in whole or in part without incurring any premium 
or penalty. 
At the Company election, amounts advanced under the Revolving Credit 
Facility will bear interest at either i the Alternate Base Rate plus a 
specified margin, or ii the Eurodollar Rate plus a specified margin. The 
Alternate Base Rate is equal to the highest of a the Bank prime rate, 
b the secondary market rate for three-month certificates of deposit plus 
10% and c the federal funds rate plus 05%, in each case as in effect from 
time to time.  The Eurodollar Rate is the rate offered by the Bank for 
eurodollar deposits for one, two, three or six months as selected by the 
Company in the interbank eurodollar market in the approximate amount of the 
Bank share of the advance under the Credit Facility. The applicable 
margins for both Alternate Base Rate and Eurodollar Rate loans are subject to 
a quarterly adjustment based on the Company leverage ratio as of the end of 
the four fiscal quarters then completed. At December 31, 1997, the Alternate 
Base Rate and the Eurodollar Rate margins are 05% and 15%, respectively. 
Interest payments on advances that bear interest based upon the Alternate 
Base Rate are due quarterly in arrears and on the Termination Date, and 
interest payments on advances that bear interest based upon the Eurodollar 
Rate are due on the last day of each relevant interest period or, if such 
period exceeds three months, quarterly after the first day of such period.
The Company paid the Bank a one-time facility and commitment fee upon 
the effective date of the Credit Facility and is required to pay the Bank 
quarterly in arrears a commitment fee equal to a per annum percentage of the 
average daily unused portion of the Credit Facility during such quarter. The 
commitment is subject to a quarterly adjustment based on the Company 
leverage ratio as of the end of the four fiscal quarters then completed. The 
quarterly commitment fee percentage is 0375%. The Company must also 
reimburse the Bank for certain legal and other costs of the Bank and pay a 
fee on outstanding letters of credit at a rate per annum equal to the 
applicable margin then in effect for advances bearing interest at the 
Eurodollar Rate.
The Revolving Credit Facility contains several covenants, including 
levels of net worth, leverage, EBITDA and cash flow coverage, and certain 
limits on the Company to incur indebtedness, make capital expenditures, 
create liens, engage in mergers and consolidations, make restricted payments 
including dividends, make asset sales, make investments, issue stock and 
engage in transactions with affiliates of the Company and its subsidiaries.  
At December 31, 1997, $11,100 was outstanding under this line of credit. 
Subsequent to December 31, 1997, the credit agreement for the Revolving 
Credit Facility was amended and restated See Note 17.
NOTE 7. 12% SERIES B AND SERIES D SENIOR SUBORDINATED NOTES
On August 2, 1994, the Company completed a private placement issuance of 
$120 million in principal amount of 12% Series A Senior Subordinated Notes 
due in 2004. Proceeds from the issuance were used to partially finance the 
initial acquisitions of the Company. The privately placed debt was exchanged 
for public debt designated Series B on February 22, 1995. 
On June 1, 1995, the Company completed another private placement 
issuance of $40 million in principal amount of 12% Series C Senior 
Subordinated Notes due in 2004. Proceeds of $424 million from the issuance 
were used to finance the 1995 Acquisitions. These notes have an effective 
interest rate of 1095%. The privately placed debt was exchanged for public 
debt designated Series D on September 10, 1995.                     35   Interest on the 12% Series B and Series D Senior Subordinated Notes the 
Senior Notes is payable semiannually on February 1 and August 1 of each 
year. The Senior Notes will mature on August 1, 2004. On or after August 1, 
1999, the Senior Notes may be redeemed at the option of the Company, in whole 
or in part, at specified redemption prices plus accrued and unpaid interest:    YEAR                      REDEMPTION PRICE
1999.....................  106%
2000.....................  104
2001.....................  102
2002 and thereafter..............  100   In addition, at any time on or prior to August 1, 1997, the Company 
could have, subject to certain requirements, redeemed up to $30 million of 
the Series B Senior Notes and $10 million of the Series D Senior Notes 
aggregate principal amounts with the net cash proceeds of one or more public 
equity offerings, at a price equal to 112% of the principal amount to be 
redeemed plus accrued and unpaid interest. On February 16, 1997 the Company 
exercised its right and redeemed $30 million in principal amount of the 
Series B Senior Notes and $10 million in principal amount of the Series D 
Senior Notes resulting in a loss on early extinguishment of debt See Note 
16. 
In the event of a change in control, the Company would be required to 
offer to repurchase the Senior Notes at a price equal to 101% of the 
principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest. 
The Senior Notes are general obligations of the Company, subordinated in 
right of payment to all existing and future senior debt including the 
Company revolving credit facility. The Senior Notes are guaranteed by each 
of the Company existing and future subsidiaries other than any subsidiary 
designated as an unrestricted subsidiary as defined. As of December 31, 
1997, the Company had no unrestricted subsidiaries. The Company may incur 
additional indebtedness, including borrowings under its revolving credit 
facility See Note 6, subject to certain limitations. 
The indentures under which the Senior Notes were issued contain certain 
covenants that, among other things, limit the Company from incurring other 
indebtedness, issuing disqualified capital stock, engaging in transactions 
with affiliates, incurring liens, making certain restricted payments 
including dividends, making certain asset sales and permitting certain 
restrictions on the ability of its subsidiaries to make distributions. As of 
December 31, 1997, the Company was in compliance with such covenants.                     36 NOTE 8. INCOME TAXES

NOTE 9. STOCK OPTIONS
The Company adopted its 1994 Stock Incentive Plan, which was 
subsequently renamed the 1996 Stock Incentive Plan the Plan, in July 1994 
in order to provide incentives to employees and directors of the Company. 
The Company has reserved 2,400,000 shares of Common Stock for issuance under 
the Plan. Options are generally granted at the fair value on the date of 
grant and vest over a period of time to be determined by the Board of 
Directors, generally from three to five years. The options expire 10 years 
from the date of grant. Options available for grant are 127,782 and 9,606 as 
of December 31, 1996 and 1997, respectively.
A summary of the status of the Company option plan is presented below                                    1995          1996          1997

In connection with the prior acquisitions, warrants to purchase 350,880 
shares of Common Stock at $167 per share were issued to two individuals. The 
warrants are exercisable through 2004. The Company has also issued a warrant 
to one member of the Board of Directors to purchase 70,176 shares of Common 
Stock at $167 per share, the fair value of the Common Stock on the date of 
grant.
As allowed under the provisions of SFAS No. 123, Accounting for 
Stock-Based Compensation, the Company will continue to apply APB Opinion No. 
25 and related interpretations in accounting for the stock options awarded 
under the Company 1996 plan. Accordingly, no compensation cost has been 
recognized for these stock options except the expense relating to options 
granted with an exercise price below the market value at the date of grant. 
Had compensation cost for the Company 1996 Plan been determined in 
accordance with SFAS No. 123, the Company net income and earnings per share 
would have been reduced to the proforma amounts indicated below:                                   Years ended December 31,
1995     1996     1997

Basic earnings per common share:
As reported..................   $ 069     $ 115     $ 131
Pro forma...................   $ 066     $ 113     $ 126   The fair value of each option grant is estimated on the date of grant 
using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model with weighted-average 
assumptions for expected volatility of 5131%, risk-free interest rates of 
600% and expected option lives of 82 years for 1995, 1996 and 1997. The 
Company has not paid and does not anticipate paying dividends; therefore, the 
expected dividend yield is assumed to be zero.
The Black-Scholes option model was developed for use in estimating the 
fair value of traded options that have no vesting restrictions and are fully 
transferable. In addition, option valuation models require the input of 
highly subjective assumptions including the expected stock price volatility. 
Because the Company employee stock options have characteristics 
significantly different from those of traded options, and because changes in 
the subjective input assumptions can materially affect the fair value 
estimate, in management opinion, the existing models do not necessarily 
provide a reliable single measure of the fair value of its employee stock 
options.                     39 NOTE 10. COMMON AND PREFERRED STOCK
On December 13, 1996, the Company amended and restated its charter to 
increase its authorized Common Stock to 30,000,000 shares and consummated a 
six-for-one stock split, and to increase its authorized Preferred Stock to 
5,000,000 shares. The accompanying financial statements have been 
retroactively adjusted to reflect the stock split. 
On December 17, 1996 the Company sold 4,025,000 shares of Common Stock 
through an initial public offering Initial Public Offering. The price per 
share for such Common Stock was $1350 Initial Public Offering Price. At 
approximately the same time, the Company sold to General Electric Pension 
Trust GEPT $120 million of Common Stock 955,794 shares in a private 
placement. The price per share for such privately placed Common Stock was the 
price per share paid by the Underwriters in the Public Offering of $12555 
the Initial Public Offering Price less Underwriters' discounts and 
commissions. 
On October 28, 1997, the Company completed a public offering of 
3,650,000 shares of its common stock. The price per share for such Common 
Stock was $2325 Public Offering Price. Of the shares sold in the offering, 
2,200,000 shares were sold by the Company and 1,450,000 shares were sold by 
certain stockholders. The Company did not receive any proceeds from the sale 
of shares by the selling stockholders. The net proceeds to the Company of 
approximately $479 million were used to repay a portion of the outstanding 
indebtedness under the Company revolving credit facility.

NOTE 12. EMPLOYEE RETIREMENT PLAN
The Company sponsors several defined contribution plans to provide 
substantially all U.S. salaried and hourly employees of the Company an 
opportunity to accumulate personal funds for their retirement, subject to 
minimum duration of employment requirements. Contributions are made on a 
before-tax basis to substantially all of these plans. 
As determined by the provisions of each plan, the Company matches a portion
of the employees' basic voluntary contributions. Company matching contributions
to the plans were approximately $108, $206 and $359 for the plan years ending in
1995, 1996 and 1997, respectively. 
40 NOTE 13. COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES
The Company leases certain facilities under various operating lease
agreements, which expire on various dates through 2004. Facility leases that
expire generally are expected to be renewed or replaced by other leases. Future
minimum rental commitments under non-cancelable operating leases with terms in
excess of one year are as follows YEAR ENDING DECEMBER 31                           
1998...................... $   7,917
1999......................    7,300
2000......................    6,036
2001......................    4,123
2002......................    4,596
Thereafter...................    7,303
$  37,275
Rent expense for all operating leases approximated $3,115, $4,582 and
$7,228 for the years ended December 31, 1995, 1996 and 1997, respectively. 
Rent expense includes amounts paid to related parties of $611, $940 and
$1,574 for the years ended December 31, 1995, 1996 and 1997, respectively. 
The Company is subject to various evolving Federal, state, local and foreign
environmental laws and regulations governing, among other things, emissions to
air, discharge to waters and the generation, handling, storage, transportation,
treatment and disposal of a variety of hazardous and non- hazardous substances
and wastes. These laws and regulations provide for substantial fines and
criminal sanctions for violations and impose liability for the costs of cleaning
up, and certain damages resulting from, past spills, disposals or other releases
of hazardous substances. 
In connection with the acquisition of certain subsidiaries, the Company
conducted certain investigations of these companies' facilities and their
compliance with applicable environmental laws. The investigations, which
included Phase I assessments by independent consultants of all manufacturing
and certain distribution facilities, found that certain facilities have had or
may have had releases of hazardous materials that may require remediation and
also may be subject to potential liabilities for contamination from off-site
disposal of substances or wastes. These assessments also found that certain
reporting and other regulatory requirements, including certain waste management
procedures, were not or may not have been satisfied. Although there can be no
assurance, the Company believes that, based in part on the investigations
conducted, in part on certain remediation completed prior to the acquisitions,
and in part on the indemnification provisions of the agreements entered into in
connection with the Company acquisitions, the Company will not incur any
material liabilities relating to these matters. 
The company from which RPM Merit RPM acquired its assets the Prior RPM
Company has been identified by the United States Environmental Protection
Agency the EPA as one of many potentially responsible parties for
environmental liabilities associated with a Superfund site located in the area
of RPM former manufacturing facilities and current distribution facility in
Azusa, California. The Federal Comprehensive Environmental Response,
Compensation, and Liability Act of 1980, as amended CERCLA or Superfund
provides for cleanup of sites from which there has been a release or threatened
release of hazardous substances, and authorizes recovery of related response
costs and certain other damages from potentially responsible parties PRPs.
PRPs are broadly defined under CERCLA, and generally include present owners and
operators of a site and certain past owners and operators. As a general rule,
courts have interpreted CERCLA to impose strict, joint and several liability
upon all persons liable for cleanup costs. As a practical matter, however, at
sites where there are multiple PRPs, the costs of cleanup typically are
allocated among the PRPs according to a volumetric or other standard. The EPA
has preliminarily estimated that it will cost approximately $47 million to
construct and approximately $4 million per year for an indefinite period to
operate an interim remedial groundwater pumping and treatment system for the
part of the Superfund site within which RPM former manufacturing facilities
and current distribution facility, as well as those of many other potentially
responsible parties, are located. The actual cost of this remedial action could
vary substantially 
41 from this estimate, and additional costs associated with the Superfund site 
are likely to be assessed. The Company has significantly reduced its presence 
at the site and has moved all manufacturing operations off-site. Since July 
1995, the Company only real property interest in this site has been the 
lease of a 6,000 square foot storage and distribution facility. The RPM 
acquisition agreement and the leases pursuant to which the Company leased 
RPM facilities after the Company acquired the assets of RPM the RPM 
Acquisition expressly provide that the Company did not assume any 
liabilities for environmental conditions existing on or before the RPM 
Acquisition, although the Company could become responsible for these 
liabilities under various legal theories. The Company is indemnified against 
any such liabilities by the seller of RPM as well as the Prior RPM Company 
shareholders. There can be no assurance, however, that the Company would be 
able to make any recovery under any indemnification provisions. Since the RPM 
Acquisition, the Company has been engaged in negotiations with the EPA to 
settle any liability that it may have for this site. Although there can be no 
assurance, the Company believes that it will not incur any material liability 
as a result of these environmental conditions. 
NOTE 14. FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS
The carrying amounts of all financial instruments approximate their fair
values at December 31, 1996 and 1997, except for the Series B and Series D
Senior Notes. 
The fair values of the Company Series B and Series D Senior Notes are

accounted for 35%, 37% and 32% of net sales, respectively. Additionally, at
December 31, 1995, 1996 and 1997 this customer accounted for approximately 46 51% and 45% of accounts receivable, respectively. No other customer accounted
for more than 10% of net sales in any period. 
NOTE 16. EXTRAORDINARY ITEM
The extraordinary item of $38 million, net of income tax benefit of $25
million, consists largely of a pre-tax charge of $57 million related to the
early redemption of $40 million in principal amount of the Company Senior
Notes, consisting of the early redemption premium charge of $43 million plus
unamortized deferred financing fees of $14 million. The extraordinary item
also includes a pre-tax charge of $06 million related to the restructuring of
the Company revolving credit facility. Both events occurred in February 1997.
42 NOTE 17. SUBSEQUENT EVENTS
On March 6, 1998, the Company acquired substantially all the assets of the
OEM Division of Autocraft Industries, Inc. Autocraft, a remanufacturer and
distributor of drivetrain and electronic parts used in the warranty and
aftermarket repair of passenger cars and light trucks. The cash purchase price
for the acquisition consists of $1125 million paid at closing, plus up to an
additional $125 million to be paid in 1999 based on the performance of the OEM
Division European operations during 1998. The transaction is being accounted
for using the purchase method of accounting and goodwill recorded estimated to
be approximately $60-70 million, which would increase by up to an additional
$125 million dependent on the potential 1999 payment described above will be
amortized over 40 years on a straight-line method beginning on the date of
acquisition.
In March 1998, the credit agreement for the Credit Facility was amended and
restated as a new credit facility comprised of a $100 million revolving portion
and a $120 million term loan portion with The Chase Manhattan Bank, as agent,
the New Credit Facility to finance the Company working capital
requirements, future acquisitions and the acquisition of Autocraft. Amounts
advanced under the revolving portion of the New Credit Facility are secured by
substantially all assets of the Company and will become due on December 31,
2003, although the Company may prepay outstanding advances in whole or in part
without incurring any premium or penalty. The term loan portion of the New
Facility is due and payable in quarterly installments beginning in September
1998 and ending on December 31, 2003 as outlined in the agreement. The New
Credit Facility contains several covenants, including levels of net worth,
leverage, EBITDA and cash flow coverage, and certain limitations on the
Company ability to incur indebtedness, make capital expenditures, create
liens, engage in mergers and consolidations, make restricted payments including
dividends, make asset sales, make investments, issue stock and engage in
transactions with affiliates of the Company and its subsidiaries.

SECTION 16a BENEFICIAL OWNERSHIP REPORTING COMPLIANCE. 
Section 16a of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, 
requires the Company officers, directors and persons who own more than 10% 
of any equity security of the Company to file reports of ownership and 
changes in ownership with the Securities and Exchange Commission and to 
furnish copies of these reports to the Company. Based solely on a review of 
the copies of the forms that the Company received, the Company believes that 
Forms 4 were not timely filed on July 10, 1997 by Mr. LePore and on November 
10, 1997 by Mr. Smith, in each case to report the exercise of stock options. 
These oversights were subsequently corrected when Mr. LePore reported his 
transaction in a Form 4 filed in December 1997 and Mr. Smith reported his 
transaction in a Form 5 filed in February 1998.
