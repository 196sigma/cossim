INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM To the Board of Directors and Shareholders of
Aehr Test Systems
We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Aehr Test
Systems and its subsidiaries the Company as of May 31, 2010 and 2009, and
the related consolidated statements of operations, shareholders' equity and
comprehensive income loss, and cash flows for each of the three years in the
period ended May 31, 2010. These consolidated financial statements are the
responsibility of the Company management. Our responsibility is to express
an opinion on these consolidated financial statements based on our audits.
We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public
Company Accounting Oversight Board United States. Those standards require
that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about
whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. The
Company is not required to have, nor have we been engaged to perform, an audit
of the Company internal control over financial reporting. Our audits
included consideration of internal control over financial reporting as a basis
for designing audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but
not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the
Company internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express
no such opinion. An audit also includes examining, on a test basis, evidence
supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing
the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management,
as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe
that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above
present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Aehr Test
Systems and its subsidiaries as of May 31, 2010 and 2009, and the results of
their operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the
period ended May 31, 2010 in conformity with accounting principles generally
accepted in the United States of America. s/ Burr Pilger Mayer, Inc. San Jose, California

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
1. ORGANIZATION AND SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES BUSINESS   Aehr Test Systems the Company was incorporated in California in May
1977 and primarily designs, engineers and manufactures test and burn-in
equipment used in the semiconductor industry. The Company principal
products are the Advanced Burn-In and Test System, the FOX full wafer contact
system, the MAX burn-in system, the MTX massively parallel test system, the
DiePak carrier and test fixtures.
LIQUIDITY   Since inception, the Company has incurred substantial cumulative losses
and negative cash flows from operations. During the second half of fiscal
2009 and fiscal 2010, the Company experienced a substantial decrease in its
net sales as a result of a major customer filing bankruptcy and the slowdown
in the semiconductor manufacturing industry. In response to the low levels of
net sales, the Company took significant steps to minimize expense levels and
to increase the likelihood that it will have sufficient cash to support
operations during the slow business periods. Those steps include reductions
in headcount, reduced compensation for officers and other salaried employees,
a Company-wide shutdown for one week each month and lower fees paid to the
Board of Directors, among other spending cuts. At times, the Company may
choose to modify or eliminate these cuts. The Company will continue to
explore methods to reduce its costs.
The Company filed a claim in the Spansion Inc., or Spansion, U.S.
bankruptcy action. In the first quarter of fiscal 2010, the Company sold a
portion, $11,364,000, of its Spansion U.S. bankruptcy claim to a third party
for a net proceeds of $3,289,000 and recorded the amount as a reduction of
operating expenses. In the third quarter of fiscal 2010, the Company sold the
remaining balance, $7,117,000, of its Spansion U.S. bankruptcy claim to a
third party for net proceeds of $4,626,000 and recorded $2,740,000 as net
sales related to cancellation charges, $1,302,000 as deferred revenue and
$584,000 as a reduction of operating expenses. In the fourth quarter of
fiscal 2010, the Company received the remaining payment of $120,000 due from
it bankruptcy claim sale completed in the first quarter of fiscal 2010 and
recognized the amount as a reduction of operating expenses. The $1,302,000
deferred at the end of the third quarter of fiscal 2010 was recognized as
product sales during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2010 in connection with the
delivery of products.
The Company anticipates that the existing cash balance together with cash
flows from operations, are adequate to meet its working capital and capital
equipment requirements through fiscal 2011. After fiscal 2011, depending on
its rate of growth and profitability, the Company may require additional
equity or debt financing to meet its working capital requirements or capital
equipment needs. There can be no assurance that additional financing will be
available when required, or if available, that such financing can be obtained
on terms satisfactory to the Company.
CONSOLIDATION AND EQUITY INVESTMENTS   The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company
and both its wholly-owned and majority-owned foreign subsidiaries.
Intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated. Equity
investments in which the Company holds an equity interest less than 20 percent
and over which the Company does not have significant influence are accounted
for using the cost method.
FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSLATION AND TRANSACTIONS   Assets and liabilities of the Company foreign subsidiaries and branch
office are translated into U.S. Dollars from Japanese Yen, Euros and New
Taiwan Dollars using the exchange rate in effect at the balance sheet date.
Additionally, their net sales and expenses are translated using exchange rates
approximating average rates prevailing during the fiscal year. Translation
adjustments that arise from translating their financial statements from their
local currencies to U.S. Dollars are accumulated and reflected as a separate
component of shareholders' equity.
Transaction gains and losses that arise from exchange rate changes
denominated in currencies other than the local currency are included in the
statements of operations as incurred. See Note 11 for the detail of foreign
exchange transaction gains losses for all periods presented.                   34 USE OF ESTIMATES   The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting
principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires
management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts
of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at
the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and
expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those
estimates.
CASH EQUIVALENTS AND INVESTMENTS   Cash equivalents consist of money market instruments, commercial paper and
other highly liquid investments purchased with an original maturity of three
months or less. Investments not classified as cash equivalents are classified
as available-for-sale. Investments in available-for-sale securities are
reported at fair value with unrealized gains and losses, net of tax, if any,
included as a component of shareholders' equity.
FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS   On June 1, 2008, the Company adopted authoritative guidance for fair value
measurements and the fair value option for financial assets and liabilities.
This authoritative guidance defines fair value, establishes a framework for
using fair value to measure assets and liabilities, and expands disclosures
about fair value measurements.
In the first quarter of fiscal 2010, the Company adopted revised
accounting guidance for the fair value measurements and disclosure for non-
financial assets and non-financial liabilities, except for items that are
recognized or disclosed at fair value in the financial statements on a
recurring basis at least annually.
The guidance establishes a fair value hierarchy that is intended to
increase the consistency and comparability in fair value measurements and
related disclosures. The fair value hierarchy is based on inputs to valuation
techniques that are used to measure fair value that are either observable or
unobservable. Observable inputs reflect assumptions market participants would
use in pricing an asset or liability based on market data obtained from
independent sources while unobservable inputs reflect a reporting entity
pricing based upon their own market assumptions. The fair value hierarchy
consists of the following three levels Level 1 - instrument valuations are obtained from real-time quotes for
transactions in active exchange markets involving identical assets.
Level 2 - instrument valuations are obtained from readily-available pricing
sources for comparable instruments.
Level 3 - instrument valuations are obtained without observable market values
and require a high level of judgment to determine the fair value.
The following table summarizes the Company financial assets and
liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis as of May 31, 2010 in
thousands                 Balance as of

without observable market values that would require a high level of judgment
to determine fair value Level 3 assets.                   35 ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE AND ALLOWANCE FOR DOUBTFUL ACCOUNTS   Accounts receivable are recorded at the invoiced amount and are not
interest bearing. The Company maintains an allowance for doubtful accounts to
reserve for potentially uncollectible trade receivables. The Company also
reviews its trade receivables by aging category to identify specific customers
with known disputes or collection issues. The Company exercises judgment when
determining the adequacy of these reserves as the Company evaluates historical
bad debt trends, general economic conditions in the United States and
internationally, and changes in customer financial conditions. Uncollectible
receivables are recorded as bad debt expense when all efforts to collect have
been exhausted and recoveries are recognized when they are received. During
the year ended May 31, 2009, the Company recorded a $13,558,000 increase in
its allowance for doubtful accounts as a result of its major customer filing
for bankruptcy. During the year ended May 31, 2010, the allowance for
doubtful accounts decreased by $12,330,000 due primarily to the write-off of
the Spansion U.S. accounts receivable.
CONCENTRATION OF CREDIT RISK   The Company sells its products primarily to semiconductor manufacturers in
North America, Asia, and Europe. As of May 31, 2010, approximately 2%, 81%
and 17% of gross accounts receivable are from customers located in the United
States, Asia and Europe, respectively. As of May 31, 2009, approximately 76 22% and 2% of gross accounts receivable are from customers located in the
United States, Asia and Europe, respectively. Two customers accounted for 71%
and 14% of gross accounts receivable at May 31, 2010. One customer accounted
for 91% of gross accounts receivable at May 31, 2009. Three customers
accounted for 55%, 12% and 11% of net sales in fiscal 2010. One customer
accounted for 80% of net sales in both fiscal 2009 and 2008. The Company
performs ongoing credit evaluations of its customers and generally does not
require collateral. While the Company has historically maintained reserves
within management expectations, as a result of the bankruptcy filing of a key
customer during the fiscal year ended May 31, 2009, specific reserves were
established. The specific reserves established for this customer accounted
for virtually all the allowance for doubtful accounts at May 31, 2009. The
Company uses letter of credit terms for some of its international customers.
The Company cash, cash equivalents, short-term cash deposits and short-
term investments are generally deposited with major financial institutions in
the United States, Japan, Germany and Taiwan. The Company invests its excess
cash in money market funds and short-term cash deposits. The money market
funds and short-term cash deposits bear the risk associated with each fund.
The money market funds have variable interest rates, and the short-term cash
deposits have fixed rates. The Company has not experienced any material
losses on its money market funds or short-term cash deposits.
CONCENTRATION OF SUPPLY RISK   The Company relies on third parties to manufacture its products, and
depends on them for the supply and quality of its products. Quality or
performance failures of the Company products or changes in its
manufacturers' financial or business condition could disrupt the Company
ability to supply quality products to its customers and thereby have a
material and adverse effect on its business and operating results. Some of
the components and technologies used in the Company products are purchased
and licensed from a single source or a limited number of sources. The loss of
any of these suppliers may cause the Company to incur additional transition
costs, result in delays in the manufacturing and delivery of its products, or
cause it to carry excess or obsolete inventory and could cause it to redesign
its products.
STRATEGIC INVESTMENTS   The Company invests in debt and equity of private companies as part of its
business strategy. These investments are carried at cost and are included in
Other Assets in the consolidated balance sheets. If the Company determines
that an other-than-temporary decline exists in the fair value of an
investment, the Company writes down the investment to its fair value and
records the related write-down as an investment loss in Other Income
Expense in its consolidated statements of operations. At May 31, 2010 and
2009, the carrying value of the strategic investments was $384,000.
INVENTORIES   Inventories include material, labor and overhead, and are stated at the
lower of cost first-in, first-out method or market. Provisions for excess,
obsolete and unusable inventories are made after management evaluation of
future demand and market conditions. The Company adjusts inventory balances
to approximate the lower of its manufacturing costs or market value. If
actual future demand or market conditions become less favorable than those
projected by management, additional inventory write-downs may be required, and
would be reflected in cost of product revenue in                   36 the period the revision is made. During the year ended May 31, 2009, the
Company recorded a $7,203,000 charge to cost of sales to reduce its inventory
to net realizable value primarily as a result of the bankruptcy filing of its
major customer.
PROPERTY AND EQUIPMENT   Property and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation
and amortization. Major improvements are capitalized, while repairs and
maintenance are expensed as incurred. Leasehold improvements are amortized
over the lesser of their estimated useful lives or the term of the related
lease. Furniture, fixtures, machinery and equipment are depreciated on a
straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives. The ranges of
estimated useful lives for furniture, fixtures, machinery and equipment are
generally as follows Furniture and  2 to 6 years
Machinery and  4 to 6 years
Test  4 to 6 years
GOODWILL   Goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value
of tangible and identifiable intangible net assets acquired in the Company
acquisition of its Japanese subsidiary.  The Company reviews goodwill
annually or whenever events or circumstances indicate that a decline in value
may have occurred. Based on the fair market value of the Company common
stock relative to its book value and revised estimates for its future cash
flow and revenue projections, the Company determined that indicators of
impairment for its goodwill were present during fiscal year 2009. As a
result, the Company tested the goodwill for impairment, determined that it was
impaired and recorded a non-cash impairment of goodwill charge of $274,000 for
the fiscal year ended May 31, 2009. Gross goodwill and accumulated impairment
losses were $274,000 at May 31, 2010 and 2009.
REVENUE RECOGNITION   The Company selling arrangements may include contractual customer
acceptance provisions. Installation of products occurs after shipment and
transfer of title. The Company recognizes revenue upon the shipment of
products or the performance of services when: 1 persuasive evidence of the
arrangement exists; 2 services have been rendered; 3 the price is fixed or
determinable; and 4 collectibility is reasonably assured. The Company
defers recognition of revenue for any amounts subject to acceptance until such
acceptance occurs. When multiple elements exist, the Company allocates the
purchase price based on vendor specific objective evidence or third-party
evidence of fair value and defers revenue recognition on the undelivered
portion. Historically, these multiple deliverables have included items such
as extended support provisions, training to be supplied after delivery of the
systems, and test programs specific to customers' routine applications. The
test programs can be written either by the customer, other firms, or the
Company. The amount of revenue deferred is the greater of the fair value of
the undelivered element or the contractually agreed to amounts. Sales tax
collected from customers is not included in net sales but rather recorded as a
liability due to the respective taxing authorities. Provisions for the
estimated future cost of warranty and installation are recorded at the time
the products are shipped.
Royalty-based revenue related to licensing income from performance test
boards and burn-in boards is recognized upon the earlier of the receipt by the
Company of the licensee report related to its usage of the licensed
intellectual property or upon payment by the licensee. This revenue is
recorded in net sales.
The Company terms of sales with distributors are generally FOB shipping
point with payment due within 60 days. All products go through in-house
testing and verification of specifications before shipment. Apart from
warranty reserves, credits issued have not been material as a percentage of
net sales. The Company distributors do not generally carry inventories of
the Company products. Instead, the distributors place orders with the
Company at or about the time they receive orders from their customers. The
Company shipment terms to our distributors do not provide for credits or
rights of return. Because the Company distributors do not generally carry
inventories of our products, they do not have rights to price protection or to
return products. At the time the Company ships products to the distributors,
the price is fixed.  Subsequent to the issuance of the invoice, there are no
discounts or special terms. The Company does not give the buyer the right to
return the product or to receive future price concessions. The Company
arrangements do not include vendor consideration.                   37 PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT COSTS AND CAPITALIZED SOFTWARE   Costs incurred in the research and development of new products or systems
are charged to operations as incurred. Costs incurred in the development of
software programs for the Company products are charged to operations as
incurred until technological feasibility of the software has been established.
Generally, technological feasibility is established when the software module
performs its primary functions described in its original specifications,
contains features required for it to be usable in a production environment, is
completely documented and the related hardware portion of the product is
complete. After technological feasibility is established, any additional
costs are capitalized. Capitalization of software costs ceases when the
software is substantially complete and is ready for its intended use.
Capitalized costs are amortized over the estimated life of the related
software product using the greater of the units of sales or straight-line
methods over ten years. No system software development costs were capitalized
or amortized in fiscal 2010, 2009 and 2008.
IMPAIRMENT OF LONG-LIVED ASSETS   In the event that facts and circumstances indicate that the carrying value
of assets may be impaired, an evaluation of recoverability would be performed.
If an evaluation is required, the estimated future undiscounted cash flows
associated with the asset would be compared to the asset carrying value to
determine if a write-down is required.
ADVERTISING COSTS   The Company expenses all advertising costs as incurred and the amounts
were not material for all periods presented.
SHIPPING AND HANDLING OF PRODUCTS   Amounts billed to customers for shipping and handling of products are
included in net sales. Costs incurred related to shipping and handling of
products are included in cost of sales.
INCOME TAXES   Income taxes have been provided using the liability method whereby
deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on differences
between financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities and net
operating loss and tax credit carryforwards measured using the enacted tax
rates and laws that will be in effect when the differences are expected to
reverse or the carryforwards are utilized. Valuation allowances are
established when it is determined that it is more likely than not that such
assets will not be realized.
During the fiscal year ended May 31, 2008 a partial release of the
valuation allowance previously established was made based upon the Company
current level of profitability and the level of forecasted future earnings.
During fiscal 2009, a full valuation allowance was established against all
deferred tax assets as management determined that it is more likely than not
that certain deferred tax assets will not be realized.
The Company accounts for uncertain tax positions consistent with
authoritative guidance. The guidance prescribes a more likely than not
recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement
recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in
a tax return. The Company does not expect any material change in its
unrecognized tax benefits over the next twelve months. The Company recognizes
interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits as a component of
income taxes.
Although the Company files U.S. federal, various state, and foreign tax
returns, the Company only major tax jurisdictions are the United States,
California, Germany and Japan. Tax years 1996 - 2009 remain subject to
examination by the appropriate governmental agencies due to tax loss
carryovers from those years.                   38 STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION   Stock-based compensation expense consists of expenses for stock options
and employee stock purchase plan, or ESPP, shares. Stock-based compensation
cost is measured at each grant date, based on the fair value of the award
using the Black-Scholes option valuation model, and is recognized as expense
over the employee requisite service period. This model was developed for
use in estimating the value of publicly traded options that have no vesting
restrictions and are fully transferable. The Company employee stock options
have characteristics significantly different from those of publicly traded
options. All of the Company stock compensation is accounted for as an
equity instrument.
The following table summarizes compensation costs related to the
Company stock-based compensation for the years ended May 31, 2010, 2009 and
2008, respectively in thousands, except per share data                             Year Ended

costs were capitalized as part of inventory.
During fiscal 2010, 2009 and fiscal 2008, the Company recorded stock-based
compensation related to stock options of $1,511,000, $1,115,000 and $750,000,
respectively.
In the second quarter of fiscal 2010, the seven officers of the Company
elected to forfeit certain stock options previously granted. The forfeiture
of these options resulted in the immediate recognition of the unamortized
portion of stock compensation expense of $465,000.
As of May 31, 2010, the total compensation cost related to unvested stock-
based awards under the Company 1996 Stock Option Plan and 2006 Equity
Incentive Plan, but not yet recognized, was $1,181,000 which is net of
estimated forfeitures of $3,000. This cost will be amortized on a straight-
line basis over a weighted average period of approximately 25 years.
During fiscal 2010, 2009 and fiscal 2008, the Company recorded stock-based
compensation related to its ESPP of $222,000, $155,000 and $141,000,
respectively.
As of May 31, 2010, the total compensation cost related to options to
purchase the Company common shares under the ESPP but not yet recognized was
$123,000. This cost will be amortized on a straight-line basis over a
weighted average period of approximately 09 years.
Valuation Assumptions
Valuation and Amortization Method. The Company estimates the fair value
of stock options granted using the Black-Scholes option valuation method and a
single option award approach for options granted after June 1, 2006. The                   39 multiple option approach has been used for all options granted prior to June
1, 2006. The fair value under the single option approach is amortized on a
straight-line basis over the requisite service periods of the awards, which is
generally the vesting period. The fair value under the multiple option
approach is amortized on a weighted basis over the requisite service periods
of the awards, which is generally the vesting period.
Expected Term. The Company expected term represents the period that the
Company stock-based awards are expected to be outstanding and was determined
based on historical experience, giving consideration to the contractual terms
of the stock-based awards, vesting schedules and expectations of future
employee behavior as evidenced by changes to the terms of its stock-based
awards.
Expected Volatility. Volatility is a measure of the amounts by which a
financial variable such as stock price has fluctuated historical volatility
or is expected to fluctuate expected volatility during a period. The
Company uses the historical volatility for the past five years, which matches
the expected term of most of the option grants, to estimate expected
volatility. Volatility for each of the ESPP four time periods of six
months, twelve months, eighteen months, and twenty-four months is calculated
separately and included in the overall stock-based compensation cost recorded.
Dividends. The Company has never paid any cash dividends on its common
stock and does not anticipate paying any cash dividends in the foreseeable
future. Consequently, the Company uses an expected dividend yield of zero in
the Black-Scholes option valuation method.
Risk-Free Interest Rate. The Company bases the risk-free interest rate
used in the Black-Scholes option valuation method on the implied yield in
effect at the time of option grant on U.S. Treasury zero-coupon issues with a
remaining term equivalent to the expected term of the stock awards including
the ESPP.
Estimated Forfeitures. When estimating forfeitures, the Company considers
voluntary termination behavior as well as analysis of actual option
forfeitures.
Fair Value. The fair values of the Company stock options granted to
employees and ESPP shares in fiscal 2010, 2009 and 2008 were estimated using
the following weighted average assumptions in the Black-Scholes option
valuation method.
The fair value of our stock options granted to employees in fiscal 2010,

Weighted Average Grant Date Fair Value.  $084    $128    $215                   40 EARNINGS PER SHARE EPS   Basic EPS is computed by dividing net income loss available to common
shareholders by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding for
the period. Diluted EPS is computed after giving effect to all dilutive
potential common shares that were outstanding during the period. Dilutive
potential common shares consist of the incremental common shares issuable upon
exercise of stock options for all periods.
A reconciliation of the numerator and denominator of basic and diluted EPS
is provided as follows in thousands, except per share amounts                          Year Ended May 31,

Basic net loss income per share.  $006  $355  $ 132
Diluted net loss income per share.  $006  $355  $ 124
For purposes of computing diluted earnings per share, weighted average
potential common shares do not include stock options with an exercise price
greater than the average fair value of the Company common stock for the
period, as the effect would be anti-dilutive. Potential common shares have
not been included in the calculation of diluted net loss per share for the
fiscal years ended May 31, 2010 and 2009, as the effect would be anti-
dilutive. As such the numerator and the denominator used in computing both
basic and diluted net loss per share for fiscal years ended May 31, 2010 and
2009 are the same. Stock options to purchase 1,949,000, 1,636,000 and 524,000
shares of common stock were outstanding on May 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008,
respectively, but not included in the computation of diluted income per share,
because the inclusion of such shares would be anti-dilutive.
COMPREHENSIVE INCOME LOSS   Comprehensive income loss generally represents all changes in
shareholders' equity except those resulting from investments or contributions
by shareholders. Unrealized gains losses on available-for-sale securities
and foreign currency translation adjustments are included in the Company
components of comprehensive income loss, which are excluded from net income
loss. Comprehensive income loss is included in the statement of
shareholders' equity and comprehensive income loss.
RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS   In October 2009, the Financial Accounting Standards Board, or FASB, issued
authoritative guidance for revenue recognition with multiple deliverables.
This authoritative guidance defines the criteria for identifying individual
deliverables in a multiple-element arrangement and the manner in which
revenues are allocated to individual deliverables. In absence of vendor-
specific objective evidence, or VSOE, or other third party evidence, or TPE,
of the selling price for the deliverables in a multiple-element arrangement,
guidance requires companies to use an estimated selling price, or ESP, for the
individual deliverables. Companies shall apply the relative-selling price
model for allocating an                   41 arrangement total consideration to its individual elements. Under this
model, the ESP is used for both the delivered and undelivered elements that do
not have VSOE or TPE of the selling price. This guidance is effective for
fiscal years beginning on or after June 15, 2010, and will be applied
prospectively to revenue arrangements entered into or materially modified
after the effective date. Since the Company will apply the requirements of
this authoritative guidance on a prospective basis, the Company is currently
unable to evaluate its effect on the Company consolidated financial
statements.
In October 2009, the FASB issued authoritative guidance for the accounting
for certain revenue arrangements that include software elements. This
authoritative guidance amends the scope of pre-existing software revenue
guidance by removing from the guidance non-software components of tangible
products and certain software components of tangible products. This guidance
is effective for fiscal years beginning on or after June 15, 2010, and will be
applied prospectively to revenue arrangements entered into or materially
modified after the effective date. Since the Company will apply the
requirements of this authoritative guidance on a prospective basis, the
Company is currently unable to evaluate its effect on the Company
consolidated financial statements.
In January 2010, the FASB issued amended standards that require additional
fair value disclosures. These amended standards require disclosures for
significant transfers in and out of Level 1 and Level 2 fair value
measurements and the reasons for the transfers and activity. For Level 3 fair
value measurements, purchases, sales, issuances and settlements must be
reported on a gross basis. Further, additional disclosures are required by
class of assets or liabilities, as well as inputs used to measure fair value
and valuation techniques. These standards are required to be adopted in the
first quarter of 2010. These standards did not have a material impact on the
Company consolidated financial statements.

5. PRODUCT WARRANTIES   The Company provides for the estimated cost of product warranties at the
time the products are shipped. While the Company engages in extensive product
quality programs and processes, including actively monitoring and evaluating
the quality of its component suppliers, the Company warranty obligation is
affected by product failure rates, material usage and service delivery costs
incurred in correcting a product failure. Should actual product failure
rates, material usage or service delivery costs differ from the Company
estimates, revisions to the estimated warranty liability would be required.                   43   Following is a summary of changes in the Company liability for product
warranties during the fiscal years ended May 31, 2010 and May 31, 2009 in

Net deferred tax asset.    $   --   $                               The valuation allowance increased by $56,000 during fiscal 2010, and
$14,599,000 during fiscal 2009, and the valuation allowance decreased by
$6,066,000 during fiscal 2008. As of May 31, 2010 and 2009, the Company
concluded that it is                   45 more likely than not that the deferred tax assets will not be realized and
therefore provided a full valuation allowance against the deferred tax assets.
The Company will continue to evaluate the need for a valuation allowance
against its deferred tax assets on a quarterly basis.
At May 31, 2010, the Company had federal and state net operating loss
carryforwards of $21,390,000 and $21,373,000, respectively. These
carryforwards will begin to expire in 2024 and 2014, respectively. At May 31,
2010, the Company also had federal and state research and development tax
credit carryforwards of $1,767,000 and $3,888,000, respectively. The federal
credit carryforward will begin to expire in 2016, and the California credit
will carryforward indefinitely. These carryforwards may be subject to certain
limitations on annual utilization in case of a change in ownership, as defined
by tax law. The Company also has alternative minimum tax credit carryforwards
of $91,000 for federal tax purposes and $34,000 for state purposes. The
credits may be used to offset regular tax and do not expire.
The Company has made no provision for U.S. income taxes on undistributed
earnings of certain foreign subsidiaries because it is the Company intention
to permanently reinvest such earnings in its foreign subsidiaries. If such
earnings were distributed, the Company would be subject to additional U.S.
income tax expense. Determination of the amount of unrecognized deferred
income tax liability related to these earnings is not practicable.
Foreign net operating loss carryforwards of $1,134,000 are available to
reduce future foreign taxable income. The foreign net operating losses will
begin to expire in 2012.
The Company maintains liabilities for uncertain tax positions. These
liabilities involve considerable judgment and estimation and are continuously
monitored by management based on the best information available. The Company
implemented new authoritative guidance for accounting for uncertain tax
positions in the first quarter of fiscal 2008. Upon adoption, the Company
recognized a cumulative effect adjustment of $127,000 decreasing its income
tax liability for unrecognized tax benefits and decreasing the May 31, 2007
accumulated deficit. The aggregate changes in the balance of gross
unrecognized tax benefits are as follows: in thousands
Beginning balance as of June 1, 2007.     $1,005
Increases related to prior year tax positions.       4
Increases related to current year tax positions..      159
Decreases related to lapse of statute of limitations.      25
Balance at May 31,      $1,143
Increases related to prior year tax positions.       49
Increases related to current year tax positions..       5
Decreases related to lapse of statute of limitations.       7

Decreases related to prior year tax positions.       5
Decreases related to lapse of statute of limitations.       4
Balance at May 31,      $1,181
If the ending balance of $1,181,000 of unrecognized tax benefits at May
31, 2010 were recognized, $298,000 would affect the effective income tax rate.
In accordance with the Company accounting policy, it recognizes accrued
interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits in the provision
for income taxes. The Company had accrued interest and penalties of $30,000

Option Plan the Stock Plan, which provided for granting of incentive and
non-qualified stock options to our employees and directors. The Stock Plan
provides that qualified options be granted at an exercise price equal to the
fair market value at the date of grant, as determined by the Board of
Directors 85% of fair market value in the case of non-statutory options and
purchase rights and 110% of fair market value in certain circumstances.
Options generally expire within five years from date of grant. Most options
become exercisable in increments over a four-year period from the date of
grant.
In October 2006, the Company 2006 Equity Incentive Plan and 2006
Employee Stock Purchase Plan 2006 Plans were approved by the shareholders.
A total of 2,000,000 shares of common stock have been reserved for issuance
under the Company 2006 Equity Incentive Plan. Options granted under the
2006 Equity Incentive Plan are generally for periods not to exceed ten years
five years if the option is granted to a 10% stockholder and are granted at
the fair market value of the stock at the date of grant as determined by the
Board of Directors. The 2006 Plans respectively replace the Company Amended
and Restated 1996 Stock Option Plan, which would otherwise have expired in
2006; and the Company 1997 Employee Stock Purchase Plan, which would have
otherwise expired in 2007. The Amended and Restated 1996 Stock Option Plan
will continue to govern awards previously granted under that plan.
As of May 31, 2010, out of the 2,947,000 shares authorized for grant under
the 1996 Stock Option Plan and 2006 Equity Incentive Plan, approximately

9. EMPLOYEE BENEFIT PLANS EMPLOYEE STOCK OWNERSHIP PLAN   The Company has a non-contributory, trusteed employee stock option plan
for full-time employees who have completed three consecutive months of service
and for part-time employees who have completed one year of service and have
attained an age of 21. The Company can contribute either shares of the
Company stock or cash to the plan. The contribution is determined annually
by the Company and cannot exceed 15% of the annual aggregate salaries of those
employees eligible for participation in the plan. On May 31, 2007, the
Company converted the Aehr Test Systems Employee Stock Bonus Plan into the
Aehr Test Systems Employee Stock Ownership Plan the Plan. The stock bonus
plan was converted to an employee stock ownership plan ESOP to enable the
Plan to better comply with changes in the law regarding Company stock.
Individuals' account balances vest at a rate of 20% per year commencing upon
completion of two years of service. Non-vested balances, which are forfeited
following termination of employment, are allocated to the remaining employees
in the Plan. Under the Plan provisions, each employee who reaches age fifty-
five 55 and has been a participant in the Plan for ten years will be offered
an election each year to direct the transfer of up to 25% of his/her ESOP
account to the employee self-directed account in the Savings & Retirement
Plan. For anyone who met the above prerequisites, the first election to
diversify holdings was offered after May 31, 2008. In the sixth year,
employees will be able to diversify up to 50% of their ESOP accounts.
Contributions of $150,000, $60,000 and $177,000 were authorized for the plan
during fiscal 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively. The contribution amounts are
recorded as compensation expense, in the period authorized and included in

held in the ESOP are included in the EPS calculation.
401K PLAN   The Company maintains a defined contribution savings plan the 401k
Plan to provide retirement income to all qualified employees of the Company.
The 401k Plan is intended to be qualified under Section 401k of the
Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended. The 401k Plan is funded by
voluntary pre-tax contributions from employees. Contributions are invested,
as directed by the participant, in investment funds available under the 401k
Plan. The Company is not required to make, and did not make, any
contributions to the 401k Plan during fiscal 2010, 2009 and 2008.                   48 EMPLOYEE STOCK PURCHASE PLAN   The Company Board of Directors adopted the 1997 Employee Stock Purchase
Plan in June 1997. A total of 400,000 shares of common stock have been
reserved for issuance under the plan. The plan has consecutive, overlapping,
twenty-four month offering periods. Each twenty-four month offering period
includes four six month purchase periods. The offering periods generally
begin on the first trading day on or after April 1 and October 1 each year,
except that the first such offering period commenced with the effectiveness of
the Company initial public offering and ended on the last trading day on or
before March 31, 1999. Shares are purchased through employee payroll
deductions at exercise prices equal to 85% of the lesser of the fair market
value of the Company common stock at either the first day of an offering
period or the last day of the purchase period. If a participant rights to
purchase stock under all employee stock purchase plans of the Company accrue
at a rate which exceeds $25,000 worth of stock for a calendar year, such
participant may not be granted an option to purchase stock under the 1997
Employee Stock Purchase Plan. The maximum number of shares a participant may
purchase during a single purchase period is 3,000 shares.
In October 2006, the Company shareholders approved the 2006 Employee
Stock Purchase Plan, or 2006 Purchase Plan. A total of 450,000 shares of the
Company common stock were reserved for issuance under the 2006 Purchase
Plan. The 2006 Purchase Plan has consecutive, overlapping, twenty-four month
offering periods. Each twenty-four month offering period includes four six
month purchase periods. The offering periods generally begin on the first
trading day on or after April 1 and October 1 each year. The first exercise
date under the 2006 Purchase Plan was April 1, 2007. All employees who work a
minimum of 20 hours per week and are customarily employed by the Company or
an affiliate thereof for at least five months per calendar year are eligible
to participate. Under the 2006 Purchase Plan, shares are purchased through
employee payroll deductions at exercise prices equal to 85% of the lesser of
the fair market value of the Company common stock at either the first day of
an offering period or the last day of the purchase period. If a participant
rights to purchase stock under all employee stock purchase plans of the
Company accrue at a rate which exceeds $25,000 worth of stock for a calendar
year, such participant may not be granted an option to purchase stock under
the 2006 Purchase Plan. For the years ended May 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008,
approximately 89,000, 73,000 and 34,000 shares of common stock, respectively,
were issued under the plans. To date, 608,000 shares have been issued under
both employee stock purchase plans.
10. STOCKHOLDER RIGHTS PLAN   The Company Board of Directors adopted a Stockholder Rights Plan on
March 5, 2001, under which a dividend of one Right to purchase one one-
thousandth of a share of the Company Series A Participating Preferred Stock
was distributed for each outstanding share of the Company common stock. The
plan entitled each Right holder to purchase 1/1000th of a share of the
Company Series A Participating Preferred Stock at an exercise price of
$3500, subject to adjustment, in certain events, such as a tender offer to
acquire 20% or more of the Company outstanding common stock. Under some
circumstances, such as if a person or group acquires 20% or more of the
Company common stock prior to redemption of the Rights, the plan entitled
such holders other than an acquiring party to purchase the Company common
stock having a market value at that time of twice the Right exercise price.
The Rights expired on April 3, 2010.

14. COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES COMMITMENTS
The Company leases most of its manufacturing and office space under

maintains equipment under non-cancelable operating leases in Germany. The
Company principal administrative and production facilities are located in
Fremont, California, in a 51,289 square foot building. The term of the
Company current lease commenced on April 1, 2008 and ends on June 30, 2015.

At May 31, 2010 and 2009, the Company had a $50,000 certificate of deposit
held by a financial institution representing a security deposit for its United
States manufacturing and office space lease. This amount is included in
Other Assets on the consolidated balance sheets.
PURCHASE OBLIGATIONS
The Company has purchase obligations to certain suppliers. In some cases
the products the Company purchases are unique and have provisions against
cancellation of the order. At May 31, 2010, the Company had $805,000 of
purchase obligations which are due within the following 12 months. This
amount does not include contractual obligations recorded on the consolidated
balance sheets as liabilities.
CONTINGENCIES
On April 24, 2009, Aehr Test Systems Japan filed a claim against Spansion
Japan in the Tokyo District Court for claims for goods and services provided
to Spansion. The claim consists primarily of accounts receivable for goods
and services provided, interest, and cancellation charges for goods and
services ordered by Spansion which were not delivered to Spansion. These
orders were canceled due to Spansion failure to pay per terms. The Company
has been advised that it may receive a small payment through the Japan
bankruptcy action.
The Company is, from time to time, involved in legal proceedings arising
in the ordinary course of business. While there can be no assurances as to
the ultimate outcome of any litigation involving the Company, management does
not believe any pending legal proceedings will result in judgment or
settlement that will have a material adverse effect on the Company
consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows.
In the normal course of business to facilitate sales of its products, the
Company indemnifies other parties, including customers, with respect to
certain matters. The Company has agreed to hold the other party harmless
against losses arising from a breach of representations or covenants, or from
intellectual property infringement or other claims. These agreements may
limit the time within which an indemnification claim can be made and the
amount of the claim. In addition, the Company has entered into
indemnification agreements with its officers and directors, and the Company
bylaws contain similar indemnification obligations to the Company agents.
It is not possible to determine the maximum potential amount under these
indemnification agreements due to the limited history of prior indemnification
claims and the unique facts and circumstances involved in each particular
agreement. To date, payments made by the Company under these agreements have
not had a material impact on the Company operating results, financial
position or cash flows.                   51 SELECTED QUARTERLY CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL DATA UNAUDITED
