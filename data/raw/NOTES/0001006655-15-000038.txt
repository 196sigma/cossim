These financial statements are the responsibility of the Companys management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audits.We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board United States. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Evolution Petroleum Corporation and subsidiaries as of June30, 2015 and 2014, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended June30, 2015, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board United States, Evolution Petroleum Corporation and subsidiaries internal control over financial reporting as of June30, 2015, based on criteria established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission in 2013, and our report dated September11, 2015expressed an unqualified opinion on the effectiveness of Evolution Petroleum Corporations internal control over financial reporting.Hein AssociatesLLPHouston, TexasSeptember11, 201536Table of ContentsREPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRMTo the Board of Directors and StockholdersEvolution Petroleum CorporationWe have audited Evolution Petroleum Corporations internal control over financial reporting as of June30, 2015, based on criteria established in Internal Control-Integrated Frameworkissued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission in 2013. Evolution Petroleum Corporations management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying Managements Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Companys internal control over financial reporting based on our audit.We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board United States. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audit also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.A companys internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A companys internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that apertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; bprovide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and cprovide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the companys assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.In our opinion, Evolution Petroleum Corporation maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of June30, 2015, based on criteria established in Internal Control-Integrated Frameworkissued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission in 2013.We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board United States, the consolidated balance sheets of Evolution Petroleum Corporation and subsidiaries as of June30, 2015 and 2014, and the related consolidated statements of operations, changes in stockholders equity, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended June30, 2015, and our report dated September11, 2015expressed an unqualified opinion.Hein AssociatesLLPHouston, TexasSeptember11, 201537Table of ContentsEvolution Petroleum Corporation and SubsidiariesConsolidated Balance SheetsJune 30, 2015June 30, 2014AssetsCurrent assetsCash and cash  tax asset82,414159,624Prepaid expenses and other current assets369,404747,453Total current  and equipment, net of depreciation, depletion, and amortizationOil and natural gas propertiesfull-cost method of accounting, of which none were excluded from  property and equipment, net276,756424,827Total property and equipment, net45,463,64238,246,897Other assets726,037464,052Total  and Stockholders' EquityCurrent liabilitiesAccounts  liabilities and  liabilities, net109,974State and federal taxes payable190,032Total current  term liabilitiesDeferred income taxes11,242,5519,897,272Asset retirement  rent18,57535,720Total  and contingencies Note17Stockholders' equityPreferred stock, par value $0001;

We are engaged primarily in the development of oil and gas reserves within known oil and gas resources for our shareholders and customers utilizing conventional and proprietary technology.Principles of Consolidation and Reporting.Our consolidated financial statements include the accounts of EPM and its wholly-owned subsidiaries. All significant intercompany transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. The consolidated financial statements for the previous year include certain reclassifications that were made to conform to the current presentation. Such reclassifications have no impact on previously reported income or stockholders' equity.Use of Estimates.The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America GAAP requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the dates of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods. Significant estimates include reserve quantities and estimated future cash flows associated with proved reserves, which significantly impact depletion expense and potential impairments of oil and natural gas properties, income taxes and the valuation of deferred tax assets, stock-based compensation and commitments and contingencies. We analyze our estimates based on historical experience and various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable. While we believe that our estimates and assumptions used in preparation of the consolidated financial statements are appropriate, actual results could differ from those estimates.Note2Summary of Significant Accounting PoliciesCash and Cash Equivalents.We consider all highly liquid investments, with original maturities of 90days or less when purchased, to be cash and cash equivalents.Account Receivable and Allowance for Doubtful Accounts.Accounts receivable consist of uncollateralized joint interest owner obligations due within 30 days of the invoice date, uncollateralized accrued revenues due under normal trade terms, generally requiring payment within 30 days of production, and other miscellaneous receivables. No interest is charged on past-due balances. Payments made on accounts receivable are applied to the earliest unpaid items. We establish provisions for losses on accounts receivables if it is determined that collection of all or a part of an outstanding balance is not probable. Collectibility is reviewed regularly and an allowance is established or adjusted, as necessary, using the specific identification method. As of June 30,2015and 2014, no allowance for doubtful accounts was considered necessary.Oil and Natural Gas Properties.We use the full cost method of accounting for our investments in oil and natural gas properties. Under this method of accounting, all costs incurred in the acquisition, exploration and development of oil and natural gas properties, including unproductive wells, are capitalized. This includes any internal costs that are directly related to property acquisition, exploration and development activities but does not include any costs related to production, general corporate overhead or similar activities. Gain or loss on the sale or other disposition of oil and natural gas properties is not recognized, unless the gain or loss would significantly alter the relationship between capitalized costs and proved reserves.Oil and natural gas properties include costs that are excluded from costs being depleted or amortized. Excluded costs represent investments in unproved and unevaluated properties and include non-producing leasehold, geological and geophysical costs associated with leasehold or drilling interests and exploration drilling costs. We exclude these costs until the project is evaluated and proved reserves are established or impairment is determined. Excluded costs are reviewed at least quarterly to determine if impairment has occurred. The amount of any evaluated or impaired oil and natural gas properties is transferred to capitalized costs being amortized.Limitation on Capitalized Costs.Under the full-cost method of accounting, we are required, at the end of each fiscal quarter, to perform a test to determine the limit on the book value of our oil and natural gas properties the Ceiling Test. If the capitalized costs of our oil and natural gas properties, net of accumulated amortization and related deferred income taxes, exceed the Ceiling, this excess or impairment is charged to expense and reflected as additional accumulated depreciation, depletion and amortization or as a credit to oil and natural gas properties. The expense may not be reversed in future periods, even though higher oil and natural gas prices may subsequently increase the Ceiling. The Ceiling is defined as the sum of: athe present value, discounted at 10 percent, and assuming continuation of existing economic conditions, of 1estimated future gross revenues from proved reserves, which is computed using oil and natural gas prices determined as the unweighted 42Table of ContentsEVOLUTION PETROLEUM CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIESNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Continuedarithmetic average of the first-day-of-the-month price for each month within the 12-month period prior to the end of the reporting period with consideration of price changes only to the extent provided by contractual arrangements including hedging arrangements pursuant to SAB103, less 2estimated future expenditures based on current costs to be incurred in developing and producing the proved reserves; plus bthe cost of properties not being amortized pursuant to Reg. S-X Rule4-10 c3ii; plus cthe lower of cost or estimated fair value of unproven properties included in the costs being amortized; net of dthe related tax effects related to the difference between the book and tax basis of our oil and natural gas properties. Our Ceiling Test did not result in an impairment of our oil and natural gas properties during the years ended June30, 2015, 2014or 2013.Other Property and Equipment.Other property and equipment includes leasehold improvements, data processing and telecommunications equipment, office furniture and equipment, and oilfield service equipment related to our artificial lift technology operations. These items are recorded at cost and depreciated over expected lives of the individual assets or group of assets, which range from threeto seven years. The assets are depreciated using the straight-line method, except for oilfield service equipment related to our artificial lift technology operations, which is depreciated using a method which approximates the timing and amounts of expected revenues from the contract. Realization of the carrying value of other property and equipment is reviewed for possible impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. Assets are determined to be impaired if a forecast of undiscounted estimated future net operating cash flows directly related to the asset, including disposal value, if any, is less than the carrying amount of the asset. If any asset is determined to be impaired, the loss is measured as the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds its fair value. Repairs and maintenance costs are expensed in the period incurred.Deferred Financing Costs.  The Company capitalizes costs incurred in connection with obtaining financing. These costs are included in other assets on the Company consolidated balance sheet and are amortized over the term of the related financing using the straight-line method, which approximates the effective interest method.Asset Retirement Obligations.An asset retirement obligation associated with the retirement of a tangible long-lived asset is recognized as a liability in the period incurred, with an associated increase in the carrying amount of the related long-lived asset, our oil and natural gas properties. The cost of the tangible asset, including the asset retirement cost, is depleted over the useful life of the asset. The initial recognition or subsequent revision of asset retirement cost is considered a level3 fair value measurement. The asset retirement obligation is recorded at its estimated fair value, measured by reference to the expected future cash outflows required to satisfy the retirement obligation discounted at our credit-adjusted risk-free interest rate. Accretion expense is recognized over time as the discounted liability is accreted to its expected settlement value. If the estimated future cost of the asset retirement obligation changes, an adjustment is recorded to both the asset retirement obligation and the long-lived asset. Revisions to estimated asset retirement obligations can result from changes in retirement cost estimates, revisions to estimated inflation rates and changes in the estimated timing of abandonment.Fair Value of Financial Instruments.Our financial instruments consist of cash and cash equivalents, certificates of deposit, accounts receivable, accounts payable and derivative instruments. Except for derivatives, the carrying amounts of these approximate fair value due to the highly liquid nature of these short-term instruments. The fair values of the Companys derivative assets and liabilities are based on a third-party industry-standard pricing model that uses market data obtained from third-party sources, including quoted forward prices for oil and gas, discount rates and volatility factors.Stock-based Compensation.  Estimated grant date fair value of stock-based compensation awards is determined to provide the basis for future compensation expense. Service-and performance-based Restricted Stock and Contingent Restricted Stock awards are valued using the market price of our common stock on the grant date. For market-based awards, which reflect future returns of our common stock, the fair value and expected vesting period are determined using a Monte Carlo simulation based on the historical volatility of the Company total return compared to the historical volatilities of the other companies comprising a benchmark index. We used the Black-Scholes option-pricing model to determine grant date fair value of our past Stock Option and Incentive Warrant awards. For service-based awards stock-based compensation equal to grant date fair value is recognized ratably over the requisite service period as the award vests. A performance-based award vests upon attaining the award operational goal and requires that the recipient remain an employee of the Company upon vesting. Stock-based compensation expense equal to grant date fair value is recognized ratably over the expected vesting period when it is deemed probable, for accounting purposes, that the performance goal will be achieved. The expected vesting period may be deemed to be shorter than the remainder of the awards term. For a market-based award stock-based compensation expense equal to grant date fair value is recognized ratably over the expected vesting period, so long as the award holder remains an employee of the Company. Total compensation expense is independent of vesting or expiration of the awards, except for termination of service43Table of ContentsEVOLUTION PETROLEUM CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIESNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS ContinuedRevenue Recognition - Oil and Gas.We recognize oil and natural gas revenue from our interests in producing wells at the time that title passes to the purchaser. As a result, we accrue revenues related to production sold for which we have not received payment.Revenue Recognition - Artificial Lift Technology.Our artificial lift technology operations may generate revenues under several forms of operational or contractual arrangements. We have utilized the technology on wells that we develop and operate and on certain wells that we operate under farm-outs from other operators. In these cases, our revenues take the form of net sales of oil and gas production. We have also provided the technology to third parties under contractual arrangements that generate fees for the technology which are based on the net profits from oil and gas production. Under these contracts, we may be required to bear part or all of the incremental installation and capital costs for the technology. In other cases, we may be compensated for our technology through a fixed or variable fee per well, which does not require us to bear any net costs of installation or other capital costs. In the future, we may enter into licensing contracts which allow for the sale and installation of the technology by third parties to their customers or we may license the technology to larger organizations for use in specified geographic areas or on other broad terms. In all cases, we evaluate the substance of the contractual arrangement and recognize revenues over the life of the contract as the earnings process is determined to be complete. We likewise charge our costs, including both capital expenditures and operating expenses, to operating costs in a manner which either matches these costs to the timing of expected revenues, where appropriate, or charges these costs to the accounting period in which they were incurred where it is not appropriate to capitalize or defer them to match with revenues.Derivative Instruments. In early June 2015, the Company initiated derivative transactions using costless collars to reduce its exposure to oil price volatility for a substantial portion of its forecasted production for the months of July 2015 through December 2015. All derivative instruments are recorded on the consolidated balance sheet as either an asset or liability measured at fair value. The Company nets its derivative instrument fair value amounts executed with the same counterparty pursuant to a ISDA master agreement, which provides for net settlement over the term of the contract and in the event of default or termination of the contract. Although the derivative instruments provide an economic hedge of the Companys exposure to commodity price volatility, because the Company elected not to meet the criteria to qualify its derivative instruments for hedge accounting treatment, net gains and losses as a result of changes in the fair value of derivative instruments are recognized as gain or loss on derivatives in the consolidated statements of operations in the period in which the changes occur. The net cash flows resulting from the payments to and receipts from the counterparty as a result of derivative settlements are classified as cash flows from investing activities. The Company does not intend to enter into derivative instruments for speculative or trading purposes.Depreciation, Depletion and Amortization.The depreciable base for oil and natural gas properties includes the sum of all capitalized costs net of DDA, estimated future development costs and asset retirement costs not included in oil and natural gas properties, less costs excluded from amortization. The depreciable base of oil and natural gas properties is amortized using the unit-of-production method over total proved reserves. Other property, consisting of leasehold improvements, office and computer equipment, vehicles and artificial lift equipment is depreciated as described above in Other Property and Equipment.Intangible Assets - Intellectual Property.The Company capitalizes the external costs, consisting primarily of legal costs, related to securing its patents and trademarks. The costs related to patents are amortized over the remaining patent life which is less than the expected useful life of each patent. Trademarks are perpetual and are not amortized.Income Taxes.We recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities based on the differences between the tax basis of assets and liabilities and their reported amounts in the financial statements that may result in taxable or deductible amounts in future years. The measurement of deferred tax assets may be reduced by a valuation allowance based upon management assessment of available evidence if it is deemed more likely than not some or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realizable. We recognize a tax benefit from an uncertain position when it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained upon examination, based on the technical merits of the position and will record the largest amount of tax benefit that is greater than 50% likely of being realized upon settlement with a taxing authority. The Company classifies any interest and penalties associated with income taxes as income tax expense.Earnings loss per share.Basic earnings loss per share EPS is computed by dividing earnings or loss by the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding less any non-vested restricted common stock outstanding. The computation of diluted EPS is similar to the computation of basic EPS, except that the denominator is increased to include the number of additional common shares that would have been outstanding if potential dilutive common shares had been issued. Our potential dilutive common shares are our outstanding stock options, warrants, and non-vested restricted common stock. The dilutive effect of our potential dilutive common shares is reflected in diluted EPS by application of the treasury stock method. Under the treasury stock method, exercise of stock options and warrants shall be assumed at the beginning of the period or at time of issuance, if later and common shares shall be assumed to be issued; the proceeds from exercise shall be assumed to be 44Table of ContentsEVOLUTION PETROLEUM CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIESNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Continuedused to purchase common stock at the average market price during the period; and the incremental shares the difference between the number of shares assumed issued and the number of shares assumed purchased shall be included in the denominator of the diluted EPS computation. Potential dilutive common shares are excluded from the computation if their effect is anti-dilutive.Recent Accounting Pronouncements.In May 2014, the FASB issued ASU No. 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers: Topic 606 to provide guidance on revenue recognition on contracts with customers to transfer goods or services or on contracts for the transfer of nonfinancial assets. ASU 2014-09 requires that revenue recognition on contracts with customers depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. ASU 2014-09 will be effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those years, beginning after December 15, 2017. The standard provides for either the retrospective or cumulative effect transition method. The Company is currently assessing the impact of the adoption of ASU 2014-09 will have on its consolidated financial statements.In April 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-03 ASC Subtopic 835-30, Interest-Imputation of Interest: Simplifying the Presentation of Debt Issuance Costs. The amendments in this ASU require that debt issuance costs related to a recognized debt liability be presented in the balance sheet as a direct deduction from the carrying amount of that debt liability. The amendments in this ASU are effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those years, beginning after December15, 2015. Early adoption is permitted for financial statements that have not been previously issued. The adoption of this new guidance will not have a material impact on the Company consolidated financial statements and  of June30, 2015and June30, 2014our receivables consisted of the following:June30, 2015June30, 2014Receivables from oil and gas   Expenses and Other Current AssetsAs of June30, 2015and June30, 2014our prepaid expenses and other current assets consisted of the following:June30, 2015June30, 2014Prepaid  federal and state income taxes22,542419,999Equipment  and deposits26,97829,478Other prepaid expenses59,35242,800Prepaid expenses and other current assets$369,404$747,45345Table of ContentsEVOLUTION PETROLEUM CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIESNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS ContinuedNote5Property and EquipmentAs of June30, 2015and June30, 2014, our oil and natural gas properties and other property and equipment consisted of the following:June30, 2015June30, 2014Oil and natural gas propertiesProperty costs subject to  Accumulated depreciation, depletion, and  properties not subject to amortizationOil and natural gas properties, net45,186,88637,822,070Other property and equipmentFurniture, fixtures and office equipment, at cost287,680343,178Artificial lift technology equipment, at cost319,994377,943Less: Accumulated  property and equipment, net$276,756$424,827As of June30, 2015and 2014, all oil and gas property costs incurred by the Company were being amortized.

The shares acquired in 2014 were received in satisfaction of payroll tax liabilities from the exercise of stock options and vesting of restricted stock requiring cash outlays by us and 50,956shares were received from option holders in cashless stock option exercises, using stock previously owned by the option holder. Commencing in December 2013, the Board of Directors initiated a quarterly cash dividend on our common stock at a quarterly rate of $010per share and subsequently adjusted this rate to $005per share during the quarter ended March31, 2015. We paid cash dividends of $9,833,642and $9,723,833from retained earnings to our common shareholders during the years ended June30, 2015, and 2014, respectively.On May 12, 2015, the Board of Directors approved a share repurchase program covering up to $5,000,000of the Company common stock. Under the program terms, shares may be repurchased only on the open market and in accordance with the requirements of the Securities and Exchange Commission. The timing and amount of repurchases will depend upon several factors, including financial resources and market and business conditions. There is no fixed termination date for this repurchase program, and the repurchase program may be suspended or discontinued at any time. Payment for shares repurchased under the program will be funded using the Company working capital. The Company intends to retire the repurchased shares. As of June30, 2015, the Company had purchases of 63,372shares of stock which had a weighted average price per share of $687.During fiscal 2015, the Company also acquired 7,535shares of its common stock at a weighted average price per share of $916in exchange for payroll tax liabilities related to stock-based compensation.SeriesA Cumulative Perpetual Preferred StockDuring the year ended June30, 2012, we sold 317,319shares of our 85%SeriesA Cumulative perpetual Preferred Stock at a weighted average sales price of $2380per share, with a liquidation preference of $2500per share. All shares were underwritten or sold through McNicoll Lewis VlakLLC MLV, 220,000of which were sold in an underwritten public offering and 97,319shares of which were sold under an at-the-market sales agreement ATM, providing aggregate net proceeds of $6,930,535after market discounts, underwriting fees, legal and other expenses of the offerings. The SeriesA Cumulative Preferred Stock cannot be converted into our common stock and there are no sinking fund or redemption rights available to holders thereof. Optional redemption can be made by us at any time after July1, 2014 for the stated liquidation value of $2500per share plus accrued dividends. With respect to dividend rights and rights upon our liquidation, winding-up or dissolution, the SeriesA Preferred Stock ranks senior to our common shareholders, but subordinate to any of our existing and future debt. Dividends on the SeriesA Cumulative Preferred Stock accrue and accumulate at a fixed rate of 85%per annum on the $2500per share liquidation preference, payable monthly at $0177083per share, as, if and when declared by our Board of Directors.We paid dividends of $674,302, $674,302and $674,302to holders of our SeriesA Preferred Stock during the years ended June30, 2015, 2014and 2013, respectively. Expected Tax Treatment of Dividends to RecipientsBased on our current projections for the fiscal year ending June 30, 2015, we expect preferred dividends will be treated as qualified dividend income to recipients and that a portion of our cash dividends on common stock will be treated as a return of capital and the remainder as qualified dividend income. We will make a preliminary determination regarding the tax treatment of dividends for the current fiscal year when we report this information to recipients. As a result of the difference between our June 30 fiscal year and the calendar year basis of our dividend reporting requirements, it is possible that we will be required to amend these reports when our final taxable income for the fiscal year is determined, as this will potentially affect the 48Table of ContentsEVOLUTION PETROLEUM CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIESNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Continuedtax status of our dividends to recipients. For the fiscal year ended June 30, 2014, cash dividends on preferred and common stock were treated for tax purposes as a return of capital to our  Incentive PlanWe have granted option awards to purchase common stock the Stock Options, restricted common stock awards Restricted Stock, contingent restricted common stock awards Contingent Restricted Stock and/or unrestricted fully vested common stock, to employees, directors, and consultants of the Company under the Evolution Petroleum Corporation Amended and Restated 2004 Stock Plan the Plan. The Plan authorized the issuance of 6,500,000shares of common stock. As of June30, 2015, 542,529shares remain available for grant.Stock Options and Incentive WarrantsNo Stock Options have been granted since August 2008 and all compensation costs attributable to Stock Options have been recognized in prior periods. No Incentive Warrants have been granted since February 2006, all compensation costs attributable to these awards have been recognized in prior periods and all remaining outstanding awards were exercised in November 2013.The following summary presents information regarding outstanding Stock Options as of June30, 2015, and the changes during the fiscal year:Number of   inyearsStock Options outstanding at June30,  or forfeitedExpiredStock Options outstanding at June30,  or expected to vest at June30,  at June30,  upon the difference between the market price of our common stock on the last trading date of the period $659as of June30, 2015 and the Stock Option exercise price of in-the-money Stock Option.For the year ended June30, 2015, there were 87,000Stock Options exercised with an aggregate intrinsic value of $501,810. For the year ended June 30, 2014, there were 4,644,759Stock Options and Incentive Warrants exercised, with an aggregate intrinsic value of $47,504,114. For the year ended June 30, 2013, there were 550,000Stock Options exercised with an aggregate intrinsic value of $5,233,480.During the years ended June30, 2015, 2014, and 2013, there were 0, 0, and 18,922Stock Options that vested with a total grant date fair value of $0, $0, and $46,359, respectively.Restricted Stock and Contingent Restricted StockPrior to fiscal 2015 all Restricted Stock grants contained a four-year vesting period period based solely on service. During fiscal 2015, the Company awarded grants of both Restricted Stock and Contingent Restricted Stock as part of its long-term incentive plan. Such grants, which expire after four years if unvested, contain service-based, performance-based and market-based vesting provisions. The common shares underlying the Restricted Stock grants were issued on the date of grant, whereas the Contingent Restricted Stock will be issued only upon the attainment of specified performance-based or market-based vesting provisions49Table of ContentsEVOLUTION PETROLEUM CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIESNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS ContinuedMarket-based awards entitle employees to vest in a fixed number of shares when the three-year trailing total return on the Companys common stock exceeds the corresponding total returns of various quartiles of companies comprising the SIG Exploration and Production Index NASDAQ EPX during defined measurement periods. The fair value and expected vesting period of these awards were determined using a Monte Carlo simulation based on the historical volatility of the Company total return compared to the historical volatilities of the other companies in the index. Fair values for these market-based awards ranged from $426to $840with expected vesting periods of 330to 255years, based on the various quartiles of comparative market performance. Compensation expense for market-based awards is recognized over the expected vesting period using the straight-line method, so long as the award holder remains an employee of the Company. Total compensation expense is based on the fair value of the awards at the date of grant and is independent of vesting or expiration of the awards, except for termination of service.The following table sets forth the Restricted Stock transactions for the year ended June30, 2015:Number  ValueUnamortized Compensation Expense at June 30, 2015 1Weighted Average Remaining Amortization Period YearsUnvested at June 30,  awards  awards  awards  at June30,  $770,252of potential future compensation expense for performance-based awards for which vesting is not considered probable at this time for accounting purposes.During the years ended June30, 2015, 2014, and 2013, there were 91,306, 277,198, and 277,198shares of Restricted Stock that vested with a total grant date fair value of $766,970, $1,796,243, and $1,427,570, respectively.The following table summarizes Contingent Restricted Stock   Compensation Expense at June 30, 2015 1Weighted Average Remaining Amortization Period YearsUnvested at July1, 2014Performance-based awards  awards granted17,961426Unvested at June 30, 201556,286$820$57,004251 Excludes $385,166of potential future compensation expense for performance-based awards for which vesting is not considered probable at this time for accounting purposes.Stock-based Compensation ExpenseFor the years ended June30, 2015, 2014, and 2013, we recognized stock-based compensation expense related to Restricted Stock, Contingent Restricted Stock grants, and Stock Option grants of $962,813, $1,728,687, and $1,531,745, respectively. For the year ended June30, 2015, this expense includes $19,160of cash dividends paid on unvested performance-based awards for which vesting is not considered probable at this time for accounting purposes.

We believe that we have appropriate support for the income tax positions taken and to be taken on the Company tax returns and that the accruals for tax liabilities are adequate for all open years based on our assessment of many factors including past experience and interpretations of tax law applied to the facts of each matter. The Company tax returns are open to audit under the statute of limitations for the years ending June30, 2012 through June30, 2014 for federal tax purposes and for the years ended June30, 2011 through June30, 2014 for state tax purposes.The components of our income tax provision benefit are as follows:June 30, 2015June 30, 2014June 30,  current income tax  deferred income tax  following table presents the reconciliation of our income taxes calculated at the statutory federal tax rate, currently 34%, to the income tax provision in our financial statements. The effective tax rate for all years is in excess of the statutory rate as a result of state income taxes, primarily in the state of Louisiana, with smaller adjustments related to stock-based compensation and other permanent differences. 51Table of ContentsEVOLUTION PETROLEUM CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIESNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS ContinuedJune 30, 2015June 30, 2014June 30, 2013Income tax provision benefit computed at the statutory federal  items:State income taxes, net of federal tax  differences related to stock-based  NOLs related to 2004 reverse merger600,964Deferred tax asset valuation adjustment600,964Other permanent  tax  income taxes primarily represent the net tax effect of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for income tax purposes. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are classified as either current or noncurrent on the balance sheet based on the classification of the related asset or liability for financial reporting purposes. Deferred tax assets and liabilities not related to specific assets or liabilities on the financial statements are classified according the expected reversal date of the temporary difference or the expected utilization date for tax attribute carryforwards. The change in the NOLs is primarily due to expiring NOLs related to the 2004 reverse merger as well as utilization of NOLs to offset potential current year taxable income. The components of our deferred taxes are detailed in the table below:June 30, 2015June 30, 2014June 30, 2013Deferred tax assets:Non-qualified stock-based  operating loss  credit  deferred tax   deferred tax  tax liability:Oil and natural gas  deferred tax  deferred tax  AMT credit carry-forward is $901,545. Our net deferred tax liability does not include $200,291of AMT credit carry-forward associated with the tax benefit related to stock-based compensation.As of June30, 2015, we have a federal tax loss carryforward of approximately $258 million, created primarily from tax deductions in excess of book deductions related to the exercise of non-qualified stock options and incentive warrants in fiscal 2014, and $12 millionof remaining tax loss carryforwards that we acquired through the reverse merger in May 2004. The majority of the tax loss carryforwards from the reverse merger have expired without being utilized. We will be able to utilize a maximum of $03 millionof these carryforwards in equal annual amounts of $39,648through 2023 and the balance is not able to be utilized based on the provisions of IRC Section 382. We have recorded a valuation allowance for the portion of our net operating loss that is limited by IRC Section382.The remaining fiscal 2014 tax loss carry-forward of $246 millionand future tax benefits resulting from the fiscal 2014 exercises will not affect our future tax provision for financial reporting purposes, nor are we able to recognize a deferred tax asset for these future benefits. When we receive these tax benefits as a reduction of future cash taxes that would otherwise be payable, we will recognize that benefit as an increase in additional paid in capital.Based on the carryback of tax losses resulting from the exercise of stock options and incentive warrants in fiscal 2014, we filed a request for refund of cash taxes paid in Louisiana for the previous three fiscal years totaling approximately $15 million. 52Table of ContentsEVOLUTION PETROLEUM CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIESNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS ContinuedThis refund will not affect our tax provision for financial reporting purposes. When and if received, we will recognize the benefit as an increase in additional paid-in capital. We cannot be certain of the timing or amount of the refund if any. As a result, this potential refund has not been reflected in the accompanying financial statements. This carryback, if realized, will utilize approximately $190 millionof an estimated $242 millionnet loss for state tax purposes with another $38 millionexpected to be used to offset taxable income in 2015, leaving $15 millionof tax loss carryforwards remaining for Louisiana tax purposes.In addition, as of June 30, 2015, the Company has an estimated carryforward of percentage depletion in excess of basis of approximately $116 million. These future deductions are limited to 65%of taxable income in any period.

Under the agreement, he is paid a fee when the technology is employed. For the years ended June30, 2015, 2014 and 2013, we made payments of $26,579, $10,113and $10,113, respectively, under the agreement.Note15Net Income Per ShareThe following table sets forth the computation of basic and diluted net income per share:June 30,201520142013NumeratorNet income attributable to common  average number of common  of dilutive securities:Contingent restricted stock grants4,422Common stock warrants issued in connection with equity and financing transactions878Stock Options and Incentive  weighted average dilutive  average number of common shares and dilutive potential common shares used in diluted  income per common shareBasic$013$009$021Net income per common  following are reflected in the calculation of diluted earnings per share as of June30, 2015:Outstanding Potential Dilutive  PriceOutstanding at June30, 2015Contingent Restricted Stock grants$17,961Stock  of ContentsEVOLUTION PETROLEUM CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIESNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS ContinuedThe following are reflected in the calculation of diluted earnings per share as of June30, 2014:Outstanding Potential Dilutive  PriceOutstanding at June30, 2014Stock Options$208178,061The following are reflected in the calculation of diluted earnings per share as of June30, 2013:Outstanding Potential Dilutive  PriceOutstanding at June30, 2013Common stock warrants issued in connection with equity and financing transactions$2501,165Stock Options and Incentive  Revolving Credit AgreementOn February29, 2012, Evolution Petroleum Corporation entered into a Credit Agreement the Credit Agreement with Texas Capital Bank, N.A. the Lender. The Credit Agreement provides the Company with a revolving credit facility the facility in an amount up to $50,000,000with availability governed by an Initial Borrowing Base of $5,000,000. A portion of the facility not in excess of $1,000,000is available for the issuance of letters of credit.The facility is unsecured and has a term of four years, expiring on February 29, 2016. The Company subsidiaries guarantee the Company obligations under the facility. The proceeds of any loans under the facility are to be used by the Company for the acquisition and development of oil and gas properties, as defined in the facility, the issuance of letters of credit, and for working capital and general corporate purposes.Semi-annually, the borrowing base and a monthly reduction amount are re-determined from reserve reports. Requests by the Company to increase the $5,000,000initial amount are subject to the Lender credit approval process, and are also limited to 25%of the value our oil and gas properties, as defined.At the Company option, borrowings under the facility bear interest at a rate of either ian Adjusted LIBORrate LIBOR rate divided by the remainder of 1less the Lender RegulationD reserve requirement, or iian adjusted Base Rate equal to the greater of the Lender prime rateor the sum of 050%plus theFederal Fund Rate. A maximum of threeLIBOR based loans can be outstanding at any time. Allowed loan interest periods are one, two, threeand six months. LIBOR interest is payable at the end of the interest period except for six-month loans for which accrued interest is payable at three monthsand at end of term. Base Rate interest is payable monthly. Letters of credit bear fees of 35%per annum rate applied to the principal amount and are due when transacted. The maximum term of letters of credit is one year.A commitment fee of 050%per annum accrues on unutilized availability and is payable quarterly. The Company is responsible for certain administrative expenses of the Lender over the life of the Credit Agreement as well as $50,000in loan costs incurred upon closing.The Credit Agreement also contains financial covenants including a requirement that the Company maintain a current ratio of not less than 15to 1; a ratio of total funded Indebtedness to EBITDA of not more than 25to 1, and a ratio of EBITDA to interest expense of not less than 3to 1. The agreement specifies certain customary covenants, including restrictions on the Company and its subsidiaries from pledging their assets, incurring defined Indebtedness outside of the facility other than permitted indebtedness, and it restricts certain asset sales. Payments of dividends for the SeriesA Preferred are only restricted by the EBITDA to interest coverage ratio, wherein such dividends are a 1X deduction from EBITDA as opposed to a 3:1requirement if dividends were treated as interest expense. The Credit Agreement contains customary events of default. If an event of default occurs and is continuing, the Lender may declare any amounts outstanding under the Credit Agreement to be immediately due and payable.As of June30, 2015and 2014, the Company had noborrowings and nooutstanding letters of credit issued under the facility, resulting in an available borrowing base capacity of $5,000,000, and we are in compliance with all the covenants of the Credit Agreement. During early 2014 the Lender waived the provisions of the Credit Agreement pertaining to the past payments 54Table of ContentsEVOLUTION PETROLEUM CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIESNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Continuedof cash dividends on our common stock, and the Credit Agreement was amended to permit the payment of cash dividends on common stock in the future if no borrowings are outstanding at the time of such payment.In connection with this agreement the Company incurred $179,468of debt issuance costs, which have been capitalized in Other Assets and are being amortized on a straight-line basis over the term of the agreement. The unamortized balance in debt issuance costs related to the Credit Agreement was $32,411as of June 30, 2015. The Company is in discussions with the Lender and other financial institutions to replace the unsecured Credit Agreement with an expanded secured facility. As of June30, 2015, the Company had incurred approximately $157,610in legal and title costs related to this proposed new agreement, which are also capitalized in Other Assets.Note17Commitments and ContingenciesWe are subject to various claims and contingencies in the normal course of business. In addition, from time to time, we receive communications from government or regulatory agencies concerning investigations or allegations of noncompliance with laws or regulations in jurisdictions in which we operate. At a minimum we disclose such matters if we believe it is reasonably possible that a future event or events will confirm a loss through impairment of an asset or the incurrence of a liability. We accrue a loss if we believe it is probable that a future event or events will confirm a loss and we can reasonably estimate such loss and we do not accrue future legal costs related to that loss. Furthermore, we will disclose any matter that is unasserted if we consider it probable that a claim will be asserted and there is a reasonable possibility that the outcome will be unfavorable. We expense legal defense costs as they are incurred.The Company and its wholly-owned subsidiary NGS Sub Corp. are defendants in a lawsuit brought by John C. McCarthy et al in the fifth District Court of Richland Parish, Louisiana in July 2011. The plaintiffs alleged, among other claims, that we fraudulently and wrongfully purchased plaintiffs income royalty rights in the Delhi Field Unit in the Holt-Bryant Reservoir in May 2006. The plaintiffs are seeking cancellation of the transaction and monetary damages. On March 29, 2012, the Fifth District Court dismissed the case against the Company and NGS Sub Corp. The Court found that plaintiffs had no cause of action under Louisiana law, assuming that the Plaintiffs claims were valid on their face. Plaintiffs filed an appeal and the Louisiana Second Circuit Court of Appeal affirmed the dismissal, but allowed the plaintiffs to amend their petition to state a different possible cause of action. The plaintiffs amended their claim and re-filed with the district court. We subsequently filed a second motion pleading no cause of action, with which the district court again agreed and dismissed the plaintiffs case on September 23, 2013. Plaintiffs again filed an appeal in November 2013. In October 2014, the appellate court reversed the district court. We subsequently filed for a rehearing which was denied. We now have filed an Application for Writ of Review in the Louisiana Supreme Court in which we have asked the Louisiana Supreme Court to reverse the appellate court and reinstate the trial court judgment dismissing plaintiffs case. Amicus Curiae Briefs have been filed in support of the writ application by the Louisiana Oil Gas Association, the Louisiana Mid-Continent Oil and Gas Association and the American Association of Professional Landmen. Our brief and supporting Amicus Curiae Briefs have been filed. Oral arguments were heard on September 1, 2015. Counsel has advised us that, based on developments in the case to date, the risk of a material loss in this matter is remote.As previously reported, on August 23, 2012, we and our wholly-owned subsidiary, NGS Sub Corp., and Robert S. Herlin, our Chief Executive Officer, were served with a lawsuit filed in federal court by James H. and Kristy S. Jones the Jones lawsuit in the Western District Court of the Monroe Division, Louisiana. The plaintiffs alleged primarily that we defendants wrongfully purchased the plaintiffs 48119%overriding royalty interest in the Delhi Unit in January 2006 by failing to divulge the existence of an alleged previous agreement to develop the Delhi Field for enhanced oil recovery. The plaintiffs were seeking rescission of the assignment of the overriding royalty interest and monetary damages. We believed that the claims were without merit and not timely, and we vigorously defended against the claims. We filed a motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12b 6 on April 1, 2013. On September 17, 2013, the federal court in the Western District Court of the Monroe Division, Louisiana, dismissed a portion of the claims and allowed the plaintiffs to pursue the remaining portion of the claims. Our motion to dismiss was for lack of cause of action, assuming that the plaintiffs' claims were valid on their face. On September 25, 2013, plaintiff Jones filed a motion to alter or amend the September 17, 2013 judgment. On December 27, 2013, the court denied said plaintiffs motion, and on January 21, 2014, we filed a motion to reconsider the nondismissal of the remaining claims, which was denied. The Court entered a Scheduling Order setting trial of the case for the week of June 15, 2015. Subsequent to depositions of the plaintiffs, in late March 2015, in the United States District Court for the Western District of Louisiana Monroe Division, a joint motion to dismiss with prejudice was entered into by all parties in the lawsuit and the judge signed the judgment of dismissal with prejudice. Further, no compensation or other consideration was paid or provided to the plaintiffs by any of the defendants other than an agreement by us not to sue for 55Table of ContentsEVOLUTION PETROLEUM CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIESNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Continuedmalicious prosecution or defamation, or seek sanctions, and the plaintiffs agreed to relinquish any and all claims to the 48119%overriding royalty interest in the Delhi Unit.On December 13, 2013, we and our wholly-owned subsidiaries, Tertiaire Resources Company and NGS Sub. Corp., filed a lawsuit in the 133rdJudicial District Court of Harris County, Texas, against Denbury Onshore, LLC Denbury alleging breaches of certain 2006 agreements between the parties regarding the Delhi Field in Richland Parish, Louisiana. The specific allegations include improperly charging the payout account for capital expenditures and costs of capital, failure to adhere to preferential rights to participate in acquisitions within the defined area of mutual interest, breach of the promises to assume environmental liabilities and fully indemnify us from such costs, and other breaches. We also alleged that Denburys gross negligence caused certain environmental damage to the unit. Specifically, we allege that Denbury failed to properly conduct CO2injection activities.We are seeking declaration of the validity of the 2006 agreements and recovery of damages and attorneys fees. Denbury subsequently filed counterclaims, including the assertion that we owe Denbury additional revenue interests pursuant to the 2006 agreements and that our transfers of the reversionary interests from our wholly owned subsidiary to our parent corporation and subsequently to another wholly-owned subsidiary were not timely noticed to Denbury. We subsequently amended and expanded our claims. The Company disagrees with, and is vigorously defending against, Denbury counterclaims. This matter is scheduled for trial in April of 2016.On January 26, 2015, Denbury notified us it had withheld and suspended 2891545%of our overriding royalty revenue interest in the field for the months of November and December 2014. This unilateral suspension of a portion of our overriding royalties by the operator was made without consultation with the Company and, we believe, was without legal basis. On February 26, 2015, we and Denbury executed an agreement under which Denbury agreed to reverse the previously disclosed suspension of our overriding royalty interest revenues and release to Evolution amounts previously suspended totaling approximately $712,000. Denbury further agreed not to suspend any future revenues attributable to any of our revenue interests, except under limited circumstances, such as non-payment of joint interest billings. This agreement did not settle any of the outstanding litigation matters with Denbury, including their counterclaim related to the net revenue interest conveyed in the 2006 Purchase and Sale Agreement. Lease Commitments.We have a non-cancelable operating lease for office space that expires on July 31, 2016. Future minimum lease commitments as of June30, 2015under this operating lease are as follows:For the fiscal year ended June  expense for the years ended June30, 2015, 2014, and 2013was $175,103, $174,229, and $147,233, respectively.Employment Contracts.We have entered into employment agreements with twoof the Company senior executives. The employment contracts provide for severance payments in the event of termination by the Company for any reason other than cause or permanent disability, or in the event of a constructive termination, as defined. The agreements provide for the payment of base pay and certain medical and disability benefits for periods ranging form 6 monthsto 1 yearafter termination. The total contingent obligations under the employment contracts as of June30, 2015was approximately $473,000.Note18Concentrations of Credit RiskMajor Customers.We market all of our oil and natural gas production from the properties we operate. We do not currently market our share of crude oil production from Delhi. Although we have the right to take our working interest production at Delhi in-kind, we are currently accepting terms under the Delhi operator agreement with Plains Marketing L.P. for the delivery and pricing of our oil there. The majority of our operated gas, oil and condensate production is sold to a variety of purchasers under short-term less than 12 months contracts at market-based prices. The following table identifies customers from whom we derived 10 percent or more our net oil and natural gas revenues during the years ended June30, 2015, 2014, and 2013. The loss of our purchaser at the Delhi field or disruption to pipeline transportation from the field could adversely affect our net realized pricing and potentially our near-term production levels.

We currently match 100%of employees' contributions to the plan, to a maximum of the first 6%of each participant compensation, with Company contributions fully vested when made. Our matching contributions to the Savings Plan totaled $85,676, $116,873, and $89,810for the years ended June30, 2015, 2014, and 2013,  early June 2015, the Company began using derivative instruments to reduce its exposure to oil price volatility for a substantial portion of its forecasted production for the months of July 2015 through December 2015 to achieve a more predictable level of cash flows to support the Companys capital expenditure program. The costless collars the Company uses to manage risk are designed to establish floor and ceiling prices on anticipated future oil production. While the use of these derivative instruments limits the downside risk of adverse price movements, they may also limit future revenues from favorable price movements. The Company does not enter into derivative instruments for speculative or trading purposes.These derivative instruments can result in both fair value asset and liability positions held with that counterparty, which positions are all offset to a single fair value asset or liability at the end of each reporting period. The Company nets its fair value amounts of derivative instruments executed with the same counterparty pursuant to ISDA master agreements, which provide for net settlement over the term of the contract and in the event of default or termination of the contract. The fair value of derivative instruments where the Company is in a net liability position with its counterparty as of June30, 2015totaled $109,974. Refer to Note21Fair Value Measurement for derivative asset and derivative liability balances before offsetting.The Company monitors the credit rating of its counterparty, Cargill, Incorporated, and believes it does not have significant credit risk. Accordingly, we do not currently require our counterparty to post collateral to support the net asset positions of our derivative instruments. As such, the Company is exposed to credit risk to the extent of nonperformance by the counterparty to its derivative instruments.The Company collateral obligations are met by a credit line of $5,000,000provided by the counterparty during the first ninety days of the agreement and thereafter by the Company which is seeking a secured facility to fund collateral obligations.For the year ended June30, 2015, the Company recorded in the consolidated statement of operations a loss on unsettled derivatives, net of $109,974.The following sets forth a summary of the Companys crude oil derivative positions at average NYMEX WTI prices as of June30, 201557Table of ContentsEVOLUTION PETROLEUM CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIESNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS ContinuedPeriodType of ContractVolumes in Bbls./dayWeighted Average Floor Price per Bbl.Weighted Average Ceiling Price per Bbl.Weighted Average Collar Spread per Bbl.Months of July 2015 through December 2015Costless  to June30, 2015, the Company realized gains of $138,787and $412,985on derivative contracts expiring in July 2015 and August 2015, respectively.Note21Fair Value MeasurementAccounting guidelines for measuring fair value establish a three-level valuation hierarchy for disclosure of fair value measurements. The valuation hierarchy categorizes assets and liabilities measured at fair value into one of three different levels depending on the observability of the inputs employed in the measurement.The three levels are defined as follows:Level1Observable inputs such as quoted prices in active markets at the measurement date for identical, unrestricted assets or liabilities.Level2Other inputs that are observable directly or indirectly such as quoted prices in markets that are not active, or inputs which are observable, either directly or indirectly, for substantially the full term of the asset or liability.Level3Unobservable inputs for which there is little or no market data and which the Company makes its own assumptions about how market participants would price the assets and liabilities.Fair Value of Derivative Instruments.The following table summarize the location and amounts of the Companys assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis as presented in the consolidated balance sheets as of June30, 2015.

The fair values are also compared to the values provided by the counterparty for reasonableness and are adjusted for the counterparty credit quality for derivative assets and the Companys credit quality for derivative liabilities. To date, adjustments for credit quality have not had a material impact on the fair values.Note22Supplemental Disclosures about Oil and Natural Gas Producing Properties unauditedCosts incurred for oil and natural gas property acquisition, exploration and development activitiesThe following table summarizes costs incurred and capitalized in oil and natural gas property acquisition, exploration and development activities. Property acquisition costs are those costs incurred to lease property, including both undeveloped leasehold and the purchase of reserves in place. Exploration costs include costs of identifying areas that may warrant examination and examining specific areas that are considered to have prospects containing oil and natural gas reserves, including costs of drilling exploratory wells, geological and geophysical costs and carrying costs on undeveloped properties. Development costs are incurred to obtain access to proved reserves, including the cost of drilling. Exploration and development costs also include amounts incurred due to the recognition of asset retirement obligations of $576,039, $66,976and $65,575during the years ended June30, 2015, 2014, and 2013, respectively58Table of ContentsEVOLUTION PETROLEUM CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIESNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS ContinuedFor the Years Ended June 30,201520142013Oil and natural gas activitiesProperty acquisition costs:Proved property 26,449Unproved    costs incurred for oil and natural gas  Net Quantities of Proved Oil and Natural Gas ReservesThe following estimates of the net proved oil and natural gas reserves of our oil and gas properties located entirely within the United States of America are based on evaluations prepared by third-party reservoir engineers. Reserve volumes and values were determined under the method prescribed by the SEC for our fiscal years ended June30, 2015, 2014, and 2013, which requires the application of the previous 12 monthsunweighted arithmetic average first-day-of-the-month price, and current costs held constant throughout the projected reserve life, when estimating whether reserve quantities are economical to produce.Proved oil and natural gas reserves are estimated quantities of crude oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids that geological and engineering data demonstrate with reasonable certainty to be recoverable in future years from known reservoirs under existing economic and operating conditions. Proved developed oil and natural gas reserves are reserves that can be expected to be recovered through existing wells with existing equipment and operating methods. There are uncertainties inherent in estimating quantities of proved oil and natural gas reserves, projecting future production rates, and timing of development expenditures. Accordingly, reserve estimates often differ from the quantities of oil and natural gas that are ultimately recovered59Table of ContentsEVOLUTION PETROLEUM CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIESNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS ContinuedEstimated quantities of proved oil and natural gas reserves and changes in quantities of proved developed and undeveloped reserves for each of the periods indicated were as follows:Crude OilBblsNatural GasLiquidsBblsNatural GasMcfBOEProved developed and undeveloped reserves:June 30,  of previous estimates  of minerals in  sales  30,  of previous estimates  recovery, extensions and  of minerals in  sales  30,  of previous estimates  recovery, extensions and discoveriesSales of minerals in placeProduction sales  30,  developed reserves:June 30,  30,  30,  30,  undeveloped reserves:June 30,  30,  30,  30,  A significant upward reserve revision occurred in the Delhi Field during fiscal 2013 as a result of 1 revised geological maps based on production results and acquired seismic data, 2 inclusion of an additional reservoir with similar features, production history and suitability for EOR, and 3 inclusion of natural gas processing at Delhi.b Significant reserve revisions occurred in the Delhi Field during fiscal 2014. As a result of an adverse fluid release event in the Field, 1,817,224BBLs of oil reserves were reclassified from proved to probable category based on the operator decision to defer CO2injections in certain parts of the Field. There was a positive revision of 1,679,481BOE, which was comprised of 1,275,178BBLs of natural gas liquids and 2,425,821MCF of natural gas as a result of an improved design for the gas plant in the Delhi Field. The plant is expected to significantly increase recoveries of these products, particularly natural gas, which was not previously planned to be extracted from the injection volumes.c The 2,894,703negative fiscal 2015 revision for natural gas primarily reflects a 2,246,524MCF negative revision for the Delhi Field gas plant together with a 452,786MCF negative revision at the Giddings Field for a well that was lost due to excessive formation solids that kept interfering with pumping. The gas plant revision resulted from a decision during the current fiscal year to use the methane production internally to reduce field operating costs rather than selling it into the market. The 156,195BBL positive natural gas liquids revision primarily reflects 185,499BBL positive revision for better recovery from the redesigned gas plant, partly offset by a 29,304BBL negative revision due to the lost Giddings well60Table of ContentsEVOLUTION PETROLEUM CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIESNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS ContinuedStandardized Measure of Discounted Future Net Cash Flows Future oil and natural gas sales and production and development costs have been estimated using prices and costs in effect at the end of the years indicated, as required by ASC 932, Disclosures about Oil and Gas Producing ActivitiesASC 932. ASC 932 requires that net cash flow amounts be discounted at 10%. Future production and development costs are computed by estimating the expenditures to be incurred in developing and producing our proved oil and natural gas reserves assuming continuation of existing economic conditions. Future income tax expenses are computed by applying the appropriate period-end statutory tax rates to the future pretax net cash flow relating to our proved oil and natural gas reserves, less the tax basis of the related properties. The future income tax expenses do not give effect to tax credits, allowances, or the impact of general and administrative costs of ongoing operations relating to the Company proved oil and natural gas reserves. Changes in the demand for oil and natural gas, inflation, and other factors make such estimates inherently imprecise and subject to substantial revision. The table below should not be construed to be an estimate of the current market value of our proved reserves.The standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows related to proved oil and natural gas reserves as of June30, 2015, 2014, and 2013are as follows:For the Years Ended June 30,201520142013Future cash  production costs and severance  development  income tax  net cash  annual discount for estimated timing of cash  measure of discounted future net cash  cash inflows represent expected revenues from production of period-end quantities of proved reserves based on the previous 12 monthsunweighted arithmetic average first-day-of-the-month commodity prices for each year and reflect adjustments for lease quality, transportation fees, energy content and regional price differentials.Year Ended June  prices used in determining future cash  NGL price utilized for future cash inflows was based on the historical price received.A summary of the changes in the standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows applicable to proved crude oil, natural gas liquids, and natural gas reserves is as follows:61Table of ContentsEVOLUTION PETROLEUM CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIESNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS ContinuedFor the Years Ended June 30,201520142013Balance, beginning of  changes in sales prices and production costs related to future  in estimated future development  of oil and gas produced during the period, net of production  change due to extensions, discoveries, and improved recovery775,574Net change due to revisions in quantity  change due to sales of minerals in  costs incurred during the  of  change in discounted income  changes in timing of production and other  end of  Due to the June 2013 adverse fluid release event in the Delhi Field, the operator had expressed plans to produce the Delhi Field at lower production rates.
