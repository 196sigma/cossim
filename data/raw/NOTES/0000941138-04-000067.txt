ITEM 8. -- CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA
- 
See  for a list of the Consolidated Financial Statements that
are included in the following pages. See Note 20 of the Notes to Consolidated
Financial Statements.                    K-68             Report of Independent Auditors To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of
UniSource Energy Corporation and to the
Board of Directors and Stockholders of
Tucson Electric Power Company
In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements listed in the index
appearing under a1 present fairly, in all material respects, the
financial position of UniSource Energy Corporation and its subsidiaries the
Company and Tucson Electric Power Company and its subsidiaries TEP at
December 31, 2003 and 2002, and the results of their operations and their cash
flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2003 in
conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of
America. In addition, in our opinion, the financial statement schedule listed in
the index appearing under a2 presents fairly, in all material
respects, the information set forth therein when read in conjunction with the
related consolidated financial statements. These financial statements and
financial statement schedule are the responsibility of the Company and TEP
management; our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial
statements and financial statement schedule based on our audits. We conducted
our audits of these statements in accordance with auditing standards generally
accepted in the United States of America, which require that we plan and perform
the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements
are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis,
evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements,
assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by
management, and evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We
believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
As discussed in Note 5 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company and
TEP changed the manner in which they account for asset retirement costs as of
January 1, 2003. As discussed in Note 7 to the consolidated financial
statements, the Company and TEP changed their method of accounting for
derivative instruments as of January 1, 2001. PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP

UNISOURCE ENERGY, TEP AND SUBSIDIARIES
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
- 
NOTE 1. NATURE OF OPERATIONS AND SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
- 
NATURE OF OPERATIONS
UniSource Energy Corporation UniSource Energy is an exempt holding
company under the Public Utility Holding Company Act of 1935. UniSource Energy
has no significant operations of its own, but owns substantially all of the
common stock of Tucson Electric Power Company TEP and all of the common stock
of UniSource Energy Services, Inc. UES, Millennium Energy Holdings, Inc.
Millennium and UniSource Energy Development Company UED.
TEP, a regulated public utility incorporated in Arizona since 1963, is
UniSource Energy largest operating subsidiary and represented approximately
86% of UniSource Energy assets as of December 31, 2003. TEP generates,
transmits and distributes electricity. TEP serves more than 367,000 retail
electric customers in a 1,155 square mile area in Southern Arizona. TEP also
sells electricity to other utilities and power marketing entities primarily
located in the western U.S.
On August 11, 2003, UniSource Energy completed the purchase of the Arizona
gas and electric system assets from Citizens Communications Company Citizens
and established UES to hold such assets. UES' businesses are described in Note
3.
Millennium unregulated businesses are described in Note 8 and UED
services are described in Note 6.
References to we and our are to UniSource Energy and its subsidiaries,
collectively.
BASIS OF PRESENTATION
On January 1, 1998, TEP and UniSource Energy exchanged all the outstanding
common stock of TEP on a share-for-share basis for the common stock of
UniSource Energy. Following the share exchange, in January 1998 TEP transferred
the stock of Millennium to UniSource Energy for a $95 million ten-year
promissory note. Approximately $25 million of this note represents a gain to
TEP. TEP has not and will not record this gain. Instead, this gain will be
reflected as an increase in TEP common stock equity when UniSource Energy
pays the principal portion of the note which is required to be paid in 2008. In
accordance with the Arizona Corporation Commission ACC order authorizing the
formation of the holding company, the note bears interest at 978% payable
every two years beginning January 1, 2000. For the interest payment due January
1, 2004, UniSource Energy paid TEP $20 million in December 2003. We expect that
this intercompany note will be repaid in full in connection with the proposed
acquisition of UniSource Energy. See Note 2.
We used the following accounting methods to report investments in
subsidiaries or other companies   - CONSOLIDATION: The consolidation method is used where a majority of the
voting stock of a subsidiary is held and control over the subsidiary is
exercised. The accounts of the subsidiary are combined with the accounts of the
parent and intercompany balances and transactions are eliminated.
- THE EQUITY METHOD: The equity method is used to report corporate joint
ventures, partnerships, and affiliated company investments when the ability to
exercise significant influence over the operating and financial policies of an
investee company is demonstrated. The equity method is typically used when 20%
to 50% of the voting interest is held. Under the equity method    - The investment appears on a single line item on the balance sheet; and
- The net income loss from the entity is reflected in Other Income on
the income statements. For investments where UniSource Energy, TEP, UES or
Millennium is committed to providing all of the financing, they recognize 100%
of the losses see Note 8.
- THE COST METHOD: The cost method is used when not enough shares are owned
to exercise significant influence over an investee company. Typically the cost
method is used for investments of less than 20% of the voting interest in an
investee company. Under the cost method                    K-80    - The investment appears on a single line item on the balance sheet; and
- Income from investee dividend distributions is reflected as Other
Income on the income statements; and - Loss is included in Other Income
on the income statements when impairment of the value of the investment
becomes evident.
USE OF ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES
Management makes estimates and assumptions when preparing financial
statements under accounting principles generally accepted in the United States
of America GAAP. These estimates and assumptions affect   - A portion of the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the dates
of the financial statements; - Our disclosures regarding contingent assets
and liabilities at the dates of the financial statements; and - A portion
of the reported revenues and expenses during the financial statement
reporting periods.
Because these estimates involve judgments, the actual amounts may differ
from the estimates.
ACCOUNTING FOR RATE REGULATION
The ACC and the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission FERC regulate
portions of TEP and UES' utility accounting practices and electric rates. The
ACC has authority over certain rates charged to retail customers, the issuance
of securities, and transactions with affiliated parties. The FERC regulates
TEP and UES' rates for wholesale power sales and transmission services.
TEP and UES generally use the same accounting policies and practices used
by unregulated companies for financial reporting under GAAP. However, sometimes
these principles, such as the Financial Accounting Standards Board FASB
Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 71, Accounting for the Effects
of Certain Types of Regulation FAS 71, require special accounting treatment
for regulated companies to show the effect of regulation. For example, in
setting TEP and UES' retail rates, the ACC may not allow TEP or UES to
currently charge their customers to recover certain expenses, but instead may
require that these expenses be charged to customers in the future. In this
situation, FAS 71 requires that TEP and UES defer these items and show them as
regulatory assets on the balance sheet until TEP and UES are allowed to charge
their customers. TEP and UES then amortize these items as expense to the income
statement as those charges are recovered from customers. Similarly, certain
revenue item s may be deferred as regulatory liabilities, which are also
eventually amortized to the income statement as rates to customers are reduced.
The conditions a regulated company must satisfy to apply the accounting
policies and practices of FAS 71 include   - an independent regulator sets rates;
- the regulator sets the rates to recover specific costs of delivering
service; and the service territory lacks competitive pressures to reduce rates
below the rates set by the regulator.
CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS
UniSource Energy and TEP define Cash and Cash Equivalents as cash
unrestricted demand deposits and all highly liquid investments purchased with
an original maturity of three months or less.
UTILITY PLANT
TEP reports its utility plant on its balance sheets at cost. UES reports
the utility plant of its two operating companies, UNS Gas and UNS Electric, at
cost. Utility plant includes   - Material and labor costs,
- Contractor costs,
- Construction overhead costs where applicable, and
- An Allowance for Funds Used During Construction AFUDC or capitalized
interest during construction.
K-81   AFUDC reflects the cost of financing construction for transmission and
distribution projects with borrowed and equity funds.
TEP imputed the cost of capital on transmission and distribution
construction expenditures at an average of 843% in 2003, 840% in 2002 and
846% in 2001, to reflect the cost of using borrowed and equity funds to finance
construction. The component of AFUDC attributable to borrowed funds is included
as a reduction of Other Interest Expense on the income statement and totaled $1
million in 2003, 2002 and 2001. The equity component is included in Other Income
and totaled $1 million in 2003, 2002 and 2001.
The interest capitalized during construction of TEP generation-related
construction projects is included as a reduction of Other Interest Expense on
the income statement and totaled $1 million in 2003, $05 million in 2002 and $1
million in 2001. The average capitalized interest rate during construction
applied to generation-related construction expenditures was 414% in 2003, 426%
in 2002 and 493% in 2001.
For the period August 11, 2003 through December 31, 2003, UES imputed the
cost of capital on construction expenditures at an average of 873% for UNS
Electric and 785% for UNS Gas. The component of AFUDC attributable to borrowed
funds is included as a reduction of Other Interest Expense on the income
statement and totaled $02 million in 2003. The equity component is included in
Other Income and totaled $02 million in 2003.
Depreciation
TEP and UES compute depreciation for owned utility plant on a straight-line
basis at rates based on the economic lives of the assets. See Note 9. The
depreciation rates are approved by the ACC for all plant except TEP
deregulated generation assets. The depreciable lives for TEP generation plant
are based on remaining useful lives. Changes made to the depreciable lives of
TEP generation plant are discussed in Note 9. The depreciation rates for
generation plant reflect interim retirements. Interim retirements of generation
plant, together with removal costs less salvage, are charged to accumulated
depreciation. The costs of planned major maintenance activities are recorded as
the costs are actually incurred and are not accrued in advance of the planned
maintenance. Planned major maintenance activities include the scheduled
overhauls at TEP generation plants. Minor replacements and repairs are
expensed as incurred.
The depreciable lives for transmission, distribution, general and
intangible plant are based on average lives. The rates reflect estimated removal
costs, net of estimated salvage value for interim retirements. Retirements of
transmission plant, distribution plant, general plant and intangible plant,
together with the cost of removal less salvage, are charged to accumulated
depreciation. As of December 31, 2003, the net cost of removal of interim
retirements for transmission, distribution, general and intangible plant have
been reclassified from accumulated depreciation to a regulatory liability and
prior period amounts have been reclassified to conform to this presentation.
The average annual depreciation rates for TEP utility plant were 378% in
2003, 401% in 2002, and 388% in 2001. The average annual depreciation rates
for UES' utility plant for the period of August 11, 2003 through December 31,
2003 were 388% for UNS Electric and 147% for UNS Gas.
Computer Software Costs
TEP and UES capitalize all costs incurred to purchase computer software and
amortize those costs over the estimated economic life of the product.
Capitalized computer software costs would be immediately charged to expense if
the software is determined to be no longer useful. TEP amortization of
capitalized computer software costs was $6 million in 2003, 2002 and 2001.
K-82   TEP Utility Plant under Capital Leases
TEP financed the following generation assets with capital leases   - Springerville Common Facilities, - Springerville Unit 1, - Springerville
Coal Handling Facilities, and - Sundt Irvington Unit 4.
The following table shows the amount of lease expense incurred for TEP
generation-related capital leases. We describe the lease terms in TEP Capital

MILLENNIUM AND UED PROPERTIES AND EQUIPMENT
Millennium and UED properties and equipment are included, net of
accumulated depreciation, in UniSource Energy balance sheets in the
Investments and Other Property-Other line item. Properties and equipment are
stated at original cost and are depreciated using the straight-line method over
the estimated useful lives of the assets. Maintenance, repairs and minor
renewals are charged to expense as incurred, while major renewals and
betterments are capitalized.
DEBT
We defer costs related to the issuance of debt. These costs include
underwriters' commissions, discounts or premiums, and other costs such as legal,
accounting and regulatory fees and printing costs. We amortize these costs over
the life of the debt using the straight-line method, which approximates the
effective interest method.
TEP recognizes gains and losses on reacquired debt associated with the
generation portion of TEP operations as incurred. TEP defers and amortizes the
gains and losses on reacquired debt associated with TEP regulated operations
to interest income or interest expense over the remaining life of the original
debt.
UTILITY OPERATING REVENUES
TEP and UES record utility operating revenues when services are provided or
commodities are delivered to customers. Operating revenues include unbilled
revenues which are earned service has been provided but not billed by the end
of an accounting period.
An Allowance for Doubtful Accounts is recorded as an expense and reduces
accounts receivable for revenue amounts that are estimated to become
uncollectible. TEP Allowance for Doubtful Accounts was $11 million at December
31, 2003 and $9 million at 2002. See Note 13 for further discussion of TEP
wholesale accounts receivable and allowances. UES' Allowance for Doubtful
Accounts was $04 million at December 31, 2003.
K-83  REVENUE FROM LONG-TERM RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT CONTRACTS
UniSource Energy income statements have included Global Solar long-term
contract revenue in Other Operating Revenues since Global Solar was consolidated
on June 1, 2000. Global Solar recognized long-term contract revenue of
approximately $1 million in 2003, $1 million in 2002 and $2 million in 2001.
Global Solar recognized total annual research and development expense of
approximately $7 million in 2003 and 2002, and $9 million in 2001. These
expenses include both costs associated with revenue producing contracts and
internal development costs. Global Solar derives much of its revenue from
funding received under research and development contracts with various U.S.
governmental agencies. Revenues on these contracts are recognized as follows   - COST REIMBURSEMENT CONTRACTS - Revenue is recognized as costs are
incurred;
- COST PLUS FIXED FEE CONTRACTS - Revenues are recognized using the
percentage of completion method of accounting by relating contract costs
incurred to date to total contract costs; and - FIXED FEE CONTRACTS -
Revenues are recognized when applicable milestones are met.
Contract costs include direct material, direct labor and overhead costs.
FUEL AND PURCHASED ENERGY COSTS
TEP
Fuel inventory, primarily coal, is recorded at weighted average cost. TEP
uses full absorption costing. Under full absorption costing, all handling and
procurement costs are included in the cost of the inventory. Examples of these
costs are direct material, direct labor and overhead costs. TEP has long-term
contracts for the purchase and transportation of coal with expiration dates from
2006 through 2020. The contracts require TEP to pay a take-or-pay fee if certain
minimum quantities of coal are not purchased or transported. TEP expenses such
fees as they are incurred. See Fuel Purchase and Transportation Commitments in
Note 15, below. Fuel costs include coal mine reclamation expenses as they are
charged to TEP on an ongoing basis.
UES
UNS Electric defers differences between purchased energy costs and the
recovery of such costs in revenues. Future billings are adjusted for such
deferrals through use of a Purchased Power and Fuel Adjustment Clause PPFAC
approved by the ACC. The PPFAC allows for a revenue surcharge or surcredit that
adjusts the customer base rate for delivered purchased power to collect or
return under or over recovery of costs. At December 31, 2003, UNS Electric had a
liability of $05 million for over recovered purchased power costs that is
included in Deferred Credits and Other Liabilities - Other on UniSource Energy
consolidated balance sheet.
UNS Gas defers differences between actual gas purchase costs and the
recovery of such costs in revenues under a Purchase Gas Adjustor PGA
mechanism. The PGA mechanism is intended to address the volatility of natural
gas prices and allows UNS Gas to recover its costs through a price adjustor. The
PGA charge may be changed monthly based on an ACC approved mechanism that
compares the twelve-month rolling average gas cost to the base cost of gas,
subject to limitations on how much the price per therm may change in a twelve
month period. The difference between the actual cost of UNS Gas' gas supplies
and transportation contracts and that currently allowed by the ACC is deferred
and recovered or repaid through the PGA mechanism. When under or over recovery
trigger points are met, UNS Gas may request a PGA surcharge or surcredit with
the goal of collecting or returning the amount deferred from or to customers
over a twelve month period. At December 31, 2003, UNS Gas had a $32 million
asset for under rec overed purchased gas costs that is included in Current
Regulatory Assets on UniSource Energy consolidated balance sheet.
INCOME TAXES
We are required by GAAP to report some of our assets and liabilities
differently for our financial statements than we do for income tax purposes. The
tax effects of differences in these items are reported as deferred income tax
assets or liabilities in our balance sheets. We measure these tax assets and
liabilities using income tax rates that are currently in effect. Federal
Investment Tax Credits ITC as well as applicable state income tax credits are
accounted for as a reduction of income tax expense in the year in which the
credit arises.
K-84   We allocate income taxes to the subsidiaries based on their taxable income
and deductions as reported in the consolidated and/or combined tax return
filings.
EMISSIONS ALLOWANCES
Emissions Allowances are issued to qualifying utilities by the
Environmental Protection Agency EPA based on past operational history. Each
allowance permits emission of one ton of sulfur dioxide SO2 in its vintage
year or a subsequent year. These allowances have no book value for accounting
purposes but may be sold if TEP does not need them for operations. TEP also may
purchase additional allowances if needed. See Note 15. TEP did not sell any
excess allowances in 2003. In 2002, TEP sold 4,000 allowances that were in
excess of those required for compliance to Millennium Environmental Group, Inc.
MEG at their fair market value of $05 million. This intercompany sale was
eliminated in UniSource Energy consolidation. MEG subsequently sold these
allowances to a third party.
DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS
TEP enters into forward contracts to purchase or sell a specified amount of
capacity or energy at a specified price over a given period of time, typically
for one month, three months, or one year, within established limits to take
advantage of favorable market opportunities. The majority of TEP forward
contracts are considered to be normal purchases and sales and, therefore, are
not required to be marked to market. However, some of these forward contracts
are considered to be derivatives, which TEP marks to market by recording
unrealized gains and losses and adjusting the related assets and liabilities on
a monthly basis to reflect the market prices at the end of the month.
UNS Gas and UNS Electric do not currently have any contracts that are
required to be marked to market.
MEG enters into swap agreements, options and forward contracts relating to
Emissions Allowances and coal. MEG marks its trading contracts to market by
recording unrealized gains and losses and adjusting the related assets and
liabilities on a monthly basis to reflect the market prices at the end of the
month.
STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION
At December 31, 2003, UniSource Energy had two stock-based compensation
plans, which are described in Note 18. We account for those plans under the
recognition and measurement principles of APB Opinion No. 25, Accounting for
Stock Issued to Employees APB 25, and related interpretations.
Our stock options are granted with an exercise price equal to the market
value of the stock at the date of the grant. Accordingly, no compensation
expense is recorded for these awards. However, compensation expense is
recognized for restricted stock, stock unit, and performance share awards over
the performance/vesting period.
The following table illustrates the effect on UniSource Energy net income
and earnings per share and TEP net income had we applied the fair value

K-86  NEW ACCOUNTING STANDARDS
The FASB recently issued the following Statements of Financial Accounting
Standards FAS and FASB Interpretations FIN   - FIN 46, Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities, was issued in
January 2003, and was subsequently revised in December 2003. The guidance
addresses when a company should include in its financial statements the assets
and liabilities of another entity. The primary objectives of FIN 46 are to
provide guidance on the identification of entities for which control is
achieved through means other than through voting rights variable interest
entities and to determine when and which business enterprises should
consolidate the variable interest entity primary beneficiary. FIN 46 requires
that both the primary beneficiary and all other enterprises with a significant
variable interest make additional disclosures. For public companies, the
revised FIN 46 is effective for financial periods ending after March 15, 2004.
Early application is permissible. Companies that implemented FIN 46 prior to
its revision may continue to apply that guidance until the implementation date
of the revision. The adoption of FIN 46 and revisions did not and are not
expected to have a significant impact on our financial statements.
- FAS 149, Amendment of Statement 133 on Derivative Instruments and Hedging
Activities, was issued by the FASB in April 2003. FAS 149 amends and clarifies
accounting for derivative instruments, including certain derivative instruments
embedded in other contracts, and for hedging activities under FAS 133. FAS 149
is effective for contracts entered into or modified after June 30, 2003, except
as stated below, and for hedging relationships designated after June 30, 2003.
The guidance is to be applied prospectively. The provisions of FAS 149 that
relate to FAS 133 Implementation Issues that have been in effect for fiscal
quarters that began prior to June 15, 2003 are to be applied in accordance with
their respective effective dates. The adoption of FAS 149 did not have a
significant impact on our financial statements.
- FAS 132, Employers' Disclosures about Pensions and Other Postretirement
Benefits revised 2003, was issued by the FASB in December 2003. FAS 132
requires additional disclosures about the assets, obligations, cash flows, and
net periodic benefit cost of defined benefit pension plans and other defined
benefit postretirement plans beyond those in the original Statement 132 which it
replaces. FAS 132, as revised, is effective for fiscal years ending after
December 15, 2003. The revised disclosure requirements are included in Note 16,
below.
The Emerging Issues Task Force EITF published Issue No. 01-08,
Determining Whether An Arrangement Contains a Lease EITF 01-08, in May 2003.
EITF 01-08 discusses how to determine whether an arrangement contains a lease
and states that the evaluation of whether an arrangement conveys the right to
use property, plant, or equipment should be based on the substance of an
arrangement and that the property that is the subject of a lease must be
specified explicitly or implicitly either at inception of the arrangement or
at the beginning of the lease term. EITF 01-08 is effective for arrangements
entered into or modified after July 1, 2003. Since July 1, 2003, we have not
entered into any new arrangements, or modified any arrangements that would fall
under this EITF.
In August 2003, the EITF also published Issue No. 03-11, Reporting Realized
Gains and Losses on Derivative Instruments That Are Subject to FASB Statement
No. 133, Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities, and Not
Held for Trading Purposes as Defined in EITF Issue No. 02-3 EITF 03-11. EITF
03-11 discusses whether realized gains and losses should be shown gross or net
in the income statement for contracts that are not held for trading purposes, as
defined in EITF 02-3, but are derivatives subject to FAS 133. Determining
whether realized gains and losses on derivative contracts not held for trading
purposes should be reported in the income statement on a gross or net basis is a
matter of judgment that depends on the relevant facts and circumstances with
respect to the various activities of the entity. Retroactive application of EITF
03-11 is not required. Therefore, any derivative instruments that are not held
for trading purposes but are subject to FAS 133 will be evaluated bas ed on this
new guidance and will be reported accordingly in the financial statements
beginning January 1, 2004.
K-87  RECLASSIFICATIONS
UniSource Energy and TEP have made reclassifications to the prior year
financial statements for comparative purposes. See Note 5, Note 7 and Note 21.
These reclassifications had no effect on net income.
NOTE 2. PROPOSED ACQUISITION OF UNISOURCE ENERGY
- 
On November 21, 2003, UniSource Energy and Saguaro Acquisition Corp., a
Delaware corporation, entered into an acquisition agreement, providing for the
acquisition of all of the common stock of UniSource Energy for $2525 per share
by an affiliate of Saguaro Utility Group L.P., an Arizona limited partnership
Saguaro Utility, whose general partner is Sage Mountain, L.L.C. and whose
limited partners include investment funds affiliated with Kohlberg Kravis
Roberts & Co., L.P., J.P. Morgan Partners, LLC and Wachovia Capital Partners.
Pursuant to the terms of the acquisition agreement, Saguaro Acquisition
Corp., will merge with and into UniSource Energy. UniSource Energy will be the
surviving corporation, but and will become an indirect wholly-owned subsidiary
of Saguaro Utility. Upon consummation of the acquisition, Saguaro Utility will
cause the surviving corporation to pay approximately $880 million in cash to
UniSource Energy shareholders and holders of stock options, stock units,
restricted stock and performance shares awarded under our performance
incentivestock based compensation plans.
UniSource Energy shareholders will formally consider a proposal to
approve the acquisition agreement at a meeting scheduled for March 29, 2004. We
expect the acquisition, which is subject to several conditions, including
receipt of certain regulatory approvals, to occur in the second half of 2004.
The acquisition agreement contains operating covenants with respect to the
operations of our business pending the consummation of the acquisition.
Generally, unless UniSource Energy obtains Saguaro Acquisition Corp. prior
written consent, we must carry on our business in the ordinary course consistent
with past practice and use all commercially reasonable efforts to preserve
substantially intact our present business organization and present regulatory,
business and employee relationships. In addition, the acquisition agreement
restricts our activities, subject to the receipt of Saguaro Acquisition Corp.
prior written consent, including the issuance or repurchase of capital stock,
the amendment of organizational documents, acquisitions and dispositions of
assets, capital expenditures, incurrence of indebtedness, modification of
employee compensation and benefits, changes in accounting methods, discharge of
liabilities, and matters relating to UniSource Energy investment in
Millennium.
Either UniSource Energy or Saguaro Acquisition Corp. may terminate the
acquisition agreement in certain circumstances, including if the acquisition is
not consummated by March 31, 2005, certain regulatory approvals are not obtained
or our shareholders fail to approve the transaction. In certain circumstances,
upon the termination of the acquisition agreement, UniSource Energy would be
required to pay Saguaro Acquisition Corp. expenses and a termination fee in an
aggregate amount of up to $25 million. See Note 15 for a description of
litigation related to the acquisition of UniSource Energy by Saguaro Acquisition
Corporation.
NOTE 3. ESTABLISHMENT OF UES
-    On August 11, 2003, UniSource Energy acquired the Arizona gas and electric
system assets from Citizens for $223 million, comprised of the base purchase
price plus other operating capital adjustments and transaction costs. This
acquisition added over 128,000 retail gas customers and 81,000 retail electric
customers in Arizona to UniSource Energy customer base as of December 31,
2003. UniSource Energy formed two new operating companies called UNS Gas, Inc.
UNS Gas and UNS Electric, Inc. UNS Electric to acquire these assets, as well
as an intermediate holding company, UES, to hold the common stock of UNS Gas and
UNS Electric. The operating results of UNS Gas, UNS Electric, and UES have been
included in UniSource Energy consolidated financial statements since the
acquisition date.
K-88   The purchase price and the allocation of the assets acquired and the
liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair market values as of the
acquisition date are as follows    Purchase Price:          -Thousands of Dollars-
Cash Paid                   $218,558
Transaction Costs                 4,872
Total Purchase Price             $223,430
Allocation of Purchase Price:   -Thousands of Dollars-
Property, Plant & Equipment          $228,001
Current Assets                  33,079
Regulatory Assets                  384
Other Assets                    580
Long-Term Debt                   487
Current Liabilities               31,142
Deferred Credits and Other Liabilities      6,985
Total Purchase Price             $223,430
RATES AND REGULATION
Concurrent with the closing of the acquisition, retail rate increases for
customers of both UNS Electric and UNS Gas went into effect on August 11, 2003.
These rate increases were approved by the ACC on July 3, 2003, when it approved
the acquisition and the terms of the April 1, 2003 settlement agreement UES
Settlement Agreement among UniSource Energy, Citizens, and the ACC Staff.
UNS Gas
UNS Gas is regulated by the ACC with respect to retail gas rates, the
issuance of securities, and transactions with affiliated parties. UNS Gas'
retail gas rates include a monthly customer charge, a base rate charge for
delivery services and the cost of gas expressed in cents per therm, and a PGA
mechanism.
The related ACC order and the UES Settlement Agreement include the
following terms related to UNS Gas rates   - An increase in retail delivery base rates, effective August 11, 2003,
equivalent to a 209% overall increase over 2001 test year retail revenues
through a base rate increase.
- Fair value rate base of $142 million and allowed rate of return of 749   based on a cost of capital of 905%, derived from a cost of equity of
1100% and a cost of debt of 775% based on a capital structure of 60%
debt and 40% equity. - The existing PGA rate may not change more than
$015 per therm through July 2004. Thereafter, the PGA rate may not change
more than $010 per therm.
Under the terms of the ACC order, UNS Gas may not file a general rate
increase until August 2006 and any resulting rate increase shall not become
effective prior to August 1, 2007.
The UES Settlement Agreement also limits dividends payable by UNS Gas to
UniSource Energy to 75% of earnings until the ratio of common equity to total
capitalization reaches 40%. The ratio of common equity to total capitalization
for UNS Gas is 35% at December 31, 2003.
On September 9, 2003, the ACC approved a new PGA surcharge of $01155 per
therm that took effect on October 1, 2003.
K-89   UNS Electric
UNS Electric is regulated by the ACC with respect to retail electric rates,
the issuance of securities, and transactions with affiliated parties, and by the
FERC with respect to wholesale power contracts and interstate transmission
service.
The ACC order and UES Settlement Agreement include the following terms
related to UNS Electric rates   - A 22% overall increase in retail rates effective August 11, 2003 from the
rates previously in effect for Citizens. This reflects the implementation
of a PPFAC of $001825 per kWh, which combined with the current base
purchased power rate of $005194 per kWh, results in a new PPFAC rate of
$007019. This allows UNS Electric to fully recover the cost of purchased
power under its current contract with its sole energy supplier, Pinnacle
West Capital Corporation PWCC. - UNS Electric must attempt to renegotiate
the PWCC purchase power contract, and any savings that result from a
renegotiated contract must be allocated in a ratio of 90% to ratepayers and
10% to shareholders.
The ACC order also requires that TEP submit in its next general rate case
filing in June 2004, a feasibility study and consolidation plan, or a plan for
coordination of operations of UNS Electric operations in Santa Cruz County
with those of TEP.
Under the terms of the ACC order, UNS Electric may not file a general rate
increase until August 2006 and any resulting rate increase shall not become
effective prior to August 1, 2007.
The UES Settlement Agreement also limits dividends payable by UNS Electric
to UniSource Energy to 75% of earnings until the ratio of common equity to total
capitalization reaches 40%. The ratio of common equity to total capitalization
for UNS Electric was 38% at December 31, 2003.
On November 3, 2003, UNS Electric filed a plan to open its service
territories to retail electric competition. The plan is subject to review and
approval by the ACC. As a result of the court decisions concerning the ACC
Retail Electric Competition Rules, we are unable to predict when and how the ACC
will address this plan.
Income Statement Impact of Applying FAS 71
If UES had not applied FAS 71, net income would have been $2 million
greater, primarily as a result of the recovery of deferred purchased gas costs.
Future Implications of Discontinuing Application of FAS 71
UES' regulatory assets, net of regulatory liabilities, total $1 million at
December 31, 2003, and are all presently included in rate base and consequently
are earning a return on investment. If UES stopped applying FAS 71 to its
regulated operations, it would write off the related balances of its regulatory
assets as an expense and would write off its regulatory liabilities as income on
its income statement. Based on the regulatory asset and liability balances at
December 31, 2003, if UES had stopped applying FAS 71 to its regulated
operations, it would have recorded an extraordinary after-tax loss of $1
million. UES' cash flows would not be affected if it stopped applying FAS 71
unless a regulatory order limited its ability to recover the cost of its
regulatory assets.
K-90  UES COMMITMENTS
UNS Gas has firm transportation agreements with El Paso Natural Gas EPNG
and Transwestern Pipeline Company Transwestern with combined capacity
sufficient to meet its load requirements. EPNG provides gas transportation
service under a converted full requirements contract in which UNS Gas pays a
fixed reservation charge. This contract expires in August 2011. In July 2003,
FERC required the conversion of UNS Gas' full requirements status under the
EPNG agreement to contract demand starting on September 1, 2003. Upon
conversion to contract demand status, UNS Gas now has specific volume limits in
each month and specific receipt point rights from the available supply basins
San Juan and Permian. These changes will reduce the amount of less expensive
San Juan gas available to UNS Gas. The impact, however, is not expected to be
material. The annual cost of the EPNG capacity after conversion to contract
demand will not change. The Transwestern contract expires in January 2007. The
aggregate annual minimum transportation charges are expected to be
approximately $35$4 million and $30 million annually through August 2011 for
the EPNG contract and $3 million annually through January 2007 for the
Transwestern contract. UNS Gas made payments under these contracts,
respectively of $2 million in 2003.
UNS Electric imports the power it purchases over the Western Area Power
Administration WAPA transmission lines. UNS Electric transmission capacity
agreements with WAPA provide for annual rate adjustments and expire in February
2008 and June 2011. The contract that expires in 2008 also contains a capacity
adjustment clause. Under the terms of the agreements, UNS Electric aggregate
minimum fixed transmission charges are expected to be approximately $6 million
in 2004 and $1 million in 2005 through 2011. UNS Electric made payments under
these contracts of $2 million in 2003.
NOTE 4. TEP REGULATORY MATTERS
- 
Upon approval of the TEP Settlement Agreement in November 1999, TEP
discontinued regulatory accounting under FAS 71 for its generation operations.
TEP continues to report its transmission and distribution operations under FAS
71.
TEP Settlement Agreement
In November 1999, the ACC approved the TEP Settlement Agreement between TEP
and certain customer groups relating to recovery of TEP transition costs and
standard retail rates. The TEP Settlement Agreement included   - CONSUMER CHOICE: By January 1, 2001, consumer choice for energy supply
was available to all customers.
- NO RATE INCREASE: TEP retail rates may not be increased until December
31, 2008. TEP expects to recover the costs of transmission and distribution
under regulated unbundled rates both during and after this period.
- RECOVERY OF TRANSITION COSTS: TEP rates include Fixed and Floating
Competition Transition Charge CTC components designated for the recovery of
transition costs, including generation-related regulatory assets and a portion
of TEP generation plant assets. Retail rates will decrease by the Fixed CTC
amount after TEP has recovered $450 million or on December 31, 2008, whichever
occurs first. The Floating CTC equals retail rates less the price of retail
electric service. The price of retail electric service includes TEP
transmission and distribution charge and a market energy component based on a
market index for electric energy. Because TEP total retail rates are
effectively frozen, the Floating CTC is expected to allow TEP to recoup the
balance of transition recovery assets not otherwise recovered through the Fixed
CTC. The Floating CTC will end no later than December 31, 2008.
- GENERAL RATE CASE: TEP is required to file a general rate case by June 1,
2004, including an updated cost-of-service study. TEP rates cannot be
increased as a result of this general rate case. Any decrease resulting from
this rate case would be effective no sooner than June 1, 2005.
K-91   Transition Recovery Asset
TEP Transition Recovery Asset consists of generation-related regulatory
assets and a portion of TEP generation plant asset costs. Transition costs
being recovered through the Fixed CTC include: 1 the Transition Recovery
Asset; 2 generation-related plant assets included in Plant in Service on the
balance sheet; and 3 excess capacity deferrals related to operating and
capital costs associated with Springerville Unit 2 which are being amortized as
an off-balance sheet regulatory asset. These transition costs were amortized as
follows                          Years Ended December 31,
2003   2002  2001
-Millions of Dollars-
Amortization of Transition Costs Being

Amortization of Transition Recovery Asset
recorded on the income statement      31   25   21
Transition Recovery Asset, end of year  $276   $307   $332
The remaining transition costs being recovered through the Fixed CTC differ
from the Transition Recovery Asset recorded on the balance sheet as follows                              December 31,
2003   2002
-Millions of Dollars-

Unamortized Excess Capacity Deferrals
off-balance sheet                   -    9
Transition Recovery Asset, end of year      $276   $307
The remaining Transition Recovery Asset balance will be amortized as costs
are recovered through rates until TEP has recovered $450 million of transition
costs or until December 31, 2008, whichever occurs first.
K-92  OTHER REGULATORY ASSETS AND LIABILITIES
In addition to the Transition Recovery Asset related to TEP
othergeneration assets, the following regulatory assets and liabilities
includeare being recovered through TEP transmission and distribution
businesses                          December 31,
2003   2002

Total Regulatory Assets       $ 71   $ 80
Other Regulatory Liabilities
Net Cost of Removal for Interim
Retirements              $ 60   $ 55
Regulatory assets of approximately $21 million are not presently included
in rate base and consequently are not earning a return on investment. These
regulatory assets are being recovered through cost of service or are authorized
to be collected in future base rates. Current regulatory assets of $9 million
are related to differences between expenses recorded on the accrual basis for
GAAP accounting and on a pay-as-you-go basis for regulatory accounting. The
remaining recovery period generally ranges from 1 to 15 years. Regulatory
compliance costs of $9 million require specific rate action and the recovery
period will be determined in the rate case to be filed in 2004. The remaining $3
million represents unamortized loss on reacquired debt that is not included in
rate base, but the amortization of these costs is included in the ratemaking
calculation of the cost of debt, which is a component of the cost of capital
rate of return. All regulatory assets are probable of recovery.
See Note 5 for a discussion of the amounts included in Other Regulatory
Liabilities.
INCOME STATEMENT IMPACT OF APPLYING FAS 71
The amortization of TEP regulatory assets had the following effect on
UniSource Energy and TEP income statements                     Years Ended December 31,
2003   2002   2001
-Millions of Dollars-
Operating Expenses
Amortization of Transition
Recovery Asset         $ 31   $ 25   $ 21
Interest Expense
Long-Term Debt           -    1    1
Income Taxes            7    7    5
If TEP had not applied FAS 71 in these years, the above amounts would have
been reflected in the income statements in prior periods. The reclassification
of TEP generation-related regulatory assets to the Transition Recovery Asset
shortened the amortization period for these assets to nine years.
K-93  FUTURE IMPLICATIONS OF DISCONTINUING APPLICATION OF FAS 71
TEP continues to apply FAS 71 to its regulated operations, which include
the transmission and distribution portions of its business. TEP regularly
assesses whether it can continue to apply FAS 71 to these operations. If TEP
stopped applying FAS 71 to its remaining regulated operations, it would write
off the related balances of its regulatory assets as an expense and its
regulatory liabilities as income on its income statement. Based on the
regulatory asset balances, net of regulatory liabilities, at December 31, 2003,
if TEP had stopped applying FAS 71 to its remaining regulated operations, it
would have recorded an extraordinary after-tax loss of approximately $173
million. While regulatory orders and market conditions may affect cash flows,
TEP cash flows would not be affected if it stopped applying FAS 71 unless a
regulatory order limited its ability to recover the cost of its regulatory
assets.
NOTE 5. ACCOUNTING CHANGE: ACCOUNTING FOR ASSET RETIREMENT OBLIGATIONS
- 
In June 2001, the Financial Accounting Standards Board FASB issued
Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 143, Accounting for Asset
Retirement Obligations FAS 143. It requires entities to record the fair value
of a liability for a legal obligation to retire an asset in the period in which
the liability is incurred. A legal obligation is a liability that a party is
required to settle as a result of an existing or enacted law, statute, ordinance
or contract. When the liability is initially recorded, the entity should
capitalize a cost by increasing the carrying amount of the related long-lived
asset. Over time, the liability is adjusted to its present value by recognizing
accretion expense as an operating expense in the income statement each period,
and the capitalized cost is depreciated over the useful life of the related
asset. Upon settlement of the liability, an entity either settles the obligation
for its recorded amount or incurs a gain or loss if the actual costs differ from
the recorded amount.
Prior to adopting FAS 143, costs for final removal of all owned generation
facilities were accrued as an additional component of depreciation expense.
Under FAS 143, only the costs to remove an asset with legally binding retirement
obligations will be accrued over time through accretion of the asset retirement
obligation and depreciation of the capitalized asset retirement cost.
TEP has identified legal obligations to retire generation plant assets
specified in land leases for its jointly-owned Navajo and Four Corners
Generating Stations. The land on which these stations reside is leased from the
Navajo Nation. The provisions of the leases require the lessees to remove the
facilities upon request of the Navajo Nation at the expiration of the leases.
TEP also has certain environmental obligations at the San Juan Generating
Station San Juan. TEP has estimated that its share of the cost to remove the
Navajo and Four Corners facilities and to settle the San Juan environmental
obligations will be approximately $38 million at the date of retirement. No
other legal obligations to retire generation plant assets were identified. As
of December 31, 2002, TEP had accrued $113 million for the final
decommissioning of its generating facilities. This amount has been reclassified
from accumulated depreciation to an accrued asset retirement obligation. As
discussed below, this amount was reversed for 2002 and included as part of the
cumulative effect of accounting change adjustment when FAS 143 was adopted on
January 1, 2003.
TEP and UES have various transmission and distribution lines that operate
under land leases and rights of way that contain end dates and restorative
clauses. TEP and UES operate their transmission and distribution systems as if
they will be operated in perpetuity and would continue to be used or sold
without land remediation. As a result, TEP and UES are not recognizing the costs
of final removal of the transmission and distribution lines in their financial
statements. As of December 31, 2003, TEP had accrued $60 million and UES had
accrued $06 million for the net cost of removal for interim retirements from
its transmission, distribution and general plant. As of December 31, 2002, TEP
had accrued $55 million for these removal costs. These amounts have been
reclassified from accumulated depreciation to a regulatory liability.
K-94   Millennium and UED have no asset retirement obligations.
Upon adoption of FAS 143 on January 1, 2003, TEP recorded an asset
retirement obligation of $38 million at its net present value of $11 million,
increased depreciable assets by $01 million for asset retirement costs,
reversed $1128 million of costs previously accrued for final removal from
accumulated depreciation, reversed previously recorded deferred tax assets of
$442 million and recognized the cumulative effect of accounting change as a
gain of $1117 million $675 million net of tax. The adoption of FAS 143 also
resulted in a $6 million reduction of current depreciation expense charged
throughout the year because asset retirement costs are no longer recorded as a
component of depreciation expense.
The following table illustrates on a pro forma basis the amount of the
asset retirement obligation as if FAS 143 had been applied during all periods
presented                      Years Ended December 31,

Amounts recorded under FAS 143 are subject to various assumptions and
determinations, such as determining whether a legal obligation exists to remove
assets, estimating the fair value of the costs of removal, estimating when final
removal will occur, and the credit-adjusted risk-free interest rates to be used
to discount future liabilities. Changes that may arise over time with regard to
these assumptions and determinations will change amounts recorded in the future
as expense for asset retirement obligations.
If TEP retires any asset at the end of its useful life, without a legal
obligation to do so, it will record retirement costs at that time as incurred or
accrued. TEP does not believe that the adoption of FAS 143 will result in any
change in retail rates since all matters relating to the rate-making treatment
of TEP generating assets were determined pursuant to the TEP Settlement
Agreement.
NOTE 6. SEGMENT AND RELATED INFORMATION
- 
Based on the way we organize our operations and evaluate performance, we
have four reportable business segments:
1 TEP, a vertically integrated electric utility business, is UniSource
Energy largest subsidiary.
2 UES is the holding company for UNS Gas, a regulated gas distribution
business; and UNS Electric, a regulated electric distribution utility business.
Results from UES are for the period from August 11, 2003 through December 31,
2003 only see Notes 1 and 3.
3 Millennium holds interests in unregulated energy and emerging
technology businesses see Note 8.
4 UED develops generating resources and other project development
activities, including facilitating the expansion of the Springerville Generating
Station. Prior to September 2002, UED owned a 20 MW gas turbine, which it
leased to TEP. In September 2002, UED sold the turbine to TEP for its net book
value of $15 million.
Significant reconciling adjustments consist of the elimination of
intercompany activity and balances. Millennium recorded revenue from
transactions with TEP of $16 million, $14 million and $13 million in 2003, 2002
and 2001, respectively. TEP related expense is reported in Other Operations
and Maintenance expense on its income statement. Millennium revenue and TEP
related expense are eliminated in UniSource Energy consolidation. Other
significant reconciling adjustments include the elimination of the intercompany
note between UniSource Energy and TEP, as well as the related interest income
and expense; and the elimination of UED rental income and TEP rental expense
from UED turbine lease to TEP prior to UED sale of the turbine to TEP in
September 2002.
As discussed in Note 1, we record our percentage share of the earnings of
affiliated companies when we hold a 20% to 50% voting interest, except for
investments where we provide all of the financing, in which case we recognize
100% of the losses. See Note 8. Our portion of the net income loss of the
entities in which TEP and Millennium own a 20-50% interest or have the ability
to exercise significant influence is shown below in Net Loss from Equity Method
Entities.

ACTIVITIES
- 
On January 1, 2001, TEP recorded an after-tax gain of less than $1 million
in its income statement for the cumulative effect of adopting Statement of
Financial Accounting Standards No. 133, Accounting for Derivative Instruments
and Hedging Activities FAS 133. TEP enters into forward contracts to purchase
or sell a specified amount of capacity or energy at a specified price over a
given period of time, typically for one month, three months, or one year, within
established limits to take advantage of favorable market opportunities. In
general, TEP enters into forward purchase contracts when market conditions
provide the opportunity to purchase energy for its load at prices that are below
the marginal cost of its supply resources or to supplement TEP own resources
i.e., during plant outages and summer peaking periods. TEP enters into forward
sales contracts when TEP forecasts that it has excess supply and the market
price of energy exceeds its marginal cost. The majority of TEP forward
contract s are considered to be normal purchases and sales and, therefore, are
not required to be marked to market. However, some of these forward contracts
are considered to be derivatives, which TEP marks to market by recording
unrealized gains and losses and adjusting the related assets and liabilities on
a monthly basis to reflect the market prices at the end of the month. TEP
manages the risk of counterparty default by performing financial credit reviews,
setting limits, monitoring exposures, requiring collateral when needed, and
using a standardized agreement which allows for the netting of current period
exposures to and from a single counterparty.
UNS Gas and UNS Electric do not currently have any contracts that are
required to be marked to market. UNS Gas does have a natural gas supply and
management agreement under which it purchases substantially all of its gas
requirements at market prices from BP Energy Company BP. However, the contract
terms allow UNS Gas to lock in fixed prices on a portion of its gas purchases by
entering into fixed price forward contracts with BP at various times during the
year. This enables UNS Gas to provide more stable prices to its customers. These
purchases are made up to a year in advance with the goal of locking in fixed
prices on at least 45% and not more than 80% of the expected monthly gas
consumption prior to entering into the month. These forward contracts, as well
as the main gas supply contract, meet the definition of normal purchases and
therefore are not required to be marked to market.
MEG, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Millennium, began operations in November
2001 and enters into swap agreements, options and forward contracts relating to
Emissions Allowances and coal. MEG marks its trading contracts to market by
recording unrealized gains and losses and adjusting the related assets and
liabilities on a monthly basis to reflect the market prices at the end of the
month.
The market prices used to determine fair values for TEP and MEG
derivative instruments are estimated based on various factors including broker
quotes, exchange prices, over the counter prices and time value.
TEP and MEG derivative activities are reported as follows   - TEP net unrealized and realized gains and losses on forward sales
contracts are components of Electric Wholesale Sales; - TEP net
unrealized and realized gains and losses on forward purchase contracts are
components of Purchased Power; and
- MEG net unrealized and realized gains and losses on trading activities
are components of Other Operating Revenues. Although MEG realized gains and
losses on trading activities are reported net on UniSource Energy income
statement, the related cash receipts and cash payments are reported separately
on UniSource Energy statement of cash flows.
TEP net unrealized gains losses on forward contracts were as follows                    Years Ended December 31,
2003   2002   2001

K-98   The net pre-tax gains and losses from MEG trading activities were less
than $1 million for each of the years ended December 31, 2003, 2002 and 2001.
At December 31, 2003, the fair value of TEP derivative liabilities was
less than $1 million and is reported in Other Current Liabilities on TEP
balance sheet. At December 31, 2002, TEP had no open forward contracts that were
considered derivatives. MEG trading assets and liabilities are reported in
Trading Assets and Trading Liabilities on UniSource Energy balance sheet. The
fair value of MEG trading assets, including its Emissions Allowance inventory,
was $22 million at December 31, 2003 and $15 million at December 31, 2002. The
fair value of MEG trading liabilities was $19 million at December 31, 2003 and
$10 million at December 31, 2002.
TEP treated certain forward sale and purchase contracts as cash flow hedges
when it adopted FAS 133 and recorded an unrealized gain/loss related to these
hedges in Other Comprehensive Income. However, during 2001, new guidance was
issued by the FASB which provided that certain forward power purchase or sale
agreements, including capacity contracts, could be excluded from the
requirements of FAS 133. TEP implemented this new guidance in 2001 and
determined that the items designated as cash flow hedges upon adoption could be
excluded from the FAS 133 requirements. Therefore, as these contracts settled in
2001, TEP reversed the unrealized gain/loss included in Other Comprehensive
Income and recorded the realized gain/loss in the income statement. As of
December 31, 2003 and December 31, 2002, TEP had no material cash flow hedges.
NOTE 8. MILLENNIUM
-    See Note 6 for selected financial data of Millennium.
Through affiliates, Millennium holds investments in unregulated energy and
emerging technology companies. As presented in Note 6, Millennium assets
represent 45% in 2003 and 6% in 2002 of UniSource Energy total assets. Under
the acquisition agreement described in Note 2, UniSource Energy is limited as to
the amount it can invest in Millennium. Consequently, Millennium continued
willingnessability to provide future funding for the operations of emerging
companies could be influenced, directly or indirectly, by the individual
investment ability to conform to new investment guidelines, necessity and
business plansaffected.
Millennium accounts for these investments under the consolidation and
equity methods. In some cases, Millennium is an investment sole funder. When
this is the case, Millennium recognizes 100% of an investment losses, because
as sole provider of funds it bears all of the financial risk. To the extent that
an investment becomes profitable and Millennium has recognized losses in excess
of its percentage ownership, Millennium will recognize 100% of an investment
net income until Millennium recognized losses equal its ownership percentage
of losses.
A brief summary of Millennium investments follows   GLOBAL SOLAR ENERGY, INC. Global Solar primarily develops and
manufactures light weight thin-film photovoltaic cells and panels. Global
Solar target markets have included military, space and commercial
applications. In 2003, Millennium increased its ownership of Global Solar to 99%
from 87%. Millennium accounts for Global Solar under the consolidation method
and recognizes 100% of Global Solar losses. In 2003, Millennium funded debt
and equity contributions of $10 million to Global Solar. We recognizeGlobal
Solar recognizes expense when the funding is utilizedused for research,
development and administrative costs. Millennium has no remaining funding
commitments to Global Solar.
INFINITE POWER SOLUTIONS, INC. IPS develops thin-film lithium ion
batteries. Millennium ownership in IPS was reduced in 2003 from 77% to 72%.
Millennium accounts for IPS under the consolidation method. In 2003, Millennium
provided IPS debt and equity funding of $3 million. In 2003, Dow Corning
Enterprises, Inc. DCEI continued to support IPS with preferred equity and debt
contributions totaling $2 million. We recognizeIPS recognizes expense when
funding is utilizedused for research, development and administrative costs. At
December 31, 2003, Millennium had committed less than an additional $1 million
to IPS. In early 2004 these funds were drawn by IPS. DCEI holds warrants to
purchase additional preferred shares of IPS that if exercised, could result in
Millennium ownership of IPS being reduced to as low as 59%.
K-99   MICROSAT SYSTEMS, INC. MicroSat develops small-scale satellites under
U.S. government contracts. In February 2004, MicroSat obtained confirmation that
the unfunded cost share commitment under this contract had been eliminated. The
change and related adjustments will be reflected in 2004. In 2003 Millennium
reduced its ownership of MicroSat to 35% from 49%. Millennium made no
contributions to MicroSat in 2003. As sole funder, Millennium recognizes 100% of
MicroSat net losses. Millennium has no further funding commitments to
MicroSat.
MEG is a wholly-owned subsidiary of Millennium, which manages and trades
emissions allowances, coal, and related financial instruments. MEG activities
are described in Note 7.
HADDINGTON ENERGY PARTNERS II, LP Haddington funds energy-related
investments. A member of the UniSource Energy Board of Directors has an
investment in Haddington and is a managing director of the general partner of
the limited partnership. Millennium committed $15 million in capital, excluding
fees, to Haddington in exchange for approximately 31% of Haddington. At December
31, 2003, Millennium has funded $9 million of this commitment, of which $2
million was funded in 2003. Millennium expects the balance to be funded in the
next three years. Millennium accounts for the investment under the equity
method.
VALLEY VENTURES III, LP Valley Ventures is a venture capital fund that
invests in information technology, microelectronics and biotechnology, primarily
within the Southwestern U.S. A different member of the UniSource Energy Board of
Directors is a general partner of the company that manages the fund. Millennium
committed $56 million, excludingincluding fees, to the fund and owns
approximately 15% of the fund. Millennium hashad funded $1 million of this
commitment through as of December 31, 2003. Millennium expects the balance to be
funded by the end of 2007. Millennium accounts for this investment under the
equity method due to an ability to exercise significant influence over the fund
based on the related party disclosure above.
CARBOELECTRICA SABINAS, S.DE R.L. DE C.V. Sabinas is a Mexican limited
liability company created to develop up to 800 megawatts MW of coal-fired
generation in the Sabinas region of Coahuila, Mexico. Sabinas also owns 195% of
Minerales de Monclova, S.A. de C.V. Mimosa. Mimosa is an owner of coal and
associated gas reserves. Mimosa supplies metallurgical coal to the Mexican steel
industry and thermal coal to the Mexican electricity commission. major electric
utility in Mexico. Millennium owns 50% of Sabinas. Altos Hornos de Mexico, S.A.
de C.V. AHMSA and affiliates also own 50%. Also, UniSource Energy Chairman,
President and Chief Executive Officer is a member of the board of directors of
AMHSA. Since 1999, both AHMSA and Mimosa are parties to a suspension of payments
procedure, under applicable Mexican law, which is the equivalent of a U.S.
Chapter 11 proceeding. Under certain circumstances, Millennium has the right to
sell a put option its interest in Sabinas to an AHMSA affiliate f or $20
million plus an accrued service fee. These circumstances include failure of
Sabinas to reach financial closing on the generation project within a specified
time. Millennium put option is secured by collateral initially valued in
excess of $20 million. In 2003 Millennium received $1 million of returned
capital from the investment. Millennium accounts for the investment in Sabinas
under the equity method, however Sabinas accounts for its investment in Mimosa
under the cost method.
NATIONS ENERGY CORPORATION Nations Energy is wholly owned by Millennium.
Through subsidiaries, Nations Energy has a 40% interest in a 43 MW power plant
in Panama. Nations Energy intends to sell its interest in this plant, whose book
value is currently less than $1 million.
Nations Energy Contingency
In September 2001, Nations Energy sold its 26% equity interest in a power
project located in Curacao, Netherlands Antilles to Mirant Curacao Investments,
Ltd. Mirant Curacao a subsidiary of Mirant Corporation Mirant. Nations
Energy received $5 million in cash and an $11 million note receivable from
Mirant Curacao. The note was recorded at its net present value of $8 million
using an 8% discount rate, the discount being recognized as interest income over
the five-year life of the note. As of December 31, 2003, Nations Energy
receivable from Mirant Curacao is approximately $10 million. The note is
primarily included in Investments and Other Property - Other on UniSource
Energy balance sheet. Payments on the note receivable are expected as follows 2 million in July 2004, $4 million in July 2005, and $5 million in July 2006.
K-100   The note is guaranteed by Mirant Americas, Inc., a subsidiary of Mirant. On
July 14, 2003, Mirant, Mirant Americas, Inc. and various other Mirant companies
filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection. Mirant Curacao was not included in
the Chapter 11 filings. Based on a review of the projected cash flows for the
power project, it appears Mirant Curacao will have sufficient future cash flows
to pay the note receivable and any applicable interest. However, we cannot
predict the ultimate outcome that Mirant bankruptcy will have on the
collectibility of the note from Mirant Curacao. Nations Energy will continue to
evaluate the collectibility of the receivable, but currently expects to collect
the note in its entirety and has not recorded any reserve for this note.
Millennium Commitments
Millennium is currently finalizing possible future commitments to each of
its investments to help insure that these investments conform to Millennium
business plans. Millennium funding levels and share ownership are subject to
change in the future. Millennium outstanding equity commitments are currently
limited to $6 million to Haddington and $45 million to Valley Ventures.
Millennium only remaining debt commitment, to IPS, was funded by Februaryin
early 2004. Millennium may commit to provide additional funding to its
investments in the future.
Global Solar and MicroSat have commitments to incur future expenses
relating to government contracts. The following is a table of remaining

K-102 NOTE 10. DEBT AND CAPITAL LEASE OBLIGATIONS
- 
UNISOURCE ENERGY DEBT
UniSource Energy summarizes its consolidated long-term debt in the
statements of capitalization.
Bridge Loan
In August 2003, UniSource Energy borrowed $35 million from a financial
institution in the form of short-term debt to help finance the purchase of
Citizens Arizona electric and gas utility assets. The funds were used as an
equity contribution in the capitalization of UES. On October 24, 2003, as
required by the debt agreement, UniSource Energy repaid the $35 million loan
upon the financial close of the Springerville Unit 3 project. See Note 14.
TEP LONG-TERM DEBT
Long-term debt matures more than one year from the date of the financial
statements. TEP summarizes its long-term debt in the statements of
capitalization.
TEP made the required sinking fund payments of $2 million on its First
Mortgage IDBs in each of 2003 and 2002. TEP redeemed $04 million of its 85%
First Mortgage Bonds in each of 2003 and 2002. TEP did not issue any new bonds
in 2003 or 2002.
TEP OTHER DEBT AND AGREEMENTS
First and Second Mortgage
TEP first and second mortgage indentures create liens on and security
interests in most of TEP utility plant assets, with the exception of
Springerville Unit 2. San Carlos Resources Inc., a wholly-owned subsidiary of
TEP, holds title to Springerville Unit 2. Utility Plant under Capital Leases is
not subject to such liens or available to TEP creditors, other than the lessors.
The net book value of TEP utility plant subject to the lien of the indentures
was $1,124 million at December 31, 2003.
Bank Credit Agreement
In November 2002, TEP entered into a new $401 million Credit Agreement to
replace the credit facilities provided under its then existing $441 million
Credit Agreement that would have expired December 30, 2002. The new agreement
provided a $60 million Revolving Credit Facility and two Letter of Credit
facilities Tranche A and Tranche B; collectively, LOC totaling $341 million.
The Revolving Credit Facility, used to provide liquidity for general corporate
purposes, is a 364-day facility that was to expire on November 13, 2003. In
October 2003, TEP revolving credit lenders agreed to extend the Revolving
Credit Facility under the same terms and conditions to November 11, 2004. The
LOC secures the payment of principal and interest on $329 million of tax-exempt
variable rate bonds IDBs. Tranche A provides $135 million and expires in
January 2006; Tranche B provides $206 million and expires in November 2006. The
facilities are collateralized by $401 million of Second Mortgage Bonds.
The Credit Agreement contains a number of restrictive covenants, including
restrictions on additional indebtedness, liens, sale of assets or mergers and
sale-leasebacks. The proposed acquisition of UniSource Energy by an affiliate of
Saguaro Utility, as discussed in Note 2, is not restricted by these covenants.
The Credit Agreement also contains several financial covenants including net
worth, cash coverage and leverage tests. As of December 31, 2003, TEP was in
compliance with these financial covenants.
K-103   At December 31, 2003 and 2002, TEP had no outstanding borrowings under the
Revolving Credit Facility. When TEP borrows under the Revolving Credit Facility,
the borrowing costs are at a variable interest rate consisting of a spread over
the London Interbank Offered Rate LIBOR or an alternate base rate. The spread
is based upon a pricing grid tied to TEP credit ratings. Also, TEP pays an
annual commitment fee on the unused portion of the Revolving Credit Facility and
a fee on the LOC facilities. The chart below shows the per annum rates and fees
in effect on TEP Credit Facilities as of December 31, 2003, based on its
credit ratings, as well as the possible range of rates and fees if TEP credit
ratings were to change                      Current Rate/    Range of

TEP CAPITAL LEASE OBLIGATIONS
The terms of TEP capital leases are as follows   - The Sundt Lease has an initial term to January 2011 and provides for
renewal periods of two or more years through 2020.
- The Springerville Common Facilities Leases have an initial term to
December 2017 for one lease and January 2021 for the other two leases,
subject to optional renewal periods of two or more years through 2025.
- The Springerville Unit 1 Leases have an initial term to January 2015 and
provide for renewal periods of three or more years through 2030.
- The Springerville Coal Handling Facilities Leases have an initial term to
April 2015 and provide for one renewal period of six years, then additional
renewal periods of five or more years through 2035.
Springerville Lease Debt and Equity
TEP held Springerville Unit 1 lease debt totaling $100 million at December
31, 2003 and $108 million at December 31, 2002. In 2003, TEP made no additional
purchases of Springerville Unit 1 lease debt, but received principal payments
related to its investment in Springerville Unit 1 lease debt of $7 million. In
2002, TEP purchased $36 million of Springerville Unit 1 lease debt.
At December 31, 2003 and December 31, 2002, TEP held $79 million and $84
million, respectively, of Springerville Coal Handling Facilities lease debt and
equity. TEP purchased a 13% ownership interest in the Springerville Coal
Handling Facilities Leases for $13 million in December 2001 and all $96 million
of the debt related to these capital leases in January 2002. In March 2002, TEP
terminated the lease related to its equity interest and cancelled the associated
debt. As a result of the lease termination, TEP recorded a $21 million reduction
to the capital lease obligation, a $27 million reduction of its investment, and
a $6 million increase in the capital lease asset, which represents the residual
value of TEP interest in the leased asset and is carried at cost.
TEP recognizes interest income on these investments. TEP purchases of
lease debt and equity are reflected in investing activities on TEP cash flow
statements.
K-104   In 1985, TEP sold and leased back its undivided one-half ownership interest
in the common facilities at the Springerville Generating Station. Under the
terms of the Springerville Common Facilities Leases, TEP must periodically
arrange for refinancing or refunding of the secured notes underlying the leases
prior to the named date in order to avoid a special event of loss. TEP was
required to arrange for the refinancing of the lease debt prior to the special
event of loss date of June 30, 2003 or the leases would have been terminated and
TEP would have been required to repurchase the facilities for $125 million. TEP
finalized the arrangements for the refinancing of $70 million of lease debt on
June 26, 2003 and the special event of loss date was reset for June 30, 2006.
TEP incurred a total of $03 million in debt costs related to the refinancing.
These costs were deferred and are being amortized over a three year period.
Interest on the new debt is payable at LIBOR plus 425%. The LIBOR rate is re
set every six months and the rate in effect on December 31, 2003 was 099 which resulted in a total interest rate on the lease debt of 524% at year end.
Prior to the refinancing, the interest rate was LIBOR plus 250%.
UES LONG-TERM DEBT
Senior Unsecured Notes
On August 11, 2003, UNS Gas and UNS Electric issued a total of $160 million
of aggregate principal amount of senior unsecured notes in a private placement.
Proceeds from the note issuance were paid to Citizens to purchase the Arizona
gas and electric system assets. UNS Gas issued $50 million of 623% notes due
August 11, 2011 and $50 million of 623% notes due August 11, 2015. UNS Electric
issued $60 million of 761% notes due August 11, 2008. All three series of notes
may be prepaid with a make-whole call premium reflecting a discount rate equal
to an equivalent maturity U.S. Treasury security yield plus 50 basis points. UNS
Gas and UNS Electric incurred a total of $2 million in debt costs related to the
issuance of the notes. These costs were deferred and are being amortized over
the life of the notes. The notes are guaranteed by UES.
The note purchase agreements for both UNS Gas and UNS Electric contain
certain restrictive covenants, including restrictions on transactions with
affiliates, mergers, liens to secure indebtedness, restricted payments,
incurrence of indebtedness, and minimum net worth. For purposes of these notes,
net worth equals common stock equity less amounts attributable to minority
interests and intangible assets not recoverable through rates. The actual and
required minimum net worth levels at December 31, 2003 were as follows                   Required

UES         $ 50     $ 90
UNS Gas        43      53
UNS Electric     26      37
The incurrence of indebtedness covenant requires each of UNS Gas and UNS
Electric to meet certain tests before an additional dollar of indebtedness may
be incurred. These tests include a a ratio of Consolidated Long-Term Debt to
Consolidated Total Capitalization of no greater than 067 to 100 prior to
September 30, 2004, and no greater than 065 to 100 after September 30, 2004,
and b an Interest Coverage Ratio a measure of cash flow to cover interest
expense of at least 250 to 100. However, UNS Gas and UNS Electric may,
without meeting these tests, refinance indebtedness and incur short-term debt in
an amount not to exceed $7 million in the case of UNS Gas, and $5 million in the
case of UNS Electric. Neither UNS Gas, nor UNS Electric, may declare or make
distributions or dividends restricted payments on their common stock unless
a immediately after giving effect to such action no default or event of
default would exist under such company note purchase agreement and b
immediately aft er giving effect to such action, such company would be permitted
to incur an additional dollar of indebtedness under the debt incurrence test for
such company. As of December 31, 2003, UNS Gas and UNS Electric were in
compliance with the terms of the note purchase agreements.
K-105  MEG LINE OF CREDIT
MEG has a $5 million bank line of credit for the purpose of issuing letters
of credit to counterparties to support its emissions allowance and coal trading
activities. As of December 31, 2003, MEG had $5 million in outstanding LOCs.
This facility expires in March 2005.

Debt. TEP intends to hold the $179 million investment in Springerville Lease
Debt Securities to maturity $46 million matures through January 1, 2009, $78
million matures through July 1, 2011, and $55 million matures through January 1,
2013. This investment is stated at amortized cost, which means the purchase
cost has been adjusted for the amortization of the premium and discount to
maturity. TEP bases the fair value of this investment on quoted market prices
for the same or similar debt.
K-106   TEP considers the principal amounts of variable rate debt outstanding to be
reasonable estimates of their fair value. TEP determined the fair value of its
fixed rate obligations including the Corporate First Mortgage Bonds, the First
Mortgage Bonds-IDBs, First Collateral Trust Bonds and the Unsecured IDBs by
calculating the present value of the cash flows of each fixed rate obligation.
TEP used a rate consistent with market yields generally available as of December
2003 for 2003 amounts and December 2002 for 2002 amounts for bonds with similar
characteristics with respect to credit rating, time-to-maturity, and the tax
status of the bond coupon for federal income tax purposes. The use of different
market assumptions and/or estimation methodologies may yield different estimated
fair value amounts.
UES considers the principal amounts of the $160 million of senior unsecured
notes issued in August 2003 to be reasonable estimates of their fair value. In
addition to being issued recently, the notes were privately placed and not
assigned credit ratings by the major credit rating agencies, making the notes
difficult to value based on bonds with comparable credit ratings,
time-to-maturity, and trading patterns.
The carrying amounts of our current assets and liabilities approximate fair
value.
NOTE 12. STOCKHOLDERS' EQUITY
- 
DIVIDEND LIMITATIONS
UniSource Energy
In February 2004, UniSource Energy declared a quarterly dividend to the
shareholders of $016 per share of UniSource Energy Common Stock. The dividend,
totaling approximately $5 million, was paid on March 10, 2004 to common
shareholders of record as of February 17, 2004. In 2003, UniSource Energy paid
quarterly dividends to the shareholders of $015 per share, for a total of $060
per share, or $20 million, for the year. During 2002, UniSource Energy paid
quarterly dividends to the shareholders of $0125 per share, for a total of
$050 per share, or $17 million, for the year. During 2001, UniSource Energy
paid quarterly dividends to the shareholders of $010 per share, for a total of
$040 per share, or $13 million, for the year.
Our ability to pay cash dividends on common stock outstanding depends, in
part, upon cash flows from our subsidiaries: TEP, UES, Millennium and UED.
Additionally, pending consummation of the acquisition discussed in Note 2,
UniSource Energy quarterly dividend payment is limited to no more than $016
per share in 2004 and $017 per share in 2005.
TEP
TEP paid dividends of $80 million in 2003, $35 million in 2002, and $50
million in 2001. UniSource Energy is the primary holder of TEP common stock.
TEP met the following requirements before paying these dividends   - Bank Credit Agreement
During 2001 and 2002, TEP bank Credit Agreement allowed TEP to pay
dividends as long as TEP maintained compliance with the agreement and met its
financial covenants. TEP new Credit Agreement as of November 2002 applies
those same restrictions as well as restricting TEP dividends to 65% of TEP
consolidated net income as long as the Tranche B LOCs are outstanding.
- ACC Holding Company Order
The ACC Holding Company Order does not allow TEP to pay dividends in excess
of 75% of its annual earnings until TEP equity ratio equals 375% of total
capitalization, excluding capital lease obligations. The UES Settlement
Agreement, as approved by the ACC, modifies this dividend limitation so that it
will remain in place until TEP common equity equals 40% of total
capitalization excluding capital lease obligations.
- Federal Power Act
This Act states that dividends shall not be paid out of funds properly
included in capital accounts. TEP 2003, 2002 and 2001 dividends were paid from
current year earnings.
K-107   UES
UES did not pay any dividends to UniSource Energy in 2003. UES' ability to
pay dividends is limited by restrictions placed on its subsidiaries, UNS Gas and
UNS Electric. As discussed in Note 3, the UES Settlement Agreement limits
dividends payable by both UNS Gas and UNS Electric to UniSource Energy to 75% of
earnings until the ratio of common equity to total capitalization reaches 40%.
Additionally, the terms of the senior unsecured note agreements entered into by
both UNS Gas and UNS Electric contain dividend restrictions. See Note 10.
Millennium and UED
Millennium did not pay any dividends to UniSource Energy in 2003, 2002 or
2001. UED paid a dividend to UniSource Energy of $50 million in 2003. UED did
not pay any dividends in 2002 or 2001. Millennium and UED have no dividend
restrictions.
UNISOURCE ENERGY SHAREHOLDER RIGHTS PLAN
In March 1999, UniSource Energy adopted a Shareholder Rights Plan. As of
April 1, 1999, each Common Stock shareholder receives one Right for each share
held. Each Right initially allows shareholders to purchase UniSource Energy
Series X Preferred Stock at a specified purchase price. However, the Rights are
exercisable only if a person or group the acquirer acquires or commences a
tender offer to acquire 15% or more of UniSource Energy Common Stock. Each
Right would entitle the holder except the acquirer to purchase a number of
shares of UniSource Energy Common or Preferred Stock or, in the case of a
merger of UniSource Energy into another person or group, common stock of the
acquiring person having a fair market value equal to twice the specified
purchase price. At any time until any person or group has acquired 15% or more
of the Common Stock, UniSource Energy may redeem the Rights at a redemption
price of $0001 per Right. The Rights trade automatically with the Common Stock
when it is bought and sold. The Rights expire on March 31, 2009. The proposed
acquisition of UniSource Energy, as discussed in Note 2, will not be an event
that triggers the provisions of the Shareholder Rights Plan as the proposed
acquisition was approved by the UniSource Energy Board of Directors.
NOTE 13. TEP WHOLESALE ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE AND ALLOWANCES
- 
At December 31, 2003, TEP Allowance for Doubtful Accounts on the balance
sheet includes $10 million related to 2001 and 2000 sales to the California
Power Exchange CPX and the California Independent System Operator CISO. At
December 31, 2002, the allowance for these receivables was approximately $8
million.
CPX and CISO
TEP collection shortfall from the CPX and the CISO was approximately $9
million for sales made in 2000 and $7 million for sales made in 2001. Since that
time, the FERC has held hearings and the FERC staff has proposed various
methodologies for calculating amounts of refunds/offsets applicable to wholesale
sales made into the CISO spot markets from October 2000 to June 2001. As of
December 31, 2002, TEP had reserved $8 million, or 50%, of its outstanding
receivable based on the amount TEP believed would be collected. Based upon a
FERC order in March 2003 as reaffirmed by the FERC on October 16, 2003, TEP
estimated that it may receive approximately $6 million of its $16 million
receivable. This represents amounts owed to TEP net of TEP estimated refund
liability. Therefore, in the first quarter of 2003, TEP increased its reserve
for sales to the CPX and the CISO by $2 million by recording a reduction of
wholesale revenues.
There are several other outstanding legal issues, complaints and lawsuits
concerning the California energy crisis related to the FERC, wholesale power
suppliers, Southern California Edison Company, Pacific Gas and Electric Company,
the CPX and the CISO. We cannot predict the outcome of these issues or lawsuits.
We believe, however, that TEP is adequately reserved for its transactions with
the CPX and the CISO.
TEP Accounts Receivable from Electric Wholesale Sales are included in
Trade Accounts Receivable on the balance sheet. TEP wholesale receivables, net
of allowances, totaled $26 million at December 31, 2003 and $31 million at
December 31, 2002. Excluding the receivables from the CPX and the CISO, as
described above, substantially all of the December 31, 2003 wholesale receivable
balance has been collected as of the date of this filing.
K-108   Enron
In late 2001, Enron filed for bankruptcy protection. At that time, TEP had
an outstanding receivable from Enron of $08 million. In early 2003, a FERC
order recommended that Enron no longer be allowed to trade and within a few days
thereafter, Enron was delisted from its stock exchange. As a result, in the
first quarter of 2003, TEP increased its allowance for doubtful accounts for its
sales to Enron by $04 million, to fully reserve its $08 million receivable
from Enron. In November 2003, TEP unconditionally sold its claim against Enron
for $05 million and reversed both the recorded receivable and the related
allowance.
NOTE 14. SPRINGERVILLE EXPANSION
- 
On October 21, 2003 the Closing Date, UED, TEP, Tri-State Generation and
Transmission Association, Inc. Tri-State and Salt River Project Agricultural
Improvement and Power District SRP entered into an Amended and Restated Joint
Development Agreement, which provides for the development of two 400 MW
coal-fired units at TEP existing Springerville Generating Station by parties
other than TEP.
On the Closing Date, TEP transferred the right to construct Unit 3,
together with associated rights, to Tri-State. Tri-State completed financing of
Unit 3 on that date and immediately began construction. Once the unit is
completed, Tri-State will lease 100% of Unit 3 through a 34-year leveraged lease
agreement with GE Structured Finance and will take 300 MW of the 400 MW
capacity.
Under the Joint Development Agreement, SRP will purchase 100 MW of Unit 3
capacity from Tri-State under a 30-year power purchase agreement and will have
the right to construct and own Unit 4 at a later date. If SRP decides to
construct Unit 4, TEP and Tri-State may be required to find a replacement
purchaser for SRP 100 MW power purchase obligation from Unit 3. If TEP and
Tri-State are unable to find a replacement purchaser, TEP would then purchase
100 MW of output from Unit 4, beginning with its commercial operation.
TEP executed contracts to provide operating, maintenance and other services
to Units 3 and 4. TEP also agreed to purchase up to 100 MW of Tri-State system
capacity for no more than five years from the time Unit 3 begins commercial
operation, which we expect to occur in December 2006. TEP will benefit from
approximately $90 million in upgraded emissions control equipment for Units 1
and 2 and other facilities at the Springerville Generating Station that will be
paid for by the Unit 3 project. Due to the transfer of Unit 3 rights to
Tri-State, in November 2003 TEP deposited $17 million with TEP Second Mortgage
Trustee.
On the Closing Date, UED received reimbursement of all project development
costs which it incurred in connection with Units 3 and 4 of approximately $29
million, plus a development fee including accrued interest on development funds
advanced of $11 million. We recognized the development fee as income in the
fourth quarter of 2003. On October 24, 2003, UniSource Energy repaid its $35
million short-term bridge loan with the proceeds.
NOTE 15. COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES
- 
TEP COMMITMENTS
Purchase and Transportation Commitments
In 2003, the ACC issued the Track B Order which defined the competitive
bidding process TEP must use to obtain capacity and energy requirements beyond
what is supplied by TEP existing resources. For the period 2003 through 2006,
TEP estimated this to be approximately 05% of its retail load in the first year
and gradually increasing over the period. This order further required TEP to bid
out short-term energy purchases that it estimated it will make in the 2003 to
2006 period. The order does not require TEP to purchase any power that it deems
to be uneconomical, unreasonable or unreliable. In 2003, TEP entered into two
power purchase agreements for the period 2003 through 2006 as listed below                    K-109   - PPL Energy Plus, LLC supplied 37 MW from June 2003 through December 2003
and will supply 75 MW from January 2004 through December 2006, under a unit
contingent contract.
- Panda Gila River generating station will supply 50 MW on-peak from June
through September, from 2003 which has been supplied through 2005, under a
unit contingent contract between TEP and Panda Gila River, L.P.
These purchases are intended to provide adequate reserve margins during the
summer peak period. In 2003, TEP made $7 million of payments under these
contracts.
TEP has several long-term contracts for the purchase and transportation of
coal with expiration dates from 2006 through 2020. The total amount paid under
these contracts depends on the number of tons of coal purchased and transported.
All of these contracts i include a price adjustment clause that will affect
the future cost of coal and ii require TEP to pay a take-or-pay charge or
liquidated damages if certain minimum quantities of coal are not purchased
and/or transported. TEP present fuel requirements are in excess of the
take-or-pay minimums. At times, TEP has purchased coal from other suppliers,
resulting in take-or-pay minimum charges, but a lower overall cost of fuel. TEP
made payments under these contracts of $167 million in 2003, $161 million in
2002, and $173 million in 2001.
TEP entered into a Gas Procurement Agreement with Southwest Gas Corporation
effective June 1, 2001 with a primary term of five years. The contract provided
for a minimum volume obligation during the first two years of 10 million MMBtus
annually. TEP negotiated new pricing and a lower minimum annual volume
obligation of 4 million MMBtus for 2004. However, TEP expects to use more gas
than this minimum requirement. In the event TEP purchases fewer MMBtus, TEP is
obligated to pay only the transportation component for any shortfall. TEP will
negotiate terms for the remaining life of the contract in late 2004. TEP made
payments under this contract of $34 million in 2003, $33 million in 2002 and $28
million in 2001.
At December 31, 2003, TEP estimates its future minimum payments under these
contracts to be               Purchase

Operating Leases
TEP, Millennium, UES and UED have entered into operating leases, primarily
for office facilities and computer equipment, with varying terms, provisions,
and expiration dates. UniSource Energy consolidated operating lease expense
was $3 million in each of 2003, 2002 and 2001. TEP operating lease expense was
$2 million in each of 2003, 2002 and 2001. UniSource Energy and TEP estimated
future minimum payments under non-cancelable operating leases at December 31,

Environmental Regulation
The 1990 Federal Clean Air Act Amendments call for reductions of SO2 and
nitrogen oxide NOx emissions in two phases. TEP is subject only to Phase II of
the SO2 and NOx emissions reductions which was effective January 1, 2000. All of
TEP generating facilities except existing internal combustion turbines are
affected. TEP capitalized $11 million in 2003 and $8 million in 2002 and 2001 in
construction costs to comply with environmental requirements and expects to
capitalize $6 million in 2004 and 2005. In addition, TEP recorded expenses of $8
million in 2003 and $6 million in 2002 and 2001 related to environmental
compliance, including the cost of lime used to scrub the stacks. TEP expects
environmental expenses to be $7 million in 2004 and 2005.
In 1993, TEP generating units affected by Phase II were allocated SO2
Emissions Allowances based on past operational history. Beginning in the year
2000, Phase II generating units were required to hold Emissions Allowances equal
to the level of emissions in the compliance year or pay penalties and offset
excess emissions in future years. TEP had sufficient Emissions Allowances to
comply with the Phase II SO2 regulations for compliance year 2003. However, due
to increased energy output and potential changes in the legislation affecting
SO2 Emission Allowances allocation, TEP may have to purchase additional
Emissions Allowances for future compliance years. Based on current estimates of
additional required Emissions Allowances and market prices, TEP believes that
purchases of Emissions Allowances will not have a material effect on TEP.
The EPA has issued a determination that coal and oil-fired electric utility
steam generating units must control their mercury emissions. Final regulations
are expected to be issued in December 2004. TEP may incur additional costs to
comply with recent and future changes in federal and state environmental laws,
regulations and permit requirements at existing electric generating facilities.
Compliance with these changes may result in a reduction in operating efficiency.
Income Tax Assessments
In 2003, the Arizona Department of Revenue issued a preliminary audit
report regarding its examination of state income tax returns for the period of
1990 through 2000. The initial review of the report resulted in a combined
additional expense of $1 million recorded on TEP and Nations Energy.
In 2002, the IRS audit for 1997-2000 was settled, and after reviewing the
impact of the audit findings as well as the effect of tax positions established
in relation to future tax years, TEP reversed $1 million of the deferred tax
valuation allowance. See Note 16.
In 2001, the IRS audit of 1994, 1995 and 1996 tax years was settled. After
reviewing the impact of the final assessment on TEP accrued tax liabilities
and the potential for assessments related to later tax years, no adjustments to
the deferred tax valuation allowance were deemed necessary in 2001.

UNISOURCE ENERGY CONTINGENCIES
Litigation Concerning the Proposed Acquisition Agreement
On November 24, 2003 two shareholder derivative lawsuits, McBride v.
Pignatelli, et al. and Zetooney v. Pignatelli, et al., were filed in the
Superior Court of the State of Arizona relating to the acquisition. In these two
lawsuits, which are virtually identical, the plaintiffs allege that UniSource
Energy Board of Directors, in its consideration and approval of the
acquisition agreement, breached its fiduciary duty to UniSource Energy
shareholders in approving the acquisition agreement. The plaintiffs, who request
that their suits be permitted to proceed as class actions, seek damages and an
order from the court declaring that UniSource Energy Board of Directors has
breached its fiduciary duties to UniSource Energy shareholders, ordering that
UniSource Energy Board of Directors take the steps specified in the complaint
to correct the alleged breaches of fiduciary duty and enjoining the acquisition
from proceeding. UniSource Energy believes that these lawsuits are without merit
and will vig orously defend them.
Acquisition Fees
UniSource Energy has entered into agreements with New Harbor Incorporated
New Harbor and Morgan Stanley & Co. Incorporated Morgan Stanley in
connection with the acquisition of UniSource Energy by Saguaro Utility. The
transaction fee payable to New Harbor is $9 million. UniSource Energy paid New
Harbor $2 million upon announcement of the transaction in November 2003, with
the balance of the transaction fee contingent and payable upon the closing of
the transaction. UniSource Energy paid Morgan Stanley $1 million in November
2003, and will pay Morgan Stanley $04 million contingent and payable upon
shareholders approving the transaction and $1 million contingent and payable
upon the acquisition closing. UniSource Energy has agreed to pay Morgan Stanley
a transaction fee of up to $4 million, including their monthly advisory fee, in
connection with the acquisition.
In certain circumstances, in the event of termination of the acquisition
agreement, UniSource Energy would be required to pay Saguaro Acquisition Corp.
expenses and a termination fee in an aggregate amount of up to $25 million.
TEP CONTINGENCIES
Springerville Generating Station Complaint
Environmental activist groups have expressed concerns regarding the
construction of any new units at the Springerville Generating Station. In
January 2003, environmental activist groups appealed an ACC Order affirming the
ACC approval of the expansion at the Springerville Generating Station to the
Superior Court of the State of Arizona. On October 22, 2003, the Superior Court
affirmed the ACC issuance of the Certificate of Environmental Compatibility
for Springerville Generating Station. The Court granted TEP and the ACC motion
for summary judgment from the environmental activist groups. The environmental
activist groups appealed the Superior Court decision on December 30, 2003 and
filed an amended notice of appeal on January 2, 2004.
K-112   In November 2001, the Grand Canyon Trust GCT, an environmental activist
group, filed a complaint in U.S. District Court against TEP for alleged
violations of the Clean Air Act at the Springerville Generating Station. The
complaint alleged that more stringent emission standards should apply to Units 1
and 2. These standards would require new permits and the installation of
additional facilities, meeting Best Available Control Technology standards, for
the continued operation of Units 1 and 2. In 2002, the U.S. District Court
granted TEP motion for summary judgment on one of the primary issues in the
case: whether TEP commenced construction within 18 months and/or by March 19,
1979, after the original 1977 air permit covering Units 1 and 2 was issued. The
Court found that TEP had commenced construction of the Springerville Generating
Station in the time periods required by the original permits. There were two
remaining allegations: that a TEP discontinued construction for a period of 18
months or longer and did not complete construction in a reasonable period of
time, and b TEP did not commence construction, for purposes of New Source
Performance Standard applicability, by September 18, 1978. On March 4, 2003, the
U.S. District Court determined that the GCT had not commenced the case on a
timely basis and dismissed the case. The GCT has appealed this decision to the
U.S. Court of Appeals.
TEP believes these claims are without merit and intends to vigorously
contest them.
Litigation and Claims Related to San Juan Generating Station
On May 16, 2002, the GCT and the Sierra Club filed a citizen lawsuit under
the Clean Air Act in federal district court in New Mexico against Public Service
Company of New Mexico PNM as operator of San Juan. TEP owns 50% of San Juan
Units 1 and 2, which equates to 198% of the total San Juan Station. The lawsuit
alleges two violations of the Clean Air Act and related regulations and permits.
One of the two claims, concerning the initial permitting of San Juan, was
dismissed by the court in August 2003. The remaining claim went to trial in
November 2003 with a decision expected in early 2004, and alleged that PNM
violated its present Title V operating permit by exceeding the 20% opacity
standard on numerous occasions between 1998 and 2002; opacity is a means to
monitor the particulate matter contained in an emission.
In September 2003, the New Mexico Environment Department NMED notified
PNM, operator of San Juan, of alleged excess emissions and opacity in violation
of the permits at San Juan. The NMED issued a draft compliance order assessing
unspecified civil penalties. PNM has entered into discussions with the NMED
concerning the alleged excess emissions and opacity violations. No compliance
order has been issued in this matter.
Based on the information available to date, TEP does not believe resolution
of these matters will be material to TEP.
Postretirement and Pension Benefit Costs at Various Generating Stations
The coal suppliers to Springerville Generating Station and each of TEP
remote generating stations have submitted demands for payment by TEP of
postretirement and pension benefit costs for these coal suppliers' employees
under the coal supply agreements with TEP. Peabody Western Coal Company
Peabody, the coal supplier to the Navajo Generating Station, has filed a
lawsuit against the participants at Navajo, including TEP, for retiree
postretirement benefit costs. TEP owns 75% of the Navajo Generating Station. In
December 2003, the Navajo participants and Peabody agreed to stay the discovery
process in this litigation until August 31, 2004 to give the parties time to
explore a possible settlement. To the extent that amounts become known and
payment probable, TEP will record a liability for additional postretirement and
pension benefit costs at the Springerville, Navajo, and San Juan Generating
Stations. TEP does not expect any settlement to be material to TEP.
The claim for postretirement at Four Corners was settled as part of the
coal contract extension. TEP paid $03 million for postretirement benefits in
settlement in September 2003.
K-113   Environmental Reclamation at Remote Generating Stations
TEP pays on-going reclamation costs at each of its remote generating
stations, and it is probable that TEP will have to pay a portion of final
reclamation costs at the coal mines which supply the remote generating stations.
In June 2003, TEP received an estimate of the reclamation liability at the coal
mine that supplies San Juan in which post-term reclamation activities are
assumed to occur over a 16-year period beginning in 2028. The expected aggregate
undiscounted reclamation liability totals $122 million of which TEP portion of
the liability, based on its ownership of San Juan, totals $24 million. The
present value of TEP liability for post-term reclamation at a 10%
credit-adjusted risk free rate approximates $7 million at December 31, 2017, the
expiration date of the coal supply agreement, and will be recognized over the
remaining term of the coal supply agreement. At December 31, 2003, TEP has
recorded $03 million of its post-term reclamation liability at San Juan.
Amounts recorded for p ost-term reclamation are subject to various assumptions
and determinations, such as estimating the costs of reclamation, estimating when
final reclamation will occur, and the credit-adjusted risk-free interest rate to
be used to discount future liabilities. Changes that may arise over time with
regard to these assumptions and determinations will change amounts recorded in
the future as expense for post-term reclamation. TEP does not believe that
recognition of its post-term reclamation obligation at San Juan will be material
to TEP in any single year since recognition occurs over the remaining 14 year
life of its coal supply agreement.
Although a cost is probable at TEP other remote generating stations, it
is not possible at this time to reasonably estimate the amount of any obligation
for final reclamation because remediation alternatives have not yet advanced to
the stage where a reasonable estimate of any cost can be made. As amounts become
known, TEP will recognize a liability for final reclamation over the remaining
lives of its coal supply agreements.
RESOLUTION OF TEP COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES
Litigation Related to San Juan Coal Company
In August 2003, San Juan Coal Company, the coal supplier to San Juan,
entered into a settlement agreement with Dugan Production Corp. Dugan. The San
Juan Coal Company, through leases with the federal government and the State of
New Mexico, owns coal interests with respect to an underground mine. Dugan,
through leases with the federal government, the State of New Mexico and certain
private parties, owns certain oil and gas interests in portions of the land used
for the underground mine. Dugan alleged that San Juan Coal Company underground
coal mining operations have or will interfere with Dugan gas production and
will reduce the amount of natural gas that Dugan would otherwise be entitled to
recover. The settlement agreement provides that San Juan Coal Company will
compensate Dugan for any remaining gas production from a well when San Juan Coal
Company determines that mining activity is close enough to warrant shutting down
a well. Dugan agreed not to drill any additional wells. This settleme nt is not
expected to be material to TEP.
Sundt Coal Contract Termination
In the third quarter of 2002, TEP terminated a coal supply agreement for
the Sundt Generating Station. As a result, TEP recorded a pre-tax charge of
$113 million and made an $113 million payment in the third quarter of 2002.
The additional expense was mitigated by TEP not being required to make a
take-or-pay penalty payment of approximately $35 million for the year 2002 and
subsequent years.
San Juan Coal Contract Amendment
In September 2000, TEP terminated the San Juan Generating Station coal
supply contract and entered into a new coal supply contract, replacing two
surface mining operations with one underground operation. To terminate the
contract, TEP made a $15 million payment in December 2002. In September 2000, as
a result of this scheduled payment, TEP recorded a pre-tax $13 million Coal
Contract Amendment Fee expense and a non-current liability which equaled the
present value of the $15 million payment. TEP recognized interest expense,
included in the Interest Imputed on Losses Recorded at Present Value line item
on the income statements, and increased its liability until the payment was
made.
K-114  GUARANTEES AND INDEMNITIES
In the normal course of business, UniSource Energy and certain
subsidiaries, including TEP, enter into various agreements providing financial
or performance assurance to third parties on behalf of certain subsidiaries. We
enter into these agreements primarily to support or enhance the creditworthiness
of a subsidiary on a stand-alone basis. The most significant of these guarantees
are 1 UES' guarantee of $160 million of aggregate principal amount of senior
unsecured notes issued by UNS Gas and UNS Electric to purchase the Citizens
Arizona gas and electric system assets, 2 UniSource Energy guarantee of
approximately $22 million in natural gas transportation and supply payments in
addition to building lease payments for UNS Gas, UES, UNS Electric, and
subsidiaries of Millennium, and 3 Millennium guarantee of approximately $5
million in commodity-related payments for MEG at December 31, 2003. To the
extent liabilities exist under the contracts subject to these guarantees, such
liabilities are inclu ded in UniSource Energy consolidated balance sheets.
In addition, UniSource Energy and its subsidiaries have indemnified the
purchasers of interests in certain investments from additional taxes due for
years prior to the sale. The terms of the indemnifications provide for no
limitation on potential future payments; however, we believe that we have abided
by all tax laws and paid all tax obligations. We have not made any payments
under the terms of these indemnifications to date.
We believe that the likelihood UniSource Energy, TEP, UES, or Millennium
would be required to perform or otherwise incur any significant losses
associated with any of these guarantees or indemnities is remote.

We record deferred tax liabilities for amounts that will increase income
taxes on future tax returns. We record deferred tax assets for amounts that
could be used to reduce income taxes on future tax returns. We record a Deferred
Tax Assets Valuation Allowance for the amount of Deferred Tax Assets that we may
not be able to use on future tax returns. We estimate the valuation allowance
based on our interpretation of the tax rules, prior tax audits, tax planning
strategies, scheduled reversal of deferred tax liabilities, and projected future
taxable income.
The valuation allowance of $9 million at December 31, 2003 and $22 million
at December 31, 2002, which reduces the Deferred Tax Asset balance, relates to
NOL and Investment Tax Credit ITC carryforward amounts. The decrease of $15
million reflects UniSource Energy and TEP expectation to be able to use a
portion of these carryforward amounts on future tax returns, primarily based on
guidance issued by the Internal Revenue Service in September 2003. In the
future if UniSource Energy and TEP determine that it is probable that TEP will
not be able to use all or a portion of the NOL and ITC carryforward amounts,
then UniSource Energy and TEP would record a valuation allowance and recognize
tax expense. Factors that could cause TEP to record a valuation allowance would
be a change in expected future taxable income or a change in tax filing status
due to the proposed acquisition. See Note 2, Proposed Acquisition of UniSource
Energy. The valuation allowance of $9 million remaining at December 31, 2003
relates to losses generated by the Millennium entities. In the future if
UniSource Energy and the Millennium entities determine that all or a portion of
the remaining amounts may be used on tax returns, then UniSource Energy and the
Millennium entities would reduce the valuation allowance and recognize a tax
benefit of up to $9 million. The primary factor that could cause the Millennium
entities to recognize a tax benefit would be a change in expected future
taxable income.
In 2002, the Deferred Tax Assets Valuation Allowance decreased $1 million
due primarily to the settlement of audits. In 2001, there was no change in the
Deferred Tax Assets Valuation Allowance.
In 2003, the deferred tax liability for timing differences related to
Plant-Net increased $82 million. This increase is primarily due to the reversal
of previously recorded deferred tax assets of $44 million related to the
adoption of FAS 143 see Note 5, and the recognition of additional deferred tax
liabilities of $8 million due to the election of bonus depreciation for federal
income tax purposes and $30 million due to a change in the method of
capitalizing indirect costs for income tax purposes.
TEP had a net intercompany tax payable to affiliates of $20 million at
December 31, 2003 and zero at December 31, 2002. These amounts are included in
TEP intercompany accounts on its balance sheet.
In 2003, UniSource Energy recognized $08 million of tax and interest
expense in anticipation of settlement of state income tax audits and settlement
of a state sales tax audit. These amounts are included in current and deferred
tax expense benefit in the following table.
In 2002, UniSource Energy recognized a tax benefit of $15 million as a
result of final agreement with the IRS on audit issues and a tax benefit of $10
million from recognition of losses generated by the sale of a Nations Energy
foreign entity.
K-116   In 2003, the tax effect of the exercise of certain employee stock options
that are recognized differently for financial reporting and tax purposes was not
recorded as a timing difference, but rather was credited to shareholder
equity. This resulted in a $08 million increase to the capital of UniSource
Energy. Additionally, in 2003, UniSource Energy and TEP incurred certain legal
and advisory fees that result in no current or future tax deductions, creating
current tax expense with no deferred asset, otherwise known as a permanent
difference.

generation of sufficient future taxable income at the separate company level.
OTHER TAXES
TEP and UES act as conduits or collection agents for excise tax sales tax
as well as franchise fees and regulatory assessments. They record liabilities
payable to governmental agencies when they bill their customers for these
amounts. Neither the amounts billed nor payable are reflected in the income
statement.
NOTE 17. EMPLOYEE BENEFIT PLANS
- 
PENSION BENEFIT PLANS
TEP and UES maintain noncontributory, defined benefit pension plans for
substantially all regular employees and certain affiliate employees. Benefits
are based on years of service and the employee average compensation. TEP and
UES fund the plans by contributing at least the minimum amount required under
Internal Revenue Service regulations. Additionally, we provide supplemental
retirement benefits to certain employees whose benefits are limited by IRS
benefit or compensation limitations.
OTHER POSTRETIREMENT BENEFIT PLANS
TEP provides limited health care and life insurance benefits for retirees.
All regular employees may become eligible for these benefits if they reach
retirement age while working for TEP or an affiliate.
TEP amended its other postretirement benefit plan to cap Medicare
supplement payments for all current retirees under age 65 and all classified
employees retiring after December 31, 2002 and eliminate post-65 medical
benefits for all salaried employees retiring after January 1, 2002. These
amendments required TEP to recalculate benefits related to participants' past
service. TEP is amortizing the change in the benefit cost from these plan
amendments on a straight-line basis over 10 years.
UniSource Energy acquired the Arizona gas and electric system assets from
Citizens on August 11, 2003, assuming a $2 million liability for postretirement
medical benefits for current retirees and a small group of active employees. The
majority of UES employees do not currently participate in the postretirement
medical plan.
The ACC allows TEP and UES to recover postretirement costs through rates
only as benefit payments are made to or on behalf of retirees. The
postretirement benefits are currently funded entirely on a pay-as-you-go basis.
Under current accounting guidance, TEP and UES cannot record a regulatory asset
for the excess of expense calculated per Statement of Financial Accounting
Standards No. 106, Employers' Accounting for Postretirement Benefits Other Than
Pensions, over actual benefit payments.
The actuarial present values of the pension benefit obligations and other
postretirement benefit plans were measured at December 1. The change in benefit
obligation and plan assets and reconciliation of the funded status are as

Net periodic benefit cost is subject to various assumptions and
determinations, such as the discount rate, the rate of compensation increase,
and the expected return on plan assets. We estimated the expected return on plan
assets based on a review of the plans' asset allocations and consultations with
a third-party investment consultant and the plans' actuary considering market
and economic indicators, historical market returns, correlations and volatility,
central banks' and government treasury departments' forecasts and objectives,
and recent professional or academic research. Changes that may arise over time
with regard to these assumptions and determinations will change amounts recorded
in the future as net periodic benefit cost.

Plan Assets
TEP calculates the market-related value of plan assets using the fair value
of plan assets on the measurement date. TEP pension plan asset allocations at
December 31, 2003 and 2002, by asset category are as follows                         Plan Assets

Total             1000%   1000%
TEP investment policy for the pension plans targets a range of exposure
to the various asset classes surrounding the following allocations: equity
securities 65%, debt securities 23% and real estate 12%. TEP rebalances the
portfolio periodically when the portfolio allocation is not within the desired
range of exposure. The plan seeks to provide returns in excess of the portfolio
benchmark. The portfolio benchmark consists of the following indices: 55% S
500; 10% MSCI EAFE; 23% Lehman Aggregate; and 12% NCREIF. A third party
investment consultant track the plan portfolio relative to the benchmark and
provides quarterly investment reviews which consist of a performance and risk
assessment on all investment managers and on the portfolio.
Certain managers within the plan use, or have authorization to use,
derivative financial instruments for risk management purposes or as a part of
their investment strategy. Currency hedges have also been used for defensive
purposes. Leverage is used by real estate managers but is limited by investment
policy.
The UES pension plan is not yet funded but is expected to follow a similar
investment policy and target asset allocation strategy.
K-121   Contributions
TEP expects to contribute $6 million to its pension plans in 2004 and UES
expects to contribute $05 million.
DEFINED CONTRIBUTION PLANS
TEP and UES sponsor defined contribution savings plans that are offered to
all eligible employees. Certain affiliate employees are also eligible to
participate. The plans are qualified 401k plans under the Internal Revenue
Code. In a defined contribution plan, the benefits a participant is to receive
result from regular contributions to a participant account. Participants direct
the investment of contributions to certain funds in their account. Matching
contributions to participant accounts are made under these plans. Matching
contributions to these plans were approximately $3 million in each of 2003, 2002
and 2001.
NOTE 18. STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION PLANS
- 
We have two stock-based compensation plans, the 1994 Outside Director Stock
Option Plan Directors' Plan and the 1994 Omnibus Stock and Incentive Plan
Omnibus Plan. The Directors' Plan provided for annual awards of non-qualified
stock options and restricted shares or stock units to each eligible director.
The Omnibus Plan allowed the Compensation Committee, a committee of non-employee
directors, to grant the following types of awards to each eligible employee:
stock options; stock appreciation rights; restricted stock; stock units;
performance shares; and dividend equivalents.
Under the Directors' Plan and the Omnibus Plan, we were previously
authorized to grant up to a total of 324,000 and 41 million shares,
respectively. The acquisition agreement discussed in Note 2 limits the amount of
capital stock that UniSource Energy can issue under its stock plans, and
requires that all of UniSource Energy stock plans must be terminated effective
as of the closing of the acquisition.
At December 31, 2003, we had stock options, stock units, performance shares
and restricted stock grants outstanding as discussed below.
Stock Options
We granted stock options to key TEP and Millennium employees and members of
the Board of Directors during 2003, 2002, and 2001. All stock options were
granted at exercise prices equal to the market price of the common stock at the
grant date. Options vest over three years, become exercisable in one-third
increments on each anniversary date of the grant and expire on the tenth
anniversary of the grant.
A summary of the stock option activity of the Directors' Plan and Omnibus
Plan is as follows              2003        2002        2001

-                     K-122   As discussed in Note 1, we apply APB 25 in accounting for our stock option
plans. We have not recognized any compensation cost for these options because
our stock options are granted with an exercise price equal to the market value
of the stock at the grant date. We have also adopted the disclosure-only
provisions of FAS 123. We present, in Note 1, the effect on net income and
earnings per share as if the company had applied the fair value recognition
provisions of FAS 123, as required by FAS 148.
Stock options awarded on January 1, 2002 accrue dividend equivalents that
are paid in cash on the earlier of the date of exercise of the underlying option
or the date the option expires. Compensation expense is recognized as dividends
are declared. In 2003 and 2002, we recognized compensation expense of $03
million for dividend equivalents on stock option grants.
Restricted Stock and Stock Units
In 2003 and 2002, we granted restricted stock awards to directors totaling
5,157 shares and 4,644 shares, respectively. The grant date fair value of the
shares was $1744 per share in 2003 and $1935 per share in 2002. Directors may
elect to receive stock units in lieu of restricted shares. The restricted shares
or stock units become 100% vested on the third anniversary of the grant date.
Compensation expense equal to the fair market value on the date of the award is
recognized over the vesting period. We recorded compensation expense of less
than $01 million in 2003 and 2002 related to these awards.
There were no new stock unit awards granted under the Omnibus Plan in 2003,
2002 or 2001. When awards are granted, compensation expense equal to the fair
market value on the date of the award is recognized over a three or four year
vesting period. We recognized compensation expense related to earlier awards of
$03less than $1 million in 2003, $05 million in 2002 and $09 million in
2001.each of the last three years.
Fully vested but undistributed stock unit awards accrue dividend equivalent
stock units based on the fair market value of common shares on the date the
dividend is paid. Compensation expense is recognized when dividends are
declared. We recorded compensation expense of $02 million in 2003 for dividend
equivalent stock units.
Performance Shares
In May 2003, the Board of Directors approved a grant of performance shares
to key employees under the Omnibus Plan. The shares may be awarded at the end of
a three-year performance period based on goal attainment. Exceptional
performance will result in an award of 134,000 shares. The grant date fair value
was $1784 per share. Compensation expense is recorded over the performance
period based on the anticipated number and market value of shares to be awarded.
Compensation expense of $07 million was recorded in 2003 for this new incentive
plan.
NOTE 19. UNISOURCE ENERGY EARNINGS PER SHARE EPS
- 
Basic EPS is computed by dividing net income by the weighted average number
of common shares outstanding during the period. Diluted EPS assumes that
proceeds from the hypothetical exercise of stock options and other stock-based
awards are used to repurchase outstanding shares of stock at the average fair
market price during the reporting period. The numerator in calculating both
basic and diluted earnings per share for each period is Net Income. The
following table shows the effects of potential dilutive common stock on the
weighted average number of shares                    K-123                         Years Ended December 31,

Options to purchase an average of 274,000 and 525,000 shares of common
stock were outstanding during the years 2003 and 2002, respectively, but were
not included in the computation of diluted EPS because the options' exercise
price was greater than the average market price of the common stock.
At December 31, 2003, UniSource Energy had no outstanding warrants. There
were 46 million warrants that were exercisable into TEP common stock until
December 15, 2002, when they expired. The dilutive effect of these warrants was
the same as it would have been if the warrants were exercisable into UniSource
Energy Common Stock.

The principal unusual items for TEP and UniSource Energy include   TEP and UniSource Energy
- FIRST QUARTER 2003: TEP recorded an after-tax gain of $67 million for the
cumulative effect of adopting FAS 143. See Note 5.
- FOURTH QUARTER 2003: TEP recognized a $15 million tax benefit due to a
reduction in its NOL valuation allowance. See Note 16. UniSource Energy
recorded $3 million of acquisition-related fees, 80% of which were allocated to
TEP. These fees do not result in a current or future tax deduction. See Note
16.
- THIRD QUARTER 2002: TEP recorded a one-time $11 million pre-tax expense
related to the termination of the Sundt coal contract. See Note 15. TEP also
recognized a $2 million tax benefit due to the resolution of various tax items.
See Note 16.
UniSource Energy
- FOURTH QUARTER 2003: UED recognized an $11 million pre-tax development
fee for closing the Springerville expansion project. See Note 14. This quarter
also includes the first full quarter of activity for UES which was established
on August 11, 2003. UES contributed Operating Revenues of $69 million, Operating
Income of $7 million and Net Income of $3 million to fourth quarter results.
- THIRD QUARTER 2002: Millennium recognized a $3 million tax benefit due to
the resolution of various tax items. See Note 16.
Reclassifications
In the third quarter of 2002, TEP began reporting purchase and sale
transactions under a Resource Management agreement with one of its
counterparties on a net basis, because TEP purchases and sales to this
counterparty exactly offset each other and are made only for scheduling
purposes. TEP reclassified Purchased Power related to its purchases from the
counterparty as a reduction of Electric Wholesale RevenuesSales related to its
sales to the counterparty. This reclassification to a net presentation was based
on TEP interpretation of EITF 99-19, Reporting Revenue Gross as a Principal
versus Net as an Agent. In the fourth quarter of 2003, TEP identified an
additional contract with a subsidiary of the same counterparty that required a
similar reclassification.
In the fourth quarter of 2003, TEP changed its income statement
presentation of unrealized gains and losses on derivatives. Net unrealized gains
and losses on forward sales contracts are now presented as a component of
Electric Wholesale Sales and net unrealized gains and losses on forward purchase
contracts are presented as a component of Purchased Power expense consistent
with the presentation of realized gains and losses on such contracts. Previously
the unrealized gains and losses on forward sales and purchase contracts were
combined in a separate line item under Operating Revenues.

-  1 The deferred tax assets valuation allowance reduces the deferred tax asset
balance. It relates to NOL and ITC carryforward amounts. UniSource, TEP and
Subsidiaries charged approximately $7 million to income in 2002 relating to the
limitation on the utilization of operating losses generated by certain
Millennium entities. UniSource, TEP and Subsidiaries reduced the deferred tax
assets valuation in 2002 due to the settlement of Internal Revenue Service
audits. UniSource, TEP and Subsidiaries charged $2 million to income in 2003
relating to the limitation on the utilization of operating losses generated by
certain Millennium entities. UniSource, TEP and Subsidiaries reduced the
deferred tax assets valuation in 2003 primarily based on guidance issued by the
Internal Revenue Service in September, 2003 see Note 16 of Notes to
Consolidated Financial Statements.
2 TEP recorded $7 million of expense in the first quarter of 2001 and $9
million in the fourth quarter of 2000 to reserve for uncollectible amounts
related to sales to the state of California in 2000 and the first quarter of
2001. TEP reversed $8 million of the $16 million reserve in the fourth quarter
of 2001. In the first quarter of 2003, TEP increased its reserve for sales to
the CPX and the CISO by $2 million by recording a reduction of wholesale
revenues. Deductions principally reflect amounts charged off as uncollectible,
less amounts recovered see Note 13 of Notes to Consolidated Financial
Statements.

Item 4. -- CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES
- 
UniSource Energy and TEP have disclosure controls and procedures to
ensure that material information recorded, processed, summarized and reported in
their filings with the SEC is on an accurate and timely basis. Management of
UniSource Energy and TEP, with the participation of the principal executive
officer and principal financial officer of UniSource Energy and TEP have
evaluated these disclosure controls and procedures as defined in Rules
13a-15e and 15d-15e under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended
as of December 31, 2003. Based on such evaluation, the principal executive
officer and principal financial officer of UniSource Energy and TEP have
concluded that such disclosure controls and procedures were, as of such date,
effective at ensuring that material information is recorded, processed,
summarized and reported accurately and within the time periods specified by the
SEC rules and forms. Since such evaluation there have not been any significant
changes in UniSource Energy and TEP internal controls, over financial
reporting that has, or is reasonably likely to, materially affect these
controls.
