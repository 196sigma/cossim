ITEM 8. FINANCIAL STATEMENTS           REPORT OF INDEPENDENT PUBLIC ACCOUNTANTS To the Board of Directors and Stockholders
of Valero Energy Corporation     We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Valero
Energy Corporation a Delaware corporation and subsidiaries as of December 31,
2000 and 1999, and the related consolidated statements of income, common
stockholders' equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period
ended December 31, 2000. These financial statements are the responsibility of
the Company management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these
financial statements based on our audits.
We conducted our audits in accordance with auditing standards generally
accepted in the United States. Those standards require that we plan and perform
the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements
are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis,
evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An
audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant
estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial
statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis
for our opinion.
In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present
fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Valero Energy
Corporation and subsidiaries as of December 31, 2000 and 1999, and the results
of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the
period ended December 31, 2000, in conformity with accounting principles
generally accepted in the United States.

VALERO ENERGY CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 1. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
PRINCIPLES OF CONSOLIDATION AND BASIS OF PRESENTATION
As used in this report, the term Valero may refer, depending upon the
context, to Valero Energy Corporation, one or more of its consolidated
subsidiaries, or all of them taken as a whole.
Valero was incorporated in Delaware in 1981 under the name Valero
Refining and Marketing Company as a wholly owned subsidiary of a separate
corporation named at that time Valero Energy Corporation, or Old Valero. Old
Valero was engaged in both the refining and marketing business and the natural
gas related services business. On July 31, 1997, Old Valero spun off Valero to
Old Valero stockholders and, with its remaining natural gas related services
business, merged with a wholly owned subsidiary of PG Corporation the
Restructuring. Upon completion of the Restructuring, Valero name was
changed from Valero Refining and Marketing Company to Valero Energy Corporation.
All significant intercompany transactions have been eliminated in
consolidation. Certain prior period amounts have been reclassified for
comparative purposes. See NEW ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS with regard to certain
reclassifications made in connection with Valero adoption in 2000 of the
consensus under the Financial Accounting Standards Board FASB Emerging
Issues Task Force EITF Issue No. 00-1, Investor Balance Sheet and Income
Statement Display under the Equity Method for Investments in Certain
Partnerships and Other Ventures.
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally
accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and
assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and
disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial
statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the
reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.
REVENUE RECOGNITION
Revenues generally are recorded when title has transferred, and include
any shipping and handling fees charged to sales customers.
SHIPPING AND HANDLING COSTS
Costs incurred for shipping and handling are included in the
accompanying Consolidated Statements of Income under Cost of sales and
operating expenses.                    46

VALERO ENERGY CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - CONTINUED PRICE RISK MANAGEMENT ACTIVITIES
The accounting policies described below in this section reflect the
policies followed by Valero with respect to its price risk management activities
in the preparation of the accompanying consolidated financial statements, prior
to the adoption, effective January 1, 2001, of FASB Statement No. 133,
Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities, as amended. See
NEW ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS for a detailed description of FASB 133,
including how the adoption of this statement is expected to affect Valero
consolidated financial statements in the future.
Valero uses derivative commodity instruments such as futures, options
and swaps with third parties to hedge certain refinery feedstock and refined
product inventories in order to reduce the impact of adverse price changes on
these inventories before the conversion of the feedstock to finished products
and ultimate sale. Hedges of inventories were accounted for under the deferral
method with gains and losses included in the carrying amounts of inventories and
ultimately recognized in cost of sales as those inventories were sold.
Valero also uses derivative commodity instruments such as futures,
options and swaps with third parties to hedge the price risk of anticipated
transactions. These instruments are used to hedge anticipated feedstock, product
and natural gas purchases, product sales, and refining operating margins by
locking in purchase or sales prices or components of refining operating margins,
including feedstock discounts, crack spreads and premium product differentials.
Hedges of anticipated transactions were also accounted for under the deferral
method with gains and losses on these transactions recognized when the hedged
transaction occurred, or when the amount of the hedged transaction, combined
with the hedging instrument, was not deemed to be recoverable.
Derivative commodity contracts were designated at inception as a hedge
when there was a direct relationship to the price risk associated with Valero
inventories, future purchases and sales of commodities used in Valero
operations, or components of Valero refining operating margins. If this direct
relationship ceased to exist, the related contract was designated for trading
purposes and accounted for as described below.
Gains and losses on early terminations of financial instrument contracts
designated as hedges were deferred and included in cost of sales in the
measurement of the hedged transaction. When an anticipated transaction being
hedged was no longer likely to occur, the related derivative contract was
accounted for similar to a contract entered into for trading purposes.
Valero also uses derivative commodity instruments such as futures,
options and swaps with third parties for trading purposes using its fundamental
and technical analysis of market conditions to earn additional income. Contracts
entered into for trading purposes were accounted for under the fair value
method. Changes in the fair value of these contracts were recognized as gains or
losses in cost of sales currently and were recorded in the Consolidated Balance
Sheets in Prepaid expenses and other and Accounts payable at fair value at
the reporting date.                    47
51
VALERO ENERGY CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - CONTINUED     Valero determined the fair value of its exchange-traded contracts based
on the settlement prices for open contracts, which were established by the
exchange on which the instruments were traded. The fair value of Valero
over-the-counter contracts was determined based on market-related indexes or by
obtaining quotes from brokers.
Valero derivative contracts and their related gains and losses were
reported in the Consolidated Balance Sheets and Consolidated Statements of
Income as discussed above, depending on whether they were designated as a hedge
or for trading purposes. In the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows, cash
transactions related to derivative contracts were included in Changes in
current assets and current liabilities.
CASH AND TEMPORARY CASH INVESTMENTS
Valero temporary cash investments are highly liquid, low-risk debt
instruments which have a maturity of three months or less when acquired.
INVENTORIES
Inventories are carried at the lower of cost or market. The cost of
refinery feedstocks purchased for processing and produced products are
determined primarily under the last-in, first-out LIFO method of inventory
pricing, and the cost of feedstocks and products purchased for resale are
determined under the weighted average cost method. At December 31, 2000, the
replacement cost of Valero LIFO inventories exceeded their LIFO carrying
values by approximately $230 million. The cost of materials and supplies is
determined principally under the weighted average cost method. Inventories as of
December 31, 2000 and 1999 were as follows in thousands                      December 31,
2000     1999
Refinery feedstocks..   $142,522   $ 61,649
Refined products and blendstocks    332,653    183,519
Materials and supplies..    64,707    52,879
$539,882   $298,047
Refinery feedstock and refined product and blendstock inventory volumes
totaled 217 million barrels and 152 million barrels as of December 31, 2000
and 1999, respectively. The increase was primarily attributable to the
inventories purchased as part of the Benicia Acquisition described in Note 3.
See Note 8 for information concerning Valero hedging activities related to its
refinery feedstock and refined product inventories.                    48

VALERO ENERGY CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - CONTINUED PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT
Property additions and betterments include capitalized interest and
acquisition costs allocable to construction and property purchases.
The costs of minor property units or components of property units, net
of salvage, retired or abandoned are charged or credited to accumulated
depreciation under the composite method of depreciation. Gains or losses on
sales or other dispositions of major units of property are credited or charged
to income.
Major classes of property, plant and equipment as of December 31, 2000
and 1999 were as follows in thousands                       December 31,
2000      1999

$3,481,117   $2,606,454
Provision for depreciation of property, plant and equipment is made
primarily on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of the
depreciable facilities. A summary of the principal rates used in computing the
annual provision for depreciation, primarily utilizing the composite method and
including estimated salvage values, is as follows                            Weighted

Refinery Turnaround Costs
Costs incurred in connection with planned major maintenance activities
at Valero refineries refinery turnaround costs are deferred when incurred
and amortized on a straight-line basis over that period of time estimated to
lapse until the next turnaround occurs. These costs include, among other things,
the cost to repair, restore, refurbish or replace refinery equipment such as i
vessels, tanks and reactors, ii piping, valves and fittings, iii rotating                    49

VALERO ENERGY CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - CONTINUED equipment, iv instrumentation, v electrical equipment, vi heat exchangers
and vii fired heaters. As of December 31, 2000 and 1999, the balance of
deferred turnaround costs was $902 million and $492 million, respectively.
Fixed-Bed Catalyst Costs
Fixed-bed catalyst costs are deferred when incurred and amortized on a
straight-line basis over the estimated useful life of that catalyst, normally
one to three years. As of December 31, 2000 and 1999, the balance of deferred
catalyst costs was $273 million and $168 million, respectively.
Technological Royalties and Licenses
Technological royalties and licenses are deferred when incurred and
amortized on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful life of each
particular royalty or license. As of December 31, 2000 and 1999, the balance of
deferred royalties and licenses was $262 million and $257 million,
respectively.
Retail Branding Rights
As discussed in Note 3, Valero acquired Exxon Mobil Corporation
Exxon-branded California retail assets in the second quarter of 2000. In
connection with this acquisition, Valero received the exclusive rights to offer
the Exxon brand throughout the state of California except for the San Francisco
Bay area for a ten-year period. The value assigned to this right of $35 million
was deferred and is being amortized over the ten-year term of the rights
agreement.
Other Deferred Charges and Other Assets
Other deferred charges and other assets include Valero 20% interest in
Javelina Company, a general partnership that owns a refinery off-gas processing
plant in Corpus Christi, Texas. Valero accounts for its interest in Javelina on
the equity method of accounting. Also included in other deferred charges and
other assets is Valero interest in the Clear Lake, Texas methanol plant, which
is owned by a joint venture between a Valero subsidiary and Celanese Ltd.
Effective in the second quarter of 2000, Valero changed the financial statement
presentation of its interest in this methanol plant from a proportionate gross
presentation to a single-amount equity method presentation in connection with
adopting the consensus under EITF Issue No. 00-1. See NEW ACCOUNTING
PRONOUNCEMENTS. Other deferred charges and other assets also include prefunded

remediation obligations incurred in connection with Valero acquisition of the
Paulsboro Refinery see Note 3.
FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS
The carrying amounts of Valero financial instruments approximate fair
value, except for certain long-term debt and financial instruments used in
price risk management activities. See Notes 5 and 8.
STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION
Valero accounts for its employee stock compensation plans using the
intrinsic value method of accounting set forth in Accounting Principles Board
APB Opinion No. 25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees, and related
interpretations. Accordingly, compensation cost for stock options is measured as
the excess, if any, of the quoted market price of Valero common stock at the
date of the grant over the amount an employee must pay to acquire the stock.
FASB Statement No. 123, Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation, encourages,
but does not require companies to measure and recognize in their financial
statements a compensation cost for stock-based employee compensation plans based
on the fair value method of accounting set forth in the statement. See Note 12
for the pro forma effects on net income and earnings per share had compensation
cost for Valero stock-based compensation plans been determined consistent with
FASB 123.                    51

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - CONTINUED EARNINGS PER SHARE
Basic and diluted earnings per share are presented on the face of the
accompanying Consolidated Statements of Income in accordance with the provisions
of FASB Statement No. 128, Earnings per Share. Basic earnings per share is
computed by dividing income available to common stockholders by the weighted
average number of common shares outstanding for the period. Diluted earnings per
share reflects the potential dilution of Valero outstanding stock options and
performance awards granted to employees in connection with Valero stock
compensation plans see Note 12 for all periods presented. The weighted average
number of common shares outstanding for the years ended December 31, 2000, 1999
and 1998 was 58,532,326, 56,086,381 and 56,077,671, respectively.
The computation of basic and diluted per share amounts, as required by
FASB 128, is as follows dollars and shares in thousands, except per share

Because Valero reported a net loss for the year ended December 31, 1998,
various stock options and performance awards which were granted to employees in
connection with Valero stock compensation plans and were outstanding during
1998 were not included in the computation of diluted earnings per share because
the effect would have been antidilutive. At December 31, 1998, options to
purchase approximately 55 million common shares and performance awards totaling
approximately 100,000 shares were outstanding.                    52

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - CONTINUED NEW ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS
FASB 140
In September 2000, the FASB issued Statement No. 140, Accounting for
Transfers and Servicing of Financial Assets and Extinguishments of Liabilities.
This statement replaces Statement 125 with the same name. Statement 140 revises
the standards for accounting for securitizations and other transfers of
financial assets and collateral and requires certain disclosures, but carries
over most of Statement 125 provisions without reconsideration. Statement 140
is effective for transfers and servicing of financial assets and extinguishments
of liabilities occurring after March 31, 2001. However, certain provisions
regarding the recognition and reclassification of collateral and certain
disclosures relating to securitization transactions and collateral are effective
for Valero financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2000. The
adoption of this statement with regard to the provisions for the recognition and
reclassification of collateral did not affect Valero accompanying consolidated
financial statements. In addition, Valero believes that the adoption of this
statement with regard to the revised accounting standards effective for
transactions occurring after March 31, 2001 will not have a material effect on
its consolidated financial statements in the future. See Note 2 for disclosures
relating to securitization transactions and collateral as required by this
statement.
SAB 101
In December 1999, the SEC staff issued Staff Accounting Bulletin SAB
No. 101, Revenue Recognition, to provide guidance on the recognition,
presentation and disclosure of revenue in financial statements. SAB 101 reflects
the basic principles of revenue recognition in existing generally accepted
accounting principles and does not supercede any existing authoritative
literature. For calendar year-end companies, SAB 101, as amended, was required
to be adopted beginning in the fourth quarter of 2000. Valero believes that its
revenue recognition policies are consistent with those described in SAB 101. The
adoption of this SAB did not have a material effect on Valero accompanying
consolidated financial statements.
EITF 00-10
In the third quarter of 2000, the EITF finalized various consensuses in
connection with its Issue No. 00-10, Accounting for Shipping and Handling Fees
and Costs. The EITF concluded that i all amounts billed to a customer in a
sale transaction related to shipping and handling, if any, represent revenues
earned for the goods provided and should be classified as revenues in the income
statement, ii costs incurred for shipping and handling should not be deducted
from revenues i.e., netted against shipping and handling revenues in the
income statement and iii the classification in the income statement of costs
incurred for shipping and handling is an accounting policy decision that should
be disclosed under the requirements of APB Opinion No. 22, Disclosure of
Accounting Policies, and if shipping or handling costs are significant and are
not included in cost of sales, both the amounts of these costs and the line
items on the income statement that includes them should be disclosed. The
guidance in these consensuses was                    54

VALERO ENERGY CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - CONTINUED required to be adopted beginning in the fourth quarter of 2000, consistent with
the required adoption date for SAB 101 as described above. Valero believes that
its accounting policies are consistent with the guidance in these consensuses
see SHIPPING AND HANDLING COSTS above for Valero required accounting
policy disclosure. The adoption of these consensuses did not have a material
effect on Valero accompanying consolidated financial statements.
EITF 00-1
In May 2000, the EITF reached a consensus in connection with its Issue
No. 00-1, Investor Balance Sheet and Income Statement Display under the Equity
Method for Investments in Certain Partnerships and Other Ventures. This
consensus concluded that a proportionate gross financial statement presentation
is not appropriate for an investment in an unincorporated legal entity accounted
for by the equity method unless the investee is in either the construction
industry or an extractive industry such as oil and gas exploration and
production but not related activities such as refining, marketing or
transporting extracted mineral resources where there is a longstanding practice
of its use. In connection with adopting this consensus, Valero changed the
financial statement presentation of its interest in the Clear Lake, Texas
methanol plant from a proportionate gross presentation to a single-amount equity
method presentation. This change was effective with Valero Form 10-Q for the
quarter ended June 30, 2000 at which time comparative financial statements were
restated to conform with the consensus. The comparative financial statements
included in this Form 10-K have also been restated to conform with the
consensus. This single-amount presentation related to Valero investment in the
Clear Lake methanol plant is included in the accompanying Consolidated Balance
Sheets under Deferred charges and other assets and is included in the
accompanying Consolidated Statements of Income under Other income expense,

FIN 44
In March 2000, the FASB issued Interpretation No. 44, Accounting for
Certain Transactions involving Stock Compensation. This interpretation
clarifies the application of APB No. 25, Accounting for Stock Issued to
Employees, for certain issues including, among other things, i the definition
of employee for purposes of applying Opinion 25, ii the criteria for
determining whether a plan qualifies as a noncompensatory plan, iii the
accounting consequence of various modifications to the terms of a previously
fixed stock option or award, and iv the accounting for an exchange of stock
compensation awards in a business combination. This interpretation became
effective for Valero consolidated financial statements beginning July 1, 2000,
including the effects of applying this interpretation to certain specific events
that occurred prior to July 1, 2000. The adoption of this interpretation did not
have a material effect on Valero consolidated financial statements.
FASB 133
In June 1998, the FASB issued Statement No. 133, Accounting for
Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities. In June 1999, the FASB issued
Statement No. 137 which delayed the effective date of Statement 133 for                    55
59
VALERO ENERGY CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - CONTINUED one year to fiscal years beginning after June 15, 2000. In June 2000, the FASB
issued Statement No. 138 which amended various provisions of Statement 133.
Statement 133, as amended, establishes accounting and reporting standards
requiring that every derivative instrument including certain derivative
instruments embedded in hybrid instruments be recorded in the balance sheet as
either an asset or liability measured at its fair value. The statement requires
that changes in a derivative fair value be recognized currently in earnings
unless specific hedge accounting criteria are met. Special accounting for
qualifying hedges, as described further below, allows a derivative gains and
losses to offset related results on the hedged item in the income statement, and
requires that a company must formally document, designate, and assess the
effectiveness of transactions that receive hedge accounting. Statement 133 will
become effective for Valero consolidated financial statements beginning
January 1, 2001 and is not allowed to be applied retroactively to financial
statements of prior periods. With respect to hybrid instruments, Valero will
apply Statement 133, as allowed by the statement, to only those hybrid
instruments that were issued, acquired or substantively modified on or after
January 1, 1999. The adoption of this statement will not result in any
significant changes in Valero business practices, including its hedging and
trading activities as described in Note 8 and in Item 7A. Quantitative and
Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk; however, various systems
modifications have been required.
Statement 133, in part, allows special hedge accounting for fair value
and cash flow hedges. Statement 133 provides that the gain or loss on a
derivative instrument designated and qualifying as a fair value hedging
instrument, as well as the offsetting loss or gain on the hedged item
attributable to the hedged risk, be recognized currently in earnings in the same
accounting period. Statement 133 provides that the effective portion of the gain
or loss on a derivative instrument designated and qualifying as a cash flow
hedging instrument be reported as a component of other comprehensive income and
be reclassified into earnings in the same period or periods during which the
hedged forecasted transaction affects earnings. The remaining ineffective
portion of the gain or loss on the derivative instrument, if any, must be
recognized currently in earnings.
The transition adjustments recorded by Valero in connection with its
adoption of FASB 133 had the following effect on its financial statements as of

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - CONTINUED 2. ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE SECURITIZATION
In September 1999, Valero, through a wholly owned special purpose
subsidiary, entered into an agreement with a financial institution
Transferee to sell, on a revolving basis, up to $100 million of an undivided
percentage ownership interest in a designated pool of trade accounts receivable.
At the inception of the agreement in 1999, proceeds of $100 million were
received under this program which were used to reduce indebtedness under
Valero bank credit facilities. Under the agreement, which matures in September
of 2002, Valero retains the residual interest in the designated pool of
receivables. This retained interest, which is included in the receivables
balance reflected in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets, is recorded
at fair value. Due to i a short average collection cycle for such receivables
of less than one month, ii Valero collection experience history, and iii
the composition of the designated pool of trade accounts receivable that are
part of this program, the fair value of Valero retained interest approximates
the total amount of the designated pool of receivables reduced by the
outstanding balance of receivables sold to the Transferee under the program.
Under this receivable securitization agreement, the Transferee has no
recourse to any other assets of Valero. Valero remains responsible for servicing
the transferred receivables and pays certain fees to the Transferee related to
its sale of receivables under this program. During 2000 and 1999, the costs
incurred by Valero related to this program, which are included in Other Income
Expense, Net in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Income, were $68
million and $16 million, respectively. During 2000, as a result of the short
average collection cycle discussed above, proceeds from collections under this
revolving agreement of $29 billion were reinvested in the program by the
Transferee. However, the Transferee interest in Valero receivables was never
in excess of $100 million at any point in time under this program. No
receivables included in this program were written off during 2000 or 1999.
As of December 31, 2000, $238 million of Valero accounts receivable
comprised the designated pool of trade receivables included in this program. Of
this amount, $100 million had been sold to the Transferee and $138 million was
retained by Valero.
3. ACQUISITIONS
CALIFORNIA REFINING AND MARKETING ASSETS
During the second quarter of 2000, Valero completed the acquisition of
Exxon Mobil Corporation Benicia, California refinery the Benicia Refinery
and Exxon-branded California retail assets, which consisted of approximately 80
service stations the Service Stations and branded supplier relationships
with over 260 Exxon-branded service stations the Distribution Assets
collectively, the Benicia Acquisition. ExxonMobil agreed to sell these
assets as a result of consent decrees issued by the Federal Trade Commission and
the State of California requiring certain assets to be divested by ExxonMobil to
satisfy anticompetitive issues in connection with the 1999 fourth quarter merger
of Exxon Corporation and Mobil Corporation. The purchase price for the Benicia
Refinery, the                    57

approximately $150 million for i refinery inventories acquired in the
transaction based on market-related prices at the time of closing and ii
certain costs incurred in connection with the acquisition. As described further
below, $155 million of the total purchase price was funded through a structured
lease arrangement for the Service Stations and the Benicia Refinery dock
facility. The acquisition of the Benicia Refinery and the Distribution Assets
closed on May 15, 2000, and the structured lease transaction closed on June 15,
2000.
In connection with the Benicia Acquisition, Valero assumed all
liabilities, including environmental liabilities, of ExxonMobil related to the
acquired California assets with certain exceptions, including those exceptions
enumerated below. ExxonMobil retained liability for, and agreed to indemnify
Valero for, i pending penalties assessed for violations relating to the
Benicia Refinery, ii pending lawsuits, iii personal injury or exposure,
including asbestos exposure, suffered by ExxonMobil employees, contractors or
subcontractors prior to closing, iv all costs associated with compliance with
a variance issued in connection with control of nitrogen oxides, v claims in
connection with offsite transportation and disposal of wastes prior to closing
asserted within three years of closing or asserted with respect to abandoned
disposal sites, vi the capital costs incurred within five years of closing for
specified corrective action of groundwater and soil contamination, vii all
covered contamination at the Service Stations caused by ExxonMobil or its
lessees that is reflected in baseline reports prepared prior to closing
provided that the indemnity for covered contamination is for five years,
viii the repair or replacement of any underground storage tanks at the Service
Stations found to be leaking prior to closing and ix fines and penalties
imposed within five years of closing arising out of a request for information
from the United States Environmental Protection Agency EPA relating to
certain provisions of the Clean Air Act that are attributable to actions taken
prior to closing or untimely or unresponsive responses to the request. In
addition, ExxonMobil will indemnify Valero for breaches of its representations
and warranties to the extent that the aggregate amount of Valero losses
resulting from such breaches exceeds $1 million and ExxonMobil receives notice
of such losses within one year after the closing date.
The Benicia Refinery is located on the Carquinez Straits of the San
Francisco Bay. It is considered a highly complex refinery and has a total
throughput capacity of approximately 165,000 barrels per day, or BPD. The
Benicia Refinery produces a high percentage of light products, with limited
production of other products. Approximately 95% of the gasoline produced by the
Benicia Refinery meets the California Air Resources Board CARB
specifications for CARB II gasoline sold in California. The refinery has
significant liquid storage capacity, including storage for crude oil and other
feedstocks. The refinery assets also include a deep-water dock located offsite
on the Carquinez Straits that is capable of berthing large crude carriers,
petroleum coke storage silos located on an adjacent dock, a 20-inch crude
pipeline connecting the refinery to a southern California crude delivery system,
and an adjacent truck terminal for regional truck rack sales. Under the consent
decrees, ExxonMobil was required to offer the buyer of the divested assets a
crude oil supply contract. As a consequence, in connection with the closing of
the Benicia Acquisition, Valero entered into a ten-year term contract providing
for ExxonMobil to supply and for Valero to purchase 100,000 BPD of Alaska North
Slope ANS crude oil at market-related prices, to be reduced to                    58

VALERO ENERGY CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - CONTINUED 65,000 BPD on January 1, 2001. Subsequent to 2001, Valero will have an option to
reduce the required volumes by an additional 20,000 BPD once per year.
The Service Stations included 10 company-operated service stations and
approximately 70 lessee-dealer service stations, all of which are in the greater
San Francisco Bay area. In connection with the consent decrees issued by the
Federal Trade Commission and the State of California, ExxonMobil was required to
withdraw the Exxon brand name from the San Francisco Bay area. As a result,
ExxonMobil notified the dealers in this market area that their franchise right
to market Exxon branded products was being terminated effective June 15, 2000.
Valero has introduced its own brand of retail petroleum products in the San
Francisco Bay area and the dealers at these locations have entered into a
franchise agreement with Valero to market products under the new Valero brand.
In July 2000, these dealers were offered an option to purchase the stations that
they were leasing. If exercised, the purchase option requires that the dealers
enter into a fuels purchase agreement with Valero for a term of 15 years. Any
purchases of stations by these dealers resulting from the exercise of their
purchase options are expected to be completed by the end of the first quarter of
2001.
The Distribution Assets included over 260 independently-owned and
operated distributor facilities which are located outside of the San Francisco
Bay area. These distributor locations retained the right to use the Exxon brand
and continue to receive Exxon brand support, while Valero received the exclusive
right to offer the Exxon brand throughout the state of California except for
the San Francisco Bay area for a ten-year period. In connection with the
Benicia Acquisition, ExxonMobil assigned to Valero all of the existing Exxon
California distributor contracts under which the distributors now purchase
Exxon-branded products from Valero.
The Benicia Acquisition was funded through a senior notes offering, an
offering of premium equity participating security units PEPS Units, a common
stock offering and borrowings under Valero existing bank credit facilities.
See Notes 5, 6 and 7 for details regarding the senior notes, PEPS Units, and
common stock offerings, respectively. In addition, Valero entered into a $155
million structured lease arrangement for the Service Stations and the Benicia
Refinery dock facility. This structured lease is being accounted for as an
operating lease and has a remaining primary term of approximately 45 years. See
Note 14.
The acquisition of the Benicia Refinery and Distribution Assets was
accounted for under the purchase method of accounting. In accordance with the
purchase method, the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheet as of December 31,
2000 includes the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on a preliminary
purchase price allocation, which will be finalized upon the completion of
independent appraisals and other evaluations. The accompanying Consolidated
Statement of Income for the year ended December 31, 2000 includes the results of

On September 16, 1998, Valero and Mobil Oil Corporation entered into an
asset sale and purchase agreement for the acquisition by Valero of substantially
all of the assets and the assumption of certain liabilities related to Mobil
155,000 barrel-per-day refinery in Paulsboro, New Jersey. The purchase price was
$228 million plus approximately $107 million representing the value of
inventories and certain other items acquired in the transaction and was paid in
cash from borrowings under Valero bank credit facilities. The acquisition was
accounted for using the purchase method of accounting and the purchase price was
allocated to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on fair values as
determined by an independent appraisal. Under the purchase method of accounting,
the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Income include the results of
operations of the Paulsboro Refinery beginning September 17, 1998. See
CONTINGENT EARN-OUT AGREEMENTS below for information regarding Mobil right
to receive certain payments if certain average refining margins exceed a
specified level.
In connection with the acquisition of the Paulsboro Refinery, Mobil
agreed to indemnify Valero for certain environmental matters and conditions
existing on or prior to the acquisition and Valero agreed to assume Mobil
environmental liabilities, with certain limited exceptions including
superfund liability for off-site waste disposal. Mobil indemnities and the
periods of indemnification, measured from the September 16, 1998 closing date,
include i third party environmental claims for a period of five years, ii
governmental fines and/or penalties for a period of five years, iii required
remediation of known environmental conditions for a period of five years,
subject to a cumulative deductible, iv required remediation of unknown
environmental conditions for a period of seven years, subject to a sharing
arrangement with a cap on Valero obligation and subject to a cumulative
deductible, and v certain capital expenditures required by a governmental
entity for a three-year period, to the extent required to cure a breach of
certain representations of Mobil concerning compliance with environmental laws,
subject to a specified deductible. Valero assumed liabilities include
remediation obligations to the New Jersey Department of Environmental
Protection. These remediation obligations relate primarily to clean-up costs
associated with groundwater contamination, landfill closure and post-closure
monitoring costs, and tank farm spill prevention costs. As of December 31, 2000                    60

In connection with Valero September 1998 acquisition of the Paulsboro
Refinery described above, Mobil now ExxonMobil is entitled to receive payments
in any of the five years following the acquisition if certain average refining
margins during any of these years exceed a specified level. Any payments under
this earn-out arrangement, which are determined in September of each year
beginning in 1999, are limited to $20 million in any year and $50 million in the
aggregate. No earn-out amount was due for the year ended September 16, 2000.
Also, in connection with Valero May 1997 acquisition of Basis, Salomon is
entitled to receive payments in any of the ten years following the acquisition
if certain average refining margins during any of these years exceed a specified
level. Any payments under this earn-out arrangement, which are determined as of
May 1 of each year beginning in 1998, are limited to $35 million in any year and
$200 million in the aggregate. The earn-out amount for the year ended May 1,
1998 was $103 million, while no earn-out amounts were due for the years ended
May 1, 1999 and 2000. Based on actual margins since May and September of 2000,
and estimated margin levels through May and September of 2001, earn-out payments
due to Salomon and Mobil during 2001 would be $35 million and $20 million,
respectively. Valero accounts for any payments under these arrangements as an
additional cost of the respective acquisition which is depreciated over the
remaining lives of the assets to which the additional cost is allocated.                    61

VALERO ENERGY CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - CONTINUED Valero is also charged various fees and expenses in connection with this
facility, including a facility fee and various letter of credit fees. The
interest rate and fees under this credit facility are subject to adjustment
based upon the credit ratings assigned to Valero long-term debt. The credit
facility includes certain restrictive covenants including a coverage ratio, a
capitalization ratio, and a minimum net worth test. The credit facility was
amended in April 2000 in connection with Valero financing plan for the Benicia
Acquisition resulting in, among other things, an increase in the total debt-to-
capitalization limit from 50% to the current limit of 60%. This ratio limit will
decrease to 55% on September 30, 2001. These amendments to the credit facility
became effective upon the closing of the acquisition of the Benicia Refinery and
the Distribution Assets. As of December 31, 2000, there were no outstanding
borrowings under this credit facility, while letters of credit outstanding were
approximately $184 million. Valero also currently has various uncommitted bank
letter of credit facilities under which approximately $89 million was
outstanding as of December 31, 2000.
On June 29, 2000, Valero issued to the public $200 million aggregate
principal amount of 8 3/8% notes which are due on June 15, 2005, and $200
million aggregate principal amount of 8 3/4% notes which are due on June 15,
2030. These notes were issued under Valero $13 billion universal shelf
registration statement on Form S-3 which was filed with the SEC on March 31,
2000 and declared effective on May 30, 2000. The net proceeds received by Valero
from this offering, which were used in connection with funding the Benicia
Acquisition as described in Note 3, were approximately $394 million, including
an aggregate discount of approximately $18 million related to the two
issuances. Interest payments on the notes will be made semi-annually on June 15
and December 15 of each year, beginning December 15, 2000. These notes are
unsecured and unsubordinated, rank equally with all of Valero other unsecured
and unsubordinated debt, have no sinking fund requirements, and are redeemable
at any time, in whole or in part, at Valero option.
In March 1999, Valero completed a public offering of $300 million
principal amount of 7 3/8% notes which are due on March 15, 2006. These notes
were issued under a $600 million universal shelf registration statement which
was previously declared effective by the SEC in June 1998. These notes are also
unsecured and unsubordinated, rank equally with all of Valero other unsecured
and unsubordinated debt, have no sinking fund requirements, and are redeemable
at any time, in whole or in part, at Valero option. The net proceeds from this
financing of approximately $2975 million were used to pay down borrowings under
Valero bank credit facilities.
In March 1999, the Gulf Coast Waste Disposal Authority issued and sold
for the benefit of Valero $25 million of new tax-exempt Waste Disposal Revenue
Bonds which have a fixed interest rate of 57% and mature on April 1, 2032. The
proceeds from the sale of these tax-exempt fixed-rate bonds were used to redeem
$25 million of the $435 million of taxable variable-rate Waste Disposal Revenue
Bonds which were issued in March 1998 at an initial interest rate of 57% and
also mature on April 1, 2032. The remaining $185 million of Series 1998 taxable
bonds bear interest at a variable rate determined weekly, with Valero having the
right to convert this rate to a daily, weekly, short-term or long-term rate, or
to a fixed rate. Valero expects to complete the refinancing of these remaining
taxable variable-rate bonds with $185 million of tax-exempt fixed-rate bonds by
the end of the first quarter of 2001. In March 1998, the Gulf Coast Waste
Disposal Authority issued and sold for the benefit of Valero $25 million of tax                    63

VALERO ENERGY CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - CONTINUED exempt Waste Disposal Revenue Bonds at a fixed interest rate of 56%. Also at
this time, Valero converted the interest rates on its $985 million of Series
1997 tax-exempt Revenue Refunding Bonds and $25 million of Series 1997
tax-exempt Waste Disposal Revenue Bonds from variable rates to a weighted
average fixed rate of approximately 54%. The Series 1997 Revenue Refunding
Bonds were issued in four series with due dates ranging from 2009 to 2027, while
the Series 1997 Waste Disposal Revenue Bonds were issued in one series and
mature on December 1, 2031.
In December 1997, Valero issued $150 million principal amount of 6 3/4%
notes for net proceeds of approximately $156 million. These notes are unsecured
and unsubordinated and rank equally with all of Valero other unsecured and
unsubordinated debt. The notes were issued to the Valero Pass-Through Asset
Trust 1997-1 which funded the acquisition of the notes through a private
placement of $150 million principal amount of 6 3/4% Pass-Through Asset Trust
Securities, or PATS. The PATS represent a fractional undivided beneficial
interest in the trust. In exchange for certain consideration paid to the trust,
a third party has an option to purchase the notes under certain circumstances at
par on December 15, 2002, at which time the term of the notes would be extended
30 years to December 15, 2032. If the third party does not exercise its purchase
option, then under the terms of the notes, Valero would be required to
repurchase the notes at par on December 15, 2002.
As of December 31, 2000, Valero debt-to-capitalization ratio was 399%
with 20% of the aggregate liquidation amount of trust preferred securities
issued as part of the PEPS Units deemed to be debt for purposes of this
computation, a decrease from 42% as of December 31, 1999.
Based on long-term debt outstanding at December 31, 2000, Valero has no
maturities of long-term debt during the next five years except for the $200
million of 8 3/8% notes due in June 2005. See above for maturities under the
terms of the 6 3/4% notes issued in 1997.
As of December 31, 2000 and 1999, the carrying amounts of Valero
taxable industrial revenue bonds approximated fair value due to their variable
interest rates. In addition, as of December 31, 1999, the carrying amount of
Valero revolving bank credit facility approximated fair value due to its
variable interest rate. For Valero fixed-rate industrial revenue bonds, 8 3/8%
notes, 8 3/4% notes, 7 3/8% notes and 6 3/4% notes, their estimated fair value
as of December 31, 2000 was approximately $1,0511 million compared to a
carrying amount of $1,0239 million. As of December 31, 1999, the estimated fair
value of Valero fixed-rate industrial revenue bonds, 7 3/8% notes and 6 3/4%
notes was approximately $563 million compared to a carrying amount of $627
million. The fair values of these instruments were estimated based on borrowing
rates available to Valero for long-term debt with similar terms and average
maturities.
6. PREMIUM EQUITY PARTICIPATING SECURITY UNITS
On June 28, 2000, Valero issued to the public 6,900,000 7 3/4% PEPS
Units at $2500 per unit. The PEPS Units were issued under Valero $13 billion

VALERO ENERGY CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - CONTINUED with the SEC on March 31, 2000 and declared effective on May 30, 2000. The net
proceeds received by Valero from this offering, which were used in connection
with funding the Benicia Acquisition as described in Note 3, were approximately
$167 million. Each PEPS Unit consists of i a purchase contract for shares of
Valero common stock and ii a trust preferred security.
Each purchase contract obligates the holder to purchase from Valero on
August 18, 2003, for a price of $25 per contract, the following number of shares
of Valero common stock based on the average closing price of Valero common
stock over the 20-day trading period ending on the third trading day prior to
August 18, 2003: i 71531 shares if the average closing price equals or
exceeds $3495; ii a number of shares having a value equal to $25 if the
average closing price is less than $3495 but greater than $29125; and iii
85837 shares if the average closing price is less than or equal to $29125. The
holder has the option to settle a purchase contract early for a price of $25 in
exchange for 71531 shares of Valero common stock.
Each trust preferred security represents an undivided interest in the
assets of VEC Trust I a wholly owned subsidiary trust of Valero, has a stated
liquidation amount of $25 and matures on August 18, 2005. The trust preferred
security is pledged as collateral to secure the PEPS Unit holder obligation to
purchase Valero common stock under the related purchase contract. VEC Trust I
will pay a cash distribution on each trust preferred security of $19375 per
year equal to 775% of the $25 stated liquidation amount prior to August 18,
2003, and from August 18, 2003 until August 18, 2005, at a reset rate that may
be less than, equal to or greater than this amount. The cash distribution
payments will be made quarterly on February 18, May 18, August 18 and November
18 of each year, beginning August 18, 2000.
The assets of VEC Trust I consist solely of Valero senior deferrable
notes maturing on August 18, 2005. VEC Trust I sole source of funds for
distributions on the trust preferred securities is the interest payments it
receives from Valero on the senior deferrable notes. Valero has the right to
defer interest on the senior deferrable notes until August 18, 2003, in which
case distributions on the trust preferred securities would also be deferred. Any
deferred distributions will accumulate and compound quarterly at the rate of
775% per year. Valero guarantees the payment of distributions on the trust
preferred securities to the extent interest is paid on the senior deferrable
notes.
The financial statements of VEC Trust I are included in the accompanying
consolidated financial statements of Valero, with the trust preferred securities
shown on the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheet as of December 31, 2000 as
Valero-obligated mandatorily redeemable preferred capital trust securities of
subsidiary trust holding solely Valero senior notes. Distributions on the trust
preferred securities, whether paid or accumulated, are reflected as a charge to
income and are shown on the accompanying Consolidated Statement of Income for
the year ended December 31, 2000 as Distributions on preferred securities of
subsidiary trust.
Prior to the issuance of shares of Valero common stock upon settlement
of the purchase contracts, the PEPS Units are reflected in Valero earnings per
share calculations using the treasury stock method. Consequently, the PEPS Units
will have a dilutive effect on earnings per share for reporting periods during
which the average market price per share of Valero common stock exceeds $3495.
For reporting periods during which the average market price per share of Valero
common stock is $3495 or less, the PEPS Units will have a dilutive effect on

7. COMMON STOCK OFFERING
On June 28, 2000, Valero issued to the public 5,980,000 shares of its
common stock at $29125 per share. These shares were issued under Valero $13
billion universal shelf registration statement on Form S-3 which was filed with
the SEC on March 31, 2000 and declared effective on May 30, 2000. The net
proceeds received by Valero from this offering, which were used in connection
with funding the Benicia Acquisition as described in Note 3, were approximately
$167 million.
8. PRICE RISK MANAGEMENT ACTIVITIES
Valero is exposed to market risks related to the volatility of crude oil
and refined product prices, as well as volatility in the price of natural gas
used in its refining operations. In order to reduce the risks of these price
fluctuations, Valero uses derivative commodity instruments such as futures,
options and swaps with third parties to hedge certain refinery inventories and
anticipated transactions. Valero also uses these types of derivative commodity
instruments for trading purposes. The disclosures detailed below in this note
reflect the disclosures required by generally accepted accounting principles
prior to the adoption, effective January 1, 2001, of FASB Statement No. 133,
Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities, as amended. See
Note 1 under NEW ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS for a detailed description of FASB
133, including how the adoption of this statement is expected to affect Valero
consolidated financial statements in the future.
In the tables below detailing Valero open derivative commodity
instruments as of December 31, 2000 and 1999, the total gain or loss as of
either date on swaps is the net of the fixed price payor and receiver fair value
amounts, while the total gain or loss on futures and options is i the excess
of the fair value amount over the contract amount for fixed price payor
positions, combined with ii the excess of the contract amount over the fair
value amount for fixed price receiver positions. As discussed above in Note 1
under PRICE RISK MANAGEMENT ACTIVITIES, gains and losses on hedging activities
are deferred and recognized when the hedged transaction occurs while gains and
losses on trading activities are recognized currently.
HEDGING ACTIVITIES
Valero uses derivative commodity instruments to hedge certain refinery
feedstock and refined product inventories in order to reduce the impact of
adverse price changes on these inventories before the conversion of the
feedstock to finished products and ultimate sale. Swaps and futures contracts
held to hedge refining inventories at the end of 2000 and 1999 had remaining
terms of less than one year. As of December 31, 2000 and 1999, 149% and 195 respectively, of Valero refining inventory position was hedged. As of December
31, 2000 and 1999, $31 million and $21 million, respectively, of deferred
hedge losses were included as an increase in refining inventories.                    66

risk of anticipated transactions. In 2000 and 1999, swaps and futures were used
to hedge anticipated feedstock and product purchases, product sales and refining
operating margins by locking in purchase or sales prices or components of the
margins, including feedstock discounts, conventional gasoline and heating oil
crack spreads and premium product differentials. Swaps were also used in 2000
and 1999 to hedge anticipated purchases of natural gas used in Valero refining
operations. The majority of contracts hedging anticipated transactions mature in
2001 with certain contracts extending through 2002. There were no significant
explicit deferrals of hedging gains or losses related to these anticipated
transactions as of the end of 2000 or 1999.

commodity instruments held to hedge anticipated feedstock and product purchases,

VALERO ENERGY CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - CONTINUED MARKET AND CREDIT RISK
Valero price risk management activities involve the receipt or
payment of fixed price commitments into the future. These transactions give rise
to market risk, the risk that future changes in market conditions may make an
instrument less valuable. Valero closely monitors and manages its exposure to
market risk on a daily basis in accordance with policies approved by its Board
of Directors. Market risks are monitored by a risk control group to ensure
compliance with Valero stated risk management policy. Concentrations of
customers in the refining industry may impact Valero overall exposure to
credit risk, in that these customers may be similarly affected by changes in
economic or other conditions. Valero believes that its counterparties will be
able to satisfy their obligations under contracts.
9. PREFERRED SHARE PURCHASE RIGHTS
Each outstanding share of Valero common stock is accompanied by one
Preferred Share Purchase Right, or Right. With certain exceptions, each Right
entitles the registered holder to purchase from Valero one one-hundredth of a
share of Valero Junior Participating Preferred Stock, Series I at a price of
$100 per one one-hundredth of a share, subject to adjustment for certain
recapitalization events.
The Rights are transferable only with the common stock until the
earlier of i 10 days following a public announcement that a person or group of
affiliated or associated persons, any such person, group or associates being
referred to as an Acquiring Person, has acquired beneficial ownership of 15% or
more of the outstanding shares of Valero common stock, ii 10 business days
or later date as may be determined by action of Valero Board of Directors
following the initiation of a tender offer or exchange offer which would result
in an Acquiring Person having beneficial ownership of 15% or more of Valero
outstanding common stock the earlier of the date of the occurrence of i or
ii being called the Rights Separation Date, or iii the earlier redemption
or expiration of the Rights. The Rights are not exercisable until the Rights
Separation Date. At any time prior to the acquisition by an Acquiring Person of
beneficial ownership of 15% or more of the outstanding common stock, Valero
Board of Directors may redeem the Rights at a price of $01 per Right. The
Rights will expire on June 30, 2007, unless extended or the Rights are earlier
redeemed or exchanged by Valero.
If after the Rights Separation Date, Valero is acquired in a merger or
other business combination transaction, or if 50% or more of its consolidated
assets or earning power are sold, each holder of a Right will have the right to
receive, upon the exercise of the Right at its then current exercise price, that
number of shares of common stock of the acquiring company which at the time of
the transaction will have a market value of two times the exercise price of the
Right. In the event that any Acquiring Person becomes the beneficial owner of
15% or more of the outstanding common stock, each holder of a Right, other than
Rights beneficially owned by the Acquiring Person which will thereafter be
void, will thereafter have the right to receive upon exercise that number of
shares of common stock having a market value of two times the exercise price of
the Right.                    70
74
VALERO ENERGY CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - CONTINUED     At any time after an Acquiring Person acquires beneficial ownership of
15% or more of the outstanding common stock and prior to the acquisition by the
Acquiring Person of 50% or more of the outstanding common stock, Valero Board
of Directors may exchange the Right other than Rights owned by the Acquiring
Person which have become void, at an exchange ratio of one share of common
stock, or one one-hundredth of a share of Junior Preferred Stock, per Right
subject to adjustment.
Until a Right is exercised, the holder will have no rights as a
stockholder of Valero including, without limitation, the right to vote or to
receive dividends.
The Rights may have certain anti-takeover effects. The Rights will
cause substantial dilution to any Acquiring Person that attempts to acquire
Valero on terms not approved by Valero Board of Directors, except pursuant to
an offer conditioned on a substantial number of Rights being acquired. The
Rights should not interfere with any merger or other business combination
approved by Valero Board of Directors since the Rights may be redeemed by
Valero prior to the time that an Acquiring Person has acquired beneficial
ownership of 15% or more of the common stock.
10. SEGMENT INFORMATION
Valero operations consist primarily of six petroleum refineries
located in Texas at Corpus Christi, Texas City and Houston, in Louisiana at
Krotz Springs, in New Jersey at Paulsboro, and in California at Benicia, the
products of which are marketed through an extensive wholesale bulk and rack
marketing network and through certain retail operations in California which were
acquired in connection with the Benicia Acquisition as described in Note 3. The
refineries have a combined throughput capacity of approximately one million
barrels per day. In applying the requirements of FASB Statement No. 131,
Disclosures about Segments of an Enterprise and Related Information, Valero
six refineries, each of which represents an operating segment as defined by the
statement, have been aggregated as allowed by the statement for reporting
purposes. As a result, Valero has one reportable segment, which is the refining
and marketing of premium, environmentally clean products.
Valero principal products include conventional, reformulated and CARB
gasolines, low-sulfur diesel, and oxygenates and other gasoline blendstocks.
Valero also produces a substantial slate of middle distillates, jet fuel and
petrochemicals, in addition to lube oils and asphalt. Valero currently markets
its products in 34 states through an extensive wholesale bulk and rack marketing
network, in California through approximately 80 Valero branded retail and 270
other retail distributor locations, and in selected export markets in Latin
America. Revenues from external customers for Valero principal products for
the years ended December 31, 2000, 1999 and 1998 were as follows in thousands                    71

VALERO ENERGY CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - CONTINUED     Valero taxable years through 1995 are closed to adjustment by the
Internal Revenue Service. Valero believes that adequate provisions for income
taxes have been reflected in the accompanying consolidated financial statements.
12. EMPLOYEE BENEFIT PLANS
PENSION PLANS AND POSTRETIREMENT BENEFITS OTHER THAN PENSIONS
Valero pension plan, which is subject to the provisions of the
Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended ERISA, is
designed to provide eligible employees with retirement income. Participation in
the plan commences upon the completion of one year of continuous service. Upon
becoming a participant, all service since date of hire is included in
determining vesting and credited service, except for individuals who became
employees of Valero as a result of an acquisition by Valero, for whom benefits
are determined by the terms of the acquisition agreement. For the former
ExxonMobil refinery and retail marketing employees continuing employment with
Valero in connection with the Benicia Acquisition, full credit was given for
service with ExxonMobil prior to May 15, 2000 or June 15, 2000, as applicable,
for purposes of eligibility, benefit accrual and vesting, with the benefits
under Valero plan offset by benefits payable to these employees under the
ExxonMobil Pension Plan. Former ExxonMobil retail store employees continuing
employment with Valero were excluded from participation in Valero plan. For
former Mobil employees continuing employment with Valero in connection with the
purchase of the Paulsboro Refinery, full credit was given for service with Mobil
prior to September 17, 1998 for vesting and eligibility purposes, but for
benefit accrual purposes, only service on and after this date is counted under
the plan. A participant vests in plan benefits after five years of vesting
service.
As a result of the Restructuring, Valero is solely responsible for i
pension liabilities that existed immediately prior to the Restructuring to, or
relating to, employees of Old Valero who became employees of PG after the
Restructuring, which will become payable upon their retirement, ii all
liabilities to, or relating to, former employees of Valero and Old Valero, and
iii all liabilities to, or relating to, current Valero employees. Also, Valero
became the sponsor of Old Valero nonqualified Supplemental Executive
Retirement Plan, or SERP, which is designed to provide additional pension
benefits to executive officers and certain other employees, and assumed all
liabilities with respect to current and former employees of both Valero and Old
Valero under this plan.
The pension plan provides a monthly pension payable upon normal
retirement of an amount equal to a set formula which is based on the
participant 60 consecutive highest months of compensation during the latest 10
years of credited service under the plan. Any contributions to the plan are made
by Valero and contributions by participants are neither required nor permitted.
Valero contributions, if and when permitted under ERISA, are actuarially
determined in an amount sufficient to fund the currently accruing benefits and
amortize any prior service cost over the expected life of the then current work
force. Valero contributions to the pension plan and SERP in 2000, 1999 and
1998 were approximately $10 million, $74 million and $72 million,
respectively, and are currently estimated to be $72 million in 2001.                    74

VALERO ENERGY CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - CONTINUED     Valero also provides certain health care and life insurance benefits
for retired employees, referred to as postretirement benefits other than
pensions. Substantially all of Valero employees may become eligible for these
benefits if, while still working for Valero, they either reach normal retirement
age or take early retirement. Health care benefits are offered by Valero through
a self-insured plan and a health maintenance organization while life insurance
benefits are provided through an insurance company. Valero funds its
postretirement benefits other than pensions on a pay-as-you-go basis.
Individuals who became Valero employees as a result of an acquisition by Valero
became eligible for postretirement benefits other than pensions under Valero
plan effective on their respective acquisition dates. As a result of the
Restructuring, Valero is responsible for all liabilities to former employees of
both Valero and Old Valero as well as current Valero employees arising under Old
Valero health care and life insurance programs.

Valero is the sponsor of the Valero Energy Corporation Thrift Plan
which is a qualified employee profit-sharing plan. The purpose of the Thrift
Plan is to provide a program whereby contributions of participating employees
and their employers are systematically invested to provide the employees an
interest in Valero and to further their financial independence. Participation in
the Thrift Plan is voluntary and is open to Valero employees who become eligible
to participate upon the completion of one month of continuous service. This
service may include prior employment with other companies prior to individuals
becoming employees of Valero through an acquisition by Valero. Former ExxonMobil
refinery and certain retail marketing employees who became employees of Valero
in connection with the Benicia Acquisition became eligible to participate in the
Thrift Plan on May 16, 2000 and June 16, 2000, respectively, under the same
service requirements as required for other Valero employees, with service
including prior employment with ExxonMobil. These employees could elect to
transfer their balances from the ExxonMobil employee savings plan into the
Thrift Plan or maintain these amounts in the ExxonMobil plan. Former Mobil
employees who became employees of Valero in connection with the purchase of the
Paulsboro Refinery became eligible to participate in the Thrift Plan on
September 17, 1998 under the same service requirements as required for other
Valero employees, with service including prior employment with Mobil. Effective
January 1999, these employees could elect to transfer their balances from the
Mobil employee savings plan into the Thrift Plan or maintain these amounts in
the Mobil plan.
Participating employees may contribute from 2% up to 8% of their total
annual compensation as basic contributions, with those participants making a
basic contribution of 8% allowed to make a supplemental contribution                    77

VALERO ENERGY CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - CONTINUED of up to 14% of their total annual compensation. Participants may elect to make
contributions on a before-tax and/or after-tax basis, with federal income taxes
on before-tax contributions being deferred until a distribution is made to the
participant. Participants' basic contributions of up to 8% of their base annual
compensation are matched 75% by Valero, with an additional match of up to 25%
subject to certain conditions. Participants' basic contributions in excess of 8%
of their base annual compensation and supplemental contributions are not matched
by Valero. In January 2001, the compensation committee of Valero Board of
Directors approved an increase in Valero matching percentage from 75% to 100%
for the 12-month period beginning February 1, 2001. Valero contributions to
the Thrift Plan for the years 2000, 1999 and 1998 were $8,153,543, $6,670,841
and $5,298,870, respectively.
STOCK COMPENSATION PLANS
Valero has various fixed and performance-based stock compensation
plans. Valero Executive Stock Incentive Plan, or ESIP, authorizes the grant of
various stock and stock-related awards to executive officers and other key
employees. Awards available under the ESIP include options to purchase shares of
common stock, performance awards which vest upon the achievement of an objective
performance goal, and restricted stock which vests over a period determined by
Valero compensation committee. A total of 2,500,000 shares of Valero common
stock may be issued under the ESIP, of which no more than 1,000,000 shares may
be issued as restricted stock. Valero also has a non-qualified stock option
plan under which awards are granted to key officers, employees and prospective
employees. A total of 2,000,000 shares of Valero common stock may be issued
under this plan. Valero also maintains an Executive Incentive Bonus Plan, under
which 200,000 shares of Valero common stock may be issued, that provides bonus
compensation to key employees based on individual contributions to company
profitability. Bonuses are payable either in cash, Valero common stock, or both.
Valero also has a non-employee director stock option plan, under which 200,000
shares of Valero common stock may be issued, and a non-employee director
restricted stock plan, under which 100,000 shares of Valero common stock may be
issued.

The fair value of each option grant was estimated on the grant date
using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model with the following weighted-average
assumptions used for grants in 2000, 1999 and 1998, respectively: risk-free
interest rates of 67 percent, 55 percent and 50 percent; expected dividend
yields of 11 percent, 16 percent and 14 percent; expected lives of 31 years,
32 years and 31 years; and expected volatility of 428 percent, 423 percent                    79
83
VALERO ENERGY CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - CONTINUED and 282 percent. The expected volatility assumption for grants in 1998 was
based on the stock price history of Old Valero due to insufficient stock price
history for Valero subsequent to the Restructuring, whereas the expected
volatility assumption for grants in 1999 and 2000 was based on the stock price
history of Valero subsequent to the Restructuring.
Valero applies APB 25 and related interpretations in accounting for its
plans see Note 1 under STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION and NEW ACCOUNTING
PRONOUNCEMENTS - FIN 44. Accordingly, no compensation cost has been recognized
for its fixed stock option plans. The after-tax compensation cost reflected in
net income for other stock-based compensation plans for 2000, 1999 and 1998 was
$88 million, $4 million and $3 million, respectively. Had compensation cost for
Valero stock-based compensation plans been determined based on the grant date
fair value of awards in 2000, 1999 and 1998 consistent with the method set forth
in FASB 123, Valero net income and earnings per share for the years ended
December 31, 2000 and 1999 would have been reduced, and Valero net loss and
loss per share for the year ended December 31, 1998 would have increased to the

In September of 2000, the Department of Energy D.O.E. announced its
intention to solicit offers for the time exchange of certain crude oil in the
Strategic Petroleum Reserve SPR. In the fourth quarter of 2000, the D.O.E.
approved a bid by Valero to receive 1,000,000 barrels of crude oil under this
program. In November and December of 2000, Valero received 1,000,000 barrels of
crude oil in exchange for the obligation to redeliver 1,026,000 barrels of crude
oil to the SPR during the third and fourth quarters of 2001. Valero also entered
into a derivative contract to lock in the cost of the crude oil that will be
purchased and redelivered to the SPR in 2001. As of December 31, 2000, Valero
obligation to redeliver crude oil is recorded in Accounts payable in the
accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets at the fair market value of the crude
oil to be redelivered. Both the crude oil payable and the related derivative
contract are adjusted for changes in fair market value, with such adjustments
reflected in income.                    80

Valero has long-term operating lease commitments in connection with
land, office facilities and equipment, transportation equipment, and various
facilities and equipment used in the storage, transportation and production of
refinery feedstocks and refined products. In addition, in connection with the
Benicia Acquisition as described in Note 3, Valero entered into a long-term
operating lease for various service stations and the Benicia Refinery dock
facility. Long-term leases for land have remaining primary terms of up to 237
years, long-term leases for office facilities have remaining primary terms of up
to 45 years and long-term leases for transportation equipment have remaining
primary terms of up to 4 years. Valero long-term leases for production
equipment, feedstock and refined product storage facilities and transportation
assets have remaining primary terms of up to 425 years and in certain cases
provide for various contingent payments based on, among other things, throughput
volumes in excess of a base amount. The long-term lease for the California
service stations and Benicia Refinery dock facility has a remaining term of
approximately 45 years.
Future minimum lease payments and minimum rentals to be received under
subleases as of December 31, 2000 for operating leases having initial or
remaining noncancelable lease terms in excess of one year are as follows in

These amounts are included in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Income
under Cost of sales and operating expenses and Selling and administrative
expenses and include various month-to-month and other short-term rentals in
addition to rents paid and accrued under long-term lease commitments.
In addition to commitments under operating leases, Valero has a
commitment under a product supply arrangement to pay a reservation fee of
approximately $113 million annually through August 2002. Valero also has an
obligation under certain long-term hydrogen supply arrangements to make fixed
minimum payments of approximately $49 million annually, as well as other
minimum payments which vary based on certain natural gas reference prices. These
arrangements, which were entered into in 1999 for the purpose of securing a firm
supply of hydrogen for the Texas City Refinery, have remaining terms of
approximately 15 years.                    81

VALERO ENERGY CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - CONTINUED 15. LITIGATION AND CONTINGENCIES
Old Valero, together with certain of its natural gas related
subsidiaries, and Valero were sued by Teco Pipeline Company regarding the
operation of a 340-mile pipeline in West Texas in which a subsidiary of Old
Valero holds a 50% undivided interest. The case was filed April 24, 1996. In
1985, a subsidiary of Old Valero sold a 50% undivided interest in the pipeline
and entered into a joint venture through an ownership agreement and an operating
agreement, with the purchaser of the interest. In 1988, Teco succeeded to that
purchaser 50% interest. A subsidiary of Old Valero has at all times been the
operator of the pipeline. The plaintiff contends that the defendants acted in
bad faith and negatively affected the economics of the joint venture in order to
provide financial advantages to facilities or entities owned by the defendants,
and by allegedly taking for the defendants' own benefit certain opportunities
available to the joint venture. The plaintiff asserts causes of action for
breach of fiduciary duty, fraud, tortious interference with business
relationships, professional malpractice and other claims. Old Valero motion to
require arbitration of the case as required in the written agreements was denied
by the trial court, but Old Valero appealed, and in August 1999, the court of
appeals ruled in Old Valero favor and ordered arbitration of the entire
dispute. Teco has since waived efforts to further appeal this ruling, and an
arbitration panel has been selected. Valero was formally added to this
proceeding. In January 2001, the panel dismissed the plaintiff legal
malpractice claims, and the arbitration hearing began on February 5, 2001. On
February 5, 2001, Teco dismissed its claims against Valero, but Valero continues
to participate in the hearing. Although PG previously acquired Teco and owned
both Teco and Old Valero prior to El Paso Corporation acquisition of Old
Valero in December 2000, PG agreement for the acquisition of Teco purports
to assign the benefit or detriment of this lawsuit to the former shareholders of
Teco. In connection with the Restructuring, Valero has agreed to indemnify Old
Valero with respect to this lawsuit for 50% of any final judgment or settlement
amount up to $30 million, and 100% of that part of any final judgment or
settlement amount over $30 million. El Paso Corporation has assumed Old Valero
liability in this matter.
In 1986, Valero filed suit against M.W. Kellogg Company for damages
arising from certain alleged design and construction defects in connection with
a major construction project at the Corpus Christi Refinery. Ingersoll-Rand
Company was added as a defendant in 1989. In 1991, the trial court granted
summary judgment against Valero based in part on certain exculpatory provisions
in various agreements connected with the project. In 1993, the court of appeals
affirmed the summary judgment and the Texas Supreme Court denied review.
Subsequent to the summary judgment, Kellogg and Ingersoll-Rand brought indemnity
claims against Valero for attorneys' fees and expenses incurred in defending the
original action. In 1996, the trial court rendered summary judgment against
Kellogg and Ingersoll-Rand based on procedural grounds, and the court of appeals
affirmed that ruling in 1997. However, in 1999, the Texas Supreme Court reversed
the court of appeals and remanded Kellogg and Ingersoll-Rand claims for
attorneys' fees and expenses to the trial court. The case went to trial in
August 2000. During trial, the claims of Ingersoll-Rand were settled for an
immaterial amount. The jury returned a verdict on Kellogg claims that resulted
in a judgment of $63 million. Valero plans to appeal the judgment.                    82
86
VALERO ENERGY CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - CONTINUED     Valero had previously received notice of, but was not served with, a
complaint filed April 28, 2000 in federal court by Texas City Railway Company
alleging that several companies, including Valero, are liable under the
Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act CERCLA,
other environmental laws and tort law theories for alleged contamination of the
plaintiff marine loading and tankering facilities. On September 6, 2000, the
complaint was dismissed pursuant to a tolling agreement. The parties are
presently seeking to resolve the matter through mediation which is expected to
conclude by the end of the first quarter of 2001.
On May 24, 2000, Valero was served with a complaint seeking to certify
a class action that alleged that numerous gasoline suppliers, including Valero,
contaminated groundwater in New York with MTBE. As a result of certain
procedural changes, the plaintiffs filed a new master complaint on January 8,
2001. The new complaint alleges that the gasoline suppliers produced and/or
distributed gasoline that is alleged to be defective because it contains MTBE.
The plaintiffs have not claimed a specific amount of monetary damages, but seek
several equitable remedies, including the institution of a court-mandated
well-testing program and the enjoining of further distribution of MTBE in New
York. No class has been certified. Valero has filed a motion to dismiss the
complaint based upon a failure to state a claim and based upon federal
preemption under the Clean Air Act. The Judicial Panel on Multidistrict
Litigation consolidated this case with certain other MTBE class action lawsuits
for pretrial purposes. Discovery has been allowed and is proceeding.
In 2000, the EPA issued to a majority of refiners operating in the
United States a series of information requests pursuant to Section 114 of the
Clean Air Act as part of an enforcement initiative. Valero received a Section
114 information request pertaining to all of its refineries owned at that time.
Valero has completed its response to the request and has provided additional
clarification requested by the EPA. Valero has not been named in any proceeding.
However, based in part upon recently announced settlements and evaluation of its
relative position, Valero expects total penalties and related expenses of less
than $5 million in connection with this enforcement initiative. Valero
estimate of expenses to be incurred related to this issue, which has been
provided for in the accompanying consolidated financial statements, is
immaterial to its financial position and results of operations. Valero believes
that any settlement with the EPA in this matter may require various capital
improvements or changes in operating parameters or both at some or all of
Valero refineries.
Valero is also a party to additional claims and legal proceedings
arising in the ordinary course of business. Valero believes it is unlikely that
the final outcome of any of the claims or proceedings to which it is a party
would have a material adverse effect on its consolidated financial statements;
however, due to the inherent uncertainty of litigation, the range of possible
loss, if any, cannot be estimated with a reasonable degree of precision and
there can be no assurance that the resolution of any particular claim or
proceeding would not have an adverse effect on Valero results of operations,
financial position or liquidity.                    83
