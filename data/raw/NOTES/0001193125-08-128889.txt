REPORT OF ERNST YOUNG LLP, INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM The Board of Directors and Stockholders
Accelrys,Inc. We have audited the
accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Accelrys,Inc. as of March31, 2008 and 2007, and the related consolidated statements of operations, stockholders equity, and cash flows for each of the years in the three year period ended
March31, 2008. Our audits also included the financial statement schedule listed in the index at a2. These financial statements and schedule are the responsibility of the Companys management. Our responsibility is to
express an opinion on these financial statements and schedule based on our audits. We conducted our audits in accordance with the
standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board United States. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit
includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the
overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. In our opinion, the
financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated financial position of Accelrys,Inc. at March31, 2008 and 2007, and the consolidated results of its operations and its cash flows for each
of the three years in the period ended March31, 2008, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. Also, in our opinion, the related financial statement schedule, when considered in relation to the basic financial
statements taken as a whole, presents fairly in all material respects the information set forth therein. As discussed in Note 1 to the
consolidated financial statements, Accelrys, Inc. changed its method of accounting for Share-Based Payments in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No123 revised 2004 on April1, 2006. We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board United States, the effectiveness of
Accelrys,Inc.s internal control over financial reporting as of March31, 2008, based on the criteria established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission

Significant Accounting Policies Principles of Consolidation
These consolidated financial statements include our accounts and those of our wholly owned subsidiaries. All significant intercompany
balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. Use of Estimates The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. requires management to make estimates and
assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. On an on-going basis, we evaluate our estimates, including those related to income taxes and the
valuation of goodwill, intangibles and other long-lived assets. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual future results could differ from those
estimates. Cash and Cash Equivalents We consider all highly liquid investments with an original maturity of three months or less to be cash equivalents. We invest our cash with financial institutions in money market funds and other investment grade securities such as
prime-rated commercial paper. Marketable Securities Our marketable securities consist of debt securities with original maturities of greater than three months and include obligations of U.S. government sponsored enterprises, U.S. corporate bonds and auction rate
securities ARS. We account for our investments in marketable securities in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards SFAS No115, Accounting for Certain Investments in Debt and Equity
Securities. Accordingly, our marketable securities have been classified as available-for-sale and are recorded at their estimated fair value. Unrealized losses which are not considered other than temporary and unrealized gains are included in
accumulated other comprehensive income in stockholders equity. Unrealized losses which are determined to be other than temporary are recorded as a charge against income. The cost of marketable securities sold is determined based on the
specific identification method. Marketable securities, including marketable securities classified as restricted marketable securities see
Note6, consist of the following:  AmortizedCost

interest receivable on marketable securities of $03 million at the end of March31, 2007. The contractual maturities of our
marketable securities at March31, 2008 are as follows inthousands:  Due within one year 2,002
Due in one to five years Due in five to ten years Due after ten years 13,918 15,920 Auction rate securities have been included in the above contractual maturities table based on the
stated maturity date of the bond. We assess our marketable securities for impairment under the guidance provided by Emerging Issues Task
Force EITF Issue No03-1 and Financial Accounting Standards Board FASB Staff Position Nos. 115-1 and 124-1, The Meaning of Other-Than-Temporary Impairment and Its Application to Certain Investments.
Accordingly, we review the fair value of our marketable securities at least quarterly to determine if declines in the fair value of individual securities are other-than-temporary in nature. If we believe the decline in the fair value of an
individual security is other-than-temporary, we write-down the carrying value of the security to its estimated fair value, generally determined using quoted market prices, with a corresponding charge against income. To determine if a decline in the
fair value of an investment is other-than-temporary, we consider several factors including, among others, the period of time and extent to which the estimated fair value has been less than cost, overall market conditions, the historical and
projected future financial condition of the issuer of the security and our ability and intent to hold the security for a period of time sufficient to allow for a recovery of the market value. As of March31, 2008, we held $146 million in ARS collateralized by student loans, most of which were originated under the Federal Family Education
Loan Program and are guaranteed by the United States Federal Department of Education. All of our ARS are AAA rated or equivalent by one or more of the major credit rating agencies. Auction rate securities are variable rate bonds tied to short-term
interest rates with maturities on the face of the securities in excess of 90 days and have interest rate resets through a modified Dutch auction, at predetermined short-term intervals, usually every 7, 28 or 35 days. Despite the underlying long-term
nature of ARS, such securities have historically been priced and traded as short-term investments because of the liquidity provided through the auction process. If there are insufficient buyers, auctions are said to fail and the holders are unable
to liquidate the investments through auction. A failed auction does not result in a default of the debt instrument. The securities continue to accrue interest and be auctioned until the next auction succeeds, the issuer calls the securities or the
securities mature. 
42 Table of Contents Accelrys, Inc. Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements Continued 
Since February 2008, all auctions for the ARS we hold have failed as the amount of securities
submitted for sale has exceeded the amount of purchase orders. As a result of the failed auctions and our inability to value the ARS based on quoted market prices, the fair values of these securities were estimated utilizing a discounted cash flow
analysis as of March31, 2008. The analyses considered, among other items, the collateralization underlying the security investments, the creditworthiness of the issuer, expected future cash flows, and the estimated time until anticipated
market recovery. Based on our assessment of the credit quality of the underlying collateral, creditworthiness of the issuers of the ARS,
and our belief that we presently have the ability and the intent to hold these investments until market recovery, we do not believe these securities to be other-than-temporarily impaired, and as such, we have recorded an unrealized loss of $07
million to accumulated other comprehensive income as of March31, 2008. Nonetheless, if uncertainties in the credit and capital markets continue, deteriorate further or there are any ratings downgrades on any ARS we hold, or if we no longer
have the ability to hold these investments, we may be required to recognize an impairment charge against net income. As the market for student loan collateralized instruments may take in excess of twelve months to fully recover, we have classified
these investments as noncurrent assets on our consolidated balance sheet as of March31, 2008. The following table summarizes the
gross unrealized losses and fair value of our marketable securities with unrealized losses that are not considered to be other-than-temporarily impaired, aggregated by investment category and length of time that individual securities that have been
in a continuous unrealized loss position, at March31, 2008:  LessThan12Months 12MonthsorGreater

receivable. This estimate is based on a specific customer analysis and an analysis of our historical write-offs as a percent of outstanding accounts receivable balances. If the financial condition of a customer were to deteriorate, resulting in an
impairment of its ability to make payments against outstanding balances owed to us, an additional allowance may be required. Fair Value of Financial
Instruments We carry our cash equivalents, marketable securities and restricted marketable securities at market value. The carrying
amount of accounts receivable, accounts payable and accrued liabilities are considered to be representative of their respective fair values due to their short-term nature.

approximately $19 million of fully depreciated assets which were no longer in use. Depreciation is provided on the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the related assets. Leasehold improvements are amortized over the shorter of
their estimated useful lives or the remaining lease term. Repair and maintenance costs are charged to expense as incurred. Software Development Costs
We account for costs incurred to develop our software products in accordance with SFAS No86, Accounting for the Cost of
Computer Software to be Sold, Leased or Otherwise Marketed. Accordingly, costs incurred in the research and development of new software products and significant enhancements to existing software products are expensed as incurred until the
technological feasibility of the product has been established. Technological feasibility occurs shortly before our software products are available for general release, and we have determined that costs eligible for capitalization are not material.
Accordingly, no software development costs were capitalized as of March31, 2008 and 2007. Goodwill and Purchased Intangible Assets

Intangible assets are amortized using the straight-line method over their estimated useful lives.
During the years ended March31, 2008, 2007 and 2006, intangible asset amortization expense totaled $15 million, $15million, $17million, respectively. Future estimated amortization expense for intangible assets as of March31, 2008 for each of the succeeding five years is as follows in thousands:  Fiscal Year 2009 1,525
Fiscal Year 2010 845
Fiscal Year 2011 165
Fiscal Year 2012 165
Fiscal Year 2013 165
In accordance with SFAS No142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets SFAS
No142, we review our goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible asset for impairment at least annually in our fiscal fourth quarter and more frequently if events or changes in circumstances occur that indicate a potential reduction in
the fair value of our reporting unit and/or our indefinite-lived intangible asset below their respective carrying values. Examples of such events or circumstances include: a significant adverse change in legal factors or in the business climate, a
significant decline in our stock price, a significant decline in our projected revenue or cash flows, an adverse action or assessment by a regulator, unanticipated competition, a loss of key personnel, or the presence of other indicators that would
indicate a reduction in the fair value of a reporting unit. Our goodwill is considered to be impaired if we determine that the carrying
value of the reporting unit to which the goodwill has been assigned exceeds managements estimate of its fair value. Based on the guidance provided by SFAS No142 and SFAS No131, Disclosures about Segments of an Enterprise and
Related Information, management has determined that our company consists of one reporting unit given the similarities of economic characteristics between the operations and the common nature of the products, services and customers. Because we
have only one reporting unit, and we are publicly traded, we determine the fair value of the reporting unit based on our market capitalization as we believe this represents the best evidence of fair value. In the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2008,
we completed our annual goodwill impairment test for fiscal year 2008 in accordance with SFAS No142 and concluded that our goodwill was not impaired. Our conclusion that goodwill was not impaired was based on a comparison of our net assets as
of March31, 2008 to our market capitalization. Our indefinite-lived intangible asset is considered to be impaired if we determine
that the carrying value of the asset exceeds its estimated fair value. In the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2008, we completed our annual indefinite-lived intangible asset impairment test and concluded that our indefinite-lived intangible asset was
not impaired. We estimated the fair value of our indefinite-lived intangible asset utilizing a discounted cash flow analysis which considers the estimated future customer orders for our scientific operating platform product line and the associated
direct and incremental selling, marketing and development costs. Key assumptions included in the discounted cash flow analysis include projections of future customer order growth for our scientific operating platform product line and developing an
appropriate discount rate. Impairment of Long-Lived Assets In accordance with SFAS No144, Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets, we review long-lived assets to be held and used, including acquired intangible assets subject to
amortization and property and equipment, for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not be fully recoverable. Conditions that would necessitate an impairment assessment 
45 Table of Contents Accelrys, Inc. Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements Continued 
include a significant decline in the market price of an asset or asset group, a significant adverse change in the extent or manner in which an asset or asset
group is being used, the loss of legal ownership or title to the asset, significant negative industry or economic trends or the presence of other indicators that would indicate that the carrying amount of an asset or asset group is not recoverable.
An asset is considered to be impaired if managements estimate of the undiscounted future cash flows anticipated to result from the use of the asset and its eventual disposition are not sufficient to recover the carrying value of the asset.
As a result of the closure of our research and development facility in Bangalore, India in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2007, we
assessed the recoverability of the associated property and equipment and determined that a portion of the assets were not recoverable. Accordingly, we recorded an asset impairment charge of $01 million in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2007 and
an additional charge of $01 million in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2008, both of which are included in restructuring charges in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations. The asset impairment charges in each period represent the
carrying value of these assets as we expect that any amount we will recover from their disposal will be negligible. We did not identify any conditions that would necessitate an impairment assessment of our long-lived assets during fiscal year 2006.
Revenue Recognition We recognize
revenues in accordance with the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants Statement of Position 97-2, Software Revenue Recognition, as amended, Securities and Exchange Commission Staff Accounting Bulletin No104, Revenue
Recognition and EITF Issue No00-21, Revenue Arrangements with Multiple Deliverables. We generate revenue from the
following primary sources:  software licenses,  post-contract customer support and maintenance services on licensed software, collectively referred to as PCS, and  professional services. Customer
billings generated in connection with our revenue-generating activities are initially recorded as deferred revenue. We then recognize the revenue from these customer billings as set forth below and when all of the following criteria are met:
a fully executed written contract and/or purchase order has been obtained from the customer i.e., persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists,
the contractual price of the product or services has been defined and agreed to in the contract i.e., price is fixed or determinable,
delivery of the product or service has occurred and no material uncertainties regarding customer acceptance of the delivered product or service exist, and
collection of the purchase price from the customer is considered probable. Software Licenses. We license software predominantly on a term basis. When sold perpetually, our standard perpetual software licensing
arrangements include twelve months of bundled PCS, while our standard term-based software licensing arrangements typically include PCS for the full duration of the term license. Because we do not have vendor specific objective evidence of the fair
value of these elements, we recognize as revenue the entire fee for such perpetual and term-based licenses ratably over the term of the bundled PCS. 
46 Table of Contents Accelrys, Inc. Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements Continued 
Renewal of PCS under Perpetual Software Licenses. Our PCS includes the right to receive
unspecified upgrades or enhancements and technical support. Fees from customer renewals of PCS related to previously purchased perpetual licenses are recognized ratably over the term of the PCS. Professional Services. We provide certain services to our customers, including non-complex product training, installation, implementation and
other professional services which are non-essential to the operation of the software. We also perform professional services for our customers designed to enhance the value of our software products by creating extensions to functionality to address a
clients specific business needs. When sold separately, revenue from these services is recorded under the proportional performance or completed performance method. Multi-Element Arrangements. For multi-element arrangements which include software licenses, PCS and non-complex training, installation and implementation services which are non-essential to the operation of the
software, the entire fee for such arrangements is recognized as revenue ratably over the term of the PCS or delivery of the services, whichever is longer. For multi-element arrangements which also include services that are essential to the operation
of the software, the fee for such arrangements is generally deferred until the services essential to the operation of the software have been performed, at which point the entire fee for such arrangements is recognized as revenue ratably over the
remaining term of the PCS or the delivery of the non-essential services, whichever is longer. Sales Taxes Collected Sales taxes collected from customers and remitted to various governmental agencies are excluded from revenues in our consolidated statement of operations.
Shipping Costs The costs of shipping
products to our customers are expensed as incurred and are included in cost of revenue in our consolidated statements of operations. We incurred $04 million, $04 million, and $08 million in shipping costs during the years ended March31,
2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively. Advertising Costs The costs of advertising are expensed as incurred and are included in sales and marketing expenses in our consolidated statements of operations. We incurred $01 million, $01 million and $45,000 in advertising costs
during the years ended March31, 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively. Foreign Currency Translation In accordance with SFAS No52, Foreign Currency Translation, we translate the financial statements of our foreign subsidiaries into U.S.
dollars using period-end exchange rates for assets and liabilities and average exchange rates during each reporting period for results of operations. Gains and losses resulting from foreign currency translation are excluded from results of
operations and recorded as accumulated other comprehensive income loss in stockholders equity. Gains and losses resulting from the
cash settlement of certain intercompany transactions as well as transactions with customers and vendors that are denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of each entity give rise to foreign exchange gains losses. These foreign
exchange gains losses are included in interest and other income, net in our consolidated statements of operations and totaled $02 million, $06 million and $03 million for the years ended March31, 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively.

Concentrations of Risk We maintain deposits in federally insured financial institutions in excess of federally insured limits. We do not believe we are exposed to significant credit risk due to the financial position of the depository
institutions in which those deposits are held. Additionally, we have established guidelines regarding diversification of our investment portfolio, credit quality of issuers and maturities of investments, which are designed to maintain the safety and
liquidity of our deposits and investments. As of March31, 2008, we held $146 million in ARS which we are unable to liquidate due to
deterioration in global credit markets. See discussion under the heading Marketable Securities for further information on our current ARS holdings. In addition to our U.S. operations, we conduct business in Europe and in the Asia/Pacific region, primarily in Japan. Any significant decline in the economies or the value of the currencies in these regions could have
a material adverse impact on us. Income Taxes Despite our belief that our tax return positions are consistent with applicable tax laws, we acknowledge that certain positions may be challenged by taxing authorities. Settlement of any challenge can result in no change, a complete
disallowance, or some partial adjustment reached through negotiations or litigation. Significant judgment is required in evaluating our tax reserves. Our reserves are adjusted in light of changing facts and circumstances, such as the progress of our
tax audits. Our income tax expense includes the impact of reserve provisions and changes to reserves that we consider appropriate, as well as related interest and penalties. Favorable resolution of such an income tax matter would be recognized as a
reduction to income tax expense. We account for income taxes in accordance with SFAS No109, Accounting for Income Taxes.
Accordingly, deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the tax consequences of temporary differences between the financial carrying amounts and the tax basis of existing assets and liabilities by applying enacted statutory tax rates
applicable to future years. The provision for income taxes is based on our estimates for taxable income of the various legal entities and jurisdictions in which we operate. As such, income tax expense may vary from the customary relationship between
income tax expense and pre-tax accounting income. We establish a valuation allowance against our net deferred tax assets to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount expected to be realized. We adopted FASB Interpretation No48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes-an Interpretation of FASB Statement No109 FIN
No48, effective April1, 2007. FIN No48 prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return.
FIN No48 requires that we determine whether the benefits of our tax positions are more-likely-than-not of being sustained upon audit based on the technical merits of the tax position. We recognize the impact of an uncertain income tax
position taken on our income tax return at the largest amount that is more-likely-than-not to be sustained upon audit by the relevant taxing authority. An uncertain income tax position is not recognized if it has less than a 50% likelihood of being
sustained. See Note 4 for additional information on our adoption of the provisions of FIN No48. Interest and penalties related to
income tax matters are recognized in income tax expense. During the years ended March31, 2008 and 2007 we did not incur any expense related to interest or penalties for income tax matters, and no such amounts were accrued as of March31,
2008.

Net Income Loss Per Share We compute net income loss per share pursuant to SFAS No128, Earnings Per Share. Accordingly, basic net income loss per share and diluted net loss per share are computed by dividing the net income
loss for the period by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the period, without consideration for common stock equivalents. Diluted net income per share is computed by dividing the net income for the period by the
weighted average number of common stock and common stock equivalents outstanding during the period. Potentially dilutive common stock equivalents consist of in-the-money common stock options and unvested restricted stock units RSUs.

2006, we adopted SFAS No123 revised 2004, Share-Based Payments SFAS No123R using the modified prospective transition method. Under the modified prospective transition method, the estimated grant date fair value
of awards granted to employees and directors on or after April1, 2006 is recognized as a charge against income over the requisite service period. Additionally, the remaining unrecognized compensation expense associated with the unvested
portion of awards granted prior to April1, 2006, determined under the provisions of SFAS No123, is recognized as a charge against income beginning April1, 2006. In accordance with the modified prospective transition method, our
consolidated financial statements for periods prior to April1, 2006 have not been restated to reflect, and do not include, the impact of our adoption of SFAS No123R. Pursuant to the provisions of SFAS No123R, deferred stock-based compensation is no longer reflected as a separate component of stockholders
equity. As a result, we reversed our remaining deferred stock-based compensation balance as of April1, 2006 of $05 million against additional paid-in capital. Additional information and disclosure on our adoption of SFAS No123R are provided in Note 3. Segment and
Geographic Information In accordance with SFAS No131, our operations have been aggregated into one reportable segment given the
similarities of economic characteristics between the operations and the common nature of the products, services and customers.

100 Comprehensive Income Loss In accordance with SFAS No130, Reporting Comprehensive Income, we report the components of comprehensive income loss, including net income loss, in the financial statements in the period in which
they are recognized. Comprehensive income loss is defined as all changes in equity during a period from non-owner sources, including foreign currency translation adjustments and unrealized gains and losses on marketable securities. We present
comprehensive income loss in our consolidated statements of stockholders equity. Accumulated other comprehensive income loss in stockholders equity consists of the following:  March31 2008 2007 Inthousands Foreign currency translation adjustment 1,046 1,303 Unrealized loss on marketable securities 682 158 364 1,145 Guarantees We account for guarantees in accordance with FIN No45, Guarantors Accounting and Disclosure Requirements for Guarantees, Including Indirect Guarantees of Indebtedness of Others FIN
No45. FIN No45 requires that a guarantor recognize, at the inception of a guarantee, a liability for the fair value of certain guarantees and requires certain disclosures to be made by a guarantor about its obligations under
certain guarantees that it has issued.

Effect of New Accounting Standards In December 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No141R, Business Combinations: Applying the Acquisition Method SFAS No141R.
SFAS No141R retains the fundamental requirements of SFAS No141, Business Combinations, but provides additional guidance on applying the acquisition method when accounting for similar economic events. It establishes
principles and requirements for how an acquirer in a business combination recognizes and measures in its financial statements the identifiable assets acquired, the liabilities assumed, and any controlling interest; recognizes and measures the
goodwill acquired in the business combination or a gain from a bargain purchase; and determines what information to disclose to enable users of the financial statements to evaluate the nature and financial effects of the business combination. SFAS
No141R was a joint effort between the FASB and the International Accounting Standards Board to promote global standards by improving the accounting and financial reporting of business combinations. SFAS No141R is effective for
acquisitions occurring in or subsequent to fiscal years following December15, 2008. We will assess the impact of SFAS No141R if and when a future acquisition occurs. In February 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No159, The Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities, which is effective for
fiscal years beginning after November15, 2007. SFAS No159 also amends certain provisions of SFAS No115, Accounting for Certain Investments in Debt and Equity Securities. This statement permits entities to choose to measure
many financial instruments and certain other items at fair value. We are currently evaluating the impact SFAS No159 will have on our results of operations and financial position. In September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No157, Fair Value Measurements, which is effective for fiscal years beginning after
November15, 2007. SFAS No157 provides a definition of fair value, establishes acceptable methods of measuring fair value and expands disclosures for fair value measurements. The principles apply under accounting pronouncements which
require measurement of fair value and do not require any new fair value measurements in accounting pronouncements where fair value is the relevant measurement attribute. We are currently evaluating the impact SFAS No157 will have on our
results of operations and financial position.  3.
Share-Based Payments Share-Based Compensation Plans
On August2, 2005, our stockholders approved the Amended and Restated 2004 Stock Incentive Plan the 2004 Plan. The
2004 Plan authorizes the grant of equity awards to purchase the number of shares of our common stock equal to the sum of i1,900,000 shares and iithe number of shares of common stock underlying any stock awards granted under certain
prior share-based compensation plans that expire or are cancelled or forfeited without having been exercised in full or that are repurchased by us. Potential types of equity awards that may be granted under the 2004 Plan to our officers, directors,
employees and consultants include stock options, RSUs, restricted stock awards, common stock awards, stock appreciation rights, performance awards and deferred stock units. Pursuant to the 2004 Plan, any shares of common stock that are awarded under
the 2004 Plan as RSUs, restricted stock awards, common stock awards, performance awards or deferred stock units but not as stock options or stock appreciation rights are counted against the maximum number of shares of common stock available for
issuance under the 2004 Plan based on a 115-to-1 ratio. The terms and conditions of specific awards are set at the discretion of our board of directors although generally awards vest over not more than four years, expire no later than ten years
from the date of grant and do not have exercise prices less than the fair market value of the underlying common stock on the date of grant. At March31, 2008, approximately 1,661,000 shares of our common stock remain available for issuance
pursuant to awards granted under the 2004 Plan. On August2, 2005, our stockholders also approved the 2005 Employee Stock Purchase
Plan the ESPP, under which we have reserved 1,000,000 shares of our common stock for issuance. Under the ESPP, employees may defer up to 10% of their base salary to purchase shares of our common stock, up to a maximum of 
51 Table of Contents Accelrys, Inc. Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements Continued 
1,000shares per offering period. The purchase price of the common stock is equal to 85% of the lower of the fair market value per share of our common
stock on the commencement date of the applicable offering period or the applicable purchase date. To date, we have issued 201,000 shares under the ESPP and 799,000 shares remain available for future issuance under the ESPP as of March31, 2008.
We also maintain certain other share-based compensation plans, under which we did not grant awards during fiscal year 2008 and do not
intend to grant any further awards in the future. Our share-based compensation plans contain a provision that allows eligible participants
to continue to vest in their stock options upon their retirement, as that term is defined in the plans. To be eligible for continued vesting, participants must be at least 55 years of age and have 5 years of service at the time of their retirement.
Beginning in fiscal year 2008, we no longer offer this retirement benefit for grants of RSUs or stock options. Share-Based Award Activity
Our stock options generally vest over four years and have a contractual term of 10 years. A summary of stock option activity under our
share-based compensation plans is as follows:  NumberofShares WeightedAverageExercisePrice

million, respectively. The total cash received from the exercise of stock options during the year ended March31, 2008 was $01 million. In fiscal year 2008, we granted RSUs under the 2004 Plan that vest annually over three years and, once vested, do not expire.

Valuation of Share-Based Awards We estimate the fair value of our share-based awards on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model. The Black-Scholes option-pricing model requires the use of certain input variables, as follows:
Expected Volatility. Volatility is a measure of the amount the stock price will fluctuate during the expected life of an award. We
determine volatility based on our historical stock price volatility over the most recent period equivalent to the expected life of the award, giving consideration to company-specific events impacting historical volatility that are unlikely to occur
in the future, such as the April30, 2004 spin-off of Pharmacopeia Drug Discovery,Inc. PDD, as well as anticipated future events that may impact volatility. We also consider the historical stock price volatilities of
comparable publicly traded companies. Risk-Free Interest Rate. Our assumption of the risk-free interest rate is based on the
interest rates on U.S. constant rate treasury securities with contractual terms approximately equal to the expected life of the award. Expected Dividend Yield. Because we have not paid any cash dividends since our inception and do not anticipate paying dividends in the foreseeable future, we assume a dividend yield of zero. Expected Award Life. We determine the expected life of an award by considering various relevant factors, including the vesting period and
contractual term of the award, our employees historical exercise patterns and length of service, the expected future volatility of our stock price and employee characteristics. We also consider the expected terms of comparable publicly traded
companies. For ESPP purchase rights, the expected life is equal to the current offering period under the ESPP. Under SFAS No123R,
we are also required to estimate at grant the likelihood that the award will ultimately vest the pre-vesting forfeiture rate and revise the estimate, if necessary, in future periods if the actual forfeiture rate differs. We determine
the pre-vesting forfeiture rate of an award based on our historical pre-vesting award forfeiture experience, giving consideration to company-specific events impacting our historical pre-vesting award forfeiture experience that are unlikely to occur
in the future as well as anticipated future events that may impact forfeiture rates. For purposes of calculating pro forma information under SFAS No123 for periods prior to fiscal year 2007, we accounted for pre-vesting forfeitures as they
occurred. Our determination of the input variables used in the Black-Scholes option pricing model as well as the pre-vesting forfeiture
rate is based on various underlying estimates and assumptions that are highly subjective and are affected by our stock price, among other factors. Changes in these underlying estimates and assumptions could materially affect the fair value of our
share-based awards and, therefore, the amount of share-based compensation expense to be recognized in our results of operations. The fair
value of stock options and ESPP purchase rights granted during the years ended March31, 2008 and 2007 was estimated at the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option pricing model with the following weighted average assumptions: Year ended March31, 2008 StockOptions ESPPPurchaseRights Expected volatility 55 55 Risk-free interest rate 42 43 Expected option life in years 5 05 Expected dividend yield 0 0 Weighted average per share grant date fair value 357 217

The fair value of RSUs granted during the years ended March31, 2008 and 2007 was based on
the market price of our common stock on the date of grant. Share-Based Compensation Expense The estimated fair value of our share-based awards is recognized as a charge against income on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period,
which is the shorter of the vesting period of the award or, for applicable awards, the period until the participant becomes eligible for retirement. The estimated fair value of applicable share-based awards granted to retirement-eligible
participants is recognized as a charge against income immediately upon grant. Total share-based compensation expense recognized in our consolidated statements of operations for the years ended March31, 2008, 2007 and 2006 was as follows:

March31, 2007 reflects our adoption of SFAS No123R effective April1, 2006 using the modified prospective transition method. Share-based compensation expense recognized in the year ended March31, 2006 relates to share-based
awards granted in prior periods accounted for under the provisions of Accounting Principals Board Opinion No25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees. Employee stock options granted in fiscal year 2006 had no intrinsic value upon
grant. No share-based compensation expense was capitalized in the periods presented. At March31, 2008, the gross amount of unrecognized share-based compensation expense relating to unvested share-based awards was approximately $66 million,
which we anticipate recognizing as a charge against income over a weighted average period of 109 years. The total fair value of RSUs vested during fiscal year 2008 was $09 million. No RSUs vested during fiscal year 2007 or 2006.

deferred tax liabilities in the U.S. related to indefinite-lived goodwill and intangible assets that are amortized for income tax purposes. For book purposes, the indefinite-lived goodwill and intangible assets will be charged to results of
operations when they are determined to be impaired in accordance with SFAS No142. Because we can not predict when these assets will be impaired and therefore when the associated deferred tax liabilities will reverse, we can not assume that
there will be sufficient deferred tax assets to offset against these deferred tax liabilities when they ultimately reverse. We have provided a full valuation allowance for our remaining net U.S. deferred tax assets as we do not believe that the
ultimate realization of such deferred tax assets is more-likely-than-not. At March31, 2008 and 2007, we also had $08 million and
$56million, respectively, of net deferred tax assets related to Accelrys, K.K. We believe that the ultimate realization of these deferred tax assets is more-likely-than-not since our intercompany transfer pricing arrangement provides for
Accelrys, K.K. to achieve an annual operating profit margin. The change in the valuation allowance for deferred tax assets for the years
ended March31, 2008 and 2007 of $08 million and $47million, respectively, was due primarily to the change in net operating loss carryforwards NOLs in the U.S. As of March31, 2008, we had U.S. federal NOLs of approximately $1419million and tax credit carryforwards of approximately $19 million. We
also had California NOLs of approximately $256 million and tax credit carryforwards of approximately $44 million. Approximately $467 million of the federal NOLs relate to stock option deductions which, when realized, will result in an increase to
paid-in capital and a decrease in income taxes payable. Our U.S. federal NOLs and tax credit carryforwards expire beginning in 2008 through 2027, if not fully utilized. Our California NOLs expire beginning in 2010 through 2018, if not fully
utilized. The California tax credit carryforwards do not expire. Realization is dependent on generating sufficient taxable income prior to expiration of the NOLs and tax credit carryforwards. In addition to the NOLs in the table above, as of March31, 2008, we had pre-acquisition NOLs of $570million from acquisitions outside the
U.S. which have been fully reserved. The realization of these pre- acquisition NOLs will result in a reduction of goodwill. No pre-acquisition NOLs were utilized during the years ended March31, 2008 and 2007. As a result of the adoption of SFAS No123R we recognize windfall tax benefits associated with the exercise of stock options directly to
stockholders equity only when realized. Accordingly, deferred tax assets are not recognized for NOLs resulting from windfall tax benefits. At March31, 2008, deferred tax assets do not include $02 million of excess tax benefits from
share based compensation. 
57 Table of Contents Accelrys, Inc. Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements Continued 
At March31, 2007, we had a tax reserve of $07 million related to a potential transfer pricing
issue in the U.K. As a result of our adoption of FIN No48 on April1, 2007, we reversed the reserve with a corresponding adjustment to beginning retained earnings. Due to uncertainties surrounding our ability to generate future taxable income, a valuation allowance of $716 million was established to offset our
gross deferred tax asset as of April1, 2007, which primarily consisted of federal and state NOLs. At March31, 2008 the valuation allowance was reduced to $708 million. The future utilization of our NOLs to offset future taxable income
may be subject to a substantial annual limitation as a result of ownership changes that may have occurred previously or that could occur in the future. An assessment of such ownership changes under Sections 382 and 383 of the Internal Revenue Code
was completed through December31, 2007. As a result of this assessment, we have determined that there are no limitations under Sections 382 and 383 for our NOL and tax credit carryforwards. However, future ownership may impact the utilization
of the NOLs and tax credit carryforwards. Upon adoption of FIN 48 on April1, 2007, we did not have any uncertain tax positions. We do not expect any changes in our uncertain tax positions within the next 12 months. We are subject to taxation in the U.S., various state jurisdictions, the United Kingdom, France, Germany, and Japan. Our tax years from 1993 forward are
subject to examination by the U.S. and various other state jurisdictions due to the carryforward of unutilized NOLs and research and development credits. Our tax years from fiscal year 2006 forward are subject to examination by the United Kingdom
taxing authorities and from fiscal year 2003 forward are subject to examination by the Japanese taxing authorities. At March31,
2007, Accelrys, K.K. recognized an income tax payable and corresponding deferred tax asset of $48 million for revenue recognized for Japanese income tax purposes in advance of being recognized for book purposes as a result of the change in our
revenue recognition policy in connection with the restatement of our previously issued consolidated financial statements. In the first quarter of fiscal year 2008, we pursued alternative tax return positions that were consistent with Japanese tax
law and filed Accelrys K.K.s fiscal year 2007 income tax return. As a result, Accelrys K.K.s income tax obligation was reduced to $06 million, which was paid during the first quarter of fiscal year 2008. The associated deferred tax
asset was reversed in the same period. In April2003, we established a wholly-owned subsidiary, Accelrys Software Solutions Pvt. Ltd.
Accelrys,Pvt., in Bangalore, India, that qualifies under applicable Indian law for a tax holiday through March2009. The aggregate dollar amount of the tax holiday was $04 million, or $001 per share, as of March31,
2007. As discussed further in note 7, in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2007, we closed our research and development facility in Bangalore and terminated the approximately 60 employees of Accelrys, Pvt. Our discussions with the Indian taxing
authorities have concluded and we have no additional tax liabilities in India. Accordingly, we have not recorded a reserve for this matter as of March31, 2008.  5.
Retirement Savings Plans U.S. Based Employees 
We have an employee savings and retirement plan the 401KPlan. The 401KPlan is intended to be a tax-qualified plan
covering substantially all U.S. based employees. Under the terms of the 401KPlan, employees may elect to contribute up to 20% of their compensation, or the statutory prescribed limit, if less. We may, at our discretion, match employee
contributions up to a maximum of 4% of the employees compensation. Employer matching contributions totaled $07 million, $06 million and $04 million for the years ended March31, 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively.

For our U.S. based executives and members of our board of directors, we previously provided an
executive deferred compensation plan the EDC Plan, which was terminated during the first quarter of fiscal year 2008. Eligible participants were able to contribute up to 90% of their base salary and 100% of all other forms of
compensation into the EDC Plan. Amounts previously contributed under the EDC plan are held in a rabbi trust established for the benefit of
our directors and officers. In accordance with FIN No46, Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities, an Interpretation of ARB No51, the rabbi trust balances have been included in our consolidated balance sheets since the
trusts inception in March 2000. Changes in the values of the assets held by the rabbi trust accrue to the directors and officers and not to us. As of March31, 2008 and 2007, the assets and liabilities of the trust were $04 million and
$05 million, respectively. As a result of the termination of the EDC Plan, all balances will be distributed to participants during the second quarter of fiscal year 2009. Non-U.S. Based Employees We provide retirement benefits for employees located outside the U.S.
commensurate with other similar companies in those respective locations. Employer contributions, in the form of cash, totaled $07million, $06 million and $07 million for the years ended March31, 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively.

Commitments and Contingencies Operating Leases 
We lease office space in several facilities under operating leases that expire through 2022. Certain of our lease agreements contain renewal options,
rent holidays or rent escalation clauses. In accordance with SFAS No13, Accounting for Leases, we recognize rent expense on a straight-line basis over the term of the related operating leases, including any cancelable option periods
where failure to exercise such options would result in economic penalty. Rent expense recognized in excess of rent paid is reflected as a deferred rent liability, which is included in lease related liabilities in the accompanying consolidated
balance sheets. Rent expense under our operating leases for the years ended March31, 2008, 2007 and 2006, was $33 million, $37 million and $42 million, respectively. Additionally, under the terms of the lease for our San Diego, California corporate office, we were required to obtain an irrevocable letter of credit for
$66 million to ensure our performance under the lease agreement. If we are not in default under the lease, the letter of credit requirement will decrease to $44 million on September1, 2009, $30 million on September1, 2011 and will
expire upon termination of the lease on September1, 2013. The letter of credit is fully secured by marketable securities, which are included in restricted cash and marketable securities in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets.
We recognized sublease income in our consolidated statements of operations of $04 million for the year ended March31, 2006. No
sublease income was recognized in our consolidated statement of operations for the years ended March31, 2007 and March31, 2008.

Thereafter 16,650 16,650 38,328 1,661 36,667 Lease Guarantee On April30, 2004, we spun-off our drug discovery subsidiary, PDD, into an independent, separately traded, publicly held company through the distribution to our stockholders of a dividend of one
share of PDD common stock for every two shares of our common stock. The landlords of our New Jersey facilities, which were used by our PDD operations, consented to the assignment of the leases to PDD. Despite the assignment, the landlords required
us to guarantee the remaining lease obligations, which totaled approximately $191 million as of March31, 2008. In the event that PDD defaults on their lease obligation, we are permitted under the guarantee to sublease the facility in order to
mitigate our lease obligation. In accordance with FIN No45, we recognized a liability and corresponding charge to stockholders equity for the probability-weighted fair market value of the guarantee. Changes to the fair market value of
the liability are recognized in stockholders equity. The liability for our guarantee of the lease obligation was $05million and $06 million at March31, 2008 and 2007, respectively. Royalties We are obligated to pay royalties for
licenses to enhance and market certain software used in connection with our product offerings. Annual contractual minimum royalty payments as of March31, 2008 are as follows in thousands:  Fiscal year 2009 449

For purposes of the contractual minimum royalty payments table, we have included indefinite-lived contractual minimum royalty payments due in the ten fiscal years following fiscal
year 2008. In addition to the contractual minimum royalties included in the table above, we have several royalty agreements
that are long term or perpetual in nature and the royalty obligations are generally based on a percentage of revenues derived from certain software license sales and associated sales of PCS. The royalty agreements require quarterly payments and
generally do not limit the maximum royalties owed. During the years ended March31, 2008, 2007 and 2006, we incurred related royalty expense of $29 million, $27 million and $30 million, respectively.

Litigation We are not a party to any legal proceedings the negative outcome of which would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations. Other Guarantees and Indemnifications We provide
indemnifications of varying scope and size to certain customers against claims of intellectual property infringement made by third parties arising from the use of our products. We have also entered into indemnification agreements with our officers
and directors. Although the maximum potential amount of future payments we could be required to make under these indemnifications is unlimited, to date we have not incurred material costs to defend lawsuits or settle claims related to these
indemnification provisions. Additionally, we have insurance policies that, in most cases, would limit our exposure and enable us to recover a portion of any amounts paid. Therefore, we believe the estimated fair value of these agreements is minimal
and likelihood of incurring an obligation is remote. Accordingly, we have not accrued any liabilities in connection with these indemnification obligations as of March31, 2008.  7.

operations and overall financial performance through workforce reductions and the abandonment of leased facilities. All severance benefits related to these workforce reductions have been fully paid. Our remaining obligations under the lease
obligations terminate in fiscal year 2009. In March 2006, we implemented various actions designed to realign our resources with our
portfolio of products and services, eliminate redundancies in our workforce and streamline our operations through workforce reductions and abandoning two leased facilities in the United Kingdom. As a result of the implementation of these actions, we
recognized a charge of $32 million, consisting of $18million in severance benefits from the termination of approximately 50 employees and $14 million for our future lease obligations related to the abandoned facility, net of estimated
future sublease income. In fiscal year 2007, we recognized a charge of 
61 Table of Contents Accelrys, Inc. Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements Continued 
$03million for estimated additional severance benefits to be paid to certain employees terminated under the original restructuring plan and associated
legal expenses. We anticipate completing the payment of severance benefits in fiscal year 2009. Additionally, in fiscal year 2007 we recorded an additional lease abandonment charge of $03 million. The lease obligations for the abandoned facilities
terminate in fiscal years 2013 and 2022. As a result of the substantial completion of our product modernization and integration efforts,
in December 2006, we implemented a restructuring planwhich resulted in the closure of our research and development facility in Bangalore, India, and the termination of approximately 60 research and development employees.As a result of
the implementation of the restructuring plan, we recognized a charge of $09 million, consisting of $03 million of severance benefits and $06 million of asset impairment charges and other facility closure costs. The severance benefits and facility
closure costs were fully paid in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2007. All amounts incurred in connection with the above activities are
recorded in restructuring charges in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations.  8.
Subsequent Events In April 2008, as part of a plan
to continue to realign our workforce in order to support our growth products, we terminated approximately 30 employees in the U.S. and the U.K. In connection with the termination, we expect to incur approximately $08 million in severance charges in
the first quarter of fiscal year 2009. We plan to hire an equivalent number of employees in the first half of fiscal year 2009 with skill sets oriented to support our growth initiatives.  9.

Controls and Procedures Conclusion Regarding the Effectiveness
of Disclosure Controls and Procedures We maintain disclosure controls and procedures, as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15e and
15d-15eunder the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended the Exchange Act, that are designed to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed by us in the reports that we file or submit under the
Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC rulesand forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our principal executive officer
and principal financial officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required financial disclosures. Because of inherent limitations, our disclosure controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only
reasonable, and not absolute, assurance that the objectives of such disclosure controls and procedures are met. As of the end of the
period covered by this Report, we conducted an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, of the effectiveness of the design and
operation of our disclosure controls and procedures pursuant to Exchange Act Rules13a-15band 15d-15b. Based on this evaluation, our principal executive officer and principal financial officer concluded that our disclosure controls
and procedures were effective as of March31, 2008. Managements Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as such term is defined in Exchange Act
Rules13a-15fand 15d-15f. Our internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of the financial statements for
external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of
effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that internal controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with policies and procedures may deteriorate. Under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, we
conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting based on the framework set forth in Internal ControlIntegrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway
Commission. Based on our evaluation under the framework in Internal ControlIntegrated Framework, our management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of March31, 2008. Ernst Young LLP, the independent registered public accounting firm that audited the consolidated financial statements included in this Annual
Report on Form 10-K, has also audited the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of March31, 2008, as stated in their report which is included herein. Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting There have been no changes in our internal
control over financial reporting during the fourth quarter of fiscal year ended March31, 2008 that have or are reasonably likely to materially affect our internal control over financial reporting identified in connection with the previously
mentioned evaluation.

REPORT OF ERNST YOUNG LLP, INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM ON INTERNAL CONTROL
OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING The Board of Directors and Stockholders Accelrys, Inc. We have audited Accelrys Inc.s internal control over financial reporting as of
March31, 2008, based on criteria established in Internal ControlIntegrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission the COSO criteria. Accelrys, Inc.s management is responsible for
maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying Managements Report on Internal Control Over Financial
Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the companys internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board United States. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective
internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating
the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.
A companys internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability
of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A companys internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures
that 1pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; 2provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as
necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors
of the company; and 3provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the companys assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections
of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. In our opinion, Accelrys, Inc. maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of March31, 2008, based
on the COSO criteria. We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board United
States, the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Accelrys, Inc. as of March31, 2008 and 2007, and the related consolidated statements of operations, stockholders equity, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period
ended March31, 2008 of Accelrys, Inc. and our report dated May29, 2008 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon. /s/ ERNST YOUNG LLP San Diego, California May29, 2008
