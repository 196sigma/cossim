AUDITORS REPORT To the Shareholders and Board of
Directors of Midwest Air Group, Inc.: We have audited the accompanying consolidated
balance sheets of Midwest Air Group, Inc. formerly known as Midwest Express Holdings,
Inc., and subsidiary the Company as of December 31, 2003 and 2002, and the
related consolidated statements of operations, shareholders equity and cash flows
for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2003. These financial
statements are the responsibility of the Companys management. Our responsibility is
to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audits. We conducted our audits in accordance
with auditing standards generally accepted in the United States of America. Those
standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about
whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes
examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the
financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and
significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial
statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our
opinion. In our opinion, such financial
statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Midwest Air
Group, Inc. and subsidiary as of December 31, 2003 and 2002, and the results of their
operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December
31, 2003, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States
of America. s/ Deloitte Touche LLP Milwaukee, WisconsinFebruary

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS MIDWEST AIR GROUP, INC. YEARS ENDED DECEMBER
31, 2003, 2002 AND 2001 NOTE 1. BASIS OF
PRESENTATION AND BUSINESS Basis of Presentation The
accompanying consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Midwest Air Group,
Inc. the Company, formerly known as Midwest Express Holdings, Inc., and its
subsidiary, which is wholly owned. All significant intercompany accounts and transactions
have been eliminated in consolidation.  Nature of Operations Midwest Air
Group, Inc. has two separate operating entities, Midwest Airlines, Inc. Midwest
Airlines, formerly known as Midwest Express Airlines, Inc., and Skyway Airlines,
Inc., a wholly owned subsidiary of Midwest Airlines, doing business as Midwest Connect Midwest
Connect, formerly known as Astral Aviation, Inc. Midwest Airlines, a wholly owned
subsidiary of the Company, is a U.S. air carrier providing scheduled passenger service to
destinations in the United States. Midwest Airlines also provides aircraft charter, air
cargo and other airline services. Midwest Connect provides regional scheduled passenger
service to cities primarily in the Midwest.  NOTE 2. ACCOUNTING
POLICIES The accounting policies of the
Company conform to accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of
America. Significant policies are described below. Cash and Cash Equivalents The
Company considers all highly liquid investments with purchased maturities of three months
or less to be cash equivalents. They are carried at cost, which approximates market. Cash
is primarily held at three financial institutions.  Inventories Inventories consist primarily of
aircraft maintenance parts, maintenance supplies and fuel stated at the lower of cost on
the first-in, first-out FIFO method for Midwest Airlines, average cost for Midwest
Connect or market, and are expensed when used in operations.  Property and Equipment Property and
equipment are stated at cost and are depreciated on the straight-line method applied to
each unit of property for financial reporting purposes and by use of accelerated methods
for income tax purposes. Aircraft are depreciated to estimated residual values, and any
gain or loss on disposal is reflected in income.  The depreciable lives for the
principal asset categories are as follows:    Asset Category
Depreciable Life
Aircraft and related equipment
10 to 20 years
Other equipment
5 to 8 years
Office furniture and equipment
5 to 20 years
Buildings
40 years
Building and leasehold improvements
Lesser of 20 years or remaining
life of building or lease 44 Restricted Cash Restricted cash
pertains primarily to cash that is due the Company for advance credit card ticket
purchases, which under the terms of the agreement with the credit card processor is held
by the credit card processor until travel takes place; this restricted cash earns a
market rate of interest and is held primarily at one financial institution. Other
restricted cash pertains to deposits related to, among other things, workers
compensation policies and the Milwaukee County guarantee.  Other Assets Other assets primarily
consist of airport leasehold rights, capitalized software and credits from aircraft
manufacturers.  Impairment of Long-Lived Assets The
Company records impairment charges on long-lived assets used in operations when events
and circumstances indicate the assets may be impaired and the undiscounted cash flows
estimated to be generated by those assets are less than their carrying amount. The amount
of any impairment is based upon the fair market value of the related asset.  During second quarter 2001, the
Company decided to accelerate the retirement of eight Midwest DC-9-10 aircraft. In
connection with this decision, the Company performed evaluations to determine whether
future cash flows undiscounted and without interest charges expected to result from the
use and eventual disposition of these aircraft would be less than the aggregate carrying
amounts. As a result of the evaluation, the Company determined that the estimated future
cash flows expected to be generated by these aircraft would be less than their carrying
amount, resulting in impairment. Consequently, the original cost bases of these assets
were reduced to reflect the fair market value at the date of the decision, resulting in an
$88 million pre-tax impairment loss, and the remaining depreciable lives were adjusted
for the new retirement schedule. In determining the fair market value of these assets, the
Company considered market trends in aircraft dispositions, data from third parties and
management estimates. During first quarter 2002, the
Company decided to accelerate the retirement of the DC-9 fleet of Midwest Airlines in
anticipation of accelerated deliveries of Boeing 717 aircraft. In connection with this
decision, the Company again performed evaluations to determine whether
probability-weighted future cash flows from an asset undiscounted and without interest
charges expected to result from the use and eventual disposition of these aircraft would
be less than the aggregate carrying amounts. As a result of the evaluation, the Company
determined that the estimated probability-weighted future cash flows would be less than
the aggregate carrying amounts, resulting in an additional impairment. Consequently, in
the first quarter 2002, the cost bases of these assets were reduced to reflect the fair
market value at the date of the decision, resulting in a $299 million pre-tax
impairment loss, and the remaining depreciable lives of such assets were adjusted for the
new retirement schedule. In determining the fair market value of these assets, the Company
considered market trends in aircraft dispositions, data from third parties and management
estimates. Revenue Recognition Passenger
revenue, related commissions if any and cargo revenues are recognized in the period
when the service is provided. A portion of the revenue from the sale of frequent flyer
miles is deferred and recognized straight-line over 32 months. Contract maintenance
revenue is recognized when work is completed and invoiced. The estimated liability for
sold, but unused, tickets is included in current liabilities as air traffic liability.
The amount of commissions associated with unearned revenue is included in current assets
as prepaid commissions. After 13 months, any sold, but unused, tickets are recognized in
revenue and any related commission expense is recorded.  45 Advertising Expense Advertising
costs are charged to expense when incurred. Advertising expense for the years ended
December 31, 2003, 2002 and 2001 was $57 million, $76 million and $69 million,
respectively.  Concentrations of Risk Certain of
the Companys employees are covered under various collective bargaining agreements.
The Midwest Airlines pilot, Midwest Connect pilot and Midwest Airlines flight attendant
groups all ratified five-year contracts in August 2003. These contracts represent 8%, 12%
and 12%, respectively, of the Companys employees at December 31, 2003. The Company
operates approximately 88% of its flights and earns approximately 82% of its passenger
revenue based on Milwaukee-originating or Milwaukee-arriving flights; thus, the Company
is impacted by the economy of the Milwaukee area.  Fair Value of Financial Instruments
The Company believes the carrying value of its financial instruments cash and cash
equivalents, accounts receivable and accounts payable is a reasonable estimate of the
fair value of these instruments due to their short-term nature or variable interest rate.
The carrying value of derivative instruments has been marked to market based on the fair
value of similar instruments as of the balance sheet date. As of December 31, 2003, the
Company had no short- or long-term debt obligations that were subject to variable
interest rates. The Companys fixed rate debt was adjusted to market rates during
the restructuring that was completed in August 2003; the convertible notes were priced at
fixed rates during third quarter 2003 and therefore all debt reflects the current fair
value at December 31, 2003.  Maintenance and Repair Costs Routine
maintenance and repair costs for owned and leased aircraft are charged to expense when
incurred. Midwest Airlines expenses airframe maintenance costs as they are incurred.
Midwest Connect accrues for major airframe maintenance events for the regional jet fleet
by flight hour on a monthly basis. Airframe maintenance events for the Midwest Connect
turboprop fleet are expensed as incurred.  Substantially all of Midwest
Airlines and Midwest Connects engines are under fleet hour agreements and
therefore engine maintenance is expensed as incurred. Frequent Flyer Program A portion of
the revenue from the sale of frequent flyer mileage credits is deferred and recognized
straight-line over 32 months. The Company believes the method appropriately matches
revenues with the period in which services are provided.  The estimated incremental cost of
providing future transportation in conjunction with miles earned by travel under the
Companys frequent flyer program is accrued based on an estimated redemption
percentage of 76% applied to actual mileage recorded in members accounts that have
accumulated miles equal to or greater than the standard travel award. The ultimate cost
will depend on the actual redemption of frequent flyer miles and may be greater or less
than amounts accrued at December 31, 2003. Postretirement Health Care and Life
Insurance Benefits The costs of health care and life insurance benefit plans for retired
employees are accrued over the working lives of employees in accordance with Statement of
Financial Accounting Standards SFAS No. 106, Employers Accounting
for Postretirement Benefits Other Than Pensions. Income Taxes The Company accounts
for income taxes in accordance with SFAS No. 109, Accounting for Income Taxes SFAS
109. SFAS No. 109 requires that deferred income taxes be determined under
the asset and liability method. Deferred income taxes have been recognized for the future
tax consequences of temporary differences by applying enacted statutory tax rates
applicable to differences between the financial reporting and the tax bases of assets and
liabilities.  46 Leases Rental obligations under
operating leases for aircraft, facilities and equipment are charged to expense on the
straight-line method over the term of the lease.  Derivative Instruments and Hedging
Activities The Company periodically utilizes option contracts to mitigate the exposure to
the fluctuation in aircraft fuel prices in accordance with the Companys financial
risk management policy. This policy was adopted by the Company to document the Companys
philosophy toward financial risk and outline acceptable use of derivatives to mitigate
that financial risk. The options establish ceiling prices for anticipated jet fuel
purchases and serve as hedges of those purchases. The Company does not hold or issue
derivative instruments for trading purposes. At December 31, 2002, the Company had
options in place to hedge approximately 20% and 15% of its projected fuel purchases in
the first quarter and second quarter of 2003, respectively. These contracts expired at
various dates through June 30, 2003. At December 31, 2002, the options were valued at
$10 million and are included in other prepaid expense in the consolidated balance sheet.
The value of any options is determined using estimates of fair market value provided by
major financial institutions. At December 31, 2003, the Company had no options for
current or future periods.  The Company accounts for its fuel
hedge derivative instruments as cash flow hedges, as defined in SFAS No. 133,
Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities and the
corresponding amendments under SFAS No. 138, Accounting for Certain Derivative
Instruments and Certain Hedging Activities. Therefore, all changes in the fair value
of the derivative instruments that are considered effective are recorded in other
comprehensive income until the underlying hedged fuel is consumed, when they are
reclassified to the income statement as an offset of fuel expense. The Company
reclassified $11 million and $15 million to the income statement in 2003 and 2002,
respectively, as an offset to fuel expense when the hedges expired. Stock Options As permitted by SFAS
No. 123, Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation, the Company has elected to
follow APB No. 25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees and related
interpretations in accounting for stock options issued to employees.  Use of Estimates The preparation of
consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally
accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and
assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of
contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, and the
reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the year. Future results could differ
from those estimates.  New Accounting Pronouncements In May
2003, the Financial Accounting Standards Board FASB issued SFAS No. 150,
Accounting for Certain Financial Instruments with Characteristics of Both
Liabilities and Equity, which requires issuers to classify as liabilities certain
classes of freestanding financial instruments instruments that are entered into
separately from other instruments or transactions, or are legally detachable and
separately exercisable that represent obligations of the issuer. SFAS No. 150 is
effective for all public company freestanding financial instruments entered into or
modified after May 31, 2003. The adoption of SFAS No. 150, which was effective for the
Company on July 1, 2003, did not have a material impact on the Companys
consolidated financial statements.  47 In January 2003, the FASB issued
Interpretation No. 46, Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities FIN
46. FIN 46 requires the consolidation of certain types of entities in which a
company absorbs a majority of another entitys expected losses, receives a majority
of the other entitys expected residual returns, or both, as a result of ownership,
contractual or other financial interests in the other entity. These entities are called
variable interest entities. If an entity is determined to be a
variable interest entity, the entity must be consolidated by the primary
beneficiary. The primary beneficiary is the holder of the variable interests that
absorbs a majority of the variable interest entitys expected losses or receives a
majority of the entitys residual returns in the event no holder has a majority of
the expected losses. There is no primary beneficiary in cases where no single holder
absorbs the majority of the expected losses or receives a majority of the residual
returns. FIN 46 initially applied to variable
interest entities created after January 31, 2003 and to variable interest entities in
which a company obtained an interest after that date. In October 2003, the FASB deferred
the effective date of FIN 46 to December 31, 2003 for all interests in variable interest
entities existing prior to January 31, 2003. In December 2003, the FASB issued a revised
interpretation to clarify provisions of the original interpretation and to exempt certain
entities from its requirements. The Company has evaluated the impact of FIN 46 as it
relates to its operations, and believes the adoption did not have a material impact on its
financial statements. On December 8, 2003, the Medicare
Prescription Drug, Improvement and Modernization Act of 2003 the Act was
signed into law. The Act introduced a prescription drug benefit program under Medicare as
well as a federal subsidy to sponsors of retiree health care benefit plans. Certain
accounting issues raised by the Act, such as how to account for the federal subsidy, are
not explicitly addressed by FASB Statement No. 106, Employers Accounting for
Postretirement Benefits Other Than Pensions. The FASB issued FASB Staff Position
FSP No. FAS 106-1, Accounting and Disclosure Requirements Related to
the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement and Modernization Act of 2003 FSP
No. 106-1, that allows sponsors to elect to defer recognition of the effects of the
Act to await guidance from various governmental and regulatory agencies concerning the
requirements that must be met to obtain these cost reductions, as well as the manner in
which such savings should be measured. In accordance with FSP No. 106-1, the Company has
elected to defer recognition of the effects of the Act. When guidance is issued, it could
require a change in previously reported information. Accordingly, the financial statements
do not reflect the effects of the Act. NOTE 3. PROPERTY AND

413,071 As of December 31, 2003, Midwest had
19 jet aircraft in service financed by operating leases. These leases have expiration
dates ranging from 2004 through 2023 and can generally be renewed, based on the fair
market value at the end of the lease term, for one to four years. Most of the leases
include purchase options at or near the end of the lease term at fair market value. Midwest Airlines has received credit
memos from certain suppliers associated with the delivery of each Boeing 717 aircraft to
be used for the acquisition of aircraft spare parts and maintenance tooling, employee
training, flight simulator rental, aircraft lease payments and engine maintenance
agreements. As of December 31, 2003, the amount of unused credit memos totaled $101
million and is recorded as Other Assets. Midwest Airlines will receive additional credit
memos on the delivery of each subsequent Boeing 717 aircraft, and will continue to use the
credits as needed to pay for applicable services. The benefit of these credit memos is
being recognized over the term of the leases. As of December 31, 2003, Midwest
Connects 14 turboprop aircraft were financed under operating leases with a lease
term of 12 years and an expiration date of 2008. These leases permit renewal for various
periods at rates approximating fair market value and purchase options at or near the end
of the lease term at fair market value. In the fourth quarter 1999, the
Company entered into lease agreements to finance the acquisition of five Fairchild
328JETs. The leases run for a term of 165 years, with expiration of all leases occurring
in 2016. These leases permit renewal for various periods at rates approximating fair
market value and purchase options at or near the end of the lease term at fair market
value. On April 23, 2001, the Company
completed a $63 million financing of a new maintenance facility for Midwest Connect
located at General Mitchell International Airport. Occupancy of the new maintenance
facility began in February 2002. The facility is financed by 32-year, tax-exempt,
variable-rate demand industrial development revenue bonds issued by the City of Milwaukee.
To ensure the tax-exempt status, Milwaukee County is the owner of the facility and
guarantor of principal and interest payments. Interest payments made to bondholders and
amortization of principal are recorded as rent expense. In October 1998, Midwest moved into a
newly constructed maintenance facility that is owned by Milwaukee County and located at
General Mitchell International Airport. To finance the $79 million project, the City of
Milwaukee issued variable-rate demand industrial development revenue bonds. The
Companys variable rent payments are based on the current interest rate of the City
of Milwaukees outstanding tax-exempt bonds over the 32-year lease term. Milwaukee
County is the owner and guarantor of principal and interest payments. Rent expense for all operating
leases, excluding landing fees, was $47,889,000, $40,723,000 and $39,021,000 for 2003,
2002 and 2001, respectively. 49 During 2003, the Company recorded
$50 million pre-tax of aircraft lease expense for seven leased DC-9 aircraft removed
from Midwest Airlines service during the year. These non-cash expenses were included in
the aircraft rentals line of the Companys statements of operations. The expense
reflects future obligations for these aircraft following their out-of-service dates. The
Company has three additional DC-9 leased aircraft that it plans to remove from service by
April 2004. The Company expects to record an additional non-cash charge of $16 million
pre-tax in accordance with SFAS No. 146 in relation to these aircraft. The remaining
lease payments on these aircraft are reflected in the lease payment table above. NOTE 5. FINANCING
AGREEMENTS Credit Card Holdback The
Company has agreements with organizations that process credit card transactions arising
from purchases of air travel tickets by customers of the Company. The Company has one
such agreement with an organization that processes MasterCard/Visa transactions. Credit
card processors have financial risk associated with tickets purchased for travel because
although the processor generally forwards the cash related to the purchase to the Company
soon after the purchase is completed, the air travel generally occurs after that time and
the processor would have liability if the Company does not ultimately deliver the travel.
The agreement with the organization that processes MasterCard/Visa transactions was
amended in January 2002 to allow the credit card processor to create and maintain a
reserve account that is funded by retaining cash that it otherwise would deliver to the
Company i.e., restricted cash. As of December 31, 2003, the retained cash
amount was 100% of the credit card processors risk exposure, or approximately $209
million. This became effective in conjunction with an agreement, executed August 29,
2003, to extend the credit card processing agreement to February 28, 2004. Subsequently,
the Company and the credit card processor agreed to a two-week extension to complete a
new agreement. The Company expects that it will be able to renew the agreement with the
current processor by the expiration of the two-week extension. The August 2003 extension
included an increase in processing fees and release of a second priority lien that exists
on substantially all non-aircraft personal property of the Company and certain aircraft,
and of a third priority lien on the Companys headquarters facility. The Company
also has agreements with American Express, Diners Club and Discover. As of December 31,
2003, American Express had retained cash related to credit card processing totaling $10
million. If current industry conditions persist, other credit card processors may require
holdbacks as well. The aggregate amount of the risk exposure of the processors other
than amounts under holdback as of February 2004 was approximately $64 million.  Credit Facility On August 29, 2003,
the Company amended the agreement relating to its bank credit facility to extend the
existing credit facility to November 26, 2003. In addition to the extension, the
amendment to the credit facility waived certain defaults that occurred prior to the
amendment, removed certain financial covenants, and modified a requirement that the
Company maintain a minimum amount of unrestricted cash. The amendment gave the Company
additional time to seek long-term financing while maintaining its existing letters of
credit issued under the credit facility. As of December 31, 2003, the Company had repaid
all borrowings under the bank credit facility. As of December 31, 2002, the Company had
outstanding borrowings under the facility of $55 million.  In October 2003, the Company
completed a transaction with Milwaukee County, Racine County and the State of Wisconsin
that reduced the amount of letters of credit outstanding under the credit facility to
approximately $11 million. AircraftThree 328JETs were
originally financed for a 32-month period beginning in 2001 at fixed rates of interest
ranging from 558% to 592% for the first 26 to 28 months. The interest rates revert to a
variable rate for the last few months of the financing agreement. The loans were
scheduled to come due in August and November 2003 and January 2004, respectively. As part
of the aircraft lease and loan restructuring that occurred in third quarter 2003, the
loans were extended to July 2013 at a fixed rate of interest of 40%.  50 In June 2001, one MD-80 series
aircraft was debt-financed for approximately $81 million for seven years at a fixed
interest rate of 739%. As part of the aircraft lease and loan restructuring that occurred
in third quarter 2003, a sale and leaseback was completed that resulted in the Company
leasing the aircraft through February 2013. In the second quarter 2002, Midwest
Airlines entered into a loan agreement to fund pre-delivery progress payments to The
Boeing Company for new Boeing 717 aircraft. Midwest Airlines entered into the loan
agreement with Kreditanstalt fur Wiederaufbau Bank KfW with the assistance
of Rolls-Royce Deutschland Ltd. Co. KG Rolls-Royce. Rolls-Royce agreed
to guarantee this loan agreement on behalf of Midwest Airlines. The loan agreement
provides up to $450 million in pre-delivery progress payment financing. To date, Midwest
Airlines has made pre-delivery progress payments of $374 million for the Boeing 717
aircraft program. As of December 31, 2003, Midwest Airlines owed $265 million under the
loan agreement. Under a financing commitment between Midwest Airlines and Boeing Capital
Corporation BCC, at each aircraft delivery BCC acquires and pays for the
aircraft delivered, including interest accrued on the debt owed KfW, and then leases the
aircraft to Midwest Airlines. At that time, BCC reimburses Midwest Airlines in full for
the pre-delivery progress payments Midwest Airlines has made. To the extent Midwest
Airlines originally funded such payments through KfW, Midwest Airlines uses the amounts
reimbursed to repay the related debt to KfW. To the extent Midwest Airlines originally
funded such payments with operating cash, the amounts reimbursed represent available cash.
The loan balance above reflects the net effect of pre-delivery progress payments and
delivery reimbursements as of December 31, 2003. Interest accrues from the date of
borrowing to the aircraft delivery date, and is included in the final purchase price as
capitalized interest. The interest rate on borrowings under the agreement is LIBOR plus
195 basis points. This debt has been classified as long-term in the accompanying condensed
consolidated balance sheet. There are no financial covenants associated with this debt
obligation. With the loan agreement with KfW and
the BCC commitment, the Company believes it has requisite financing for the Boeing 717
program. Although BCC is able to terminate its financing commitment if it deems the
Company has experienced a material adverse change and the commitment is subject to other
conditions, the Company does not anticipate that the financing commitment will be
terminated or that the Company will be unable to meet the conditions. In connection with the final
restructuring agreements with the aircraft lessors and lenders, the Companys
subsidiaries delivered subordinated promissory notes the Basic Moratorium
Notes to the lessors and lenders. Each of the Basic Moratorium Notes was delivered
pursuant to an agreement to amend the existing lease or financing agreements. Each of the
Basic Moratorium Notes constitutes payment in full for regularly scheduled amounts due
under such lease and financing agreements that Midwest Airlines or Skyway Airlines failed
to pay to the lessors or lenders during the Companys payment moratorium from
February 28, 2003 through August 30, 2003. The aggregate principal amount of the Basic
Moratorium Notes is $7,533,000. Principal and interest on the Basic Moratorium Notes are
payable, in arrears, in 36 monthly installments commencing in July 2004. The Basic
Moratorium Notes bear interest at 10% per annum beginning June 30, 2004. Headquarters In August 1997,
the Company purchased its headquarters building, which it had previously leased. As part
of the transaction, the Company assumed $35 million of long-term debt. The mortgage had
an interest rate of 825% and was payable in monthly installments through April 2011. In
November 2003, the Company completed a sale and leaseback of the headquarters buildings.
The initial lease term is 15 years with options to renew the lease for four successive
five-year periods at fair market value lease rates. Monthly payments increase by
approximately 56% for years 6-10 and another 70% for years 11-15; however, the payments
are recorded on the straight-line basis over the life of the lease. A portion of the
proceeds was used to pay off the outstanding mortgage.  51 Convertible Debt On September
29, 2003, the Company entered into agreements under which it raised financing of
approximately $33 million net proceeds approximated $311 million, after commissions and
expenses. The financing included two components: the sale of $25 million in convertible
senior secured notes and the sale of 1,882,353 shares of the Companys common stock
for an aggregate purchase price of approximately $8 million. The equity transaction is
discussed more fully in Note 7. Most of the Companys assets, including aircraft,
spare parts and landing slots, were pledged as security to the convertible note holders.
The Company sold the convertible senior secured notes and the common stock in private
placements to certain qualified institutional investors and accredited investors.  The convertible senior secured notes
bear interest at 675% and mature on October 1, 2008. The notes are secured by certain
assets of the Company and its subsidiaries in accordance with a Security Agreement and by
a Mortgage granted by Midwest Connect. The notes are generally convertible at any time at
the option of the note holders into shares of common stock of the Company at an initial
conversion price of $500 per share, which is subject to adjustment pursuant to certain
anti-dilution provisions. The note holders may not convert any portion of the outstanding
and unpaid principal of the notes to the extent that, after giving effect to such
conversion, the note holder together with such note holders affiliates would
beneficially own in excess of 499% or 999%, as the case may be for the respective note
holder, of the number of shares of common stock outstanding immediately after giving
effect to such conversion. A note holder may waive the 499% limitation with such waiver
being effective on the 61st calendar day after the Company receives notice of the waiver. The terms of the agreements specify
that the Company is subject to certain operating restrictions that, among other things,
limit the Companys ability to sell assets and make loans. In addition, the Company
may not, except as required under certain contracts, plans or arrangements, redeem,
declare or pay any cash dividends or distributions on common stock without the consent of
the note holders. The agreements require the Company to maintain a minimum monthly
unrestricted cash balance of $375 million. In addition, the agreements also specify
customary events of default for debt securities of this type, including, among others,
failure to make payments when due, breaches of covenant, breaches of representations and
warranties, cross-default to other indebtedness, bankruptcy and insolvency defaults, and
unsatisfied judgment defaults. If the Company breaches a covenant, some or all of the
convertible notes may be subject to redemption. Future maturities of long-term debt
on all debt obligations, including the Basic Moratorium Note, debt related to the 328JET
aircraft and the convertible notes for the next five years are as follows in thousands:    Year ended December 31,

warrants to certain lessors and lenders that currently give the holders the right to
purchase in the aggregate 1,571,467 shares of the Companys common stock at an
exercise price per share of $472. The warrants expire in August 2013. None of the
warrants had been exercised as of December 31, 2003. NOTE 7.
SHAREHOLDERS EQUITY During second quarter 2002, the
Company generated gross proceeds of $219 million through the private placement of
1,675,000 shares of the Companys common stock to qualified institutional investors
at $1309 per share. Net proceeds, after commissions and expenses, of $205 million were
used to reduce indebtedness and provide general working capital. During fourth quarter 2003, the
Company generated gross proceeds of $80 million through the private placement of
1,883,353 shares of the Companys common stock to qualified institutional investors
at $425 per share. Net proceeds, after commissions and expenses, of $75 million were
used to reduce indebtedness and provide general working capital. In 1996, the Board of Directors
adopted a shareholder rights plan and made a dividend distribution of one Preferred Share
Purchase Right Right on each outstanding share of the Companys common
stock. As a result of the 3-for-2 stock splits effected in May 1997 and 1998, four-ninths
of a Right is now associated with each share of common stock. The Rights are exercisable
only if a person or entity acquires 15% or more of the common stock of the Company or
announces a tender offer for 15% or more of the common stock. Each Right initially
entitles its holder to purchase one one-hundredth share of the Companys Series A
Preferred Stock at an exercise price of $100, subject to adjustment. If a person or entity
acquires 15% or more of the Companys common stock, then each Right will entitle the
holder to purchase, at the Rights then-current exercise price, Company common stock
valued at twice the exercise price. The Board of Directors is also authorized to reduce
the 15% threshold to not less than 10%. The Rights expire in 2006. 53 In connection with the final
restructuring agreements with the aircraft lessors and lenders, the Company issued
warrants to certain lessors and lenders that currently give the holders the right to
purchase in the aggregate 1,571,467 shares of the Companys common stock at an
exercise price per share of $472. The weighted average fair value of the warrants at the
grant date was $289. The warrants expire in August 2013. None of the warrants had been
exercised as of December 31, 2003. The assumptions used to calculate the fair value of the
warrants were comparable to the weighted average assumptions used to calculate the fair
value of options issued under the Companys stock option plans under SFAS No 123,
Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation SFAS 123. Under the Companys 1995 Stock
Option Plan, the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors may grant options, at
its discretion, to certain employees to purchase shares of common stock. An aggregate of
2,548,900 shares of common stock is reserved for issuance under the Plan, of which 347,003
shares are available for future grants at December 31, 2003. Under the Plan, options
granted have an exercise price equal to 100% of the fair market value of the underlying
stock at the date of grant. Granted options become exercisable at the rate of 30% after
the first year, 30% after the second year and the remaining 40% after the third year,
unless otherwise determined, and have a maximum term of 10 years. Under the Companys 2003
All-Employee Stock Option Plan, the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors may
grant options, at its discretion, to certain non-represented employees and each union may
grant options, at its discretion, to certain represented employees to purchase shares of
common stock. An aggregate of 1,551,741 shares of common stock is reserved for issuance
under the Plan, of which 586,423 shares are available for future grants at December 31,
2003. Granted options for non-represented employees become exercisable at the rate of 33?%
immediately upon the date of grant, 33?% after the first year and the remaining 33?% after
the second year. Options for represented employees become exercisable in varying
increments as determined by each union, such that no more than 33?% of the options
allocated to a represented group become exercisable immediately upon the date of grant.
All options granted under this Plan will expire no later than August 21, 2013. Transactions with respect to the
Plans where the exercise price was equal to the market price on the date of grant have
been adjusted to reflect the effect of the two stock splits and are summarized as follows:

The Company has adopted the
disclosure requirements of SFAS 123 as amended by SFAS No. 148. The Company has elected to
continue to follow the provisions of Accounting Principles Board No. 25, Accounting
for Stock Issued to Employees and its related interpretations; accordingly, no
compensation cost has been reflected for the 1995 stock option plan in the consolidated
financial statements. Compensation expense was recognized for the difference between the
fair value and exercise price as of grant date for shares issued under the 2003
All-Employee Stock Option Plan. Had compensation costs for the
Companys stock option plan been determined based on their fair value at the grant
dates for awards under those plans consistent with the method of SFAS 123, the

As of December 31, 2003, the Company
has state net operating losses of approximately $125 million, which will begin to expire
in the year ending December 31, 2005. In 2003 and 2002, the Company recorded a valuation
allowance on the state net operating losses of $27 million and $07 million,
respectively, based on the Companys best estimates. As of December 31, 2003, the
Company has recorded federal net operating losses of $110 million, which begin to expire
in 2023. 57 Income taxes have been settled with
the Internal Revenue Service IRS for all years through 1996, and IRS
examinations have been completed through 2002. As a result of the completion of the
examinations, the Company will make payments of approximately $39 million in 2004. The
Company believes adequate provision for all outstanding issues has been made for all open
years. In connection with the Companys
initial public offering in 1995 the Offering, the Company, Midwest, Midwest
Connect and Kimberly-Clark entered into a Tax Allocation and Separation Agreement
Tax Agreement. Pursuant to the Tax Agreement, the Company is treated for tax
purposes as if it purchased all of Midwests assets at the time of the Offering, and
as a result, the tax bases of Midwests assets were increased to the deemed purchase
price of the assets. The tax on the amount of the gain on the deemed asset purchase was
paid by Kimberly-Clark. This additional basis is expected to result in increased income
tax deductions and, accordingly, may reduce income taxes otherwise payable by the Company.
Pursuant to the Tax Agreement, the Company will pay to Kimberly-Clark the amount of the
tax benefit associated with this additional basis retaining 10% of the tax benefit, as
realized on a quarterly basis, calculated by comparing the Companys actual taxes to
the taxes that it would have owed had the increase in basis not occurred. In the event of
certain business combinations or other acquisitions involving the Company, tax benefit
amounts thereafter will not take into account, under certain circumstances, income,
losses, credits or carryovers of businesses other than those historically conducted by
Midwest or the Company. Except for the 10% benefit, the effect of the Tax Agreement is to
put the Company in the same financial position it would have been in had there been no
increase in the tax bases of Midwests assets. The effect of the retained 10% benefit
is reflected in the consolidated financial statements as a reduction in the Companys
provision for income taxes. NOTE 9. COMMITMENTS AND
CONTINGENCIES In February 1997, Midwest Airlines
agreed to pay $925 million over 15 years for the naming rights to the Midwest Airlines
Center, an 800,000-square-foot convention center in Milwaukee that opened in July 1998. As
of December 31, 2003, the Company had remaining cash payments on this commitment of $47
million. In April 2002, the Company announced
that it had amended its Boeing 717 aircraft order. The Company placed a firm order for 25
new Boeing 717 aircraft, with purchase rights for an additional 25 aircraft. The firm
order is valued at $940 million, with a remaining value of approximately $526 million
relating to undelivered aircraft as of December 31, 2003. Under an amended purchase
agreement, delivery of the aircraft began in February 2003 and was to continue into 2005
at a rate of one aircraft every month. In July 2003, Midwest Airlines announced that it
was further amending the delivery schedule for the Boeing 717 aircraft. Midwest Airlines
will now receive one aircraft per month through March 2004; subsequent deliveries will
take place approximately one aircraft per quarter until all 25 aircraft on order are
delivered by October 2006. In April 2001, Midwest Connect signed
a memorandum of understanding placing firm orders for 20 new Embraer regional jets, with
options to purchase 20 additional aircraft. The firm order is valued at $400 million. In
August 2001, the parties signed a purchase agreement related to this order. Under this
purchase agreement, delivery of the 20 aircraft was scheduled to begin in January 2002. In
October 2001, due to ramifications of the events of September 11, Midwest Connect reached
an agreement with Embraer to delay deliveries of the first aircraft to January 2003. For
similar reasons, Midwest Connect reached further agreement with Embraer in March 2002 to
delay delivery of the first aircraft until January 2004. This delay was intended to allow
the Company to concentrate on the introduction of Boeing 717 aircraft to the Midwest
Airlines fleet and provide additional time for Midwest Connect to evaluate financing
alternatives. Midwest Connect plans to use the new Embraer regional jets to expand service
in existing and new markets. Because the regional jets are produced in three sizes, they
are expected to provide Midwest Connect with flexibility to serve markets with differing
capacity demands. The Embraer regional jet program requires less significant pre-delivery
payments than the Boeing 717 program but will require long-term financing on or after
delivery. Midwest Connect believes long-term financing will be difficult to obtain given
current industry conditions and Company financial results, and for these reasons, Midwest
Connect reached agreement with Embraer in July 2003 to defer acquisition of these aircraft
until July 2006. The contract has been amended to reflect this agreement. Midwest Connect
will not incur any cost or face claims for breach of contract in relation to the deferral. 58 As a result of the restructuring of
lease and debt agreements described in Note 5, the Company has significantly lowered its
obligations compared with the obligations under the previous lease and debt agreements.
Included in the restructured agreements are clauses that would make the Companys
obligations, under certain default situations, increase to the amounts under the previous
agreements. The amount of such contingent obligation of the Company is approximately $232
million as of December 31, 2003. The Company is party to routine
litigation incidental to its business. Management believes that none of this litigation is
likely to have a material adverse effect on the Companys consolidated financial
statements. NOTE 10. SETTLEMENT OF
ARBITRATION Midwest Connect currently operates 10
32-passenger Fairchild 328JET regional jets. In September 2001, Midwest Connect settled
its arbitration with Fairchild Dornier GmbH Fairchild over the cancellation
of the 428JET program. In the first quarter 2002, the Company recorded as other income
$395 million pre-tax associated with the settlement. NOTE 11. RETIREMENT AND
BENEFIT PLANS The Company uses a December 31
measurement date for purposes of calculations of plan assets and obligations and all other
related measurements. Qualified Defined Benefit Plan In
2003 and 2002, Midwest Airlines had one qualified defined benefit plan: the Pilots
Supplemental Pension Plan. This plan provides retirement benefits to Midwest Airlines
pilots represented by their collective bargaining agreement.  Nonqualified Defined Benefit Plans
Nonqualified defined benefit plans consist of an Executive Supplemental Plan and
a Pilots Nonqualified Supplemental Pension Plan. The Executive Supplemental
Plan provides annuity benefits for salary in excess of IRS salary limits that could not
be applied in the qualified Salaried Employees Retirement Plan. The Executive
Supplemental Plan was terminated as of March 31, 2000, however benefits remain frozen in
this account while the Company evaluates alternatives. The other Midwest Airlines
nonqualified defined benefit plan is the Pilots Nonqualified Supplemental Pension
Plan. This plan provides Midwest Airlines pilots with annuity benefits for salary in
excess of IRS salary limits that cannot be covered by the qualified Pilots Supplemental
Pension Plan.  59 The following table sets forth the

Assumptions for the above table
include a discount rate of 600%, 675% and 775% for 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively.
The rate of compensation increase for all qualified defined benefit plans was 544% for
2003, 2002 and 2001. The rate of compensation increase for all nonqualified defined
benefit plans was 438% for 2003, 2002 and 2001. The expected return on plan assets for
all defined benefit plans was 900% for 2003, 2002 and 2001. The Company offers severance
arrangements to certain Midwest Airlines pilots. The liability under this plan at December
31, 2003 was $45 million. Postretirement Health
Care and Life Insurance Benefits Midwest Airlines allows retirees to
participate in unfunded health care and life insurance benefit plans. Benefits are based
on years of service and age at retirement. The plans are principally non-contributory for
current retirees, and are contributory for most future retirees. The following table sets forth the

Assumptions for the above table
include a discount rate of 675%, 725% and 775% for 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively.
The rate of compensation increase was 438% for 2003, 2002 and 2001. As the Company is in
an unfunded position for this plan, there is no expected return on plan assets. A 1000%
annual rate of increase in the per capita cost of covered health care benefits was assumed
for 2004. The rate was assumed to decrease 1% per year to 500% for 2009 and remain at
that level thereafter. A one-percentage-point change in assumed health care cost trend
rates would not have a material effect to the financial statements. The preset limit on the
Companys annual payment toward retiree healthcare has been reached; all costs above
this preset cap are paid by retirees. Plan Assets The asset allocation for the
Companys U.S. pension plans at the end of 2003 and 2002, and the target allocation
for 2004, by asset category, follows. The fair value of plan assets for these plans is
$3,383,134 and $1,680,382 at the end of 2003 and 2002, respectively. The expected
long-term rate of return on these plan assets was 900% in 2003 and 900% in 2002. On a
go-forward basis, the expected rate of return will be 8%. The return on plan assets reflects
the weighted-average of the expected long-term rates of return for the broad categories of
investments held in the plan. The expected long-term rate of return is adjusted when there
are fundamental changes in expected returns on the plan investments; this adjustment takes
into account consideration from the actuary regarding long-term market conditions and
investment management performance.

Plan Investment Strategy The Qualified Plan has a Fiduciary
Committee that oversees the investment of the assets of the Plan. The Fiduciary Committee
has created an investment policy for the assets of the Plan. The basic investment strategy
for plan assets provide that over the investment horizon established in the policy, it is
expected that the aggregate Plan assets will meet or exceed:  
An
absolute annual rate of return of 8%, based on the blended weighted-average return on
equity and fixed income securities based on the target allocation.  
An
absolute real return excess of inflation of 5%.  
The
return of a balanced market index comprised of 75% SP 500 Stock Index and 25% Lehman
Brothers Intermediate Government/Credit Bond Index. 62 The investment goals above are the
objectives of the aggregate Plan, and are not meant to be imposed on each investment
account if more than one account is used. The goal of each investment manager, over the
investment horizon, shall be to:  
Meet
or exceed the market index, or blended market index, selected and agreed upon by the Plan
Fiduciary Committee that most closely corresponds to the style of investment management.  
Display
an overall level of risk in the portfolio that is consistent with the risk associated
with the benchmark specified above. Risk will be measured by the standard deviation of
quarterly returns. Specific investment goals and
constraints for each investment manager are incorporated as part of the investment policy. Expected Cash Flows Information about expected cash flows

72 Qualified Defined Contribution Plans
Midwest Airlines makes monthly contributions to substantially all employees accounts
under the Retirement Account Plan. Company contributions vary based on the age of the
employee. In addition, under the Retirement Account Plan, some employees who were
participants in the terminated Midwest Airlines Pension Plan on March 31, 2000 may
receive additional transition benefits each year.  Company contributions under the
Retirement Account Plan are limited to the extent required by tax provisions. To the
extent contributions to the Retirement Account Plan are limited under tax law, any excess
will be paid pursuant to supplemental retirement arrangements. The amounts expensed and
reflected in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations were $38 million 42 million and $46 million, in 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively. The Company has two voluntary defined
contribution investment plans covering substantially all employees. Under these plans, the
Company matches a portion of an employees contributions if certain thresholds are
met. Amounts expensed and reflected in the accompanying consolidated statements of
operations were $01 million, $02 million and $20 million in 2003, 2002 and 2001,
respectively. Effective October 1, 2001, Midwest Airlines temporarily suspended matching
contributions to its 401k program following the events of September 11. In 2002, Midwest
Airlines reinstated matching contributions using a targeted profitability measure. Midwest
Connect matches 25% of employee contributions up to 10% of an employees salary. In
addition, Midwest Connect will increase matching contributions above that level if
targeted profitability measures are met. Profit Sharing Plans The Company has
three profit sharing plans: an employee profit sharing plan for substantially all
employees of Midwest Airlines, an employee profit sharing plan for substantially all
employees of Midwest Connect, and an Annual Incentive Plan for key management employees.
Company contributions for all plans are based primarily on achieving specified levels of
profitability. The Company expensed $0, $0 and $0 under these plans during 2003, 2002 and
2001, respectively. During 2003, the Company announced an income-sharing plan that
replaces these plans.  63 NOTE 12. SEGMENT
REPORTING Midwest Airlines and Midwest Connect
constitute the two reportable segments of the Company. The Companys reportable
segments are strategic units that are managed independently because they provide different
services with different cost structures and marketing strategies. No single customer
accounted for more than 10% of revenue. The accounting policies of the reportable segments
are the same as those described in Note 2. As of December 31, 2003, Midwest
Airlines offered jet service to 23 destinations throughout the United States. As of
December 31, 2003, Midwest Airlines operated a fleet of 28 aircraft 4 DC-9s, 11
MD-81/82s, two MD-88s and 11 Boeing 717s. Midwest Connect offers point-to-point
service in select markets and increases traffic for Midwest Airlines by providing
passengers with connecting service to Midwest Airlines flights. As of December 31,
2003, Midwest Connect operated a fleet of 14 Beech 1900D turboprop aircraft and 10
Fairchild 328JETs. Revenue for passengers who travel on
both carriers within a single itinerary is allocated to each entity based on a formula
that is dependent on the fare type paid by the passenger. There were 207,084, 182,095 and
166,380 passengers in 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively, under the aforementioned pricing
agreement. Although Midwest Connect is
independent from an operational perspective, Midwest Airlines performs a number of
services for Midwest Connect including, but not limited to, aircraft scheduling, pricing,
reservations, yield management, advertising and fuel procurement. Midwest Connect is
charged a marketing service fee for these services 83 %, 83% and 83% of the
revenue for passengers who travel exclusively on Midwest Connect and approximately $116 116 and $116 per passenger for passengers who connect between the carriers for the
years ended December 31, 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively. These service charges comprise
a majority of the intercompany revenue and expense between the two segments. Midwest Airlines also performs
treasury functions for Midwest Connect, including centrally controlling cash. Midwest
Connect earns interest income at market rates for any cash managed by Midwest Airlines.
This interest income comprises the intercompany interest income and expense shown as
eliminations in the following information. The total asset elimination consists primarily
of the intercompany payable and receivable balances. 64 Reportable segments, as defined by
SFAS No. 131, Disclosure about Segments of an Enterprise and Related
Information, are components of an enterprise about which separate financial
information is available that is evaluated regularly by the chief operating decision-maker
in deciding resource allocation and assessing performance.    2003
