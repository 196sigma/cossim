Item 8.
Financial Statements and Supplementary Data Independent Auditors
Report The Board of Directors and Shareholders
CIBER, Inc. We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of CIBER,
Inc. and subsidiaries as of December31, 2003 and 2002, and the related
consolidated statements of operations, shareholders equity, and cash flows for
each of the years in the three-year period ended December31, 2003. These
consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the Companys
management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated
financial statements based on our audits. We conducted our audits in accordance with auditing standards generally
accepted in the United States of America. Those standards require that we plan
and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the
financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes
examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in
the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting
principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as
evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our
audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above
present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of CIBER, Inc.
and subsidiaries as of December31, 2003 and 2002, and the results of
their operations and their cash flows for each of the years in the three-year
period ended December31, 2003, in conformity with accounting principles
generally accepted in the United States of America. As discussed in note 2 to the consolidated financial statements, the
Company changed its method of accounting for intangible assets in 2002 and for
business combinations in 2001.

Dollar amounts in thousands, except per share amounts 1 Description of
Operations CIBER, Inc. and its subsidiaries provide information technology IT
system integration consulting and other IT services. We also resell certain third-party IT hardware and software
products. Our services are offered on a project or strategic staffing basis, in
both custom and enterprise resource planning ERP package environments, and
across all technology platforms, operating systems and infrastructures. Our
clients consist primarily of governmental agencies and Fortune 500 and middle
market companies, across most major industries. We serve clients through local
branch offices that are located throughout the United States and Europe, plus
Canada and India, as well as several hundred traveling consultants. Foreign operations accounted for 11% of our
total revenue in 2003. 2 Summary of
Significant Accounting Policies The following is a description of our more significant accounting policies. The accounting policies and estimates we
believe are most critical to the Companys financial condition and operating
results pertain to revenue recognition including estimates of costs to
complete engagements; collectibility of accounts receivable; acquisition
accounting; valuation of goodwill and other intangible assets; accrued
compensation and other liabilities and estimates of effective tax rates. a Principles of
Consolidation The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of CIBER,
Inc. and all of its majority-owned subsidiaries. All material intercompany
balances and transactions have been eliminated. b Estimates The preparation of these financial statements in conformity with
generally accepted accounting principles in the United States requires
management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts
of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent liabilities and the
reported amounts of revenue and expense. These estimates and assumptions include,
but are not limited to, estimates of revenue earned but not yet billed, costs
to complete fixed-price projects, the collectibility of accounts receivable,
the valuation of goodwill and other intangible assets, certain accrued
liabilities and other reserves, income taxes, and others. We base our estimates
on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to
be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results could differ from those
estimates. c Cash and Cash
Equivalents Cash and cash equivalents includes bank demand and time deposits, money
market funds, and all other highly liquid investments with maturities of three
months or less when purchased. d Investments in
Marketable Securities and ECsoft Investments in marketable equity securities are classified as available
for sale and are recorded at fair market value, which is determined based on
quoted market prices. There were no
investments held as of December31, 2003.
At December31, 2002, investments with a fair market value of $417
were included in prepaid expenses and other current assets. All unrealized gain or loss, net of tax, are
included in accumulated other comprehensive income in equity. Unrealized losses
and declines in market value determined to be other than temporary are included
in other income. In 2002, we recorded
losses of $800 to write down the value of certain marketable securities whose
decline in value was deemed other than temporary. Realized gains and losses are
based on average cost. Net realized
gains were $146, $175 and $2 for the years ended December31, 2003, 2002
and 2001, respectively. At December31, 2002, we owned approximately 10% of ECsoft Group
plc that we had acquired in the open market for a cost of $2,851, and which was
accounted for as a marketable security at market value. In January2003, as a result of 36 the acquisition of all of the remaining shares of ECsoft, the total
ECsoft purchase price including the shares held at December31, 2002 have
been accounted for based on actual cost.
Accordingly, the unrealized gain on ECsoft shares of $2,192, which was
recorded as part of accumulated other comprehensive income at December31,
2002, was reversed in 2003. e Property and
Equipment Property and equipment, which consists of computer equipment, and
software, furniture and leasehold improvements, is stated at cost. Depreciation
is computed using straight-line and accelerated methods over the estimated
useful lives, ranging primarily from three to seven years. Direct costs of time and material incurred
for the development of software for internal use are capitalized as property
and equipment. f Goodwill and
Other Intangible Assets Goodwill represents the cost of acquired businesses in excess of the
fair value of the net assets acquired.
Other intangible assets from business combinations consist of customer
relationships and non-compete agreements and are amortized, on a straight-line
basis, over periods of up to seven years. Effective July1, 2001, we adopted Statement of Financial
Accounting Standards SFAS No. 141, Business Combinations. SFAS 141 specifies the criteria for
recording intangible assets separate from goodwill. Under SFAS No. 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets
goodwill is no longer amortized, but instead is reviewed annually for
impairment. The non-amortization of
goodwill became effective for business combinations after June30, 2001. With respect to goodwill acquired prior to
July1, 2001, we have adopted SFAS142 effective January1,
2002. Other intangible assets with
finite lives continue to be amortized over their estimated useful lives. Goodwill is allocated to reporting units and tested for impairment at
the reporting unit level. The goodwill
impairment test has two steps. The
first step identifies potential impairment by comparing the fair value of the
reporting unit with its book value, including goodwill. If the fair value of the reporting unit
exceeds its carrying amount, goodwill is not impaired. If the carrying value
exceeds fair value, the second step calculates the impairment by comparing the
implied fair value of goodwill with the carrying amount. g Revenue
Recognition We primarily provide consulting services under time-and-material or
fixed-price contracts. The majority of our service revenue is recognized under
time-and-material contracts as hours and costs are incurred. Revenue includes
reimbursable expenses separately billed to clients. For fixed-price contracts, revenue
is recognized on the basis of the estimated percentage of completion based on
costs incurred relative to total estimated costs. The cumulative impact of any
revisions in estimated revenue and cost is recognized in the period in which
the facts that give rise to the revision become known. Losses, if any, on
fixed-price contracts are recognized when the loss is determined. Under certain
national IT services contracts we are required by our client to act as a
billing agent for other service providers to such client. We recognize the net
fee under these arrangements as revenue. Other revenue includes resale of third-party IT hardware and software
products as well as commissions on sales of IT products. Revenue related to the
sale of computer products is recognized when the products are shipped or, if
applicable, when installed. Where we
are the re-marketer of certain computer products, commission revenue is
recognized when the products are drop-shipped from the vendor to the
customer. Our commission revenue
represents the sales price to the customer less the cost paid to the vendor. Unbilled accounts receivable represent amounts recognized as revenue
based on services performed in advance of billings in accordance with contract
terms. Under our typical
time-and-materials billing arrangement, we bill our customers on a regularly
scheduled basis, such as biweekly or monthly.
At the end of each accounting period we accrue revenue for services
performed since the last billing cycle.
These unbilled amounts are actually billed the following month. Costs
and estimated earnings in excess of billings arise when percentage of
completion accounting is used. Such
amounts are billed at specific dates or at contract completion. 37 h Income Taxes Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax
consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement
carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases,
and to operating loss carryforwards.
Deferred tax amounts are based on enacted tax rates expected to be in
effect during the year in which the differences reverse. The effect on deferred tax assets and
liabilities due to a change in tax rates is recognized in income tax expense in
the period that includes the enactment date.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are classified as current and
non-current amounts based on the financial statement classification of the
related asset and liability. A valuation
allowance is provided when it is more likely than not that a deferred tax asset
will not be realized. Interim-period
tax expense is recorded based upon our best estimate of the effective tax rate
expected to be applicable for the full fiscal year. i Stock-based
Compensation As permitted by Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123
SFAS 123, we account for stock-based employee compensation in accordance
with the provisions of Accounting Principles Board Opinion 25, and related interpretations,
including FASB Interpretation No. 44, Accounting for Certain Transactions
Involving Stock Compensation an Interpretation of APB Opinion No. 25. We
measure stock-based compensation cost as the excess, if any, of the quoted
market price of CIBER common stock or the estimated fair value of subsidiary
stock at the grant date over the amount the employee must pay for the stock.
We generally grant stock options at fair value at the date of grant. For all our stock-based plans, we have recorded compensation expenses
of $74, $146 and $748 in 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively. No compensation
expense has been recorded for stock options.
The following table illustrates the effect on net income and earnings loss
per share had we determined compensation cost for our stock-based compensation
plans based on the fair value method of SFAS 123.

The effect of applying SFAS 123 in this pro forma
disclosure may not be indicative of the effect on pro forma net income for
future years due to the fact that variables such as the number of options
granted, exercises and stock price volatility included in these disclosures may
not be indicative of future activity. The weighted average fair values of CIBER, Inc.
options granted in 2003, 2002 and 2001 were $360, $420 and $364,
respectively. 38 The fair value of options at the date of grant was
estimated using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model with the following
weighted-average assumptions

j Comprehensive
income loss Comprehensive income loss includes changes in the balances of items
that are reported directly as separate components of shareholders equity.
Comprehensive income loss includes net income loss plus changes in the net
unrealized gain/loss on investments, net of taxes and changes in cumulative
foreign currency translation adjustment. k Foreign Currency
Translation The assets and liabilities of our foreign operations are translated
into U.S. dollars at current exchange rates and revenue and expense is
translated at average exchange rates for the period. The resulting cumulative
translation adjustment is included in accumulated other comprehensive income
loss on the balance sheet. Foreign
currency transaction gains and losses are included in the results of operations
as incurred. Foreign currency gains and losses on short-term loans with our
foreign subsidiaries are also included in the results of operations as
incurred. We recorded a net foreign
currency gain of $151, $795 and a loss of $117 in 2003, 2002 and 2001,
respectively. l Fair Value of
Financial Instruments The carrying amount of cash and cash equivalents accounts receivable
and accounts payable approximate fair value due to their short-term
nature. Borrowings under our bank line
of credit approximate their fair value due to the variable interest rates on
these borrowings. We estimate the fair value of our $175 million convertible Senior
Subordinate debentures to be approximately $1773 million based on the trading
price for our debentures on December31, 2003. m Related party
transaction In 2002, we loaned $1,493 to
our President pursuant to an unsecured, non-interest bearing, Revolving
Promissory Note. In December2002,
this note was repaid in full with cash of $243 and 200,000 shares of CIBER
common stock valued at $1,250. 3 Acquisitions We have acquired certain businesses, as set forth below, that we have
accounted for using the purchase method of accounting for business combinations
and accordingly, the accompanying consolidated financial statements include the
results of operations of each acquired business since the date of acquisition. Acquisitions 2003 AlphaNet Solutions, Inc. 
On June25, 2003, we completed our acquisition of AlphaNet Solutions, Inc.
AlphaNet. Prior to the acquisition, AlphaNets shares were publicly traded
on the NASDAQ. We acquired all of the approximately 63 million outstanding
shares of AlphaNet, for cash consideration of $405 per share. The aggregate purchase price for all of
AlphaNets shares, including stock options, totaled approximately $28,511,
excluding transaction-related costs.
CIBER paid to the holders of vested AlphaNet stock options having an
exercise price of less than $405 per share, the amount of $405 minus the
exercise price of each vested stock option.
A 39 significant consideration in arriving at the purchase price was
AlphaNets cash balance of $19,007 at
closing. AlphaNet, located in Cedar Knolls, New Jersey provided information
technology consulting services similar to CIBER and had 120 consultants at the
time of the acquisition. We acquired
AlphaNet to increase our capabilities and service offerings and our client base
in the New York/New Jersey metro area.
AlphaNet has been combined with our existing Edison, New Jersey Custom
Solutions operations. ECsoft Group plc  Effective January23, 2003, we
completed our acquisition of ECsoft Group plc ECsoft. Prior to the acquisition, ECsofts shares
were publicly traded on the London Stock Exchange. We acquired all of the approximately 100 million outstanding
shares of ECsoft, not already owned by CIBER, for cash consideration of 305
pence approximately $494 per share or approximately $50,204 in the
aggregate. In addition, we had
previously acquired approximately 11 million ECsoft shares in the open market
at a cost of approximately $3,231 bringing our total cost for all of ECsofts
shares to approximately $53,435, excluding transaction-related costs. At the time of the acquisition, ECsoft, now
named CIBER Europe Limited which is incorporated under the laws of England and
Wales had approximately 440 consultants and operations in Denmark, the Netherlands,
Norway, Sweden and the United Kingdom that provide information technology
consulting services similar to CIBER.
We acquired ECsoft to expand our European presence. The following table summarizes the estimated fair values of the
acquired tangible assets and assumed liabilities of AlphaNet and ECsoft at the

40 The AlphaNet goodwill has been
assigned to our Custom Solutions Segment and our ECsoft goodwill has been
assigned to our European Operations Segment.
We expect that all of the AlphaNet goodwill and $2,535 of the ECsoft
goodwill will be deductible for income tax purposes. At the date of the acquisition, ECsoft had tax loss carryforwards
in certain foreign jurisdictions. Any
subsequent tax benefits from these loss carryforwards will be recorded as a
reduction of goodwill. We recorded an
accrued liability of $574 and $2,535 for estimated severance of AlphaNet and
ECsoft personnel, respectively, of which, all of the AlphaNet liability and
$2,355 of the ECsoft Liability has been paid as of December31, 2003. The
following unaudited pro forma information presents the combined results of
operations of CIBER, AlphaNet and ECsoft as if the acquisitions had occurred as
of the beginning of each of the periods presented, after including the impact
of certain adjustments such as, the elimination of ECsofts goodwill impairment
charge, the elimination of both AlphaNet and ECsofts expenses related to their
acquisition by CIBER and the addition of interest expense on borrowings used to
fund the purchases and amortization of other intangible assets, as well as,
adjustments to income tax expense. The
pro forma financial information is not necessarily indicative of the results of
operations that would have occurred had CIBER, AlphaNet and ECsoft constituted
a single entity during such periods, nor are they necessarily indicative of
future operating results.

Acquisition 2002 Decision Consultants, Inc. DCI
On April 30, 2002, we acquired substantially all of the assets and certain
liabilities of Decision Consultants, Inc. DCI. DCI, headquartered in Southfield, Michigan, provided information
technology consulting services similar to our Custom Solutions division. The majority of DCIs revenue was from
clients that were already CIBER clients and most of DCIs operations were in
locations already served by CIBER. As a
result, the primary asset acquired was the workforce that was in place, which
is accounted for as part of goodwill. Like CIBER, DCIs consultants comprised
an experienced technical workforce that we believe will help maintain and
obtain business at both current and new clients. DCI also added depth to our executive and operations management
team. The acquisition allowed us to
combine many of the DCI offices with existing CIBER offices to obtain economies
of scale resulting in reduced overhead costs as a percentage of revenue. Also significant were the cost savings to be
realized by combining redundant corporate back office functions. DCI added significantly to CIBERs existing
consultant base at IBM, Ford and Verizon, among others. In addition, the acquisition gave us
opportunities at some new strategic clients, however, such clients did not
constitute a significant percentage of DCIs revenue. The purchase consideration
consisted of $404 million in cash including transaction costs, 1,104,973
shares of CIBER common stock valued at $87 million and a $15 million
unsecured promissory note. The value of
the CIBER shares issued was based on the average closing price of the CIBER
stock over the two-day period before and after, April 8, 2002, the date the
acquisition was announced. The $15
million promissory note payable to DCI was paid in full in July 2002. 41 The following table summarizes

All DCI goodwill has been
assigned to our Custom Solutions segment.
Substantially all of the DCI goodwill is expected to be deductible for
income tax purposes. We recorded an
accrued liability of $1,771 for severance of DCI personnel, all of which was
paid in 2002. We recorded an accrued
lease liability for DCI office lease exit costs of $4,038 for office locations
that we will not use. Information
regarding accrued lease costs is included in Note 9. We also recorded an accrued liability of $643 for other exit
costs, primarily office closure costs, of which $484 was paid in 2002 and $159
was paid in 2003. As part of the DCI
purchase allocation, we have assigned $1,298 to other intangible assets for the
estimated fair value of customer relationships. Such amount was determined based on a cost-savings approach
projected over estimated customer commitments at the time of the
acquisition. The Financial Accounting
Standards Board issued additional guidance with respect to the recognition of
customer relationship intangible assets acquired in business combination
occurring after October 25, 2002. We
have applied this guidance to all acquisitions after that date. Acquisitions 2001 Metamor Industry Solutions, Inc. Metamor
- - On October 15, 2001, CIBER, Inc. acquired Metamor
Industry Solutions, Inc. and its subsidiary, Metamor Government Solutions,
Inc. CIBER acquired all of the
outstanding stock of Metamor Industry Solutions, Inc. from PSINet Consulting
Solutions Holdings, Inc., a subsidiary of PSINet, Inc., for cash consideration
of $366 million. We have recorded goodwill of $298 million, all of which is
expected to be deductible for tax purposes.
We recorded reserves of $3,420 for estimated office lease exit costs as
additional costs of the acquisition.
Metamor, based in Chicago, IL, provided IT consulting services similar
to CIBER, including custom software development and IT staffing, primarily to
governmental entities. Our primary
reason for acquiring Metamor was to expand our services to federal, state and
local governments. 42 Aris Corporation Aris On
September 18, 2001, we acquired the business and properties of Aris as the
result of Aris merger with and into CIBER. The consideration for the Aris
stock consisted of $149 million in cash and 2,222,092 shares of CIBER common
stock valued at $127 million. The
value of the CIBER shares issued was based on the average closing price of
CIBER stock over the two-day period before and after the revised terms of the
acquisition were agreed to. We issued
CIBER replacement stock options and warrants valued at $14 million. We have recorded $77 million of goodwill,
all of which is not deductible for tax purposes. We recorded liabilities for severance and office/lease closure
costs as additional costs of the acquisition.
We recorded an accrued liability of $2,529 for severance of Aris
employees, of which $1,953 was paid in 2001 and $576 was paid in 2002. We recorded an accrued lease liability for
Aris office lease exit costs of $3,866. We also recorded an accrued liability
of $488 for other exit costs, primarily office closure costs, of which $153 was
paid in 2001 and $335 was paid in 2002.
Aris, headquartered in Bellevue, WA, provided IT consulting services
similar to CIBER, including enterprise systems implementation and front-end web
development. Our primary reason for acquiring Aris was to expand our presence
in Microsoft and Oracle technologies as well as to add to our geographic
presence in Seattle and New Jersey and add a location in the United Kingdom. Century Computer Consultants, Inc.
Century On August 31, 2001, we acquired Century
for an aggregate purchase price of approximately $104 million, consisting of
$29 million in cash and 1,134,644 shares of CIBER common stock valued at $75
million. The value of the CIBER shares
issued was based on the closing stock price on August 30, 2001. We have recorded $65 million of goodwill,
all of which is not deductible for tax purposes. Century, based in Overland Park, Kansas, provided IT services
similar to CIBER. Our primary reasons
for acquiring Century were to strengthen strategic client relationships in
Kansas City and in the wireless industry, add leadership to our existing Kansas
City operations and realize the cost efficiencies associated with the combined
operation. The following table summarizes

10 Convertible Senior Subordinated
Debentures On December2, 2003, in a private placement we issued $175 million
of 2875% Convertible Senior Subordinated Debentures Debentures due to
mature in December2023. The Debentures are general unsecured
obligations and are subordinated in right of payment to all of our indebtedness
and other liabilities. The Debentures accrue interest at a rate of 2875%
per year. Interest is payable semi-annually in arrears on June15th
and December15th of each year, beginning June15, 2004. The Debentures are convertible at the option of the holder into shares
of our common stock at an initial conversion rate of 733138 shares per $1,000
principal amount of Debentures, which is equivalent to an initial conversion
price of approximately $1364 per share, subject to adjustments, prior to the
close of business on the final maturity date only under the following
circumstances: 1 during any fiscal quarter commencing after December31,
2003, if the closing sale price of our common stock exceeds 120% of the
conversion price for at least 20 trading days in the 30 consecutive trading-day
period ending on the last trading day of the preceding fiscal quarter; 2
during the five business days after any ten consecutive trading day period in
which the trading price per $1,000 principal amount of Debentures for each day
of such period was less than 98% of the product of the closing sale price of
our common stock and the number of shares issuable upon conversion of $1,000
principal amount of the Debentures; 3 if the Debentures have been called for
redemption; or4 upon the occurrence of certain specified corporate
transactions. Upon conversion, we will
have the right to deliver, in lieu of our common stock, cash or a combination
of cash and common stock. The
conversion price is subject to adjustment in certain circumstances. From December20, 2008, to but not including December15,
2010, we may redeem any of the Debentures if the closing price of our common
stock exceeds 130% of the conversion price for at least 20 trading days in any
30 consecutive trading day period.
Beginning December15, 2010, we may, by providing at least 30-day
notice to the holders, redeem any of the Debentures at a redemption price of 100%
of their principal amount, plus accrued interest. Debenture holders may require us to repurchase their Debentures
on December15, 2008, 2010, 2013 and 2018 or at any time prior to their
maturity in the case of certain events, at a repurchase price of 100% of their
principal amount plus accrued interest. Debenture issuance costs were approximately $5,711 and are being
amortized over five years to interest expense. The unamortized debt
issuance costs were $5,616 as of December31, 2003. Of this amount, $1,142 is included in
prepaid and other current assets and $4,474 is included in other assets in the
accompanying consolidated balance sheet. 48 11 Bank Line of
Credit and Financing Agreement Bank Line of Credit
We have a $60 million revolving line of credit with
Wells Fargo Bank, N.A. that expires August15, 2006. Borrowings bear interest based on the banks
prime rate of interest prime and ranges from prime minus 070% to prime
less 020%, depending on our ratio of indebtedness to earnings before interest,
taxes, depreciation and amortization, and changes accordingly at the beginning
of each quarter. We are also required
to pay a fee of 0125% per annum on the unused portion of the line of credit. The line of credit is secured by substantially
all of our assets. The line of credit
agreement contains certain financial covenants including: maximum liabilities
to tangible net worth, minimum fixed charge coverage ratio, maximum leverage
ratio and a maximum asset coverage ratio.
The terms of the credit agreement also contain, among other provisions,
specific limitations on additional indebtedness, liens and merger activity and
prohibit the payment of any dividends.
As a result of our December2003 sale of debentures, we repaid the
outstanding balance under the line of credit and further borrowing under the
line of credit has been suspended until an amendment to the line of credit is
executed modifying certain terms and the financial covenants. We expect to have an amendment completed
during the first quarter of 2004. Wholesale Financing
Agreement - In connection with our operation as an
authorized remarketer of certain computer hardware and other products, we have

Based on our evaluation of current and anticipated future taxable
income, we believe sufficient taxable income will be generated to realize the
deferred tax assets. In 2003, we
recognized $3,605 of tax benefit from the closure of a subsidiary that was
recorded as a reduction to goodwill. In
2002, we realized a $401 tax benefit from the use of foreign net operating
losses that was recorded as a reduction of goodwill. At December31, 2003, we have approximately $80 million of net
operating loss NOL carryforwards for U.S. Federal tax purposes resulting
from acquisitions. There is no
valuation allowance for these U.S. NOLs.
Also at December31, 2003, we have approximately $65 million of
foreign NOLs for which we have recorded a 100% valuation allowance of $20
million. Most of these foreign NOLs
were acquired with our acquisition of ECsoft and any realized benefit from
these pre-acquisition NOLs will be recorded as a reduction of goodwill. 13 Stock-Based
Plans Our stock-based compensation plans are described below. 50 Employees Stock
Option Plan We have a stock option plan for
employees and up to 13,500,000 shares of CIBER, Inc. common stock are
authorized for issuance under this plan. At December31, 2003, there are
2,387,163 shares available for future option grants. This plan expired in
January2004, and thus effective February1, 2004, no shares are
available for future stock option grants. The plan administrators may grant to officers, employees and
consultants, restricted stock, stock options, performance bonuses or any
combination thereof. The Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors
determines the number and nature of awards. Options become exercisable as
determined at the date of grant by the Board of Directors and expire within 10
years from the date of grant. In 2001, stock grants were made to employees for
130,000 shares of common stock valued at an average price of $450 per share. 1989 Stock Option
Plan We established a stock option plan in 1989 that
was discontinued during 1994. The options expire twenty years after the date of
grant through 2013. At
December31, 2003, options for 123,000 shares were outstanding and vested
under this plan with an average exercise price of $042. Directors Stock Option
Plan Up to 300,000 shares of CIBER, Inc. common
stock are authorized for issuance to non-employee, non-affiliate directors
under this plan. Such stock options are non-discretionary and granted annually
at the fair market value of our common stock on the date of grant. The number
of options granted annually is fixed by the plan. Options expire 10 years from
the date of grant. At December31,
2003, 79,666 shares were available for future option grants. This plan expired in January2004, and
thus effective February1, 2004, no shares are available for future stock
option grants. A summary of the status of the CIBER, Inc. stock
option plans as of December31, 2003, 2002 and 2001, and changes during

Sale of
Stock to Investors On April29, 2002, we sold 2,459,016
shares of our common stock to investors at $610 per share, in a private
placement. Total proceeds, net of expenses
were $14,095. Stock
Repurchase Put Option  In
connection with our acquisition of DCI on April30, 2002, DCIs majority
shareholder the Shareholder entered into an agreement to not sell a
significant portion of the CIBER common stock received in the transaction for a
period of up to 90 days the Lockup Agreement. As an inducement for the Shareholder to enter into the Lockup
Agreement, CIBER granted the Shareholder an option that under certain circumstances,
the Shareholder could require CIBER to repurchase up to 805,000 shares of CIBER
common stock at $725 per share. In May
2003, the Shareholder exercised this option.
CIBER paid approximately $5,832 for the acquisition of these shares,
which were accounted for as treasury stock. 52 Share Repurchase
Program In 2002, we reached the maximum number
of shares authorized by the Board of Directors under our previous share
repurchase program that began in 1999.
A total of 6,888,591 shares were repurchased under this program. On July30, 2002 our Board of Directors
approved a new share repurchase program and authorized up to 1,000,000 common
shares to be repurchased. In 2003, we
reached the maximum number of shares authorized by the Board of Directors under
this new share repurchase program and authorized up to another 1,000,000 common
shares to be repurchased. During 2003
we repurchased a total of 1,061,500 shares under the Share Repurchase Program
at a cost of $7,255. At December31, 2003, there were
174,000 authorized shares remaining available for repurchase. Shelf Registration
Statement on Form S-4
At December31, 2003, we have an effective registration statement
of Form S-4, under which 8,261,365 shares of our common stock remain and may be
used from time to time in connection with future business combinations. Warrants for Common
Stock In connection with our acquisition of Aris in
2001, we issued warrants for shares of our common stock in replacement of
Ariss previously outstanding warrants.
The 8,586 warrants outstanding at December31, 2003 are exercisable
at $5824 per share, and expire in October2004. Stock Purchase
Rights On September21, 1998, CIBER, Inc. paid
a dividend of one preferred stock purchase right a Right for each
outstanding share of CIBER, Inc. common stock Common Stock. A Right is also
attached to all shares of Common Stock issued after the dividend date. Each
Right entitles the registered holder to purchase one one-hundredth of a share
of Series A Junior Preferred Stock, par value $001, at a purchase price of two
hundred fifty dollars, subject to adjustment. The Rights become exercisable ten
business days following a public announcement that a person or group has
acquired, or has commenced or intends to commence a tender offer for 15% or
more of our outstanding Common Stock. In the event the Rights become
exercisable, each Right will entitle its holder, other than the Acquiring
Person as defined in the Rights Agreement, to that number of shares of our
Common Stock having a market value of two times the exercise price of the
Right. In the event the Rights become exercisable because of a merger or
certain other business combination, each Right will entitle its holder to
purchase common stock of the acquiring company having a market value of two
times the exercise price of the Right. If the Rights are fully exercised, the
shares issued would cause substantial dilution to the Acquiring Person or the
Shareholders of the acquiring company.
We can redeem the Rights in their entirety, prior to their becoming
exercisable, at $0001 per Right. The Rights expire on August28, 2008,
unless extended or earlier redeemed. 16
Contingencies We are routinely involved in
legal proceedings, audits, claims and litigation arising in the ordinary course
of business. Although, the outcome of such matters is not predictable with
assurance, we do not expect that the ultimate outcome of any of these matters,
individually or in the aggregate, will have a material adverse effect on our
financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. However, depending on the amount and timing,
an unfavorable outcome of any such matters could possibly materially affect our
future results of operations or cash flow in any particular period. 17 Business and
Credit Concentrations Financial instruments that are potentially subject to concentrations of
credit risk are cash and cash equivalents and accounts receivable. Our cash and cash equivalents are in high
credit quality short-term investments and held by high credit qualified
financial institutions. Accounts
receivable are reviewed on a periodic basis and an allowance for bad debts is
recorded where such amounts are determined to be uncollectible. Our revenue and accounts receivable are
principally concentrated with large companies across several industries and
governmental entities located throughout the United States. Our largest client
accounted for approximately 10%, 12% and 6% of total revenue in 2003, 2002 and
2001, respectively. In 2003 and 2002, our largest client was the various
agencies of the U.S. federal government.
In addition, our five largest clients accounted for, in the aggregate,
approximately 29%, 30% and 16% of our total revenue in 2003, 2002 and 2001,
respectively. 53 18 Segment
Information Our operating segments are organized internally primarily by the
nature of their services and geographic area. As a result of our
January2003 acquisition of ECsoft we have significantly expanded and
reorganized our European operations.
Effective January1, 2003, we created a new reportable segment
European Operations, resulting in three reportable segments, Custom Solutions,
Package Solutions and European Operations. All prior year segment data
presented herein has been restated to conform with the 2003 segment
presentation. Similar operating units
have been aggregated in the determination of reportable segments. The Custom Solutions segment includes our
United States based CIBER branch offices that provide IT project solutions and
IT professional staffing services in custom developed software
environments. Our Package Solutions
segment is comprised of our CIBER Enterprise Solutions division including our
Canadian subsidiary and our DigiTerra, Inc. subsidiary. The Package Solutions segment primarily
provides enterprise software implementation services, including enterprise
resource planning ERP, and supply chain management software from software
vendors such as PeopleSoft, Lawson, Oracle and SAP. In 2003, our European Operations segment includes the acquired
ECsoft operations and is comprised of our European operations in Denmark,
Germany, Hungary, the Netherlands, Norway, Sweden and the United Kingdom. In 2002, European Operations included our
CIBER Solution Partners operations in Germany, Hungary, the Netherlands and
the United Kingdom. We evaluate our segments results of operations based on operating
income before amortization of intangible assets and goodwill impairment. We do not account for or report to our chief
executive officer any information on assets or capital expenditures by segment
as such information is only prepared on a consolidated basis. The accounting policies of our reportable
segments are the same as those disclosed in the Summary of Significant
Accounting Policies. The following presents financial information about our reporting

20 Subsequent
Events Acquisition of the Services Division of
FullTilt Solutions, Inc. On January23, 2004, CIBER, Inc. acquired the Services
Division of FullTilt Solutions, Inc., for cash consideration of approximately
$99 million unaudited, excluding transaction-related costs. The Services Division has operations similar
to CIBER, located in Philadelphia and Pittsburgh that have been combined with
CIBERs existing Custom Solutions operations in those areas. Acquisition of SCB
Technology, Inc. SCB On March1, 2004, we acquired SCB Computer Technology,
Inc. SCB. SCB, based in Memphis, Tennessee, provided IT services
similar to CIBER, including consulting, outsourcing and professional staffing,
with a particular focus on federal and state government clients. The total
consideration paid by CIBER for all of SCBs outstanding shares is
approximately $54 million unaudited, consisting of approximately $41
million in cash unaudited and approximately 14 million shares of CIBER
common stock valued at approximately $13 million unaudited. In
addition, SCB had certain debt obligations, totaling approximately $33 million
unaudited, which we repaid shortly after closing of the acquisition. We used a portion of the cash raised from
our December2003 Convertible Debenture Offering to fund the cash portion
of the purchase consideration and the repayment of SCBs debt. The acquisition of SCB expands our Federal Government and State 
Local Government Practices and also adds beneficial customer relationships to
our commercial sector business. We
believe that the acquisition will be beneficial due to the revenue that SCBs
business will add to our existing operations, and due to the expanded presence
in certain markets that SCBs existing client base offers to CIBER. In particular,
SCBs public sector business will compliment our existing state and Federal
government service offerings. We expect
that a combined CIBER and SCB will be able to compete more effectively for
larger public sector contracts. In
addition we believe that the acquisition will provide an opportunity to realize
operational efficiencies in the form of lower combined selling, general and
administrative costs, primarily by reducing SCBs corporate administrative
costs. On February18,
2004, our Board of Directors authorized an additional 1,000,000 shares for our
share repurchase program. 55 21 Selected

Controls and Procedures We
maintain disclosure controls and procedures that are designed to ensure that
information required to be disclosed by us in the reports that we file or
submit to the Securities and Exchange Commission under the Securities Exchange
Act of 1934, as amended, is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within
the time periods specified by the Commissions rules and forms, and that
information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our
principal executive and principal financial officers whom we refer to in this
periodic report as our Certifying Officers, as appropriate to allow timely
decisions regarding required disclosure. Our management evaluated, with
the participation of our Certifying Officers, the effectiveness of our
disclosure controls and procedures as of September30, 2003, pursuant to
Rule 13a-15b under the Exchange Act. Based upon that evaluation, our
Certifying Officers concluded that, as of December31, 2003, our
disclosure controls and procedures were effective. There
were no changes in our internal control over financials reporting that occurred
during our most recently completed fiscal quarter that have materially
affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control
over financial reporting. In
response to recent legislation and proposed regulations, we have begun a
process of reviewing our internal control structure and our disclosure controls
and procedures. Although we believe our
pre-existing disclosure controls and procedures are adequate to enable us to
comply with our disclosure obligations, as a result of such review, we are
implementing minor changes, from time to time, primarily to formalize and
document procedures already in place. Part III The information required by Part III is omitted from this Report on
Form 10-K because the Registrant will file a definitive proxy statement for its
2004 Annual Meeting of Shareholders scheduled for April27, 2004 the
2004 Proxy Statement within 120 days of December31, 2003 and certain
information included therein is incorporated herein by reference.
