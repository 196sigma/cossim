NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
DIMON Incorporated and Subsidiaries
in thousands Note A - Significant Accounting Policies
- 
The accounts of the Company and its consolidated subsidiaries are
included in the consolidated financial statements after elimination of
significant intercompany accounts and transactions. Certain foreign
consolidated subsidiaries of the Company have fiscal year ends of
March 31 and May 31 to facilitate reporting of consolidated accounts.
The Company accounts for its investments in certain investee companies
ownership 20% - 50% under the equity method of accounting.
Investments in certain other foreign investees and subsidiaries which
are combined with other investments are stated at cost or less than
cost since the Company does not exercise significant influence over
financial or operating policies and because of restrictions imposed on
the transfer of earnings and other economic uncertainties.
Sales recognition is based on the passage of ownership, usually
with shipment of product.
Cash equivalents are defined as temporary investments of cash
with maturities of less than 90 days.
Inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market. Inventory
valuation provisions included in cost of goods and services sold
totaled $92 million for 1995. Costs of tobacco inventories are
generally determined by the average cost method while costs of other
inventories are generally determined by the first-in, first-out
method. Substantially all of the tobacco inventory represents
finished goods. Interest and other carrying charges on the
inventories are expensed in the period in which they are incurred.
Equity in net assets of investee companies includes excess of
equity over cost in the amount of $346 $4,075 at June 30, 1996 and
is being amortized on a straight-line basis over ten years.
Excess of cost over related net assets of businesses acquired is
being amortized on a straight-line basis over periods ranging from 10
to 40 years. The accumulated amortization at June 30, 1997, is
$11,115 $5,300 at June 30, 1996.
The carrying value of intangible assets is periodically reviewed
by the Company based on the expected future undiscounted operating
cash flows of the related business unit. Based upon its most recent
analysis, the Company believes that no material impairment of
intangible assets exists at June 30, 1997.
Supply contracts include the cost allocated to two ten-year
tobacco supply agreements with R. J. Reynolds Tobacco Company RJR
pursuant to which the Company will supply RJR and its affiliates with
specified quantities of its required tobaccos. Each contract is being
amortized over the quantities shipped or the contract period,
whichever is sooner. The accumulated amortization at June 30, 1997,
is $22,700 $18,900 at June 30, 1996.
Production contracts include the cost allocated to contracts
associated with farmers for the future supply of their annual tobacco
production. The production contracts are being amortized primarily on
a straight-line basis over ten years. The accumulated amortization at
June 30, 1997, is $16,155 $13,311 at June 30, 1996.
Property, plant and equipment is accounted for on the basis of
cost. Provisions for depreciation are computed on a straight-line
basis at annual rates calculated to amortize the cost of depreciable
properties over their estimated useful lives. Buildings and machinery
and equipment are depreciated over ranges of 20 to 40 years and over
five to ten years, respectively. The consolidated financial
statements do not include fully depreciated assets.
The Company provides deferred income taxes on temporary
differences arising from tax loss carryforwards, employee benefit
accruals, depreciation, deferred compensation and undistributed
earnings of consolidated subsidiaries and unconsolidated affiliates
not permanently reinvested.
Primary earnings per share are computed by dividing earnings by
the weighted average number of shares outstanding plus any common
stock equivalents during each period. The fully diluted earnings per
share calculation assumes that all of the outstanding Convertible
Subordinated Debentures outstanding during the periods presented were
converted into Common Stock at the beginning of the reporting period,
or as of the date of issue, thereby increasing the weighted average
number of shares considered outstanding during each period and
reducing the after-tax interest expense. The weighted average number
of shares outstanding are further increased by common stock
equivalents on employee stock options.
The Company carried its equity security investments at fair value
as Prepaid expenses and other assets with any change from the average
cost basis being reflected in stockholders' equity net of the tax
benefit. These securities were sold in 1996.               -33 ITEM 8.  FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA continued

In February 1997, the Financial Accounting Standards Board
FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards SFAS
No. 128, Earnings per Share which simplifies the earnings per share
EPS computation and replaces the presentation of primary EPS with a
presentation of basic EPS.  This statement also requires dual
presentation of basic and diluted EPS on the face of the income
statement for entities with a complex capital structure and requires a
reconciliation of the numerator and denominator used for the basic and
diluted EPS computation. This statement will be effective for the
Company March 31, 1998, interim statements and will require the
restatement of all prior-period earnings per share data presented.
The Company has studied the implications of the statement, and based
on its initial evaluation, does not expect it to have a material
impact on the Company financial condition or results of operations
upon adoption.
In June 1997, the FASB issued SFAS No. 130, Reporting
Comprehensive Income which establishes standards for reporting and
display of comprehensive income and its components in a full set of
general-purpose financial statements. This statement will be
effective for the Company March 31, 1998, interim statements and
will require the restatement of all prior-periods presented.  The
Company has studied the implications of the statement, and based on
its initial evaluation, does not expect it to have a material impact
on the Company financial condition or results of operations upon
adoption.
In June 1997, the FASB issued SFAS No. 131, Disclosures About
Segments of an Enterprise and Related Information which requires that
public business enterprises report certain information about
operating segments in complete sets of financial statements of the
enterprise and in condensed financial statements of interim periods
issued to shareholders. It also requires that public business
enterprises report certain information about their products and
services, the geographic areas in which they operate and their major
customers. This statement is effective for the Company June 30, 1998,
year end financial statements. The Company has studied the
implications of the statement, and based on its initial evaluation,
does not expect it to have a material impact on the Company financial
condition or results of operations upon adoption.
Certain prior year amounts have been reclassified to conform to
the current year presentation.
Note B - Merger and Acquisitions

Merger
On October 23, 1994, Dibrell and Monk-Austin announced execution of a
definitive Agreement and Plan of Reorganization pursuant to which the
businesses of Dibrell and Monk-Austin would be combined. At special
meetings on March 31, 1995, the shareholders of both Dibrell and
Monk-Austin approved the Agreement and related combination. As a result,
Dibrell and Monk-Austin were merged into DIMON Incorporated DIMON
and each share of Dibrell Common Stock outstanding at the merger date
was converted to 15 shares, and each share of Monk-Austin Common
Stock outstanding at the merger date was converted into 10 share of
DIMON Common Stock, resulting in 38069 million total outstanding
shares at April 1, 1995, the effective date of the merger. In
connection with the merger, the Company incurred legal, accounting and
financial consultants costs of $81 million in 1995.
The merger qualifies as a tax free reorganization and was
accounted for as a pooling of interests. Accordingly, the Company
financial statements have been restated to include the results of both
Dibrell and Monk-Austin for all periods presented. Recorded assets
and liabilities have been carried forward to the combined company at
their historical book values.
Combined and separate results of Dibrell and Monk-Austin during

Acquisitions
The combined financial results presented above include
adjustments made to conform accounting policies of the two companies.
The significant adjustments impacting net income for conformity relate
to the accounting for income taxes, the treatment of grower advances
in Brazil, foreign currency transaction gains and losses and certain
other inventory costing policies. All other adjustments are
reclassifications to conform financial statement presentation.
Intercompany transactions between the two companies for the periods
presented were not material.
On April 1, 1995, the Company acquired the businesses of
Austro-Hellenique De Tabac S.A. Hellas and Austro-Turk Tutun A.S.
Austro-Turk for cash of $13,372 and assumption of liabilities of
$3,821. Hellas and Austro-Turk have tobacco buying, processing and
selling operations in Greece and Turkey, respectively. This acquisition
has been accounted for as a purchase. The excess of cost over businesses
acquired of $17,193 is being amortized over a ten-year period.
The following pro forma information has been prepared assuming
that this acquisition had taken place at the beginning of the period.
The pro forma information includes adjustments to give effect to
amortization of goodwill and interest expense on acquisition debt,
together with related income tax effects.                           Year ended June 30, 1995

Loss per share, primary..................   96    On April 1, 1997, DIMON Incorporated acquired all the outstanding
capital stock and other rights of Intabex Holdings Worldwide S.A.
Intabex, a privately-owned Luxembourg holding company. Intabex
maintains coordination and service offices in Wokingham, England. In
addition, Intabex owns and operates leaf tobacco buying, processing,
and exporting operations in principal tobacco markets around the world
including the United States, Brazil, Argentina, Malawi, Italy and
Thailand. An Intabex subsidiary, Compania de Filipinas CdF, is one
of the two major suppliers of premium cigar leaf and other dark air-cured
tobaccos to the resurgent cigar industry in the United States
and Europe. Separately, a Zimbabwe company that is a wholly-owned
subsidiary of DIMON acquired certain tobacco assets from an Intabex
affiliated company in Zimbabwe. Intabex is a major supplier of
Zimbabwean and other African grown tobacco to the cigarette industry.
The transaction was accounted for as a purchase, and accordingly,
the consolidated financial statements of DIMON include the results of
operations of Intabex from the date of acquisition. The $24558
million aggregate purchase price for Intabex, the Zimbabwe assets and
other rights acquired, consisted of 170 million shares of DIMON
common stock, $1233 million in 10-year, 625 percent subordinated
debentures convertible into 4287 million DIMON shares at $2877 per
share, and $8421 million in cash. The final purchase price reflects
a reduction of $186 million for certain adjustments that were
comtemplated by the purchase agreement. The source of cash was working
capital of DIMON.
Intabex former shareholders, Folium, Inc., Tabacalera, S.A. and
Leaf Management Investments Ltd., have agreed to indemnify DIMON
against certain liabilities in connection with the acquisition of
Intabex, subject to a maximum of $90 million. DIMON may set off any
such liabilities against $90 million of the debentures held by Folium
and Tabacalera. The amount of debentures subject to set-off declines
in stages, with $15 million subject to set-off after October 1, 1998,
through July 31, 1999, and $10 million subject to set-off from August
1, 1999, through April 1, 2000, subject to extension with respect to
outstanding claims. A DIMON subsidiary in Zimbabwe is entitled to
similar indemnification and set-off rights in connection with the
Zimbabwe tobacco assets purchased, subject to a maximum of $12
million. The purchase price has been preliminarily allocated based on
estimated fair values of assets acquired and liabilities assumed at
the date of acquisition. This preliminary allocation resulted in an
excess of purchase price over net assets acquired of $159 million,
which is being amortized on a straight-line basis over 40 years.               -35 ITEM 8. FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA continued

debt. They do not purport to be indicative of the results of
operations which actually would have resulted had the combination been
in effect on July 1, 1996 or 1995, or of future results of operations
of the consolidated entities.
In conjunction with this acquisition, the Company capitalized
$92 million, net of $37 million of tax, to cover the anticipated
costs of combining the acquired tobacco business with existing tobacco
operations of DIMON. The capitalized amounts relate primarily to
severance and closure of certain duplicative administrative, warehouse
and plant facilities acquired from Intabex. Of the capitalized
amounts, $70 million relates to severance and other costs associated
with employee separations and $22 million relates to costs of planned
facility closures. As these amounts are paid out in cash, the Company
will reduce an accrual established for their expenditure.
Note C - Restructuring and Merger Related Costs
In 1995, the Company commenced various activities to restructure its
worldwide operations. The following tables set forth the Company
restructuring provisions provided and changes in the related reserves
for 1995, 1996 and 1997. The reserve balances are included in accrued
expenses and deferred compensation and other benefits.                           Facilities

in thousands Note C - Restructuring and Merger Related Costs continued
The 1995 restructuring provision included approximately $26
million for the closing of certain unprofitable flower facilities and
related severance costs. The remaining 1995 restructuring provision
of $152 million addressed rationalization of the tobacco operations
through elimination of duplicative facilities and reduction of
personnel.
The 1996 restructuring provision of $154 million was primarily
for additional severance costs. During the year ended June 30, 1996,
the Company severed a total of 367 employees most of which were
involuntarily separated. The severed employees were primarily in the
tobacco division and worked in various departments throughout the
Company.
During the year ended June 30, 1997, additional restructuring
charges were accrued in the amount of $39 million, of which $29
million relates to additional severance costs and $1 million relates
to a reduction of capitalized idle plant expense. Remaining cash
outlays associated with employee separations are expected to total
$79 million, of which $33 million will be expended in 1998.
Remaining amounts relate primarily to the pension plan charge and
other deferred compensation, which will be made as required for
funding appropriate pension and other payments in future years.

purchase, two investee companies are now being accounted for as
consolidated entities.  The above changes from 1995 relate primarily
to the Company selling its interest in a Brazilian investee, Rio

characteristics of a portion of the Company debt. The differential
to be paid or received is accrued as interest rates change and
recognized as an adjustment to interest expense in the statement of
consolidated income. The related accrued receivable or payable is
included in other assets or liabilities. The fair values of the swap
agreements are not recognized in the financial statements.
The counterparties to these contractual arrangements are a
diverse group of major financial institutions with which the Company
also has other financial relationships. The Company is exposed to
credit loss in the event of non-performance
by these counterparties. If a counterparty fails to meet the terms of
a swap agreement, the Company exposure is limited to the net amount
that would have been received, if any, over the agreement remaining
life. The Company does not anticipate non-performance by the other
parties, given their high-credit ratings and no material loss would be
expected from non-performance by any one of such counterparties.
Interest rate swap agreements with an aggregate notional
principal balance of $200,142 $125,000 fixed to floating and $75,142
floating to fixed and expiring at various dates through May 23, 2001,
had a negative value of $3 at June 30, 1997.
In the normal course of business, the Company is a party to
financial instruments with off balance sheet risk such as letters of
credit and guarantees. Management does not expect any material losses
to result from these instruments.
The fair value estimates presented herein are based on
information available to management at June 30, 1997, and were
determined using quoted market prices and the discounted value of
future cash flows. Note F - Short-Term Borrowing Arrangements
The Company has lines of credit arrangements with several banks under
which the Company may borrow up to a total of $1,783,889 $897,523 at
June 30, 1996, excluding all long-term credit agreements. These
lines bear interest at rates ranging from 17% to 137% at June 30,
1997. Unused lines of credit at June 30, 1997, amounted to $789,913
$521,145 at June 30, 1996, net of $143,713 of available letters of
credit and guarantees that reduce lines of credit. There were no
compensating balance agreements at June 30, 1997, or 1996.                  -38 ITEM 8.   FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA continued

On May 29, 1996, the Company issued $125 million in 8 7/8%
Senior Notes the Notes due 2006. The Notes are general unsecured
obligations of the Company and will rank equally in right of payment
with all other unsubordinated indebtedness including the New Credit
Facility, discussed below of the Company. The Company used the net
proceeds to repay certain existing short-term indebtedness and for
other corporate purposes. On or after June 1, 2001, the Company may
redeem the Notes in whole or in part, at established redemption
prices, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to the date of
redemption. There are no sinking fund requirements for the Notes.
The Notes are subject to certain covenants that among other things,
require specific liquidity and long-term solvency ratios and, under
certain circumstances, restrict payment of dividends by the Company.
The Company generally may make such restricted payments, provided that
1 the Company is not in default under the Indenture, 2 the Company
is able to incur at least $100 of additional indebtedness under a
consolidated interest coverage ratio test set forth in the Indenture,
and 3 the aggregate amount of the payments to be made is less than
the total of x $200 million, y 50% of the Company consolidated
net income for the period from April 1, 1996, through the end of the
Company most recent fiscal quarter and z the net cash proceeds
from the sale by the Company of any equity securities or debt
securities that are converted into equity securities. At June 30,
1997, the Company was permitted to make restricted payments, including
cash dividends on its Common Stock, of up to $780 million.
On April 1, 1997, in connection with the Intabex acquisition
the Debentures, DIMON Incorporated issued $1233 million of 6 1/4%
Convertible Subordinated Debentures due on March 31, 2007. The
Debentures are convertible into approximately 429 million shares of
the Company Common Stock at conversion price of $2877 per share at
any time prior to maturity. The Debentures are subordinated in right
of payment to all existing and future senior indebtedness, as defined,
of the Company, and do not have a cross-default provision. The
Debentures are redeemable at the option of the Company under certain
circumstances on or after April 1, 2000. As discussed in Note B,
Intabex former shareholders have indemnified DIMON against certain
liabilities in connection with the acquisition of Intabex. DIMON may
set off any such indemnified liabilities against $90 million of the
Debentures. The amount of Debentures subject to set-off declines in
stages, as discussed in Note B.

To ensure long-term liquidity, DIMON entered into a $500 million
New Credit Facility, effective June 27, 1997, with 20 banks which
replaces DIMON $240 million Former Credit Facility. The Company had
no borrowings under these agreements at either June 30, 1997 or 1996.
However, the Company has used these facilities to classify $500,000
$231,676 at June 30, 1996 of working capital loans to Revolving
Credit Notes. It is the Company intent to finance at least $500,000
on a long-term basis. The New Credit Facility is subject to certain
commitment fees and covenants that among other things require DIMON to
maintain minimum working capital and tangible net worth amounts,
require specific liquidity and long-term solvency ratios and restrict
acquisitions. The New Credit Facility initial term is to June 27,
2000, and pending approval by the lenders, may be extended. The rates
of interest are based upon the type of loan requested by the Company.
During the life of the agreement, the interest rate could be the prime
rate or the LIBOR rate adjusted. The primary advance rate is the
agent bank base lending rate 850% at June 30, 1997. The Company
pays a commitment fee of 1/4% per annum on any unused portion of the
facility. Decisions relative to repayments and reborrowings are made
based on circumstances then existing, including management judgment
as to the most effective utilization of funds.
Other long-term debt consists of obligations of DIMON
Incorporated, Florimex and the tobacco operations in Africa, Germany
and Spain, and is payable at interest rates varying from 485% to
117%. Note H - Long-Term Leases
The Company, primarily through Florimex, has both capital and
operating leases. The capital leases are for land, buildings,
automobiles and trucks; the operating leases are for office equipment.
The capitalized lease obligations are payable through 1999. Interest
rates are imputed at 70% to 107%. Amortization is included in
depreciation expense. Minimum future obligations and capitalized

The Board of Directors is authorized to issue shares of Preferred
Stock in series with variations as to the number of shares in any
series. The Board of Directors also is authorized to establish the
rights and privileges of such shares issued including dividend and

Note J - Stock Incentive Plan
At the 1995 Special Meeting of Stockholders, the DIMON Incorporated
Omnibus Stock Incentive Plan the Incentive Plan and the DIMON
Incorporated Non-Employee Directors Stock Option Plan the Directors
Plan were approved. Also, as a result of the merger, options granted
under previous plans were assumed by DIMON.
The Incentive Plan authorizes the issuance of up to 2 million
shares of common stock subject to increase annually by 3% of the
number of shares of common stock issued during such year, other than
pursuant to the Incentive Plan. The Incentive Plan authorizes the
issuance of various stock incentives to key employees of the Company
or any subsidiary, including nonqualified or incentive stock options,
stock appreciation rights and shares of restricted stock.
Stock options granted under the Incentive Plan allow for the
purchase of common stock at prices determined at the time the option
is granted by a committee composed of independent directors the
Committee. Stock appreciation rights SARs may be granted under the
Incentive Plan in relation to option grants or independently of option
grants. SARs generally entitle the participant to receive in cash the
excess of the fair market value of a share of common stock on the date
of exercise over the value of the SAR at the date of grant.
Restricted stock is common stock that is both nontransferable and
forfeitable unless and until certain conditions are satisfied. As of
June 30, 1997 no restricted stock has been awarded under the Incentive
Plan. No awards may be granted under the Incentive Plan after
February 8, 2005.
The options and SARs become exercisable on various dates as
originally determined for the grants assumed by DIMON. Under the
Incentive Plan, the Committee will determine the dates that the
options and SARs become exercisable.
A separate Directors' Plan authorizes automatic annual grants to
purchase one thousand shares to each non-employee director. Any 1997
grants will be awarded at the meeting of the DIMON Board following the
1997 annual meeting of the shareholders of DIMON. The option price
will be equal to the fair market value of DIMON common stock on the
date of grant. The maximum number of shares to be issued under the
Directors Plan is 50 thousand shares. Options granted under the
Directors' Plan are immediately exercisable. Options to purchase
thirteen thousand shares had been granted as of June 30, 1997.
The Company has elected to treat the costs of SARs as
compensation charges to the income statement with quarterly
adjustments for market price fluctuations. All other options are
treated as equivalent shares outstanding. There was a $2,142 charge
to income in 1997, a $473 charge to income in 1996, and an $680 charge
to income in 1995 arising from adjustments in fair market values of
the SARs.
In October, 1995, the Financial Accounting Standards Board
issued SFAS No. 123 which established financial accounting and
reporting standards for stock-based employees compensation plans.
SFAS No. 123 encourages companies to adopt a fair value based method
of accounting for such plans but continues to allow the use of the
intrinsic value method prescribed by Accounting Principles Board APB
Opinion No. 25. The Company has elected to continue to account for
stock-based compensation in accordance with APB No. 25. If the
Company had elected to recognize compensation cost based on the fair
value of the options granted at grant date as prescribed by SFAS No.

income of investee companies accounted for on the equity method. Note L - Income Taxes
Consolidated retained earnings at June 30, 1997 and 1996 include
undistributed earnings of $175,910 and $145,773 respectively, of
certain foreign consolidated subsidiaries which are not subject to
additional foreign income taxes nor considered to be subject to United
States income taxes unless remitted as dividends. The Company intends
to reinvest these undistributed earnings indefinitely; accordingly, no
provision has been made for United States taxes on such earnings.
At June 30, 1997, the Company has net operating tax loss
carryforwards of approximately $99,420 for income tax purposes that
expire in 1998 and thereafter. Those carryforwards relate primarily
to state taxes for U.S. entities and to foreign taxes on Baardse and
various Florimex entities.
The components of income loss before income taxes, minority
interest, equity in net income or less of investee companies and
extraordinary items, consisted of the following                  1997       1996      1995

Retirement Benefits
In 1995, the Company assumed the defined Benefit Pension Plan the
Retirement Plan and an Excess Benefit Plan of the former Dibrell.
The Retirement Plan provides retirement benefits for substantially
all of the former Dibrell U.S. salaried personnel based on years of
service rendered and compensation during the last five years of
employment. The Company maintains an Excess Benefit Plan that
provides individuals who participate in the Retirement Plan the
difference between the benefits they could potentially accrue under
the Retirement Plan and the benefits actually paid as limited by
regulations imposed by the Internal Revenue Code. The Company funds
these plans in amounts consistent with the funding requirements of
Federal Law and Regulations.
Certain non-U.S. plans are sponsored by certain Florimex
subsidiaries located in Italy, Austria and Germany. These plans
cover substantially all of their full-time employees. Additional
non-U.S. plans sponsored by certain tobacco subsidiaries cover
substantially all of their full-time employees located in Greece,
Italy, The Netherlands, Turkey and Zimbabwe.              -45 ITEM 8.   FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA continued

For the U.S. plans, projected benefit obligations were determined
using assumed discount rates of 8% for the Retirement Plan for all
three years and 8% for the Excess Benefit Plan for all three years.
Assumed compensation increases were 4% for 1997, 7% for 1996 and 65%
for 1995 for the Retirement Plan and 4% for 1997 and 5% for 1996 and
1995 for the Excess Benefit Plan. The assumed long-term rate of return
on plan assets for all three years was 9% for the Retirement Plan and
8% for all three years for the Excess Benefit Plan. Plan assets
consist principally of common stock and fixed income securities. For
non-U.S. plans, discount rates and assumed compensation increases are
in accordance with locally accepted practice. No assumed long-term
rate of return is made for non-U.S. plan assets as these plans are
generally not funded.               -46 ITEM 8.  FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA continued

The Company also sponsors a 401-k savings plan for most of its
salaried employees located in the United States. The Company
contributions to the plan were $546 in 1997, $481 in 1996, and $652 in
1995.
The Company has a Profit-Sharing Plan for substantially all of
the salaried employees meeting certain eligibility requirements who
were employed by Monk-Austin. This Profit-Sharing Plan is in lieu of
a defined benefit pension plan. Profit-Sharing Plan contributions are
discretionary and totaled $1,043 in 1995. There were no contributions
in 1997 and 1996.
The Company adopted a Cash Balance Plan on July 1, 1996, that
combines the Retirement Plan of the former Dibrell and the Profit-
Sharing Plan of the former Monk-Austin. The adoption increased the
present value of the accumulated benefit obligation by $2,353,
decreased the benefits attributable to projected salary increases by
$2,493 and decreased net pension cost by $403 for 1997.
Postretirement Health and Life Insurance Benefits
The Company provides certain health and life insurance benefits to
retired employees and their eligible dependents who meet specified
age and service requirements. Plan assets consist of paid-up life
insurance policies on certain current retirees. The Company retains
the right, subject to existing agreements, to modify or eliminate the
medical benefits.
The benefit obligation was determined using an assumed discount
rate of 80% for all three years and an assumed rate of increase in
health care costs, also known as the health care cost trend rate, of
8% for 1997, 115% for 1996 and 130% for 1995. This trend rate is
assumed to decrease gradually to 55% by 2002. The assumed long-term
rate of return on plan assets was 55% for 1997 and 1996 and 54% for
1995. Based on current estimates, increasing the health care cost
trend rate by one percentage point would increase the benefit
obligation by approximately $458.
The following table presents the plan funded status at June 30

The Company continues to evaluate ways to better manage these
benefits and control the costs. Any changes in the plan or revisions
to assumptions that affect the amount of expected future benefits may
have a significant effect on the amount of the reported obligation and
annual expense.
Employees in operations located in certain foreign countries are
covered by various foreign postretirement life insurance benefit
arrangements. For these foreign plans, the cash-basis cost of
benefits charged to income was not material in 1997, 1996 and 1995. Note N - Geographic Area Data, Export Sales and Other Information
The following description and tables present the Company tobacco and
flower operations in different geographic areas in conformity with the
Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 14, Financial
Reporting for Segments of a Business Enterprise SFAS 14.
Geographic area information for tobacco operations as to net sales and
operating profit is based on the origin of the product sold, and
identifiable assets are classified based on the origination of the
product. Turkish tobacco is included in other origin. Geographic
area information for flower operations as to net sales and operating
profit is based on the point of sale, and identifiable assets are
classified based on the point of sale. Corporate assets consist
primarily of those related to cost investments. Export sales are
defined as foreign sales of United States origin.
Tobacco
The Company is principally engaged in the tobacco business. Through
its wholly-owned subsidiary, DIMON International, Inc. DIMON
International, DIMON International and its U.S. tobacco subsidiaries
and affiliates buy leaf tobacco on the auction markets in Florida,
Georgia, South Carolina, North Carolina, Virginia, Kentucky, Tennessee
and Maryland for its customers. This tobacco is shipped to plants
located in Virginia and North Carolina where it is processed, packed
in hogsheads or cases and then stored until ordered shipped by its
customers. DIMON International and its tobacco subsidiaries and
affiliates also are engaged in buying, processing and exporting
tobacco grown in Argentina, Brazil, China, Greece, Guatemala, India,
Italy, Malawi, Mexico, Tanzania, Thailand, Turkey, Zimbabwe and other
areas which is sold on the world markets. The Company investee
companies are located in Colombia, Greece, Malawi, Philippines and
Spain.
The disaggregation of entities necessary for geographic area data
may require the use of estimation techniques for operating profit.
The identifiable assets presentation does not take into account the
seasonal aspects of the tobacco business, particularly the seasonal
peak in South America.
Flowers
The Company imports, exports and distributes cut flowers through the
Florimex group, which operates through 67 offices on six continents.               -48 ITEM 8.  FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA continued

revenues, approximately 41%, 55% and 52%, respectively, were to
various tobacco customers which management has reason to believe are
now owned by or under the common control of two companies three
companies in 1996 and 1995, each of which accounted for more than 10%
of net sales. At June 30, 1997, there was approximately $631 million
due from the two major tobacco customers and included in Trade
receivables.
The following table summarizes the net sales made to each
customer for the periods indicated                           1997    1996    1995
Customer A....................$467,333  $474,787  $317,110

Total......................$867,430  $981,943  $810,989
No customers in the flower operation accounted for more than 10%
of flower sales. Note O - Foreign Currency Translation
The financial statements of foreign entities included in the
consolidated financial statements have been translated to U.S. dollars
in accordance with FASB Statement No. 52, Foreign Currency
Translation. Under that Statement, all asset and liability accounts
are translated at the current exchange rate, and income statement
items are translated at the average exchange rate for each quarter;
resulting translation adjustments, net of deferred taxes, are made
directly to a separate component of stockholders' equity. Transaction
adjustments, however, are made in the Statement of Consolidated
Income. These include realized exchange adjustments relating to
assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies. Financial
statements of entities located in highly inflationary economies are
remeasured in U.S. dollars. The remeasurement of and subsequent
transaction adjustments are also made in the Statement of Consolidated
Income.
For 1997, the transaction adjustments netted to a loss of $526.
The transaction adjustments netted to a gain of $368 and a loss of
$570 for 1996 and 1995, respectively, and were primarily related to
the Company Brazilian operations.                 -52 ITEM 8. FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA continued

On August 29, 1996, the Company received notices from Brazilian tax
authorities of proposed adjustments to income taxes for the calendar
year 1992 based on the Company recalculation of monetary correction
as allowed under Law 8200. The approximate proposed adjustment claims
additional tax, including penalties and interest, through June 30,
1997, of $24,112, before related tax benefits for all assessed
interest. In 1993, the Company received notices from Brazilian tax
authorities of proposed adjustments to the income tax returns of the
Company entities located in Brazil for the calendar years ending
1988 through 1992. The approximate proposed adjustments claim
additional tax, including penalties and interest through June 30,
1997, of $31,835, before related tax benefits for all assessed
interest. The Company believes that it has properly reported its
income and paid its taxes in Brazil in accordance with applicable laws
and intends to contest the proposed adjustments vigorously. The
Company expects that the ultimate resolution of these matters will not
have a material adverse effect on the Company consolidated balance
sheet or results of operations.
The Company and certain subsidiaries have available letters of
credit of $261,709 at June 30, 1997, of which $143,713 was
outstanding. These letters of credit represent, generally,
performance guarantees issued in connection with purchases and sales
of domestic and foreign tobacco.
The Company is guarantor as to certain lines and letters of
credit of affiliated companies in an amount not to exceed
approximately $18,476. There was approximately $6,199 outstanding
under these guarantees at June 30, 1997.
The Company subsidiaries have guaranteed certain loans made by
Brazilian banks to local farmers. There was approximately $39,567
outstanding under these guarantees at June 30, 1997.
The Company enters into forward exchange contracts to hedge
certain foreign currency transactions for periods consistent with the
terms of the underlying transactions. While the forward contracts
affect the Company results of operations, they do so only in
connection with the underlying transactions. As a result, they do not
subject the Company to risk from exchange rate movements, because
gains and losses on these contracts offset losses and gains on the
transactions being hedged. At June 30, 1997, the Company had $12
million $14 million in 1996 of U.S. dollar/Deutschmark exchange
contracts outstanding, all of which were in Deutschmarks. The forward
exchange contracts generally have maturities that do not exceed 18
days at June 30, 1997.
The Company other off balance sheet risks are not material.
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with
generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make
estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets
and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at
the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of
revenues and expenses during the reporting period. These estimates
may change with future events.                   -53 ITEM 8.    FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA continued
