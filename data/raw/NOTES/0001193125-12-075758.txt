REPORTING Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal controls over
financial reporting, as such term is defined in Exchange Act Rule 13a-15f. Our internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of
financial statements for external purposes in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Included in our system of internal control are written policies, an organizational structure providing division
of responsibilities, the selection and training of qualified personnel and a program of financial and operations reviews by our professional staff of corporate auditors. 
Our internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that ipertain to the
maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the underlying transactions, including the acquisition and disposition of assets; iiprovide reasonable assurance that our assets are safeguarded and
transactions are executed in accordance with managements and our directors authorization and are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of our Financial Statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles; and
iiiprovide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of our assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. 
Under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our principal executive officer and
principal financial officer, we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting. Our evaluation was based on the framework in Internal Control Integrated Framework issued by the Committee
of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission COSO. Based on our evaluation under the
framework in Internal Control Integrated Framework, our principal executive officer and principal financial officer concluded our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December31, 2011. The conclusion of
our principal executive officer and principal financial officer is based upon the recognition that there are inherent limitations in all systems of internal control, including the possibility of human error and the circumvention or overriding of
controls. Due to its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become
inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. Our internal control over financial reporting as of December31, 2011 has been audited by Ernst Young LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in their report which
is included herein.  s/ Philip K. Asherman s/ Ronald A. Ballschmiede

The Supervisory Board and Shareholders of Chicago Bridge Iron Company N.V. We have audited
Chicago Bridge Iron Company N.V. and subsidiaries internal control over financial reporting as of December31, 2011, based on criteria established in Internal ControlIntegrated Framework issued by the Committee of
Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission the COSO criteria. Chicago Bridge Iron Company N.V. and subsidiaries management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its
assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying Managements Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the
companys internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We conducted our audit in
accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board United States. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial
reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating
effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion. 
A companys internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance
regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A companys internal control over financial reporting includes those
policies and procedures that 1pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; 2provide reasonable assurance that
transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations
of management and directors of the company; and 3provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of the companys assets that could have a material effect on the
financial statements. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not
prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies
or procedures may deteriorate. In our opinion, Chicago Bridge Iron Company N.V. and
subsidiaries maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December31, 2011, based on the COSO criteria. 
We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board United States,
the consolidated balance sheets of Chicago Bridge Iron Company N.V. and subsidiaries as of December31, 2011 and 2010, and the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive income, changes in shareholders equity

ORGANIZATION AND NATURE OF OPERATIONS 
Organization and Nature of Operations Chicago Bridge Iron N.V.
CBI or the Company is an integrated engineering, procurement and construction EPC services provider and major process technology licensor. Founded in 1889, CBI provides conceptual design, technology,
engineering, procurement, fabrication, construction and commissioning services. Natural gas, petroleum and petrochemical projects for the worldwide energy and natural resource industries accounted for a majority of our revenue in 2011, 2010 and
2009.  2.
SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES 
Basis of Accounting and Consolidation These Consolidated Financial Statements
Financial Statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America U.S. GAAP and include all wholly-owned subsidiaries and those entities which we are required to
consolidate in accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board FASB Accounting Standards Codification ASC Consolidations Topic 810 FASB ASC 810. Significant intercompany balances and transactions are
eliminated in consolidation. Certain December31, 2010 balances have been reclassified to conform to our December31, 2011 presentation. See the Joint Venture Arrangements section of this footnote for further discussion of our
consolidation policy for those entities that are not wholly-owned. Use of Estimates The
preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities.
We believe the most significant estimates and judgments are associated with revenue recognition on engineering and construction and technology contracts, recoverability assessments that must be periodically performed with respect to goodwill and
intangible asset balances, financial instruments and deferred tax assets, and the determination of liabilities related to self-insurance programs. If the underlying estimates and assumptions upon which the Financial Statements are based change in
the future, actual amounts may differ from those included in the accompanying Financial Statements. 
Revenue Recognition Our contracts are awarded on a competitive bid and negotiated basis. We offer our
customers a range of contracting options, including cost-reimbursable, fixed-price and hybrid, which has both cost-reimbursable and fixed-price characteristics. Our contract revenue is primarily recognized using the percentage of completion
POC method, based on the percentage that actual costs-to-date bear to total estimated costs to complete each contract. We follow the guidance of FASB ASC Revenue Recognition Topic 605-35 for accounting policies relating to our use of
the POC method, estimating costs, and revenue recognition, including the recognition of profit incentives, unapproved change orders and claims, and combining and segmenting contracts. We utilize the cost-to-cost approach as we believe this method is
less subjective than relying on assessments of physical progress. Under the cost-to-cost approach, the use of estimated cost to complete each contract is a significant variable in the process of determining recognized revenue and is a significant
factor in the accounting for contracts. The cumulative impact of revisions in total cost estimates during the progress of work is reflected in the period in which these changes become known, including, to the extent required, the reversal of profit
recognized in prior periods and the recognition of losses expected to be incurred on contracts in progress. Due to the various estimates inherent in our contract accounting, actual results could differ from those estimates. 
Contract revenue reflects the original contract price adjusted for approved change orders and estimated recoveries of
unapproved change orders and claims. We recognize revenue associated with unapproved change orders and claims to the extent that related costs have been incurred, recovery is probable and the value can be reliably estimated. Profit incentives are
generally included in contract price upon achievement of the relevant performance requirements and customer approval. For 2011, we had unapproved change orders of approximately 
46 Table of Contents CHICAGO BRIDGE IRON COMPANY N.V. 
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Continued 
$27,000 factored into the determination of revenue and estimated costs for a project in our Project Engineering and Construction sector, but had no material claims or profit incentives recognized
in revenue. For 2010 and 2009, we had no material unapproved change orders, claims or profit incentives recognized in revenue. The timing of our revenue recognition may be impacted by the contracting structure of our contracts. Fixed-price and hybrid contracts tend to provide us with greater control over project schedule and the
timing of when work is performed and costs are incurred, and accordingly, when revenue is recognized. Cost-reimbursable contracts, or hybrid contracts with a more significant cost-reimbursable component, generally provide our customers with greater
influence over the timing of when we perform our work, and accordingly, such contracts often result in less predictability with respect to the timing of revenue recognition. 
With respect to our EPC services, our contracts are generally not segmented between types of services, such as
engineering and construction, if each of the EPC components is negotiated concurrently or if the pricing of any such services is subject to the ultimate negotiation and agreement of the entire EPC contract. In some instances we may combine contracts
that are entered into in multiple phases, but that are interdependent and for which pricing considerations by us and the customer are impacted by all phases of the project. Otherwise, if each phase is independent of the other and pricing
considerations do not give effect to another phase, the contracts will not be combined. If an EPC contract also includes technology, in addition to EPC services, such contract is segmented between technology and the EPC services when the technology
scope is independently negotiated and priced. Cumulative costs and estimated earnings recognized to date in
excess of cumulative billings is reported on the Consolidated Balance Sheets Balance Sheets as costs and estimated earnings in excess of billings. Cumulative billings in excess of cumulative costs and estimated earnings recognized to
date is reported as billings in excess of costs and estimated earnings. Any uncollected billed revenue, including contract retentions, is reported as accounts receivable. The timing of when we bill our customers is generally dependent upon advance
billing terms or completion of certain phases of the work. At December31, 2011 and 2010, accounts receivable included contract retentions of $23,700 and $31,700, respectively. Contract retentions estimated to be collectible beyond one year
were not significant at December31, 2011 or 2010. Cost of revenue includes direct contract costs, such as material and labor, and indirect costs that are attributable to contract activity. 
Precontract Costs Precontract costs are generally charged to cost of revenue as incurred, but, in certain
cases, their recognition may be deferred if specific probability criteria are met. There were no significant precontract costs deferred as of December31, 2011 or 2010. 
Research and Development Expenditures for research and development activities are charged to cost of
revenue as incurred and were $27,548 in 2011, $18,634 in 2010 and $16,048 in 2009. Other Operating Expense
Income, Net Other operating expense income, net, generally represents losses gains on the sale of property and equipment. However, 2009 included severance costs in all business sectors, costs associated with the reorganization of
our business sectors and costs associated with the closure of certain fabrication facilities, partially offset by a gain on the sale of a non-controlling equity investment. 
Depreciation and Amortization Property and equipment are recorded at cost and depreciated on a
straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives, including buildings and improvements 10 to 40 years and plant and field equipment 1 to 15 years. Renewals and betterments that substantially extend the useful life of an asset are
capitalized and depreciated. Leasehold improvements are amortized over the lesser of the useful life of the asset or the applicable lease term. Depreciation expense is primarily included within cost of revenue and was $43,882 in 2011, $49,195 in
2010 and $56,205 in 2009. See Note 7 for disclosure of the components of property and equipment.

Impairment of Long-Lived Assets We review tangible assets
and finite-lived intangible assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. If an evaluation is required, the estimated cash flow associated with the asset or asset group
will be compared to the carrying amount to determine if an impairment exists. Finite-lived identifiable intangible assets are amortized on a straight-line basis over estimated useful lives ranging from 5 to 20 years, absent any indicators of
impairment. Goodwill is not amortized to earnings, but instead is reviewed for impairment at least annually,
absent any indicators of impairment. We perform our annual impairment assessment during the fourth quarter of each year based upon balances as of the beginning of that years fourth quarter. As part of our annual impairment assessment in 2011,
we early adopted FASB Accounting Standards Update ASU 2011-08 and elected to utilize the option to first perform a qualitative assessment of goodwill to determine whether it was more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting
unit was less than its carrying value. Based upon this qualitative assessment, a two-phase quantitative assessment was not required to be performed for any of our reporting units. If the two-phase quantitative assessment is deemed necessary in the
future, based on future qualitative assessments, the first phase would screen for impairment, while the second phase, if necessary, would measure impairment. If required, our quantitative analysis of goodwill for future impairment would be
accomplished by comparing an estimate of discounted future cash flow to the net book value of each applicable reporting unit. See Note 5 for additional discussion of our goodwill impairment assessment and intangible asset amortization. 
Earnings Per Share EPS Basic EPS is calculated by dividing net income attributable to
CBI by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding for the period. Diluted EPS reflects the assumed conversion of dilutive securities, consisting of employee stock options, restricted shares, performance shares where performance
criteria have been met and directors deferred-fee shares. See Note 3 for calculations associated with basic and diluted EPS. Cash Equivalents Cash equivalents are considered to be all highly liquid securities with original maturities of three months or less. 
Concentrations of Credit Risk Our billed and unbilled revenue may be exposed to potential credit risk if
our customers should encounter financial difficulties, and we maintain reserves for specifically identified potential uncollectible receivables. As of both December31, 2011 and 2010, allowances for doubtful accounts totaled approximately
$1,800. Foreign Currency The nature of our business activities involves the management of
various financial and market risks, including those related to changes in foreign currency exchange rates. The effects of translating financial statements of foreign operations into our reporting currency are recognized as a cumulative translation
adjustment in accumulated other comprehensive income loss AOCI. These balances, which have been impacted in the current year primarily by movements in the Euro and Canadian Dollar exchange rates against the U.S.Dollar, are net
of tax, where applicable. Foreign currency exchange gains losses are included within cost of revenue, and were immaterial in 2011, 2010 and 2009. Financial Instruments We utilize derivative instruments in certain circumstances to mitigate the effects of changes in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates, as described below:
Foreign Currency Exchange Rate Derivatives We do not engage in currency speculation; however, we do utilize foreign currency exchange
rate derivatives on an on-going basis to hedge against certain foreign currency-related operating exposures and to hedge intercompany loans utilized to finance our non-U.S. subsidiaries. We generally seek hedge accounting treatment for contracts
used to hedge operating exposures and designate them as cash flow hedges. Therefore, gains and losses exclusive of credit risk 
48 Table of Contents CHICAGO BRIDGE IRON COMPANY N.V. 
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Continued  
and forward points which represent the time-value component of the fair value of our derivative positions are included in AOCI until the associated underlying operating exposure impacts our
earnings. Changes in the fair value of credit risk and forward points, gains and losses associated with instruments deemed ineffective during the period and instruments that we do not designate as cash flow hedges, including those instruments used
to hedge intercompany loans, are recognized within cost of revenue.  Interest Rate Derivatives Our interest rate derivatives are limited to a swap arrangement in place to hedge against interest rate
variability associated with our unsecured term loan the Term Loan. The swap arrangement is designated as a cash flow hedge, as its critical terms matched those of the Term Loan at inception and through December31, 2011.
Therefore, changes in the fair value of the swap arrangement are included in AOCI. For
those contracts designated as cash flow hedges, we formally document all relationships between the derivative instruments and associated hedged items, as well as our risk-management objective and strategy for undertaking hedge transactions. This
process includes linking all derivatives to specific firm commitments or highly-probable forecasted transactions. We continually assess, at inception and on an on-going basis, the effectiveness of derivative instruments in offsetting changes in the
cash flow of the designated hedged items. Hedge accounting designation is discontinued when 1it is determined that the derivative is no longer highly effective in offsetting changes in the cash flow of the hedged item, including firm
commitments or forecasted transactions, 2the derivative is sold, terminated, exercised, or expires, 3it is no longer probable that the forecasted transaction will occur, or 4we determine that designating the derivative as a
hedging instrument is no longer appropriate. See Note 10 for additional discussion of our financial instruments. Income Taxes Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing
assets and liabilities and their respective tax basis using currently enacted income tax rates for the years in which the differences are expected to reverse. A valuation allowance is provided to offset any net deferred tax assets if, based upon the
available evidence, it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. The final realization of deferred tax assets depends upon our ability to generate sufficient future taxable income of the appropriate
character and in the appropriate jurisdictions. We continually review our exposures and as further information is known or events occur, changes in our deferred tax assets may be recorded. 
We provide income tax and associated interest reserves, where applicable, in situations where we have and have not
received tax assessments. Tax and associated interest reserves are provided in those instances where we consider it more likely than not that additional taxes will be due in excess of amounts reflected in income tax returns filed worldwide. As a
matter of standard policy, we continually review our exposure to additional income tax obligations and as further information is known or events occur, changes in our tax and interest reserves may be recorded within tax expense and interest expense,
respectively. Joint Venture Arrangements In the ordinary course of business, we execute
specific projects and conduct certain operations through joint venture arrangements. We have various ownership interests in the joint venture entities with such ownership typically being proportionate to our decision-making and distribution rights.
The joint venture generally contracts directly with the third party customer; however, services may be performed directly by the joint venture, or may be performed by us or our joint venture partners, or a combination thereof. 
Joint venture net assets consist primarily of cash and working capital, and assets are typically restricted from being
used to fund obligations outside of the joint venture. These entities typically do not have third-party debt; however, the joint venture arrangements may provide for capital calls to fund operations, if and as necessary, and may require additional
financial support from the joint venture partners, advance payment or retention letters of credit. 
49 Table of Contents CHICAGO BRIDGE IRON COMPANY N.V. 
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Continued 
Each of these entities is assessed at inception and on an ongoing basis
as to whether it qualifies as a variable interest entity VIE under the guidance in FASB ASC 810. Joint ventures generally qualify as a VIE when they meet the following criteria: 1the entity meets the definition of a legal
entity, 2the entity absorbs the operational risk of the projects being executed, creating a variable interest, and 3sufficient capital investment has not been provided by the partners, potentially resulting in the entity needing
additional subordinated financial support, if necessary, to finance its future activities. If at any time an
entity qualifies as a VIE, we are required to perform a qualitative assessment to determine whether we are the primary beneficiary of the VIE and therefore, need to consolidate the VIE. We are the primary beneficiary if we have 1the power to
direct the economically significant activities of the VIE and 2the right to receive benefits from, and obligation to absorb losses of, the VIE. If we are the primary beneficiary of the VIE, or otherwise have the ability to control an entity,
we consolidate the entity. If we are not determined to be the primary beneficiary of the VIE, or only have the ability to significantly influence the entity rather than control the entity, we do not consolidate the entity. We account for
unconsolidated entities using the equity method or proportionate consolidation. For 2011, 2010 and 2009, we had no material proportionately consolidated entities. See Note 6 for additional discussion of our material joint venture arrangements.
New Accounting Standards As noted above, in the third quarter of 2011, we early adopted FASB
ASU 2011-08, which allowed us the option to perform a qualitative assessment of a reporting units fair value, potentially replacing the two-phase quantitative assessment previously required under the FASB ASC Intangibles-Goodwill and Other
Topic 350. Our adoption of this standard did not have a material impact on our financial position, results of operations or cash flow. See Note 5 for additional discussion of our qualitative assessment of goodwill. 
In the fourth quarter of 2011, FASB ASU 2011-09 became effective, requiring additional annual disclosures for employers
that participate in multi-employer pension plans. For each multi-employer plan that is individually significant to an employers financial statements, the employer must disclose additional information regarding the funding level of the plan,
the employers contributions to the plan, the status of any actions to improve the funding level of the plan, where required, and the status of the plans collective bargaining agreements. Our adoption of this standard did not have a
material impact on our financial position, results of operations or cash flow. See Note 11 for specific disclosures of our multi-employer pension plans.  3.

ACQUISITIONS 
Through December31, 2010, we held a 50% equity investment in Catalytic Distillation Technologies
CDTECH, which provides license, basic engineering and catalyst supply for catalytic distillation applications, including gasoline desulphurization and alkylation processes. This investment was accounted for by the equity method and was
reflected in the operating results of Lummus Technology. On December31, 2010, we acquired Chemical Research and Licensing CRL from CRI/Criterion, a subsidiary of Royal Dutch Shell plc., for approximately $38,400, net of cash
acquired. The acquisition of CRL included a research and development and catalyst manufacturing facility, and enabled us to assume the remaining 50% equity interest in CDTECH. Beginning in 2011, the results of operations of CDTECH were
consolidated and continue to reside within Lummus Technology. The aggregate purchase price noted above was
allocated to the major categories of assets and liabilities acquired based upon their estimated fair values, none of which were significant to our Balance Sheets at December31, 2011 or 2010. The change in our purchase price allocation from
December31, 2010 did not have a significant impact on our Balance Sheet at December31, 2011 or our 2011 Consolidated Statement of Operations Statement of Operations. 
We had no acquisitions in 2011, and other acquisitions during 2010 and 2009 were not material. 5.
GOODWILL AND OTHER INTANGIBLES 
Goodwill At December31, 2011 and 2010, our goodwill was $926,393 and $938,855,
respectively, attributable to the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of net assets acquired as part of previous acquisitions. The change in goodwill by business sector for 2011 and 2010 was as follows: Steel PlateStructures  LummusTechnology Total Balance at December31, 2009 45,709 480,635 436,346 962,690 Acquisitions1 9,135 9,135 Foreign currency translation and other2 2,788 26,398 9,360 32,970

Balance at December31, 2011 48,320 444,425 433,648 926,393 
1
These changes are associated with the acquisition of CDTECH on December31, 2010. See Note 4 above for additional discussion of the
acquisition. 2
These changes are inclusive of the impact of foreign currency translation and reductions associated with U.S. tax goodwill in excess of book
goodwill. As discussed in Note 2, in the fourth quarter of 2011, we performed our annual
impairment assessment utilizing the option to first perform a qualitative assessment of goodwill to determine whether it was more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit was less than its carrying value. Based upon this qualitative
assessment, a two-phase quantitative assessment was not required to be performed for any of our reporting units and no impairment charge was necessary during 2011. There can be no assurance that future goodwill impairment tests will not result in
charges to earnings.

Other Intangible Assets The following table provides a
summary of our acquired finite-lived intangible assets at December31, 2011 and 2010, including weighted-average useful lives for each major intangible asset class and in total: December31, 2011 December31, 2010 GrossCarryingAmount AccumulatedAmortization GrossCarryingAmount AccumulatedAmortization Finite-lived intangible assets weighted average life Process technologies 15 years1 228,363 57,381 230,031 42,870 Tradenames 9 years 38,346 25,814 38,563 19,782 Backlog 5 years 10,669 8,782 10,727 6,684 Lease agreements 6 years 7,279 5,792 7,516 3,781 Non-compete agreements 7 years 2,895 1,664 2,958 1,277

Our technologies primarily relate to our process licenses for the gas processing, hydrocarbon refining and petrochemical industries. The
technologies were valued based upon their ability to generate earnings in excess of those associated with standard products. The valuation included an analysis of current and potential industry and competitive factors, including market share,
barriers to entry, pricing, competitor and customer technologies, research and development budgets, patent protection and potential for product line extensions. The amortization periods were estimated based upon a combination of the expectations of
general industry refurbishment rates for the types of technologies we provide, remaining patent protection periods for our patented technologies, and the expected lives of those technologies for which we do not seek patent protection.
The decrease in other intangibles during 2011 related to amortization expense and the
impact of foreign currency translation. Amortization expense for 2011, 2010 and 2009 was $26,302, $23,690, and $23,326, respectively. For intangibles existing at December31, 2011, the amortization for 2012, 2013, 2014, 2015 and 2016 is
anticipated to be approximately $22,700, $16,500, $15,800, $15,300, and $15,300, respectively.  6.
JOINT VENTURE ARRANGEMENTS 
As discussed in Note 2, we account for our unconsolidated joint ventures primarily using the equity
method of accounting. Further, we consolidate any joint venture that is determined to be a VIE for which we are the primary beneficiary, or which we otherwise effectively control. 
Unconsolidated Joint Ventures The following is a summary description of our material unconsolidated joint
ventures, which have been accounted for using the equity method:  Chevron-Lummus Global We have a 50% equity interest in Chevron-Lummus Global CLG, which provides
license, basic engineering services and catalyst supply for deep conversion e.g. hydrocracking, residual hydroprocessing and lubes processing. The business primarily focuses on converting/upgrading heavy/sour crude that is produced in the refinery
process to more marketable products. As sufficient capital investments in CLG have been made by the joint venture partners, it does not qualify as a VIE.  CDTECH As discussed in Note 4, through December31, 2010, we held a 50% equity interest in CDTECH. On December31, 2010, we
acquired the remaining 50% equity interest in CDTECH, and 
52 Table of Contents CHICAGO BRIDGE IRON COMPANY N.V. 
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Continued  
accordingly, we consolidated the entity as of that date. Our 2011 Statement of Operations includes the results of operations of CDTECH and our Balance Sheet at December31, 2011 and 2010
includes the assets acquired and liabilities assumed in the acquisition. The following
tables present: 1summarized income statement data for CLG in 2011 and combined information for CDTECH and CLG in 2010 and 2009, and 2summarized balance sheet information for CLG at December31, 2011 and 2010: Years Ended December31 2011 2010 2009 Revenue 169,139 170,667 228,501 Gross profit 60,361 79,827 102,193 Income from operations 32,687 34,054 56,011 Net income 32,628 33,116 55,544

In addition to CLG and CDTECH, we have had various other equity method joint ventures
that were not material to our consolidated results of operations or financial position. Dividends received for equity method joint ventures were $9,605, $26,853 and $24,219 during 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively. 
Consolidated Joint Ventures The following is a summary description of the material joint ventures we
consolidate due to their designation as VIEs for which we are the primary beneficiary:  CBI Kentz Joint Venture In 2011, a joint venture between CBI 65%and Kentz 35%was formed to execute the
structural, mechanical, piping, electrical and instrumentation work and to provide commissioning support for the construction of three Liquefied Natural Gas LNG trains, including associated utilities and a domestic gas processing and
compression plant for the Gorgon LNG project, located on Barrow Island, Australia. The contract value of the project as of December31, 2011 was approximately $23 billion.  CBI Clough Joint Venture In 2009, a joint venture between CBI 65%and Clough 35%was formed to execute the EPC work
for a gas conditioning plant, nearby wellheads and associated piping and infrastructure for the Papua New Guinea LNG project, located in the Southern Highlands of Papua New Guinea. The contract value of the project as of December31, 2011 was
approximately $20 billion. The following table presents summarized balance sheet

RESTRUCTURING COSTS 
During 2009, we recognized charges within other operating expense for severance costs, costs associated
with the reorganization of our business sectors and costs associated with the closure of certain fabrication facilities. The charges, which were substantially paid during 2009, were approximately $15,300 and were distributed among our business
sector as follows: Steel Plate Structures approximately $5,900, Project Engineering and Construction approximately $6,800 net of a gain on the sale of a non-controlling equity investment, and Lummus Technology approximately
$2,600. We do not expect these activities to have a material effect on our future sector or consolidated results of operations or cash flow. 
54 Table of Contents CHICAGO BRIDGE IRON COMPANY N.V. 
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Continued 
During 2010 and 2011, we consolidated or relocated several of our leased
U.S. and international engineering offices in support of the requirements of our backlog, which resulted in the recognition of charges totaling $10,616 and $13,342, respectively, within cost of revenue. The charges were primarily associated with the
accelerated recognition of future operating lease expense for unutilized facility capacity in our Project Engineering and Construction and Steel Plate Structures sectors, where we remain contractually obligated to a lessor. The following table
presents the total accelerated operating lease charges recognized during 2010 and 2011 and the remaining net operating lease obligation at December31, 2010 and 2011: YearsEndedDecember

During 2010, all charges were related to facilities in our Project Engineering and Construction sector. During 2011, charges of $2,816 and $7,265
were related to facilities in our Steel Plate Structures and Project Engineering and Construction sectors, respectively. 2
The remaining net operating lease obligation was recorded in accrued liabilities and other non-current liabilities, based on the anticipated timing
of payments. Additionally, we recognized charges associated with the write-down of
leasehold improvements and other long-term assets in the facilities noted above. These charges were $3,889 in 2010 all of which related to our Project Engineering and Construction sector and $3,261 in 2011 $2,077 and $1,184 for our Steel Plate
Structures and Project Engineering and Construction sectors, respectively. We do not expect these consolidation activities to have a material effect on our future sector or consolidated results of operations or cash flow. 9.

Revolving Facility We have a four-year, $1,100,000,
committed and unsecured revolving credit facility the Revolving Facility with JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. JPMorgan, as administrative agent, and Bank of America, N.A. BofA, as syndication agent, which expires
in July 2014. The Revolving Facility has a borrowing sublimit of $550,000 and certain financial covenants, including a maximum leverage ratio, a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio and a minimum net worth level. The Revolving Facility also includes
customary restrictions regarding subsidiary indebtedness, sales of assets, liens, investments, type of business conducted, and mergers and acquisitions, as well as a trailing twelve-month limitation of $200,000 for dividend payments and share
repurchases, among other restrictions. In addition to interest on debt borrowings, we are assessed quarterly commitment fees on the unutilized portion of the facility as well as letter of credit fees on outstanding instruments. The interest, letter
of credit fee, and commitment fee percentages are based upon our quarterly leverage ratio. In the event that we were to borrow funds under the facility, interest would be assessed at either prime plus an applicable floating margin or LIBOR plus an
applicable floating margin. As of December31, 2011, we had issued $434,128 of letters of credit under the Revolving Facility. Such letters of credit are generally issued to customers in the ordinary course of business to support advance
payments and performance guarantees, in lieu of retention on our contracts, or in certain cases, are issued in support of our insurance program. As of December31, 2011, we had $665,872 of available capacity under the Revolving Facility.
LC Agreement We have a $125,000 committed and unsecured letter of credit and term loan
agreement the LC Agreement with BofA, as administrative agent, JPMorgan, and various private placement note investors, which expires in November 2014. Under the terms of the LC Agreement, either BofA or JPMorgan the LC
Issuers can issue letters of credit. As of December31, 2011, the LC Agreement was fully utilized. The LC Agreement has financial and restrictive covenants similar to those noted above for the Revolving Facility. In the event of our
default under the LC Agreement, including our failure to reimburse a draw against an issued letter of credit, the LC Issuers could transfer their claim against us, to the extent such amount is due and payable by us under the LC Agreement, to the
private placement lenders, creating a term loan that is due and payable no later than the stated maturity of the respective LC Agreement. In addition to quarterly letter of credit fees that we pay under the LC Agreement, we would be assessed an
applicable rate of interest over LIBOR to the extent that a term loan is in effect. 
Term Loan We have a $200,000 unsecured term loan the Term Loan with
JPMorgan, as administrative agent, and BofA, as syndication agent. Interest under the Term Loan is paid quarterly in arrears and, at our election, is based upon LIBOR plus an applicable floating margin. However, we have an interest rate swap that
provides for an interest rate of approximately 557%, inclusive of the applicable floating margin. The remaining Term Loan balance is scheduled to be repaid in November 2012. The Term Loan has financial and restrictive covenants similar to those
noted above for the Revolving Facility. Uncommitted Facilities We also have various short-term,
uncommitted revolving credit facilities the Uncommitted Facilities across several geographic regions of approximately $1,420,111. These facilities are generally used to provide letters of credit or bank guarantees to customers to
support advance payments and performance guarantees in the ordinary course of business or in lieu of retention on our contracts. At December31, 2011, we had available capacity of $677,342 under these facilities. In addition to providing
letters of credit or bank guarantees, we also issue surety bonds in the ordinary course of business to support our contract performance. Compliance and Other During 2011, we had no material borrowings under the Revolving Facility, the LC Agreement or the Uncommitted Facilities. As of December31, 2011, we were in
compliance with all of our restrictive and financial covenants. Capitalized interest was insignificant in 2011, 2010 and 2009.

FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS 
Foreign Currency Exchange Rate Derivatives 
Operating Exposures At December31, 2011, the notional value of our outstanding forward contracts to
hedge certain foreign exchange-related operating exposures was approximately $73,200. These contracts vary in duration, maturing up to three years from period-end. Certain of these hedges are designated as cash flow hedges, allowing changes in their
fair value to be recognized in AOCI until the associated underlying operating exposure impacts our earnings. We exclude forward points, which are recognized as ineffectiveness within cost of revenue and are not material to our earnings, from our
hedge assessment analysis. Intercompany Loan Exposures At December31, 2011, the notional
value of our outstanding forward contracts to hedge certain intercompany loans utilized to finance non-U.S. subsidiaries was approximately $3,200. These contracts, which we do not designate as cash flow hedges, generally mature within seven days of
period-end and changes in their fair value are recognized in cost of revenue, generally offsetting any translation gains losses on the underlying loans. Interest Rate Derivatives Interest Rate
Exposures We continue to utilize a swap arrangement to hedge against interest rate variability associated with our Term Loan. The swap arrangement has been designated as a cash flow hedge as its critical terms matched those of the Term
Loan at inception and as of December31, 2011. Accordingly, changes in the fair value of the hedge are recognized in AOCI.

We are exposed to credit risk associated with potential non-performance of counterparties on our hedging instruments and the fair value of our
derivatives reflects this credit risk. The total assets at fair value above represent the maximum loss that we would incur on our outstanding hedges if the applicable counterparties failed to perform according to the hedge contracts. To help
mitigate counterparty credit risk, we transact only with counterparties that are rated as investment grade or higher and monitor all such counterparties on a continuous basis. 
A financial instruments categorization within the valuation hierarchy above is based upon the lowest level of input
that is significant to the fair value measurement. Cash and cash equivalents are classified within Level 1 of the valuation hierarchy as they are valued at cost, which approximates fair value. Exchange-traded derivative positions are classified
within Level 2 of the valuation hierarchy, as they are valued using readily observable market parameters quoted market prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets as their basis. Level 2 derivatives are valued utilizing an income
approach, which discounts future cash flow based upon current market expectations and adjusts for credit risk. In some cases, derivatives may be valued based upon models with significant unobservable market parameters and would be classified within
Level 3 of the valuation hierarchy. We did not have any Level 3 classifications as of December31, 2011 or 2010. The carrying values of our accounts receivable, accounts payable and notes payable approximate their fair values because of the short-term nature of these instruments. At December31, 2011 and 2010,
the fair value of our long-term debt, based upon the current market rates for debt with similar credit risk and maturity, approximated its carrying value as interest is based upon LIBOR plus an applicable floating spread and is paid quarterly in
arrears.

RETIREMENT BENEFITS 
Defined Contribution Plans 
We sponsor multiple contributory defined contribution plans for eligible employees with various features including
voluntary pre-tax salary deferral features, matching contributions, and savings plan contributions in the form of cash or our common stock, to be determined annually. During 2011, 2010 and 2009, we expensed $43,530, $43,451 and $47,891,
respectively, for these plans. In addition, we sponsor several other defined contribution plans that cover salaried and hourly employees for which we do not provide contributions. The cost of these plans was not significant to us in 2011, 2010 or
2009. Defined Benefit Pension and Other Postretirement Plans 
We currently sponsor various defined benefit pension plans covering certain employees in our business sectors. We also
provide certain health care and life insurance benefits for our retired employees through multiple health care and life insurance benefit programs. Retiree health care benefits are provided under an established formula, which limits costs based upon
prior years of service of retired employees. These plans may be changed or terminated by us at any time. The following tables provide combined information for our defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans:

During 2012, we expect to contribute approximately $15,800 and $3,800 to our pension and other postretirement plans, respectively. 4
During 2012, we expect to recognize $374 and $2,383 of previously unrecognized net prior service pension costs and net actuarial pension losses,
respectively.

Plan Assets Our investment strategy for defined benefit plan assets seeks
to optimize the proper risk-return relationship considered appropriate for each respective plans investment goals, using a global portfolio of various asset classes diversified by market segment, economic sector and issuer. The primary goal is
to optimize the asset mix to fund future benefit obligations, while managing various risk factors and each plans investment return objectives.

Our defined benefit pension plan assets in the U.S. are invested in a
well-diversified portfolio of equities including U.S. large, mid and small-capitalization and international equities and fixed income securities including corporate and government bonds. Non-U.S. defined benefit pension plan assets are similarly
invested in well-diversified portfolios of equity, fixed income and other securities. At December31, 2011, our target weighted-average asset allocations by asset category were: equity securities 20%-30%, fixed income securities 60%-70 and other investments 0%-10%.

Level 3 assets include private equity hedge funds for which the
principal investment objective is to invest in a portfolio that delivers excess returns over cash with low volatility and near zero betas to traditional asset classes, when measured over an economic cycle. The following table presents the activity

Health Care Cost Inflation We maintain multiple medical plans for certain
groups of retirees and their dependents in the U.S. and the U.K., subject to vesting requirements. Under our program in the U.S., certain eligible current and future retirees are covered by a defined fixed dollar benefit, under which our costs for
each participant are fixed. Additionally, there is a closed group of U.S. retirees for which we assume some or all of the cost of coverage. For this group, health care cost trend rates are projected at annual rates ranging from 85% in 2012 down to
50% in 2018 and beyond. The assumed annual rate of health care cost inflation for the U.K. plan is 71%. Under both the U.S. and U.K. programs, new employees are not eligible for post-retirement medical benefits. 
Increasing decreasing the assumed health care cost trends by one percentage point for our programs is estimated to
increase decrease the total of the service and interest cost components of net postretirement health care cost for 2011 and the accumulated postretirement benefit obligation at December31, 2011, as follows: 1-Percentage 1-Percentage PointIncrease PointDecrease Effect on total of service and interest cost 101 90 Effect on postretirement benefit obligation 1,994 1,767  65 Table of Contents CHICAGO BRIDGE IRON COMPANY N.V.

Multi-employer Pension Plans We contribute to certain
union sponsored multi-employer defined benefit pension plans, primarily in the U.S. and Canada. Benefits under these plans are generally based upon years of service and compensation levels. Under U.S. legislation regarding such pension plans, the
risks of participation are different than single-employer pension plans as 1assets contributed to the plan by a company may be used to provide benefits to participants of other companies, 2if a participating company discontinues
contributions to a plan, other participating companies may have to cover any unfunded liability that may exist, and 3a company is required to continue funding its proportionate share of a plans unfunded vested benefits in the event of
withdrawal as defined by the legislation from a plan or plan termination. The following table provides additional information regarding our significant multi-employer defined benefit pension plans, including the funding level of each plan or zone
status, as defined by the Pension Protection Act, whether actions to improve the funding level of the plan have been implemented, where required a funding improvement plan FIP or rehabilitation plan RP, and our

Pension Protection Act Zone Status and FIP/RP plans are applicable to our U.S.-registered plans only, as these terms are not defined within Canadian
pension legislation. In the U.S., plans funded less than 65% are in the red zone, plans funded at least 65%, but less than 80% are in the yellow zone, and plans funded at least 80% are in the green zone. The requirement for FIP or RP plans in the
U.S. is based on the funding level or zone status of the applicable plan. 2
Our contributions for only the Boilermakers National Pension Plan Canada exceeded 5% of total plan contributions for 2010 and 2009. For
2011, our contributions as a percentage of total plan contributions were not available for any of our plans. The level of our contributions to each plan noted above varies from period to period based upon the level of work being performed that is
covered under the applicable collective-bargaining agreement. 3
The funding level zone status for the 2011 plan year was not available for these plans. However, based on total plan assets and accumulated
benefit obligations, the Minnesota Laborers Pension Plan was greater than 80% funded green zone status as of January1, 2011. Funding level information for the 2011 plan year was not available for the Twin City Iron Workers Pension Plan. 4
Our remaining contributions are to various U.S. and Canadian plans, which are immaterial individually and in the aggregate.
We also contribute to our multi-employer plans for annuity benefits covered under the
defined contribution portion of the plans as well as health benefits. We made contributions to our multi-employer plans of $12,170, $8,796 and $11,947 during 2011, 2010, and 2009, respectively, for these additional benefits.

COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES 
Leases Certain facilities and equipment, including project-related field equipment, are
rented under operating leases that expire at various dates through 2022. Rent expense for operating leases was $73,835, $60,529, and $69,180 in 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively. Future minimum payments under non-cancelable operating leases having
initial terms of one year or more are as follows:  Year
Amount 2012 67,525 2013 51,947 2014 35,083 2015 27,098 2016 24,173 Thereafter 66,518 
Total1 272,344

Approximately $37,500 of minimum lease payments above are contractually recoverable through our cost-reimbursable projects.
Certain lease agreements contain escalation provisions based upon specific future inflation
indices which could impact the future minimum payments presented above. The costs related to leases with an initial term of less than one year have been reflected in rent expense but have been excluded from the future minimum payments presented
above. Legal Proceedings We have been and may from time to time be named as a defendant in
legal actions claiming damages in connection with engineering and construction projects, technology licenses and other matters. These are typically claims that arise in the normal course of business, including employment-related claims and
contractual disputes or claims for personal injury or property damage which occur in connection with services performed relating to project or construction sites. Contractual disputes normally involve claims relating to the timely completion of
projects, performance of equipment or technologies, design or other engineering services or project construction services provided by us. We do not believe that any of our pending contractual, employment-related personal injury or property damage
claims and disputes will have a material effect on our future results of operations, financial position or cash flow. Asbestos Litigation We are a defendant in lawsuits wherein plaintiffs allege exposure to asbestos due to work we may have performed at various locations. We have never been a manufacturer,
distributor or supplier of asbestos products. Over the past several decades and through December31, 2011, we have been named a defendant in lawsuits alleging exposure to asbestos involving approximately 5,200 plaintiffs and, of those claims,
approximately 1,400 claims were pending and 3,800 have been closed through dismissals or settlements. Over the past several decades and through December31, 2011, the claims alleging exposure to asbestos that have been resolved have been
dismissed or settled for an average settlement amount of approximately one thousand dollars per claim. We review each case on its own merits and make accruals based upon the probability of loss and our estimates of the amount of liability and
related expenses, if any. We do not believe that any unresolved asserted claims will have a material adverse effect on our future results of operations, financial position or cash flow, and, at December31, 2011, we had approximately $1,600
accrued for liability and related expenses. With respect to unasserted asbestos claims, we cannot identify a population of potential claimants with sufficient certainty to determine the probability of a loss and to make a reasonable estimate of
liability, if any. While we continue to pursue recovery for recognized and unrecognized contingent losses through insurance, indemnification 
67 Table of Contents CHICAGO BRIDGE IRON COMPANY N.V. 
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Continued 
arrangements or other sources, we are unable to quantify the amount, if any, that we may expect to recover because of the variability in coverage amounts, limitations and deductibles, or the
viability of carriers, with respect to our insurance policies for the years in question. Environmental
Matters Our operations are subject to extensive and changing U.S.federal, state and local laws and regulations, as well as the laws of other countries, that establish health and environmental quality standards. These standards,
among others, relate to air and water pollutants and the management and disposal of hazardous substances and wastes. We are exposed to potential liability for personal injury or property damage caused by any release, spill, exposure or other
accident involving such pollutants, substances or wastes. In connection with the historical operation of our
facilities, substances which currently are or might be considered hazardous were used or disposed of at some sites that will or may require us to make expenditures for remediation. In addition, we have agreed to indemnify parties from whom we have
purchased or to whom we have sold facilities for certain environmental liabilities arising from acts occurring before the dates those facilities were transferred. 
We believe that we are in compliance, in all material respects, with all environmental laws and regulations. We do not
believe that any environmental matters will have a material adverse effect on our future results of operations, financial position or cash flow. We do not anticipate that we will incur material capital expenditures for environmental controls or for
the investigation or remediation of environmental conditions during 2012 or 2013. Letters of Credit/Bank
Guarantees/Surety Bonds In the ordinary course of business, we may obtain surety bonds and letters of credit, which we provide to our customers to secure advance payment or our performance under our contracts, or in lieu of
retention being withheld on our contracts. In the event of our non-performance under a contract and an advance being made by a bank pursuant to a draw on a letter of credit, the advance would become a borrowing under a credit facility and thus our
direct obligation. Where a surety incurs such a loss, an indemnity agreement between the parties and us may require payment from our excess cash or a borrowing under our credit facilities. When a contract is completed, the contingent obligation
terminates and the bonds or letters of credit are returned. At December31, 2011, we had provided $1,568,980 of surety bonds and letters of credit to support our contracting activities in the ordinary course of business. This amount fluctuates
based upon the mix and level of contracting activity. Insurance We have elected to retain
portions of future losses, if any, through the use of deductibles and self-insured retentions for our exposures related to third-party liability and workers compensation. Liabilities in excess of these amounts are the responsibilities of an
insurance carrier. To the extent we are self-insured for these exposures, reserves see Note 7 have been provided based upon our best estimates with input from our legal and insurance advisors. Changes in assumptions, as well as changes in actual
experience, could cause these estimates to change in the near term. We believe that reasonably possible losses, if any, for these matters, to the extent not otherwise disclosed and net of recorded reserves, will not have a material adverse effect on
our future results of operations, financial position or cash flow. At December31, 2011, we had outstanding surety bonds and letters of credit of $28,248 relating to our insurance programs. 
Income Taxes We provide income tax and associated interest reserves, where applicable, in situations where
we have and have not received tax assessments. Tax and associated interest reserves are provided in those instances where we consider it more likely than not that additional taxes will be due in excess of amounts reflected in income tax returns
filed worldwide. As a matter of standard policy, we continually review our exposure to additional income tax obligations and as further information is known or events occur, changes in our tax and interest reserves may be recorded within tax expense
and interest expense, respectively.

SHAREHOLDERS EQUITY 
Stock Held in Trust From time to time, we grant restricted shares to key employees under
our Long-Term Incentive Plan see Note 14. Prior to 2010, restricted shares granted were transferred to a rabbi trust the Trust and held until the vesting restrictions lapsed, at which time the shares were released from the Trust and
distributed to the applicable employees. Beginning in 2010, restricted shares are no longer transferred to the Trust upon grant, but instead are distributed directly to the applicable employees upon vesting. 
Treasury Stock Under Dutch law and our Articles of Association, we may hold no more than 10%
of our issued share capital at any time. Accumulated Other Comprehensive Loss Income
AOCI At December31, 2011 and 2010, the components of AOCI, net of tax, were as follows:  December31 2011 2010 Currency translation adjustment 26,720 7,027 Unrealized fair value of cash flow hedges 797 2,132 Unrecognized net prior service pension credits costs 2,413 104 Unrecognized net actuarial pension losses 36,048 11,729 
Total 61,152 20,992 
Other Changes in common stock, additional paid-in capital,
stock held in trust and treasury stock for 2011 and 2010 primarily relate to activity associated with our stock-based compensation plans and share repurchases.  14.
STOCK PLANS 
Under our employee stock purchase plan ESPP, employees may make quarterly purchases of
shares at a discount through regular payroll deductions for up to 8% of their compensation. The shares are purchased at 85% of the closing price per share on the first trading day following the end of the calendar quarter. Compensation expense
related to our ESPP, representing the difference between the fair value on the date of purchase and the price paid, was $1,329, $1,356 and $1,475 for 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively. At December31, 2011, 1,596,782 authorized shares remained
available for purchase under the ESPP. Under our Long-Term Incentive Plan the Incentive Plan,
we can issue shares to employees and directors in the form of stock options, restricted shares or performance shares. This plan is administered by the Organization and Compensation Committee of our Board of Supervisory Directors, which selects those
employees eligible to receive awards and determines the number of shares or options subject to each award, as well as the terms, conditions, performance measures, and other provisions of the award. Compensation expense related to our Incentive Plan
was $33,969, $29,930 and $27,105 for 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively. At December31, 2011, 2,526,344 authorized shares remained available under the Incentive Plan for future stock option, restricted share or performance share grants.
Total stock-based compensation expense for our ESPP and the Incentive Plan was $35,298, $31,286 and $28,580
during 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively. As of December31, 2011, there was $31,287 of unrecognized compensation cost related to share-based grants, which is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of 15 years. 
69 Table of Contents CHICAGO BRIDGE IRON COMPANY N.V. 
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Continued 
We receive a tax deduction during the period in which certain options
are exercised, generally for the difference in the option exercise price and the price of the shares at the date of exercise intrinsic value. Additionally, we receive a tax deduction upon the vesting of restricted shares and
performance shares for the price of the shares at the date of vesting. The total recognized tax benefit based on our compensation expense was $11,331, $10,196 and $7,946 for 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively. The amount of tax deductions in excess
of accumulated tax benefits recognized is reflected as a financing cash flow. Stock Options
Stock options are generally granted at the market value on the date of grant and expire after 10 years. Options granted to employees typically vest over a period ranging from two to seven years. The expense for these awards was
determined based upon the calculated Black-Scholes fair value of each stock option at the date of grant applied to the total number of options that were anticipated to fully vest. The weighted-average fair value per share of options granted during
2011, 2010 and 2009 was $2053, $1416 and $473, respectively. The aggregate intrinsic value of options exercised during 2011, 2010 and 2009 was $13,789, $8,692 and $907, respectively. From the exercise of stock options in 2011, we received net
cash proceeds of $4,681 and realized an actual income tax benefit of $3,798. The following table represents stock option activity for 2011:  Number ofShares WeightedAverageExercise

We estimate that 1,245,746 of these options will ultimately vest. These options have a weighted-average exercise price per share of $1761, a
weighted-average remaining contractual life of 57 years and a current aggregate intrinsic value of $26,533. Using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model, the fair value of each option grant was estimated on the grant date based upon the following weighted-average assumptions: 2011 2010 2009 Risk-free interest rate 285 324 222 Expected dividend yield 059 000 000 Expected volatility 6965 6871 6228 Expected life in years 6 6 6
The risk-free interest rate is based on the U.S. Treasury yield curve on the grant date,
expected dividend yield is based on current dividend levels, expected volatility is based on the historical volatility of our stock, and the expected life of options granted represents the period of time that they are expected to be outstanding. We
also use historical information to estimate option exercises and forfeitures. Restricted Shares
Our Incentive Plan also allows for the issuance of restricted share awards that may not be sold or otherwise transferred until certain restrictions have lapsed, which is generally over a four-year graded vesting period. The
unearned compensation related to these awards is recognized as compensation expense on a 
70 Table of Contents CHICAGO BRIDGE IRON COMPANY N.V. 
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Continued 
straight-line basis over the vesting period, subject to retirement eligibility expense acceleration, where applicable. Restricted shares granted to directors vest, and are recognized as
compensation expense, over one year. The compensation expense for our restricted share awards was determined based upon the market price of our stock at the date of grant applied to the total number of shares that we anticipate will fully vest.
The following table presents restricted share activity for 2011: Shares  Share Nonvested restricted shares Balance at beginning of year 1,810,118 1703 Granted 443,519 3594 Distributed 667,210 1889 Forfeited 23,739 2128

During 2010, 620,299 restricted shares including 41,566 directors shares subject
to restrictions were granted with a weighted-average grant-date fair value per share of $2204. During 2009, 1,577,679 restricted shares including 35,200 directors shares subject to restrictions were granted with a weighted-average
grant-date fair value per share of $854. The total fair value of restricted shares that vested during 2011, 2010, and 2009 was $25,208, $17,568 and $3,274, respectively. 
Performance Shares Performance shares generally vest over three years and are expensed
ratably over the vesting term, subject to achievement of specific Company performance goals and retirement eligibility expense acceleration, where applicable. Compensation expense for these awards is determined based upon the market price of our
stock at the date of grant applied to the total number of shares that we anticipate will fully vest. As a result of performance conditions being met during 2011, we recognized $17,822 of compensation expense. During 2011, 286,140 performance shares
were granted with a weighted-average grant-date fair value per share of $3615. Additionally, we distributed 1,113,726 performance shares in 2011 upon vesting and achievement of certain performance goals. During 2010, 447,069 performance shares were
granted with a weighted-average grant-date fair value per share of $2210. During 2009, 1,246,716 performance shares were granted with a weighted-average grant-date fair value per share of $819.

As of December31, 2011, except as indicated herein, neither Netherlands income
taxes from dividends and other profit remittances, nor other worldwide withholding taxes due on profit distributions have been accrued on the estimated $1,018,000 of undistributed earnings of our U.S., Netherlands, and subsidiary companies thereof.
Distribution of earnings from our European Union subsidiaries to their Netherlands parents are not subject to withholding tax. With respect to our non-European Union Netherlands subsidiaries and our U.S. companies and their subsidiaries, we intend
to permanently reinvest the undistributed earnings of these subsidiaries in their respective businesses, and therefore, have not provided for deferred taxes on such unremitted foreign earnings. The determination of any unrecognized deferred tax
liability related to permanently reinvested earnings is not practical. Further, we did not record any Netherlands deferred income taxes on undistributed earnings of our other subsidiaries and affiliates at December31, 2011 since, if any such
undistributed earnings were distributed, under current Dutch tax law The Netherlands Participation Exemption should become available to significantly reduce or eliminate any resulting Netherlands income tax liability. 
As of December31, 2011, we had Non-U.S. NOLs of $680,323, including $470,443 in the U.K. and $209,880 in other
jurisdictions. We believe it is more likely than not that $308,011 of U.K. NOLs and $137,656 of other non-U.S. NOLs will not be utilized and have placed a valuation allowance against these NOLs. Accordingly, as of December31, 2011, the net
deferred tax asset DTA associated with Non-U.S. NOLs was $40,608 and $17,627 for the U.K. and other jurisdictions, respectively. The U.K. NOL DTA was recorded 
73 Table of Contents CHICAGO BRIDGE IRON COMPANY N.V. 
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Continued 
primarily in 2007 and 2008 and is attributable to losses incurred during those years on two large fixed-price projects that were completed in the first quarter of 2010. Prior to 2007, and
excluding these two projects in 2007 through 2009, our U.K. operations were profitable and have been since completion of the projects. Since December31, 2008, the U.K. NOL DTA has decreased by approximately $37,600, including a decrease of
$17,200 for 2011. In order to realize the U.K. NOL DTA, we will need to generate future taxable income of approximately $162,400. Given NOLs in the U.K. do not expire, and based on our historical and projected profitability for the U.K., we believe
it is more likely than not that we will generate sufficient future taxable income to realize our U.K. NOL DTA. Excluding NOLs having an indefinite carryforward, principally in the U.K., the Non-U.S. NOLs will expire from 2012 to 2021. 
As of December31, 2011, we had U.S.-State NOLs of approximately $6,006, net of apportionment. We believe it is more
likely than not that $4,685 of the U.S.-State NOLs, net of apportionment, will not be utilized and accordingly, a valuation allowance has been placed against these U.S.-State NOLs. The U.S.-State NOLs will expire from 2012 to 2031. 
Unrecognized Income Tax Benefits As of December31, 2011, our unrecognized income tax
benefits totaled $7,374 and we do not anticipate significant changes in this balance in the next twelve months. If these income tax benefits are ultimately recognized, $4,235 would affect the effective tax rate. The following is a reconciliation of
our unrecognized income tax benefits for the years ended December31, 2011 and 2010:  YearsEndedDecember31 2011 2010 Unrecognized tax benefits at the beginning of the year 12,881 21,209 Increase as a result of Tax positions taken during the current period 4,235 3,300 Decreases as a result of Tax positions taken during the prior periods 700 6,320 Lapse of applicable statue of limitations 9,042 Settlements with taxing authorities 5,308 
Unrecognized income tax benefits at the end of the year 7,374 12,881 
We are subject to taxation in the U.S. and various states and foreign jurisdictions. We
have significant operations in the U.S., The Netherlands, Canada, the U.K., Australia, South America and the Middle East. Tax years remaining subject to examination by worldwide tax jurisdictions vary by country and legal entity, but are generally
open for tax years ending after 2003. To the extent penalties and associated interest are assessed on any underpayment of income tax, such amounts are accrued and classified as a component of income tax expense and interest expense, respectively. In
2011, the net decrease in unrecognized tax benefits noted above resulted in a net reversal of associated accrued interest of approximately $3,900. For 2010 and 2009, interest was not significant. For 2011, 2010 and 2009, penalties were not
significant.  16.
