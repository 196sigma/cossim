Basis of Presentation and Accounting Policies Rockwell
Automation, Inc. the Company or Rockwell Automation is a
leading global provider of industrial automation power, control
and information products and services.   
Basis of Presentation Except
as indicated, amounts reflected in the consolidated financial
statements or the notes thereto relate to our continuing
operations. Certain prior year amounts have been reclassified to
conform to the current year presentation. In
September 2004, we sold our FirstPoint Contact business.
FirstPoint Contact is classified as a discontinued operation in
the consolidated financial statements for all periods
presented.   
Principles of Consolidation The
accompanying consolidated financial statements include the
accounts of the Company and its wholly-owned and controlled
majority owned subsidiaries. All significant intercompany
accounts and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.
Investments in affiliates over which we have the ability to
exert significant influence, but that we do not control and are
not the primary beneficiary of, including Rockwell Scientific
Company LLC RSC, are accounted for using the equity method of
accounting. Accordingly, our proportional share of the
respective affiliates earnings or losses is included in
other income expensein the Consolidated Statement of
Operations. Investments in affiliates over which we do not have
the ability to exert significant influence are accounted for
using the cost method of accounting. These affiliated companies
are not material individually or in the aggregate to our
financial position, results of operations or cash flows.   
Use of Estimates The
consolidated financial statements have been prepared in
accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the
United States, which require us to make estimates and
assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and
liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements
and revenues and expenses during the periods reported. Actual
results could differ from those estimates. We use estimates in
accounting for, among other items, customer returns, rebates and
incentives; allowance for doubtful accounts; excess and obsolete
inventory; impairment of long-lived assets; product warranty
obligations; retirement benefits; litigation, claims and
contingencies, including environmental matters; and income
taxes. We account for changes to estimates and assumptions
prospectively when warranted by factually based experience.   
Revenue Recognition We
record sales of products and services, representing
approximately 90percent of our consolidated sales, when
all of the following have occurred: an agreement of sale exists;
pricing is fixed or determinable; collection is reasonably
assured; and product has been delivered and acceptance has
occurred, as may be required according to contract terms, or
services have been rendered. We
recognize substantially all of the remainder of our sales on
construction-type contracts using either the
percentage-of-completion or completed contract method of
accounting. We record sales relating to these contracts using
the percentage-of-completion method when we determine that
progress towards completion is reasonably and reliably
estimable; we use the completed contract method for all others.
Under the percentage-of-completion method, we recognize sales
and gross profit as work is performed using either ithe
relationship between actual costs incurred and total estimated
costs at completion or iiunits-of-delivery. Under the
percentage-of-completion method, we adjust sales and gross
profit for revisions of estimated total contract costs or
revenue in the period the change is identified. We record
estimated losses on contracts when they are identified. 40 Table of Contents NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTSContinued   
1.
Basis of Presentation and Accounting Policies
Continued We
use contracts and customer purchase orders to determine the
existence of an agreement of sale. We use shipping documents and
customer acceptance, when applicable, to verify delivery. We
assess whether the fee is fixed or determinable based on the
payment terms associated with the transaction and whether the
sales price is subject to refund or adjustment. We assess
collectibility based on the creditworthiness of the customer as
determined by credit evaluations and analysis, as well as the
customers payment history. Shipping
and handling costs billed to customers are included in sales and
the related costs are included in cost of sales in the
Consolidated Statement of Operations.   
Returns, Rebates and Incentives Our
primary incentive program provides distributors with cash
rebates or account credits based on agreed amounts that vary
depending on the end user or original equipment manufacturer
OEMcustomer to whom our distributor ultimately sells the
product. We also offer various other incentive programs that
provide distributors and direct sale customers with cash
rebates, account credits or additional products and services
based on meeting specified program criteria. Certain
distributors are offered a right to return product, subject to
contractual limitations. We
record accruals for customer returns, rebates and incentives at
the time of revenue recognition based primarily on historical
experience. Returns, rebates and incentives are recognized as a
reduction of sales if distributed in cash or customer account
credits. Rebates and incentives are recognized in cost of sales
for additional products and services to be provided. Amounts are
accrued at the time of recognition of our sale to a distributor
or direct sale customer. Accruals are reported as a current
liability in our balance sheet or, where a right of set-off
exists, as a reduction of accounts receivable.   
Cash and Cash Equivalents Cash
and cash equivalents include time deposits and certificates of
deposit with original maturities of three months or less.   
Receivables We
record allowances for doubtful accounts based on
customer-specific analysis and general matters such as current
assessments of past due balances and economic conditions.
Receivables are stated net of allowances for doubtful accounts
of $184million at September30, 2005 and
$252million at September30, 2004. In addition,
receivables are stated net of an allowance for certain customer
returns, rebates and incentives of $94million at
September30, 2005 and $78million at
September30, 2004.   
Inventories Inventories
are stated at the lower of cost or market using the first-in,
first-out FIFOmethod. Market is determined on the basis
of estimated realizable values.   
Property Property
is stated at cost. We calculate depreciation of property using
the straight-line method over 15 to 40years for buildings
and improvements, 3 to 14years for machinery and equipment
and 3 to 10years for computer hardware and software. We
capitalize significant renewals and enhancements and write off
replaced units. We expense maintenance and repairs, as well as
renewals of minor amounts. 41 Table of Contents NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTSContinued

Basis of Presentation and Accounting Policies
Continued   
Intangible Assets Goodwill
and other intangible assets generally result from business
acquisitions. We account for business acquisitions by allocating
the purchase price to tangible and intangible assets acquired
and liabilities assumed at their fair values, the excess of the
purchase price over the allocated amount is recorded as
goodwill. Statement
of Financial Accounting Standard SFASNo142,
Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, requires goodwill
and other intangible assets with indefinite useful lives to be
reviewed for impairment annually or more frequently if events or
circumstances indicate an impairment may be present, rather than
amortized as previous standards required. Any excess in carrying
value over the estimated fair value is charged to results of
operations. We
amortize distributor networks, computer software products,
patents and other intangible assets with finite useful lives on
a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives,
generally ranging from 3 to 40years.   
Impairment of Long-Lived Assets We
evaluate the recoverability of the recorded amount of long-lived
assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that
the recorded amount of an asset may not be fully recoverable. An
impairment is assessed when the undiscounted expected future
cash flows derived from an asset are less than its carrying
amount. If we determine that an asset is impaired, we measure
the impairment to be recognized as the amount by which the
recorded amount of the asset exceeds its fair value. We report
assets to be disposed of at the lower of the recorded amount or
fair value less cost to sell. We determine fair value using a
discounted future cash flow analysis or other accepted valuation
techniques. During
2004, we sold a facility in a sale-leaseback transaction with a
third party resulting in a $206million pre-tax loss. The
net cash proceeds from the sale were $190million.   
Derivative Financial Instruments We
use derivative financial instruments in the form of foreign
currency forward exchange contracts and interest rate swap
contracts to manage foreign currency and interest rate risks. We
use foreign currency forward exchange contracts to offset
changes in the amount of future cash flows associated with
intercompany transactions expected to occur within the next four
years cash flow hedges and changes in the fair value of
certain assets and liabilities resulting from intercompany loans
and other transactions with third parties denominated in foreign
currencies. We sometimes use interest rate swap contracts to
manage the balance of fixed and floating rate debt. Our
accounting method for derivative financial instruments is based
upon the designation of such instruments as hedges under
accounting principles generally accepted in the United States.
It is our policy to execute such instruments with creditworthy
banks and not to enter into derivative financial instruments for
speculative purposes. All foreign currency forward exchange
contracts are denominated in currencies of major industrial
countries.   
Foreign Currency Translation We
translate assets and liabilities of subsidiaries operating
outside of the United States with a functional currency other
than the U.S.dollar into U.S.dollars using exchange
rates at the end of the respective period. We translate sales,
costs and expenses at average exchange rates effective during
the respective period. We report foreign currency translation
adjustments as a component of other comprehensive income.
Currency transaction gains and losses are included in the
results of operations in the period incurred. 42 Table of Contents NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTSContinued   
1.
Basis of Presentation and Accounting Policies
Continued   
Research and Development Expenses We
expense research and development RD costs as incurred;
these costs were $1386million in 2005 1217million in 2004 and $1216million in 2003. We
include RD expenses in cost of sales in the Consolidated
Statement of Operations.   
Income Taxes We
record a liability for income tax exposures when they are
probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated. Tax
benefits related to claims are also recognized when they become
probable and reasonably estimable. The determination of
probability and the estimate of the liability or tax benefit
reflect the relevant tax law as applied to us taking into
account the particular country, state, or other taxing
authority.   
Earnings Per Share We
present basic and diluted earnings per share EPSamounts.
Basic EPS is calculated by dividing net income by the weighted
average number of common shares outstanding during the year.
Diluted EPS amounts are based upon the weighted average number
of common and common equivalent shares outstanding during the
year. The effect of stock options represents the entire
difference between basic and diluted EPS. We use the treasury
stock method to calculate the effect of outstanding stock
options. Stock options for which the exercise price exceeds the
average market price out-of-the-money options over the period
have an antidilutive effect on EPS, and accordingly, we exclude
them from the calculation. Antidilutive options for the years
ended September30, 2005 20,013shares, 2004
51,938shares and 2003 1,073,119shares were
excluded from the diluted EPS calculation.   
Stock-Based Compensation We
account for stock-based compensation in accordance with
Accounting Principles Board Opinion No25, Accounting
for Stock Issued to Employees. We grant stock options at
prices equal to the fair market value of our common stock on the
grant dates; therefore we do not recognize compensation expense
in connection with stock options granted to employees. We
recognize compensation expense on grants of restricted stock
during the period of the employees service. 43 Table of Contents NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL

Pro
forma net income for 2005 includes an additional
$49million after tax of compensation expense, recognized
in the second quarter of 2005, for retirement eligible stock
option participants. Previously we reported compensation expense
for these participants over the vesting period. Stock options
granted to retirement eligible plan participants who retire
under our retirement plans on or after the first anniversary of
the grant date continue to vest post-retirement in accordance
with plan provisions and agreements related thereto. If the plan
participant retires less than twelve months from the grant date,
the options under that grant are forfeited. Stock compensation
expense on grants to plan participants who are retirement
eligible on the grant date or who will be retirement eligible in
less than twelve months from the grant date is reported in pro
forma net income over the twelve month period from the grant
date. We report stock compensation expense on grants to plan
participants who become retirement eligible between twelve and
thirty-six months after the grant date in pro forma net income
over the period from grant date to the retirement eligibility
date. Pro
forma net income for 2004 includes $36million after tax
of expense related to performance-vesting options that vested in
the first quarter of 2004 as a result of the market price of our
common stock reaching a specified level for a pre-determined
period of time. Net
income, as reported and pro forma net income in 2004 include
$29million before and after tax of compensation expense
resulting from modifications made to certain stock options in
connection with the sale of our FirstPoint Contact
business. See
Recent Accounting Pronouncements for further discussion of
stock-based compensation. The
per share weighted average fair value of options granted was
$1260 in 2005, $720 in 2004 and $298 in 2003. 44 Table of Contents NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL

Product and Workers Compensation Liabilities We
record accruals for product and workers compensation
claims in the period in which they are probable and reasonably
estimable. Our principal self-insurance programs include product
liability and workers compensation where we self-insure up
to a specified dollar amount. Claims exceeding this amount up to
specified limits are covered by policies purchased from
commercial insurers. We estimate the liability for the majority
of the self-insured claims with the assistance of a third party
actuarial consultant using our claims experience for the periods
being valued.   
Environmental Matters We
record accruals for environmental matters in the period in which
our responsibility is probable and the cost can be reasonably
estimated. We make changes to the accruals in the periods in
which the estimated costs of remediation change. At
environmental sites for which more than one potentially
responsible party has been identified, we record a liability for
our estimated allocable share of costs related to our
involvement with the site as well as an estimated allocable
share of costs related to the involvement of insolvent or
unidentified parties. At environmental sites for which we are
the only responsible party, we record a liability for the total
estimated costs of remediation. We do not discount to their
present value future expenditures for environmental remediation
obligations. If we determine that recovery from insurers or
other third parties is probable, we record a receivable for the
estimated recovery.   
Recent Accounting Pronouncements In
March 2005, the FASB issued Interpretation No47
FIN47 to clarify the guidance included in
SFASNo143, Accounting for Asset Retirement
Obligations. FIN47 requires companies to recognize a
liability for the fair value of a legal obligation to perform
asset retirement activities that are conditional on a future
event if the amount can be reasonably estimated. If amounts
cannot be reasonably estimated, certain disclosures will be
required about the unrecognized asset retirement obligations.
The interpretation must be adopted in the fourth quarter of
2006. We are currently evaluating the interpretation to
determine the effect on our financial statements and related
disclosures. In
December 2004, the FASB issued the revised
SFASNo123, Share-Based Payment
SFAS123R. SFAS123R requires compensation
cost related to share-based payment transactions, including
stock options and restricted stock, to be recognized in the
financial statements. Compensation cost will be measured based
on the grant-date fair value of the instruments issued using an
option pricing model and will be recognized over the requisite
service period. We are required to implement SFAS123R
for our 2006 fiscal year. SFAS123R will apply to all
awards granted after the implementation date and to
previously-granted awards unvested as of the implementation
date. The effect of adoption of SFAS123R is currently
estimated to be approximately $17 to $20million $009 to
$011per share after-tax for 2006. However, our actual

Basis of Presentation and Accounting Policies
Continued In
November 2004, the FASB issued SFASNo151,
Inventory Costs SFAS151. SFAS151 requires
that abnormal amounts of idle facility expense, freight,
handling costs and spoilage be recognized as current-period
charges. Further, SFAS151 requires the allocation of fixed
production overhead to inventory based on the normal capacity of
the production facilities. Unallocated overhead must be
recognized as an expense in the period in which it is incurred.
SFAS151 is effective for inventory costs incurred
beginning in the first quarter of 2006. We do not believe the
adoption of SFAS151 will have a material effect on our
financial statements and related disclosures.

Acquisitions of Businesses   
2005 Acquisitions On
September1, 2005, our Power Systems segment acquired the
assets of Quality Rewind Electric, Inc.s motor
repair and management business based in Ft.McMurray,
Alberta, Canada.   
2003 Acquisitions In
March 2003, our Control Systems segment acquired certain assets
and assumed certain liabilities of Weidmller Holding
AGs Weidmller North American business. In February
2003, our Control Systems segment acquired substantially all of
the assets and assumed certain liabilities of Interwave
Technology, Inc., a consulting integrator focusing on
manufacturing solutions. The aggregate cash purchase price of
these businesses was $257million. Amounts recorded for
liabilities assumed were approximately $10million. The
results of operations of these businesses have been included in
the Consolidated Statement of Operations since their respective
dates of acquisition. Pro forma financial information and
allocation of the purchase price for these acquisitions is not
presented as the combined effect of these acquisitions was not
material to our results of operations or financial
position.

In
September 2002, we entered into an interest rate swap contract
the Swap that effectively converted our $3500million
aggregate principal amount of 615%notes, payable in 2008,
to floating rate debt based on six-month LIBOR. The floating
rate was 623percent at September30, 2005 and
427percent at September30, 2004. As permitted by
SFASNo133, Accounting for Derivative Instruments
and Hedging Activities SFAS133, as amended, we have
designated the Swap as a fair value hedge. Accordingly, the fair
value of the Swap was recorded in other
liabilitiesassets on the Consolidated Balance Sheet with
a corresponding adjustment to the carrying value of the
underlying debt at September30, 2005 and 2004. The fair
value of the Swap, based upon quoted market prices for contracts
with similar maturities, was $63million at
September30, 2005 and $37million at
September30, 2004. On
October26, 2004, we entered into a five-year
$6000million unsecured revolving credit facility.
Borrowings under our credit facility bear interest based on
short-term money market rates in effect during the period the
borrowings are outstanding. The terms of our credit facility
contain a covenant under which we would be in default if our
debt-to-total capital ratio were to exceed 60percent. In
addition to our $6000million credit facility, short-term
unsecured credit facilities of approximately $115million
at September30, 2005 were available to foreign
subsidiaries. There were no significant commitment fees or
compensating balance requirements under any of our credit
facilities. Borrowings under our credit facilities during 2005
were not significant. Interest
payments were $456million during 2005, $409million
during 2004 and $547million during2003. 48 Table of Contents NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL

currency forward exchange contracts provide for the purchase or
sale of foreign currencies at specified future dates at
specified exchange rates. At September30, 2005 and 2004,
we had outstanding foreign currency forward exchange contracts
primarily consisting of contracts for the euro, Swiss
franc 49 Table of Contents NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL

The foreign currency forward exchange contracts are recorded in
other current assets in the amounts of $222million as of

September30, 2004 and other current liabilities in the
amounts of $40million as of September30, 2005 and
$120million as of September30, 2004. We do not
anticipate any material adverse effect on our results of
operations or financial position relating to these foreign
currency forward exchange contracts. We have designated certain
foreign currency forward exchange contracts related to
forecasted intercompany transactions as cash flow hedges. The
amount recognized in earnings as a result of the ineffectiveness
of cash flow hedges was not significant.

Shareowners Equity   
Common Stock At

Preferred Share Purchase Rights Each
outstanding share of common stock provides the holder with one
Preferred Share Purchase Right Right. The Rights will become
exercisable only if a person or group, without the approval of
the board of directors, acquires, or offers to acquire,
20percent or more of the common stock, although the board
of directors is authorized to reduce the 20percent
threshold for triggering the Rights to not less than
10percent. Upon exercise, each Right entitles the holder
to 1/100thof a share of SeriesA Junior Participating
Preferred Stock of the Company Junior Preferred Stock at a
price of $250, subject to adjustment. Upon
an acquisition of the Company, each Right other than Rights
held by the acquirer will generally be exercisable for $500
worth of either common stock of the Company or common stock of
the acquirer for $250. In certain circumstances, each Right may
be exchanged by the Company for one share of common stock or
1/100thof a share of Junior Preferred Stock. The Rights
will expire on December6, 2006, unless earlier exchanged
or redeemed at $001per Right. 50 Table of Contents NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL

Stock Options We
have granted options to purchase our common stock under various
incentive plans and by board action to directors, officers and
other key employees at prices equal to the fair market value of
the stock on the grant dates. The plans provide that the option
price for certain options granted under the plans may be paid in
cash, shares of common stock or a combination thereof. Under
our 2000 Long-Term Incentives Plan, we are authorized to grant
up to 240million shares of our common stock as
non-qualified options, incentive stock options, stock
appreciation rights and restricted stock. Shares available for
future grant or payment under various incentive plans were
approximately 80million at September30, 2005. None
of our employee incentive plans presently permits options to be
granted after November30, 2009. Stock options generally
expire ten years from the grant date and vest over three
years. Information

Retirement Benefits We
sponsor funded and unfunded pension plans and other
postretirement benefit plans for our employees. The pension
plans cover most of our employees and provide for monthly
pension payments to eligible employees after retirement. Pension
benefits for salaried employees generally are based on years of
credited service and average earnings. Pension benefits for
hourly employees are primarily based on specified benefit
amounts and years of service. Our policy with respect to funding
our pension obligations is to fund the minimum amount required
by applicable laws and governmental regulations. We may,
however, at our discretion, fund amounts in excess of the
minimum amount required by laws and regulations, as we did in
2005 and 2004. Other postretirement benefits are primarily in
the form of retirement medical plans that cover most of our
United States employees and provide for the payment of certain
medical costs of eligible employees and dependents after
retirement. The
components of net periodic benefit cost are in millions

Retirement BenefitsContinued During
2005, we recorded an increase to our minimum pension liability
of $4688million resulting primarily from the discount
rate change. Considering the increase of the deferred tax asset
of $1850million resulting from the increase of our
minimum pension liability and the decrease in the intangible
pension asset of $96million, the net decrease to
shareowners equity reflected as an increase in
accumulated other comprehensive loss was
$2934million. Effective
for 2006, we amended our U.S.pension plan to eliminate the
early retirement subsidy for certain employees. The effect of
the amendment is a reduction in the pension obligation of
approximately $70million and a corresponding reduction in
annual pension expense recognized over the average remaining
service life of plan participants. In
2005, we made voluntary contributions of $1500million to
our U.S.qualified pension plan trust, including
$1000million contributed in the fourth quarter. We also
made contributions of $175million to our
non-U.S.pension plan trusts in the fourth quarter of 2005.
In 2004, we contributed $1250million to our
U.S.qualified pension plan trust. The
accumulated benefit obligation for our pension plans is
$2,3571million as of the 2005 measurement date and
$1,7681million as of the 2004 measurement date. We
use an actuarial measurement date of June30 to measure our
benefit obligations and to calculate our net periodic benefit
cost for pension and other postretirement benefits.

As a result of a plan amendment adopted
effective October1, 2002, and in accordance with
SFASNo106, Employers Accounting for
Postretirement Benefits Other Than Pensions, our
postretirement healthcare liabilities were recalculated as of
the date of the amendment using a 65percent discount
rate, the discount rate applicable at the date of the plan
amendment. The related net periodic benefit cost in 2003 of
$291million consists of expense using a 70percent
discount rate for the period July1, 2002 through
September30, 2002 and expense using a 65percent
discount rate for the period October1, 2002 through
June30, 2003.     2
The healthcare cost trend rate reflects the
estimated increase in gross medical claims costs as required to
be disclosed by SFASNo132, Employers
Disclosures about Pensions and Other Postretirement
Benefits. As a result of the plan amendment adopted
effective October1, 2002, our effective per person retiree
medical cost increase is zero percent beginning in 2005 for the
majority of our postretirement benefit plans. For our other
plans, we assume gross healthcare cost trend rate will decrease
to 55% in 2011.     3
Decreasing to 425% in 2011. Effective
October1, 2002, we amended our United States
postretirement healthcare benefit program in to order mitigate
the increasing cost of postretirement healthcare services.
Effective January1, 2004, we began contributing
50percent of the amount in excess of the 2003per
capita amount. However, our calendar 2004 contribution was
limited to a 75percent increase from the 2003per
capita amount. Effective January1, 2005, we limit our
future per capita maximum contribution to our calendar
2004per capita contribution. As
a result of the finalization during 2005 of the rules for the
Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement and Modernization Act of
2003 the Act, we have included an additional reduction in our
accumulated projected benefit obligation of $135million
as of September30, 2005 related to certain Other
Postretirement Benefit plans. A reduction in our accumulated
projected benefit obligation of $169million was included
as of September30, 2004. Net periodic postretirement
benefit cost in 2005 decreased by $20million and is
expected to decrease in 2006 by an additional $1million as
a result of the Act. There was no adjustment to net periodic
postretirement benefit cost in 2004. In
determining the expected long-term rate of return on assets
assumption, we equally consider the historical performance and
the future expected performance for returns for each asset
category, as well as the target asset allocation of the pension
portfolios. We consulted with and considered the opinions of
financial and other professionals in developing appropriate
return assumptions. This resulted in the selection of the 55 Table of Contents NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL

The
investment objective for pension funds related to our defined
benefit plans is to meet the plans benefit obligations,
while maximizing the long-term growth of assets without undue
risk. We strive to achieve this objective by investing plan
assets within target allocation ranges and diversification
within asset categories. Target allocation ranges are guidelines
that are adjusted periodically based on ongoing monitoring by
plan fiduciaries. Investment risk is controlled by rebalancing
to target allocations on a periodic basis and ongoing monitoring
of investment manager performance relative to the investment
guidelines established for each manager. As
of September30, 2005 and 2004, our pension plans do not
own our common stock. In
certain non-U.S.countries in which we operate, there are
no legal requirements or financial incentives provided to
companies to pre-fund pension obligations. In these instances,
we typically make benefit payments directly from cash as they
become due, rather than by creating a separate pension
fund.   
Estimated Future Payments We
contributed $450million to our U.S.pension plan
trust in October 2005. In addition, we expect to contribute
approximately $25million related to our worldwide pension
plans and $302million to our postretirement benefit plans
in 2006. The
following benefit payments, which include employees

FirstPoint Contact In
2004, we sold our FirstPoint Contact business for cash proceeds
and a note convertible into a minority interest in the corporate
parent of the buyer. The value assigned to the convertible note
on the date of the transaction was approximately
$270million. In September 2005, the note was converted to
non-voting equity shares, accounted for under the cost method.
The historical cost value of $270million was used to
value the equity shares at the date of conversion. No fair value
was available for this investment as the equity shares are not
publicly traded. Accordingly, it is not practicable to estimate
that value. The results of operations of FirstPoint Contact for
2003 and 2004, as well as the gain on the sale, are reflected in
Income from Discontinued Operations in the Consolidated

Related Party Transactions We
own 50percent of RSC. This ownership interest is accounted
for using the equity method. Our investment in RSC of
$588million at September30, 2005 and
$575million at September30, 2004 is included in
Other assets in the Consolidated Balance Sheet. We
have an agreement with RSC pursuant to which RSC performs
research and development services for us. We incurred
$28million in 2005, $37million in 2004 and
$30million in 2003 for research and development services
performed by RSC. At September30, 2005, the amounts due to
or from RSC were not significant. At September30, 2004,
the amount due to RSC for research and development services was
$07million. At September30, 2004, the amount due
from RSC for cost sharing arrangements was not significant. We
share equally with Rockwell Collins, Inc. Rockwell Collins,
which owns 50percent of RSC, in providing a
$60million line of credit to RSC which bears interest at
the greater of our or Rockwell Collins commercial paper
borrowing rate. At September30, 2005 and 2004, there were
no outstanding borrowings on the line of credit. In addition, we
and Rockwell Collins each guarantee one-half of a lease
agreement for one of RSCs facilities. The total future
minimum lease payments under the lease are $48million.
The lease agreement has a term that ends in December 2011. We
own 25percent of CoLinx, LLC CoLinx, a company that
provides logistics and e-commerce services. This ownership
interest is accounted for using the equity method. We paid
CoLinx $182million in 2005, $171million in 2004
and $152million in 2003, primarily for logistics
services. In addition, CoLinx paid us approximately
$28million in 2005, $22million in 2004 and
$24million in 2003 for the use of facilities we own and
other services. The amounts due to and from CoLinx at
September30, 2005 and 2004 were not significant.

During
2005, we recognized a net tax benefit of $197million in
income from continuing operations and $216million in
income from discontinued operations related to current and
former businesses. The net tax benefits included in income from
continuing operations are primarily related to the resolution of
claims and other tax matters in connection with the closure of
the federal audit cycle for the years 1998 through 2002. In
addition, these net tax benefits include the effect of the
true-up of estimated tax audit contingency accruals in
connection with closure of the 1998 through 2002 audit. The net
tax benefits included in discontinued operations relate
primarily to the closure of the 1998 through 2002 audit
$75million, a prior year state tax refund of a divested
business $113million and the resolution of various
other tax matters of divested businesses
$28million. During
2004, we recognized tax benefits of $463million in income
from continuing operations and $184million in income from
discontinued operations related to the following items   
$345million resulting from the
resolution of certain tax matters, in part related to former
businesses. A majority of the benefits recognized related to
non-U.S.tax matters in addition to an agreement with a
taxing authority related to the treatment of an investment. Of
this amount, $115million is reflected as a reduction of
the United States income tax provision; $213million is
reflected as a reduction of the non-United States income tax
provision; and $17million is reflected as reduction of
the state and local income tax provision     
$43million related to additional
state tax benefits associated with the U.S.research and
experimentation credit refund claim in 2003 see discussion
below;and     
$259million related to a refund from
the State of California for the period 1989 to 1991. Of this
amount, $75million is included as a reduction in the
income tax provision and $184million is included in
Income from discontinued operations.   During 2003, we recognized in earnings a
tax benefit of $694million related to a federal research
and experimentation credit refund claim for the years 1997
through 2001. Of this amount, $664million is reflected as
a reduction of the United States income tax provision and
$30million is reflected as a reduction of the state and
local income tax provision.

September30, 2004. Total deferred tax liabilities were
$1356million at September30, 2005 and
$1473million at September30, 2004. We
reclassified our tax audit accrual as of September30, 2004
from Deferred income taxes non-current to Other liabilities in
the Consolidated Balance Sheet. The reclassification resulted in
a remaining net non-current deferred tax asset of
$121million at September30, 2004, which is reported
as a non-current asset in the Consolidated Balance Sheet. We
believe it is more likely than not that we will realize current
and long-term deferred tax assets through the reduction of
future taxable income, other than as reflected below for tax
attributes to be carried forward. Significant factors we
considered in determining the probability of the realization of
the deferred tax assets include: aour historical
operating results $2610million of United States taxable
income over the past threeyears, bexpected future
earnings, and cthe extended period of time over which
the retiree medical benefits will be paid. 60 Table of Contents NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL

We
have a valuation allowance at September30, 2005 as noted
above for carryforwards for which future use is uncertain. During
2005, the valuation allowance decreased by $75million as
a result of a basis adjustment in connection with the filing of
the 2004 income tax return related to the sale of FirstPoint
Contact and the recording of a valuation allowance for
non-U.S.net operating losses. We
operate in numerous taxing jurisdictions and are subject to
regular examinations by various U.S.Federal, state and
foreign jurisdictions for various tax periods. Additionally, we
have retained tax liabilities and the rights to tax refunds in
connection with various divestitures of businesses in prior
years. Our income tax positions are based on research and
interpretations of the income tax laws and rulings in each of
the jurisdictions in which we do business. Due to the
subjectivity of interpretations of laws and rulings in each
jurisdiction, the differences and interplay in tax laws between
those jurisdictions as well as the inherent uncertainty in
estimating the final resolution of complex tax audit matters,
our estimates of income tax liabilities may differ from actual
payments or assessments. Cross
jurisdictional transactions between our subsidiaries involving
the transfer price for products, services, and/or intellectual
property as well as various U.S.state tax matters comprise
our more significant income tax exposures. We regularly assess
our position with regard to tax exposures and record liabilities
for these uncertain tax positions and related interest and
penalties, if any, according to the principles of
SFASNo5, Accounting for Contingencies. We
have recorded an accrual of $1031million and
$1117million at September30, 2005 and 2004,
respectively, that reflects our estimate of the likely outcome
of current and future audits and is recorded in Other
liabilities in our Consolidated Balance Sheet. The change in the
accrual reflects a reduction of $346million related
primarily to settlement of the 1998 2002
U.S.federal audit, offset by an increase of
$260million to the accrual for changes in estimates and
additional interest related to previously identified income tax
exposures. A final determination of these tax audits or changes
in our estimates may result in additional future income tax
expense or benefit. 61 Table of Contents NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL

have not provided U.S.deferred taxes on cumulative
earnings of non-U.S.affiliates that have been reinvested
indefinitely. These earnings relate to ongoing operations and at
September30, 2005, were approximately $5100million.
Because of the availability of U.S.foreign tax credits, it
is not practicable to determine the U.S.or state income
tax liabilities that would be payable if such earnings were not
reinvested indefinitely. Deferred taxes are provided for
non-U.S.affiliates when we plan to remit those earnings. Income taxes paid were $1348million during 2005 300million during 2004 and $845million during
2003.

Commitments and Contingent Liabilities   
Environmental Matters Federal,
state and local requirements relating to the discharge of
substances into the environment, the disposal of hazardous
wastes and other activities affecting the environment have and
will continue to have an effect on our manufacturing operations.
Thus far, compliance with environmental requirements and
resolution of environmental claims have been accomplished
without material effect on our liquidity and capital resources,
competitive position or financial condition. We
have been designated as a potentially responsible party at 12
Superfund sites, excluding sites as to which our records
disclose no involvement or as to which our potential liability
has been finally determined and assumed by third parties. We
estimate the total reasonably possible costs we could incur for
the remediation of Superfund sites at September30, 2005 to
be $71million, of which $38million has been
accrued. 62 Table of Contents NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTSContinued   
17.
Commitments and Contingent
LiabilitiesContinued Various
other lawsuits, claims and proceedings have been asserted
against us alleging violations of federal, state and local
environmental protection requirements, or seeking remediation of
alleged environmental impairments, principally at previously
owned properties. As of September30, 2005, we have
estimated the total reasonably possible costs we could incur
from these matters to be $825million. We have recorded
environmental accruals for these matters of $343million.
In addition to the above matters, we assumed certain other
environmental liabilities in connection with the 1995
acquisition of Reliance. We are indemnified by ExxonMobil
Corporation Exxon for substantially all costs associated with
these Reliance matters. At September30, 2005, we have
recorded a liability of $226million and a receivable of
$214million for these Reliance matters. We estimate the
total reasonably possible costs for these matters to be
$350million for which we are substantially indemnified by
Exxon. Based
on our assessment, we believe that our expenditures for
environmental capital investment and remediation necessary to
comply with present regulations governing environmental
protection and other expenditures for the resolution of
environmental claims will not have a material adverse effect on
our liquidity and capital resources, competitive position or
financial condition. We cannot assess the possible effect of
compliance with future requirements.   
Lease Commitments Rental
expense was $880million in 2005; $852million in
2004; and $807million in 2003. Minimum future rental
commitments under operating leases having noncancelable lease
terms in excess of one year aggregated $2065million as of

and certain leases include options to purchase the leased
property.   
Other Matters Various
lawsuits, claims and proceedings have been or may be instituted
or asserted against us relating to the conduct of our business,
including those pertaining to product liability, safety and
health, intellectual property, employment and contract matters.
Although the outcome of litigation cannot be predicted with
certainty and some lawsuits, claims or proceedings may be
disposed of unfavorably to us, we believe the disposition of
matters that are pending or asserted will not have a material
adverse effect on our business or financial condition. We
including our subsidiaries have been named as a defendant in
lawsuits alleging personal injury as a result of exposure to
asbestos that was used in certain components of our products
many years ago. Currently there are thousands of claimants in
lawsuits that name us as defendants, together with hundreds of
other companies. The great bulk of the complaints, however, do
not identify any of our products or specify which of these
claimants, if any, were exposed to asbestos attributable to our
products; and past experience has shown 63 Table of Contents NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTSContinued   
17.
Commitments and Contingent
LiabilitiesContinued that the vast majority of the claimants will never identify any
of our products. In addition, when our products appear to be
identified, they are frequently from divested businesses, and we
are indemnified for most of the costs. For those claimants who
do show that they worked with our products, we nevertheless
believe we have meritorious defenses, in substantial part due to
the integrity of our products, the encapsulated nature of any
asbestos-containing components, and the lack of any impairing
medical condition on the part of many claimants. We defend those
cases vigorously. Historically, we have been dismissed from the
vast majority of these claims with no payment to claimants.
We
have maintained insurance coverage that we believe covers
indemnity and defense costs, over and above self-insured
retentions, for most of these claims. We initiated litigation in
the Milwaukee County Circuit Court on February12, 2004 to
enforce the insurance policies against Nationwide Indemnity
Company and Kemper Insurance, the insurance carriers that
provided liability insurance coverage to our former
Allen-Bradley subsidiary. As a result, the insurance carriers
have paid some past defense and indemnity costs and have agreed
to pay the substantial majority of future defense and indemnity
costs for Allen-Bradley asbestos claims, subject to policy
limits. If either carrier becomes insolvent or the policy limits
of either carrier are exhausted, our share of future defense and
indemnity costs may increase. However, coverage under excess
policies may be available to pay some or all of these
costs. The
uncertainties of asbestos claim litigation and the long term
solvency of our insurance companies make it difficult to predict
accurately the ultimate outcome of asbestos claims. That
uncertainty is increased by the possibility of adverse rulings
or new legislation affecting asbestos claim litigation or the
settlement process. Subject to these uncertainties and based on
our experience defending asbestos claims, we do not believe
these lawsuits will have a material adverse effect on our
financial condition. In
connection with the divestiture of our former aerospace and
defense businesses the AD Business to The Boeing Company
Boeing, we agreed to indemnify Boeing for certain matters
related to operations of the AD Business for periods prior
to the divestiture. In connection with the spinoffs of our
former automotive component systems business, semiconductor
systems business and Rockwell Collins avionics and
communications business, the spun-off companies have agreed to
indemnify us for substantially all contingent liabilities
related to the respective businesses, including environmental
and intellectual property matters. We
have, from time to time, divested certain of our businesses. In
connection with such divestitures, lawsuits, claims and
proceedings may be instituted or asserted against us related to
the period that we owned the businesses. In
many countries we provide a limited intellectual property
indemnity as part of our terms and conditions of sale. We also
at times provide limited intellectual property indemnities in
other contracts with third parties, such as contracts
concerning: the development and manufacture of our products; the
divestiture of businesses; and the licensing of intellectual
property. Due to the number of agreements containing such
provisions, we are unable to estimate the maximum potential
future payments. However, we believe that future payments, if
any, would not be material to our business or financial
condition.

Business Segment Information Continued Among
other considerations, we evaluate performance and allocate
resources based upon segment operating earnings before income
taxes, interest expense, costs related to corporate offices,
certain non-recurring corporate initiatives, gains and losses
from the disposition of businesses, earnings and losses from
equity affiliates that are not considered part of the operations
of a particular segment and incremental acquisition related
expenses resulting from purchase accounting adjustments such as
intangible asset amortization, depreciation, inventory and
purchased research and development charges. Depending on the
product, intersegment sales are either at a market price or cost
plus a mark-up, which does not necessarily represent a market
price. In preparing the segment information, we use accounting
policies consistent with those described in Note1. The
following tables summarize the identifiable assets at
September30, the provision for depreciation and

a net tax benefit of $197million
$010per diluted share primarily related to the
resolution of claims and other tax matters in connection with
the closure of the federal audit cycle for the years 1998

c
special charges of $215million
$142million after tax, or $008per diluted share
associated with realignment of administrative functions and a
reduction of workforce in Europe in our Control Systems segment
and a facility closure in our Power Systems segment. Segment
operating earnings of Control Systems and Power Systems include
these special charges of $165million and
$50million, respectively, for the quarter ended
September30, 2005. The special charges are included in the
Consolidated Statement of Operations for the year ended
September30, 2005 in cost of sales and selling, general
and administrative expenses in the amounts of $94million
and $121million, respectively. We expect that total cash
expenditures after-tax in connection with these actions will
be approximately $114million related to employee
severance and separation costs and will be mostly incurred
during the first half of 2006. Non-cash charges of
$28million after-tax relate to a write-down of property
to its fair value, determined by management using customary
valuation techniques.

Subsequent Events In
November 2005, the Company completed a sale-leaseback
transaction of 24 properties, including the land, buildings and
improvements affixed to the properties. The lease terms vary
from five to fifteen years depending on the property and will be
classified as operating leases. The net proceeds on sale were
approximately $148million, which were used to repay
commercial paper borrowings. Three of the sold properties
resulted in a loss of $20million that will be recognized
in our first quarter of 2006, the remaining properties resulted
in a gain on sale of $36million that will be amortized to
rent expense over the term of the respective leases. The average
operating lease commitment for the first five years is
$12million per year and $10million per year
thereafter. On
October11, 2005, we issued unsecured commercial paper
obligations of $3000million with various maturities of
between 1 and 28days. We used the proceeds to partially
fund a $450million voluntary contribution to our
U.S.qualified pension trust. 68 Table of Contents REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM To the Board of Directors and Shareowners of Rockwell Automation, Inc. Milwaukee, Wisconsin We
have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheet of
Rockwell Automation, Inc. and subsidiaries the
Company as of September30, 2005 and 2004, and
the related consolidated statements of operations, shareowners
equity, cash flows, and comprehensive income for each of the
three years in the period ended September30, 2005. Our
audits also included the financial statement schedule listed in
the Index at a2. These financial
statements and financial statement schedule are the
responsibility of the Companys management. Our
responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial
statements and financial statement schedule based on our
audits. We
conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the
Public Company Accounting Oversight Board United States. Those
standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are
free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a
test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in
the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the
accounting principles used and significant estimates made by
management, as well as evaluating the overall financial
statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a
reasonable basis for our opinion. In
our opinion, such consolidated financial statements present
fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the
Company at September30, 2005 and 2004, and the results of
its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in
the period ended September30, 2005, in conformity with
accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of
America. Also in our opinion, such financial statement schedule,
when considered in relation to the basic consolidated financial
statements taken as a whole, presents fairly in all material
respects the information set forth therein. We
have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the
Public Company Accounting Oversight Board United States the
effectiveness of the Companys internal control over
financial reporting as of September30, 2005, based on the
criteria established in Internal Control
Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring
Organizations of the Treadway Commission and our report dated
November10, 2005 expressed an unqualified opinion on
managements assessment of the Companys internal
control over financial reporting. Deloitte Touche

Controls and Procedures Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures We
carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the
participation of our management, including the Chief Executive
Officer and Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness, as of
September30, 2005, of the design and operation of our
disclosure controls and procedures, as defined in
Rule13a-15e of the Exchange Act. Based upon that
evaluation, the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial
Officer have concluded that our disclosure controls and
procedures were effective as of September30, 2005. Managements Report on Internal Control Over Financial
Reporting We
are responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate
internal control over financial reporting, as defined in
Rule13a-15f under the Exchange Act. Our internal control
over financial reporting is a process designed to provide
reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of our financial
reporting and the preparation of financial statements for
external purposes in accordance with generally accepted
accounting principles. Under the supervision and with the
participation of our management, including the Chief Executive
Officer and Chief Financial Officer, we conducted an evaluation
of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial
reporting based on the framework in Internal
Control Integrated Framework issued by the
Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission
COSO. Based upon that evaluation, management has concluded
that our internal control over financial reporting was effective
as of September30, 2005. Our
assessment of the effectiveness of our internal control over
financial reporting as of September30, 2005 has been
audited by Deloitte Touche LLP, an independent
registered public accounting firm, as stated in their report
that is included below. Because
of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial
reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also,
projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods
are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate
because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of
compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting During
2005, we continued to make improvements to the design and
effectiveness of our internal controls over financial reporting,
including those related to our information technology systems,
as part of a previously existing overall program on internal
control and as part of the process of preparing for compliance
with Section404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002. Some of
these changes, especially to our internal controls related to
information technology systems, could be deemed to have
materially improved our internal control over financial
reporting. We anticipate that we will continue to make
improvements. 70 Table of Contents REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM To the Board of Directors and Shareowners of Rockwell Automation, Inc. Milwaukee, Wisconsin We
have audited managements assessment, included in the
accompanying Managements Report on Internal Control Over
Financial Reporting, that Rockwell Automation, Inc. and
subsidiaries the Company maintained effective
internal control over financial reporting as of
September30, 2005, based on criteria established in
Internal Control Integrated Framework issued
by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway
Commission. The Companys management is responsible for
maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting
and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control
over financial reporting. Our responsibility is to express an
opinion on managements assessment and an opinion on the
effectiveness of the Companys internal control over
financial reporting based on our audit. We
conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the
Public Company Accounting Oversight Board United States. Those
standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control
over financial reporting was maintained in all material
respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of
internal control over financial reporting, evaluating
managements assessment, testing and evaluating the design
and operating effectiveness of internal control, and performing
such other procedures as we considered necessary in the
circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable
basis for our opinions. A
companys internal control over financial reporting is a
process designed by, or under the supervision of, the
companys principal executive and principal financial
officers, or persons performing similar functions, and effected
by the companys board of directors, management, and other
personnel to provide reasonable assurance regarding the
reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of
financial statements for external purposes in accordance with
generally accepted accounting principles. A companys
internal control over financial reporting includes those
policies and procedures that 1pertain to the maintenance
of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly
reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the
company; 2provide reasonable assurance that transactions
are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial
statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting
principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company
are being made only in accordance with authorizations of
management and directors of the company; and 3provide
reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of
unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the
companys assets that could have a material effect on the
financial statements. Because
of the inherent limitations of internal control over financial
reporting, including the possibility of collusion or improper
management override of controls, material misstatements due to
error or fraud may not be prevented or detected on a timely
basis. Also, projections of any evaluation of the effectiveness
of the internal control over financial reporting to future
periods are subject to the risk that the controls may become
inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree
of compliance with the policies or procedures may
deteriorate. In
our opinion, managements assessment that the Company
maintained effective internal control over financial reporting
as of September30, 2005, is fairly stated, in all material
respects, based on the criteria established in Internal
Control Integrated Framework issued by the
Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway
Commission. Also in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all
material respects, effective internal control over financial
reporting as of September30, 2005, based on the criteria
established in Internal Control Integrated
Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring
Organizations of the Treadway Commission. We
have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the
Public Company Accounting Oversight Board United States, the
consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended
September30, 2005 of the Company and our report dated
November10, 2005, expressed an unqualified opinion on those
financial statements and financial statement schedule. Deloitte Touche
