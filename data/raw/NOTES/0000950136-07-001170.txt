Report of Independent Registered Public
Accounting Firm
To Board of Directors and
StockholdersStrayer Education, Inc.
We have completed
integrated audits of Strayer Education, Inc.s consolidated
financial statements and of its internal control over financial
reporting as of December 31, 2006, in accordance with the
standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board United
States. Our opinions, based on our audits, are presented
below.
Consolidated financial statements and
financial statement schedule
In our opinion, the
consolidated financial statements listed in the accompanying index
present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of
Strayer Education, Inc. and its subsidiaries at December
31, 2006 and 2005, and the results of their operations and their
cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended
December 31, 2006 in conformity with accounting
principles generally accepted in the United States of America. In
addition, in our opinion, the financial statement schedule listed in
the accompanying index presents fairly, in all material respects, the
information set forth therein when read in conjunction with the related
consolidated financial statements. These financial statements and
financial statement schedule are the responsibility of the
Companys management. Our responsibility is to express an
opinion on these financial statements and financial statement schedule
based on our audits. We conducted our audits of these statements in
accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting
Oversight Board United States. Those standards require that we plan
and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the
financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit of
financial statements includes examining, on a test basis, evidence
supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements,
assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made
by management, and evaluating the overall financial statement
presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for
our opinion.
As discussed in Note 2 to the consolidated
financial statements, the Company changed the manner in which it
accounts for share-based compensation in
2006.
Internal control over financial
reporting
Also, in our opinion, managements
assessment, included in Managements Report on Internal Control
Over Financial Reporting appearing under Item 9A, that the Company
maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of
December 31, 2006 based on criteria established in
Internal Control Integrated Framework issued by the
Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission
COSO, is fairly stated, in all material respects, based on those
criteria. Furthermore, in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all
material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting
as of December 31, 2006, based on criteria established in
Internal Control Integrated Framework issued by the
COSO. The Companys management is responsible for maintaining
effective internal control over financial reporting and for its
assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial
reporting. Our responsibility is to express opinions on
managements assessment andon the effectiveness of the
Companys internal control over financial reporting based on our
audit. We conducted our audit of internal control over financial
reporting in accordance with the standards of the Public Company
Accounting Oversight Board United States. Those standards require
that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about
whether effective internal control over financial reporting was
maintained in all material respects. An audit of internal control over
financial reporting includes obtaining an understanding of internal
control over financial reporting, evaluating managements
assessment, testing and evaluating the design and operating
effectiveness of internal control, and performing such other procedures
as we consider necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our
audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinions.
A
companys internal control over financial reporting is a process
designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of
financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for
external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting
principles. A companys internal control over financial
reporting includes those policies and procedures that
ipertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable
detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and
44 Table of Contents
dispositions of the assets of the company;
iiprovide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded
as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in
accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that
receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in
accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the
company; and iiiprovide reasonable assurance regarding
prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or
disposition of the companys assets that could have a material
effect on the financial statements.
Because of its
inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not
prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of
effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls
may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the
degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may
deteriorate.

STATEMENTS
1.Nature of
Operations
Strayer Education, Inc. the
Company, a Maryland corporation,
conducts its operations through its subsidiaries, Strayer University,
Inc. the University and Education
Loan Processing, Inc. ELP. The
University is an accredited institution of higher education that
provides undergraduate and graduate degrees in various fields of study
through 47 campuses including two campuses opened for the 2007 winter
term and two opened for the 2007 spring term in Pennsylvania,
Delaware, Maryland, Washington, D.C., Virginia, North Carolina, South
Carolina, Tennessee, Georgia, Florida, Alabama and Kentucky, and
worldwide via the Internet through Strayer University Online. With the
Companys focus on the customer, regardless of whether he or she
chooses to take classes at a physical campus or online, we have only
one reporting segment.
2.Significant Accounting
Policies
Principles of Consolidation
The consolidated
financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its
subsidiaries, the University, ELP, and Professional Education, Inc.
which is currently inactive. All inter-company accounts and
transactions have been eliminated in the consolidated financial
statements.
Cash and Cash Equivalents
Cash and cash
equivalents consist of cash invested in bank overnight deposits and
money market mutual funds. The Company places its cash and temporary
cash investments with high quality credit institutions. The Company
considers all highly liquid instruments purchased with a maturity of
three months or less at the date of purchase to be cash
equivalents.
Marketable Securities
Most of the
Companys excess cash is invested in tax-exempt money market
funds and a diversified, short-term, investment grade, tax-exempt bond
fund to minimize the Companys principal risk and to benefit
from the tax efficiency of the funds underlying securities. As
of December 31, 2006, the Company had a total of
$758 million invested in the short-term tax-exempt bond fund.
The investments are considered
available-for-sale as they are not held
for trading and will not be held to maturity, in accordance with
Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 115, Accounting for
Certain Investments in Debt and Equity Securities. The Company
records the net unrealized gains and losses for changes in fair value
as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income in
stockholders equity. Realized gains and losses from the sale of
marketable securities are based on the specific identification
method.
Revenues
The Companys educational
programs are offered on a quarterly basis. Approximately 97% of
the Companys revenues during the year ended December
31, 2006 consisted of tuition revenue. Tuition revenue is
recognized in the quarter of instruction. Tuition revenue is shown net
of any refunds, withdrawals, corporate discounts, scholarships and
employee tuition discounts. At the time of registration, a liability
unearned tuition is recorded for academic services to be provided and
a tuition receivable is recorded for the portion of the tuition not
paid upfront in cash. Revenues also include textbook-related income,
application fees, commencement fees, placement test fees, withdrawal
fees, loan administration fees and other income, which are all
recognized when incurred.
50 STRAYER
EDUCATION, INC.NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS Continued
Concentration of Credit Risk
The
Company places its cash and temporary cash investments in money market
mutual funds and bank overnight deposits with high credit quality
institutions. Cash and cash equivalent balances are in excess of the
FDIC insurance limit. The Company has not experienced any losses on its
cash and cash equivalents. The Company has also invested its excess
cash in a diversified, short-term, investment grade, tax-exempt bond
fund that is classified under Marketable
Securities.
Tuition receivables are not
collateralized; however, credit risk is minimized as a result of the
diverse nature of the Universitys student base. The University
establishes an allowance for doubtful tuition accounts based upon
historical trends and other information.
Property and
Equipment
Property and equipment are stated at cost less
accumulated depreciation. In accordance with Statement of Financial
Accounting Standards No. 144, Accounting for the Impairment or
Disposal of Long-Lived Assets, the carrying values of the
Companys assets are re-evaluated when events or changes in
circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be
recoverable. If it is determined that an impairment loss has occurred
based on expected undiscounted future cash flows, then a loss is
recognized using a fair-value based model. Through 2006, no such
impairment loss had occurred. Depreciation of property and equipment is
calculated using the straight-line method over the estimated useful
lives ranging from 3 to 40 years. Depreciation and amortization
amounted to $54 million, $66 million and $71
million for the years ended December 31, 2004, 2005 and
2006, respectively.
Purchases of property and equipment and
changes in accounts payable for each of the three years in the period
ended December 31, 2006 in the Consolidated Statements of
Cash Flows have been adjusted to exclude non-cash purchases of property
and equipment transactions during that period. In 2004, non-cash
transactions were included in these line items. This change in
classification had no impact on net increase decrease in cash and
cash equivalents, and is immaterial to prior periods.
Income
Taxes
The Company provides for deferred income taxes based on
temporary differences between financial statement and income tax bases
of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect in the year
in which the differences are expected to reverse.
Advertising
Costs
The Company expenses advertising costs in the quarter in
which incurred, except for costs associated with the production of
television commercials which are expensed when the commercial is first
used.
Long-Term Liabilities
The Company has no debt;
most of its long-term liabilities are for lease incentives related to
the opening of new campuses and for the straight-lining of rent
expense. In conjunction with the opening of some new campuses and other
facilities, the Company was reimbursed by the lessors for improvements
made to those leased properties. In accordance with Financial
Accounting Standards Board Technical Bulletin No. 88-1, these
reimbursements were capitalized as leasehold improvements and a
long-term liability established. The leasehold improvements and the
long-term liability are amortized on a straight-line basis over the
corresponding lease terms, which range from five to ten years. In
accordance with the FASB Technical Bulletin No. 85-3,
Accounting for Operating Leases with Schedule Rent
Increases, the Company records rent expense on a
straight-line basis over the initial term of a lease. The difference
between the rent payment and the straight-line rent expense is recorded
as a long-term liability. See Note 8 below for more
information.

EDUCATION, INC.NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL

Stock-Based Compensation
On
January 1, 2006, the Company adopted Statement of
Financial Accounting Standards No123R, Share-based
Payment FAS 123R, which
requires the measurement and recognition of compensation expense for
all share-based payment awards made to employees and directors,
including employee stock options and employee stock purchases related
to the Companys Employee Stock Purchase Plan based on estimated
fair values. FAS 123R supersedes the Companys previous
accounting under Accounting Principles Board Opinion No25,
Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees APB
25 for periods beginning January 1,
2006. In March2005, the Securities and Exchange Commission
issued Staff Accounting Bulletin No107 SAB
107 relating to FAS 123R. The Company has applied
the provisions of SAB 107 in its adoption of FAS 123R.
The
Company adopted FAS 123R using the modified prospective transition
method provided under the rule, which requires the application of the
accounting standard as of January 1, 2006. In adopting
FAS 123R, the Company used the long-form method for calculating the
accumulated windfall tax benefit. The Companys consolidated
financial statements as of and for the twelve months ended
December 31, 2006 reflect the impact of FAS 123R. In
accordance with the modified prospective transition method provided
under the rule, the Companys consolidated financial statements
for prior periods have not been restated to reflect, and do not
include, the impact of FAS 123R. Stock-based compensation expense
related to restricted stock grants is expensed over the vesting period
using the straight-line method for Company employees and the
graded-vesting method for members of the Board of Directors.
Stock-based compensation expense recognized under FAS 123R for the
year ended December 31, 2006 was $81 million or
$51 million after tax and reduced diluted EPS by
$035.
FAS 123R requires companies to estimate the fair value
of share-based payment awards on the date of grant using an
option-pricing model. The Company has elected to estimate fair value
using the Black-Scholes option pricing valuation model. The value of
the portion of the award that is ultimately expected to vest is
recognized as expense over the requisite service periods in the
Companys Consolidated Statements of Income. Prior to the
adoption of FAS 123R, the Company accounted for stock-based awards to
employees and directors using the intrinsic value method in accordance
with APB 25 pursuant to Statement of Financial Accounting Standards
No123, Accounting for Stock-based Compensation
FAS 123. Under the intrinsic value
method, no stock-based compensation expense was recognized in the
Companys Consolidated Statements of Income for stock options
because the exercise price of the Companys stock options
granted to employees and directors equaled the fair market value of the
underlying stock at the date of grant.
Stock-based compensation
expense recognized in the Companys Consolidated Statements of
Income for the twelve months ended December 31, 2006
included compensation expense for share-based payment awards granted
prior to, but not yet vested as of December 31, 2005,
based on the grant date fair value estimated in accordance with the pro
forma provisions of FAS 123 and compensation expense for the
share-based payment awards granted subsequent to December31,
2005, based on the grant date fair value estimated in accordance with
the provisions of FAS 123R. As stock-based compensation expense
recognized in the Consolidated Statements of Income for the year ended
December 31, 2006 is based on awards ultimately expected
to vest, the amounts have been reduced for estimated forfeitures. FAS
123R requires forfeitures to be estimated at the time of grant and
revised, if necessary, in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures
differ from those estimates. Forfeitures were estimated based on
historical experience.
The Companys determination of fair
value of share-based payment awards on the date of grant using an
option-pricing model is affected by the Companys stock price as
well as assumptions regarding a number of highly complex and subjective
variables. These variables include, but are not limited to, the
Companys expected stock price volatility over the term of the
awards, and actual and projected employee stock option exercise
behaviors.

EDUCATION, INC.NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS Continued
No stock options were granted in 2006. For
the years ended December 31, 2004 and 2005, the

The
dividend yield assumption is based on the Companys history and
expectation of dividend payouts. 2
The
Company analyzed historical volatility of the Companys stock to
estimate the expected volatility. 3
The
risk-free interest rate assumption is based on observed interest rates
appropriate for the term of the Companys employee stock
options. 4
The expected option term
was determined using the simplified method for estimating expected
option life. Net Income Per Share
Basic earnings per
share is computed by dividing net income available to common
stockholders by the weighted average number of shares of common stock
outstanding during the periods. Diluted earnings per share reflects the
potential dilution that could occur assuming conversion or exercise of
all dilutive unexercised stock options and restricted stock. The
dilutive effect of stock options was determined using the treasury
stock method. Under the treasury stock method, the proceeds received
from the exercise of stock options, the amount of compensation cost for
future service not yet recognized by the Company and the amount of tax
benefits that would be recorded in additional paid in capital when the
stock options become deductible for income tax purposes are assumed to
be used to repurchase shares of the Companys common stock. Stock
options are not included in the computation of diluted earnings per
share when the stock option exercise price of an individual grant
exceeds the average market price for the period. At December
31, 2006, the Company had 10,000 issued and outstanding stock
options that were excluded from the calculation. A reconciliation of
shares used to calculate basic and diluted earnings per share is as

of Estimates
The preparation of financial statements in
conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United
States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions
that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date
of the financial statements and the reported amounts of expenses during
the period reported. The most significant management estimates included
allowances for uncollectible accounts, accrued expenses, forfeiture
rates for stock-based awards, and the provision for income taxes.
Actual results could differ from those estimates.

In May
2005, the FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No.
154, Accounting Changes and Error Corrections a replacement
of APB Opinion No. 20 and FASB Statement No. 3
SFAS 154. SFAS 154 requires
retrospective application to prior periods financial statements

determine either the period-specific effects or the cumulative effect
of the change. SFAS 154 also requires that retrospective application of
a change in accounting principle be limited to the direct effects of
the change. Indirect effects of a change in accounting principle should
be recognized in the period of the accounting change. SFAS 154 also
requires that a change in depreciation, amortization, or depletion
method for long-lived, nonfinancial assets be accounted for as a change
in accounting estimate effected by a change in accounting principle.
SFAS 154 is effective for accounting changes and corrections of errors
made in fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2005.
The Company adopted SFAS 154 beginning in the first quarter of
2006.
In July 2006, the Financial Accounting Standards
Board issued FASB Interpretation No. 48, Accounting for Uncertainty
in Income Taxes FIN 48. This
Interpretation prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement
attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a
tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax and penalties,
accounting in interim periods, disclosure, and transition. The
Interpretation is effective for fiscal years beginning after
December 15, 2006. The Company adopted FIN 48 beginning
in the first quarter of 2007. The adoption of FIN 48 is not expected to
have a material impact on its financial condition and results of
operations.
In September 2006, the FASB issued Statement
of Financial Accounting Standards No. 157 SFAS
157, Fair Value Measurements, which defines
fair value, establishes guidelines for measuring fair value and expands
disclosures regarding fair value measurements. SFAS 157 does not
require any new fair value measurements but rather eliminates
inconsistencies in guidance found in various prior accounting
pronouncements. SFAS 157 is effective for fiscal years beginning after
November 15, 2007. Earlier adoption is permitted,
provided that the company has not yet issued financial statements,
including for interim periods, for that fiscal year. We are currently
evaluating the impact of SFAS 157, but do not expect the adoption of
SFAS 157 to have a material impact on our consolidated financial
position, results of operations or cash
flows.

lessors as lease incentives. In 2006, the Company wrote-off $05
million in fixed assets that were fully depreciated and no longer in
service.
5.Restricted Cash
In 2003, as part of
commencing operations in Pennsylvania, the Company was required to
maintain a minimum protective endowment
of at least $500,000. These funds are required as long as the Company
operates its campuses in the state. The Company accounts for these
funds as a long-term asset.
6.Stock Options and Restricted
Stock
In July 1996, the Companys stockholders
approved 1,500,000 shares of common stock for grants under the
Companys 1996 Stock Option Plan as amended, the
Plan. This Plan was amended by the
stockholders at the May 2001 Annual Stockholders Meeting
and at the May 2005 Annual Stockholders Meeting to
increase the number of shares authorized for issuance thereunder by
1,000,000 and 500,000, respectively. A total of 3,000,000 shares have
therefore been approved for grant under the Plan. The Plan was again
amended at the May 2006 Annual Stockholders Meeting to
authorize a one-time exchange of stock options for restricted stock by
employees excluding the five highest compensated executive officers
and to permit restricted stock and cash awards to qualify for favorable
tax treatment under Section 162m of the Internal Revenue Code. The
Plan provides for the grant of options intended to qualify as incentive
stock options, and also provides for the grant of non-qualifying
options and restricted stock to employees, officers and directors of
the Company. Options and restricted stock may be granted to eligible
employees, officers or directors of the Company at the discretion of
the Board of Directors. Vesting provisions are also at the discretion
of the Board of Directors. Options may be granted at option prices
based at or above the fair market value of the shares at the date of
grant. The maximum term of the options granted under the Plan is ten
years.
In February 2006, the Company granted 19,500 shares
of restricted stock to several employees. These shares vest 100%
on February 14, 2010. The Companys stock price
closed at $9127 on the date of the restricted stock grant.
In
February 2006, the Companys Board of Directors approved
cash payments to the holders of vested stock options in an amount
equivalent to the Companys common stock dividend. These cash
payments are to be remitted on the same dates as the Companys
dividends and amounted to $06 million in 2006.
55 STRAYER
EDUCATION, INC.NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS Continued
In February 2006, the
Companys Board of Directors approved a grant of 131,478 shares
of restricted stock to the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. These
shares vest 100% on December 1, 2008 based on the
achievement of certain performance criteria. The performance criteria
categories contained in the grant are covered by the May 2006
amendment to the Plan, so that this restricted stock grant is eligible
for favorable tax treatment by the Company under Section 162m of the
Internal Revenue Code. Expensing of these shares commenced following
stockholder approval of this Plan amendment on May 3,
2006. The Companys stock price closed at $10360 on that
date.
In the second quarter of 2006, the Company granted 32,765
shares of restricted stock to employees in exchange for 105,000 stock
options pursuant to the one-time exchange offer approved by the
shareholders. Of the 11 eligible employees, 10 chose to participate in
the offer. The incremental stock-based compensation expense incurred by
the Company as a result of this offer was immaterial. The
Companys stock price closed at $10360 on the date that the
exchange offer was approved by the shareholders and priced.
In
May 2006, the Companys Board of Directors granted 4,632
shares of restricted stock to various members of the Board of
Directors. These shares vest equally over a three year period. The
Companys stock price closed at $10360 on the date of the
restricted stock grant.
In July 2006, the Companys
Board of Directors approved a grant of 20,192 shares of restricted
stock to the Companys newly appointed President and Chief
Operating Officer. These shares vest 100% on July
25, 2010 based on the achievement of certain performance
criteria. The performance criteria categories contained in the grant
are covered by the May 2006 amendment to the Plan, so that this
restricted stock grant is eligible for favorable tax treatment by the
Company under Section 162m of the Internal Revenue Code. The
Companys stock price closed at $9905 on the date of the
restricted stock grant.
Stock Options
All stock options
granted after 2000 vest over three to four years with exercise prices
ranging from $3369 to $11972. These options expire within six to
eight years from date of grant and had a weighted-average contractual
life of 26 years as of December 31,
2006.

A Convertible Mandatorily Redeemable Preferred Stock
A total of
6,000,000 shares of Series A Convertible Redeemable Preferred Stock,
par value $01, have been authorized. In May 2001, the Company
underwent a $150 million recapitalization and change of control
transaction in which it issued 5,769,231 shares of its Series A
Convertible Mandatorily Redeemable Preferred Stock the
Series A Convertible Redeemable Preferred
Stock of the Company to an investor group consisting
of New Mountain Partners, L.P. and MidOcean Capital Investors, L.P.
formerly DB Capital Partners, Inc. collectively, the
Original Investors. The Series A
Convertible Redeemable Preferred Stock had an effective dividend yield
of 543% and each share of Series A Convertible Redeemable
Preferred Stock was convertible into one share common stock, subject to
adjustment under certain circumstances. The Company used the
$150 million, together with approximately $364 million
of its cash and marketable securities, to repurchase 7,175,000 shares
of outstanding common stock of the Company in a tender offer at $2500
per share open to all shareholders; as the Companys shares had
traded above $2500 per share, only the Companys then CEO and
majority stockholder tendered shares. In March 2004,
31 million outstanding and accrued shares of the Series A
Convertible Redeemable Preferred Stock were converted into shares of
common stock on a one for one basis and sold in a secondary public
offering. The Company received no proceeds from such offering other
than $42 million associated with certain management option
exercises in connection with the secondary offering. In June
2004, the remaining 875,120 outstanding and accrued shares of Series A
Convertible Redeemable Preferred Stock were

lieu of being redeemed for cash, were converted by the holders into
875,120 common shares in accordance with the terms of the Series A
shares. As a result, the Company does not have any preferred shares
outstanding.
8.Long-Term Liabilities
Lease
Incentives
In conjunction with the opening of new campuses
during 2005 and 2006, the Company recorded reimbursements by the
lessors for improvements made to the leased properties in the amount of
$15 million and $12 million, respectively. In
accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board Technical Bulletin
No. 88-1, these reimbursements were capitalized as leasehold
improvements and a long-term liability established. The leasehold
improvements and the long-term liability will be amortized on a
straight-line basis over the corresponding lease terms, which range
from five to 10 years. As of December 31, 2005 and
2006, the Company had deferred lease incentives of $35 million
and $39 million, respectively.
Lease
Obligations
In accordance with the FASB Technical Bulletin No.
85-3, Accounting for Operating Leases with Schedule
Rent Increases, the Company records rent expense on a
straight-line basis over the initial term of a lease. The difference

as a long-term liability. As of December 31, 2005 and
2006, the Company had lease obligations of $28 million and
$38 million, respectively.
