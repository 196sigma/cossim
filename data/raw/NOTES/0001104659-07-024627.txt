INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM
To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of
Canterbury Park Holding Corporation
Shakopee, Minnesota
We have audited the
accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Canterbury Park Holding Corporation
and subsidiaries the Company as of December 31, 2006 and 2005 and the related
consolidated statements of operations, stockholders equity, and cash flows for
each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2006. These consolidated financial statements are
the responsibility of the Companys management.
Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated
financial statements based on our audits.
We conducted our audits
in accordance with standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board
United States. Those standards require
that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether
the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement. The Company is not required to have, nor were
we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial
reporting. An audit includes consideration
of internal control over financial reporting as a basis for designing audit
procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances but not for the purpose of
expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Companys internal control
over financial reporting. Accordingly,
we express no such opinion. An audit
also includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and
disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles
used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the
overall financial statement presentation.
We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
In our opinion, such
consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the
financial position of Canterbury Park Holding Corporation and subsidiaries as
of December 31, 2006 and 2005 and the results of its operations and its cash
flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2006 in
conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States
of America.
As discussed in Notes 1
and 5 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company changed its method
of accounting for stock-based compensation in 2006.

1. SUMMARY OF
SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
Business Canterbury Park
Holding Corporation the Company was incorporated on March 24, 1994. On March
29, 1994 the Company acquired all the outstanding securities of Jacobs Realty,
Inc. JRI from Irwin Jacobs and IMR Fund, L.P. an investment fund for various
pension plans and trusts. JRI was merged into the Company and the acquisition
was accounted for under the purchase method of accounting whereby the acquired
assets and liabilities have been recorded at the Companys cost. The primary
asset of JRI was Canterbury Downs Racetrack and the 325 acres of surrounding
land.
On May 20, 1994, the Company adopted a plan of Reorganization pursuant
to which the sole shareholder of Canterbury Park Concessions, Inc. CPC, and
majority shareholder of the Company, agreed to exchange his shares of CPC stock
for 198,888 shares of the Companys common stock concurrent with the closing of
a public offering. Pursuant to the Plan of Reorganization, CPC became a wholly
owned subsidiary of the Company in August 1994 when the Company completed the
initial public offering of its common stock. This reorganization was treated in
a manner similar to a pooling of interests. Net proceeds received by the
Company from the public offering were approximately $4,847,000, which along
with additional borrowings under the Companys line of credit with the majority
shareholder, were used to pay off the remaining notes payable from the
acquisition of JRI.
The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the
Company, CPC and Shakopee Valley RV Park Acquisition Company, LLC after
elimination of intercompany accounts and transactions.
Revenue Recognition  Our
revenues are derived primarily from the operations of a Card Club, pari-mutuel
wagering on simulcast and live horse races, concession sales and related
activities. Collection revenue from Card Club operations and pari-mutuel
commission and fee revenues are recognized at the time that the wagering
process is complete. Revenues related to wagering activities including
concession and publication sales, and parking and admission fees are recognized
as revenue when the service has been performed or the product has been
delivered.
Estimates The preparation of
the consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles
generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make
estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and
liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of
the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and
expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from these
estimates.
Reclassifications 
Certain prior year numbers have been reclassified to be consistent with current
period presentation. These reclassifications had no effect on net earnings or stockholders
equity.
The Company has reclassified promotional allowances from advertising
and marketing expense to net revenues as of December 31, 2006. Prior periods
were reclassified to be consistent with current period presentation.
In the third quarter of fiscal 2006, the Company has changed its
accounting treatment for presentation of cash flows related to restricted cash.
The Company is now presenting all cash flows related to restricted cash within
the operating activities section of the Statements of Cash Flows rather than
the investing activities section. The Company believes this is a more proper
presentation as it more appropriately reflects the nature of the restricted
cash activities. The Company after considering the nature of this change in classification
and having given appropriate weight to the guidance provided by Staff
Accounting Bulletin No. 99, believed it is sufficient to incorporate this
change in this current and future filings, at which time we will reclassify
prior periods presented, and not treat this change in classification as an
error requiring restatement. 40 The following table presents the affect of the change
in accounting treatment for all fiscal years and interim periods where the cash
flows from restricted cash were previously presented within the investing
activities section of the Statements of Cash Flows

Restricted Cash 
Restricted cash represents refundable deposits and amounts due to horsemen for
purses, stakes and awards, and amounts accumulated in card game progressive
jackpot pools, the Player Pool and Poker Promotional Fund to be used to repay
card players in the form of promotions, giveaways, prizes, or by other means.
Uncashed Winning Tickets  Pari-mutuel tickets which are not cashed within one year of
the end of the respective race meet become the property of the Company. The
Company records revenue associated with the uncashed winning tickets at the
time that, based on historical experience, management can reasonably estimate
the amount of additional winning tickets from a race meet that will be
presented for payment.
Promotional Allowances The Company offers certain promotional
allowances at no charge to patrons who participate in our player rewards
program. The retail value of these promotional items is shown as a deduction
from total revenues on the Companys consolidated statements of operations.
Pari-mutuel Taxes  The first
$12 million of pari-mutuel revenue is exempt from the 6% pari-mutuel tax. Pari-mutuel
taxes are estimated for each 12-month period from July 1 through June 30, and
an estimated annual effective tax rate is applied to all pari-mutuel commission
revenues.
Due to Minnesota Horsemens Benevolent and
Protective Association, Inc. MHBPA The Minnesota
Pari-Mutuel Horse Racing Act specifies that the Company is required to
segregate a portion of funds recorded as purse expense in the statements of
operations, received from card club operations and wagering on simulcast and
live horse races, for future payment as purses for live horse races or other
uses of the horsepersons associations. Pursuant to an agreement with the
MHBPA, the Company has transferred into a trust account or paid directly to the
MHBPA, approximately $7,825,000, $7,575,000 and $7,601,000 for the years ended
December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively, related to thoroughbred races. Amounts
due to the MHBPA are guaranteed by the Chairman of the Board. Minnesota
Statutes specify that amounts transferred into the trust account are the
property of the trust and not of the Company. The interest rates on any purses
accrued but not transferred into the trust were 825%, 725% and 525% at
December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively.
Impairment of Long-Lived Assets  Management of the Company periodically reviews the carrying
value of property and equipment for potential impairment by comparing the
carrying value of these assets with their related expected future net cash
flows. Should the sum of the related expected future net cash flows be 41 less than the carrying value, management will determine whether an
impairment loss should be recognized. An impairment loss would be measured by
the amount by which the carrying value of the asset exceeds the fair value of
the asset. To date, management has determined that no impairment of these
assets exists.
Depreciation Buildings and equipment
are depreciated on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of the
assets, generally 5 to 39 years.
Card Club Accruals Minnesota law allows the Company to collect
amounts from patrons to fund progressive jackpot pools in the Card Club. These
amounts, along with amounts earned by the player pool, promotional pools and
the outstanding chip liability, are accrued as short-term liabilities at each
balance sheet date.
Borrowings - The weighted average
interest rates on short-term borrowings at December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004
were 825%, 725% and 525%, respectively. The weighted average rates for
short-term borrowings for the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004 were
793%, 590% and 423%, respectively.
Income Taxes Income taxes are
accounted for under the asset and liability method. Deferred tax assets and
liabilities are recognized for the estimated future tax consequences
attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of
existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases. Deferred tax
assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates in effect for the
year in which those temporary differences are expected to reverse.
Net Income Per Share Basic net
income per common share is based on the weighted average number of common
shares outstanding during each year. Diluted net income per common share takes
into effect the dilutive effect of potential common shares outstanding. The
Companys only potential common shares outstanding are stock options and shares
of unvested restricted stock.
Comprehensive Income Statement
of Financial Accounting Standards SFAS No. 130, Reporting
Comprehensive Income, establishes standards for reporting and
display of comprehensive income and its components in a full set of financial
statements. Comprehensive income includes all changes in stockholders equity
except those resulting from investments by and distributions to owners. SFAS
No. 130 is not currently applicable for the Company because the Company did not
have any items of other comprehensive income in any of the periods presented.
Fair Values of Financial Instruments Due to
the current classification of all financial instruments of the Company and
given the short-term nature of the related account balances, carrying amounts
reported in the consolidated balance sheets approximate fair value.
Stock Based Employee Compensation
In December 2004, the Financial Accounting Standards Board FASB revised
SFAS No123, Share Based Payment SFAS No. 123R. This Statement supercedes APB
Opinion No. 25, which resulted in no stock-based employee compensation cost
related to stock options if the options granted had an exercise price equal to
the market value of the underlying common stock on the date of grant. SFAS No.
123R requires recognition of employee services provided in exchange for a
share-based payment based on the grant date fair market value. In April 2005
the effective date of SFAS No. 123R was deferred to the fiscal year beginning
after June 15, 2005. Consequently, the Company adopted SFAS No. 123R as of
January 1, 2006. As of the effective date, this Statement applies to all new
awards issued as well as awards modified, repurchased, or cancelled. Additionally,
for stock-based awards issued prior to the effective date, compensation cost
attributable to future services will be recognized as the remaining service is
rendered. The Company elected to apply the modified prospective method of
adoption of SFAS No123R.
SFAS 123R requires the use of a fair value
based measurement method when granting stock options. The Company
selected the Black-Scholes method to measure the compensation cost for stock
options. The Black-Scholes method requires the use of significant assumptions
to estimate the fair value of the stock option awards. The expected term of the
board of director options is equivalent to the historical exercise experience
for these options. The expected term of the key employee options was the term
of the option as the individuals have exhibited a pattern of exercising options
at or near the expiration date. The expected volatility was calculated
primarily with reliance on historical volatility rates. The Company has no
reason to believe that future volatility of the share price over the expected
option term is likely to differ from its past. The Company assumed a dividend
yield equivalent to historical dividend rates over the vesting period. The 42 risk-free rate
utilized in the Black-Scholes calculations was the U.S. Constant Maturity
Treasury Security for the period equivalent to the term of the option.
The fair value of options granted under the 1994 Stock Plan during
2006, 2005 and 2004 were estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes
option-pricing model with the following weighted average assumptions and
results:

New Accounting Pronouncements
In September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 157, Fair Value Measurements, which defines fair value,
establishes a framework for measuring fair value, and expands disclosures about
fair value measurements. The provisions of SFAS No. 157 are effective for
fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2007. The Company is evaluating the
impact the adoption of SFAS No. 157 will have on its consolidated financial
statements.
In June 2006, the FASB issued FASB Interpretation No. 48 FIN 48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxesan
interpretation of FASB Statement No. 109. FIN 48 prescribes a
recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement
recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in
a tax return. The Company must determine whether it is more-likely-than-not that
a tax position will be sustained upon examination, including resolution of any
related appeals or litigation processes, based on the technical merits of the
position. Once it is determined that a position meets the more-likely-than-not
recognition threshold, the position is measured to determine the amount of
benefit to recognize in the financial statements. FIN 48 applies to all tax
positions related to income taxes subject to FASB Statement No109, Accounting for Income Taxes. FIN 48 is
applicable for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2006. The Company has
evaluated the impact and does not expect it to have a material impact on its
consolidated financial statements. 43 2. LAND, BUILDINGS AND

EQUITY
Stock Options The Companys 1994 Stock Plan the Plan provides for the granting of
awards in the form of stock options, restricted stock, stock appreciation
rights, and deferred stock to key employees and non-employees, including
directors of and consultants to the Company and any subsidiary, to purchase up
to a maximum of 1,450,000 shares of common stock. Options that are granted
under the Plan may be either options that qualify as incentive stock options
within the meaning of Section 422 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as
amended Incentive Stock Options, or those that do not qualify as Incentive
Stock Options Non-Qualified Stock Options. The Plan is administered by the
Board of Directors, or a committee designated by the Board, which determines
the persons who are to receive awards under the Plan, the type of award to be
granted, the number of shares subject to each award and, if an option, the
exercise price of each option. The Plan also provides for formula grants of
Non-Qualified Stock Options to non-employee directors of the Company.
The Plan provides that payment of the
exercise price may be made in the form of unrestricted shares of common stock
already owned by the optionee. The Company calculates the fair market value of
unrestricted shares as the average of the high and low sales prices on the date
of exercise. During 2004, the Company purchased and retired 752 shares valued
at $14,364.
Employee Stock Purchase Plan On April 3, 1995, the Board of Directors adopted an Employee Stock
Purchase Plan the ESPP. The ESPP is open to all employees of the Company
working more than 15 hours per week. The ESPP consists of one-year phases. The
phases commence on October 1 of each year and under the terms of the plan
employees were allowed to set aside a portion of their payroll earnings to
purchase shares of the Companys common stock. Prior to the phase which started
October 1, 2005, the purchase price was the lower of 85% of the fair market
value of the shares on the commencement date of each phase or 85% of the fair
market value on the termination date of each phase. Effective with the phase
beginning October 1, 2005 the purchase price is 95% of the fair market value of
the shares on the termination date of the phase. The plan provides for the sale
of up to 350,000 shares. The plan issued 7,501, 31,174 and 29,202 shares in
2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. The ESPP has issued a total of 223,500
shares since the inception of the ESPP.
401k Plan On June 1, 1998 the Company established a defined contribution savings
plan for employees who had completed one year of service, as defined in the
Plan document. The defined contribution savings plan allows for employee
compensation deferral contributions under Section 401k of the Internal
Revenue Code and discretionary contributions by the Company. Employer
contributions charged to operations in 2006, 2005 and 2004 were approximately
$376,000, $128,000 and $113,000, respectively.
Employee Stock Ownership Plan In December 2004, the Companys Board of Directors approved an Employee
Stock Ownership Plan the ESOP effective for calendar years beginning
January 1, 2004. All eligible employees of the Company participate in the ESOP
after completing one full calendar year of service. Contributions to the ESOP
are determined by the Board of Directors and can be made in cash or shares of
the Companys common stock. Annual contributions are allocated to each
participant based on compensation and vest in accordance with a seven year
graded vesting schedule. Compensation expense for the ESOP is determined based
on the average fair value of shares on the date the Company commits to the
contribution to the ESOP. For the purposes of earnings per share, ESOP shares
are included in weighted-average common shares outstanding at year-end as the
shares are committed to be contributed on that date. On December 15, 2006, the
Company committed to contribute 10,000 shares of the Companys common stock
valued at $132,000. The shares were issued in February 2007 and will be
allocated to the accounts of eligible employees based upon their 2006
compensation during the first quarter of 2007. During 2006, the Company
contributed an additional 46 shares valued at $606 for calendar year 2005. For
calendar year 2005 the Company contributed 14,000 shares of the Companys
common stock valued at $197,400. During 2005, the Company contributed an
additional 142 shares valued at $2,023 for calendar year 2004. 45 Stock Repurchase Plan On November 2, 2006 the Company announced that its Board of Directors
had authorized a program to repurchase up to 100,000 shares of the Companys
common stock. On December 6, 2006 the Company repurchased 53,050 shares of
common stock at a price of $1310 per share for a total of $694,955.
5. STOCK-BASED
COMPENSATION
The Plan, an equity based compensation plan, provides for the granting
of awards in the form of stock options, restricted stock, stock appreciation
rights, and deferred stock to key employees and non-employees, including
directors of and consultants to the Company and any subsidiary, for up to a
maximum of 1,450,000 shares of common stock. During the first quarter of 2006
the Company issued non-qualified options to the members of the Board of Directors,

46 2006 Grants
Each member of the Board of Directors receives an annual recurring
grant of 3,000 non-qualified stock options. On February 1, 2006 15,000 options
were granted to the five board members with an exercise price equal to the
market price on the date of grant of $1430. The stock options vest over a six-
month period and expire in ten years. The Company also granted 15,000 incentive
stock options to two executive officers of the Company on February 9, 2006. The
exercise price of these incentive stock options was the market value on the
date of grant of $1455. The stock options vest ratably over a four-year period
and expire in ten years. Shares of restricted stock were granted to key
management -level employees on February 9, 2006. The Company granted 41,000
shares of restricted stock that vest 100% after four years. Employees who
terminate employment prior to the vesting date forfeit their right to the
shares.
The compensation
cost associated with the Board of Director options is $61,200 to be recognized
as expense over the six-month vesting period. The compensation cost associated
with the employee stock option grant is $74,100 to be recognized ratably over
the four-year vesting period. The Company also recognized $7,807 related
to a grant of employee stock options in 2004 which vested in February of 2006. In
accordance with the modified prospective method, the compensation cost related
to the option awards included in salaries and benefits expense for 2006 was
$104,386. As of December 31, 2006, there was $38,722 of total unrecognized
compensation cost related to stock options which is expected to be recognized
over 31 years. The total income tax benefit recognized in the income statement
for stock-based compensation arrangements was $177,000, $310,000 and $350,000
for 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively.

years.
7. LINES OF
CREDIT
The Company has a general credit and security agreement with Bremer
Bank, N.A. Borrowings under the credit agreement include a commercial revolving
credit line, which provides for maximum advances of $2,250,000 with interest at
the prime rate until April 30, 2007. The Company had no borrowings under the
credit line during the year 2006. The credit agreement contains covenants
requiring the Company to maintain certain financial ratios. The Company was in
compliance with these requirements as of December 31, 2006. Management believes
that funds available under this line of credit, along with funds generated from
card club and simulcast operations, will be sufficient to satisfy its liquidity
and capital resource requirements during 2007.
8. OPERATING LEASES
AND COMMITMENTS
In January 2004 the Company entered into a five-year totalizator
services agreement with Scientific Games Inc. formerly Autotote Systems,
Inc. Pursuant to the agreement, Scientific Games provides totalizator
equipment and computer programs which record and process all wagers and
calculate the odds and payoffs. Amounts charged to operations under this
agreement for the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004 were
approximately $342,000, $348,000 and $370,000, respectively. During annual live
race meets, Autotote provides uplink services, which enables the Company to
simulcast horse races held at Canterbury Park to out-of-state racetracks. These
services resulted in amounts charged to operations in 2006, 2005 and 2004 of
approximately $138,000, $137,500 and $135,500, respectively.
The Company has entered into operating leases for rental of office
equipment and equipment to print certain publications. Amounts charged to
operations under these agreements for the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005
and 2004 were approximately $96,000, $162,000 and $170,000, respectively. All
such leases expire on or before April 30, 2010. Future lease payment
obligations under these leases are provided in the contractual obligations
table below. 48 CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS TABLE

borrowings pursuant to our line of credit and were not party to capital lease
obligations, significant purchase obligations or other long-term obligations.
9. CONTINGENCIES
In connection with the purchase of the Racetrack Note 1, the Company
entered into an Earn Out Promissory Note dated March 29, 1994. In accordance
with the Earn Out Note, if i off-track betting becomes legally permissible in
the State of Minnesota and ii the Company begins to conduct off-track betting
with respect to or in connection with its operations, the Company will be
required to pay to the IMR Fund, L.P. the greater of $700,000 per operating
year, as defined, or 20% of the net pretax profit, as defined for each of five
operating years. At this time, management believes that the likelihood that
these two conditions will be met, and that the Company will be required to pay
these amounts is remote. At the date if any that these two conditions are
met, the five minimum payments will be discounted back to their present value
and the sum of those discounted payments will be capitalized as part of the
purchase price in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. The
purchase price will be further increased if payments become due under the 20%
of Net Pretax Profit calculation. The first payment is to be made 90 days
after the end of the third operating year in which off-track betting is
conducted by the Company. Remaining payments would be made within 90 days of
the end of each of the next four operating years.
The Company is periodically involved in various legal actions arising
in the normal course of business. At December 31, 2006, management believes
that the resolution of any legal actions outstanding will not have a material
impact on the consolidated financial statements.
The Company guarantees payment of statutory distributions under a
$500,000 bond issued to the Minnesota Racing Commission.
10. RELATED-PARTY
TRANSACTIONS
The Company paid a total of $50,100 in 2006, $50,100 in 2005 and
$50,052 in 2004 to the Chair and Vice Chair of the Company in consideration for
the services they provided pursuant to consulting agreements. In addition,
another non-employee Board member received $0 in 2006, $25,500 in 2005 and
$32,000 in 2004 for services related to building support for proposed
legislation to provide additional gaming authority to the Company.
11. OPERATING SEGMENTS
The Company has three reportable operating segments: horse racing, card
club, and concessions. The horse racing segment includes simulcast and live
horse racing operations, the card club segment includes operations of the
Canterbury Card Club, and the concessions segment provides concessions during
simulcast and live racing, in the card club and during special events. The
Companys reportable operating segments are strategic business units that offer
different products and services. They are managed 49 separately because the segments differ in the nature of the products
and services provided, as well as processes to produce those products and
services. The horse racing and card club segments are regulated by the State of
Minnesota Racing Commission.
The accounting policies of the operating segments are the same as those
described in the summary of significant accounting policies
Depreciation, interest expense and income taxes are allocated to the
segments but no allocation is made to concessions for shared facilities. The
concessions segment paid approximately 25% of gross revenues on live racing and
special event days to the horse racing segment for use of the facilities in
2006, 2005 and 2004.
