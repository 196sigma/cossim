statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. In our opinion, the financial statements
referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated financial position of ANI Pharmaceuticals, Inc. and

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC
ACCOUNTING FIRM To the Board of Directors and Stockholders
ANI Pharmaceuticals, Inc. and Subsidiary We have audited ANI Pharmaceuticals, Inc.
and Subsidiarys the Company internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2014, based on
criteria established in the 2013 Internal Control - Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations
of the Treadway Commission COSO. The Companys management is responsible for maintaining effective internal
control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included
in the accompanying Managements Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express
an opinion on the Companys internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We conducted our audit in accordance with
the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board United States. Those standards require that we plan and perform
the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all
material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk
that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on
the assessed risk. Our audit also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We
believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion. A companys internal control over
financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and
the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A companys
internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that i pertain to the maintenance of records
that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; ii
provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance
with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance
with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and iii provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or
timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the companys assets that could have a material effect
on the financial statements. Because of its inherent limitations, internal
control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness
to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree
of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. In our opinion, ANI Pharmaceuticals, Inc.
and Subsidiary maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2014,
based on criteria established in the 2013 Internal Control - Integrated Framework issued by COSO. We also have audited, in accordance
with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board United States, the consolidated balance sheets of ANI
Pharmaceutical, Inc. and Subsidiary as of December 31, 2014 and 2013, and the related consolidated statements of operations,
changes in stockholders equity, and cash flows for each of the years in the two-year period ended December 31, 2014,
and our report dated February 23, 2015 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon. s/ EisnerAmper LLP New York, New York

ANI Pharmaceuticals, Inc. and Subsidiary
Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements
For the years ended December 31, 2014 and
2013 1. DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS AND SUMMARY OF
SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES Organization and Business ANI Pharmaceuticals, Inc. and its consolidated
subsidiary, ANIP Acquisition Company together, ANI, the Company, we, us,
or our is a specialty pharmaceutical company, developing and marketing generic and branded prescription products.
ANI was organized as a Delaware corporation in April 2001. At
our two facilities located in Baudette, Minnesota, which have a combined manufacturing, packaging and laboratory capacity totaling
173,000 square feet, we manufacture oral solid dose products, as well as liquids and topicals, including those that must be manufactured
in a fully contained environment due to their potency. We also perform contract manufacturing for other pharmaceutical companies. On June 19, 2013, BioSante Pharmaceuticals,
Inc. BioSante acquired ANIP Acquisition Company ANIP in an all-stock, tax-free reorganization the
Merger Note 2, in which ANIP became a wholly-owned subsidiary of BioSante. BioSante was renamed ANI Pharmaceuticals,
Inc. The Merger was accounted for as a reverse acquisition pursuant to which ANIP was considered the acquiring entity for accounting
purposes. As such, ANIP historical results of operations replace BioSante historical results of operations for all periods
prior to the Merger. The results of operations of both companies are included in our consolidated financial statements for all
periods after completion of the Merger. Our operations are subject to certain risks
and uncertainties including, among others, current and potential competitors with greater resources, dependence on significant
customers, lack of operating history and uncertainty of future profitability and possible fluctuations in financial results. The
accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared assuming that we will continue as a going concern, which contemplates
continuity of operations, realization of assets, and satisfaction of liabilities in the ordinary course of business. The propriety
of using the going-concern basis is dependent upon, among other things, the achievement of future profitable operations, the ability
to generate sufficient cash from operations, and potential other funding sources, including cash on hand, to meet our obligations
as they become due. We believe the going-concern basis is appropriate for the accompanying consolidated financial statements based
on our current operating plan through December 31, 2015. Basis of Presentation The accompanying consolidated financial statements
have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America U.S. GAAP.
Certain prior period information has been reclassified to conform to the current period presentation. Principles of Consolidation The consolidated financial statements include
the accounts of ANI Pharmaceuticals, Inc. and its wholly-owned subsidiary, ANIP. All significant intercompany accounts and transactions
are eliminated in consolidation. Use of Estimates The preparation of financial statements
in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and
liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported
amount of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. In the accompanying consolidated financial statements, estimates
are used for, but not limited to, stock-based compensation, allowance for doubtful accounts, accruals for chargebacks,
Medicaid rebates, returns and other allowances, allowance for inventory obsolescence, valuation of financial instruments and
intangible assets, accruals for contingent liabilities, fair value of long-lived assets, deferred taxes and valuation
allowance, and the depreciable lives of long-lived assets. Actual results could differ from those estimates.   57
ANI Pharmaceuticals, Inc. and Subsidiary
Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements
For the years ended December 31, 2014 and
2013 1. DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS AND SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING
POLICIES Continued Credit Concentration Our customers are primarily wholesale distributors,
chain drug stores, group purchasing organizations, and other pharmaceutical companies. During the year ended December31, 2014,
three customers represented approximately 27%, 21%, and 17% of net revenues, respectively. As of December31, 2014, accounts
receivable from these customers totaled 73% of net accounts receivable. During the year ended December31, 2013, three customers
represented approximately 27%, 18%, and 10% of net revenues, respectively. Vendor Concentration We source the raw materials for its
products, including active pharmaceutical ingredients API, from both domestic and international suppliers.
Generally, only a single source of API is qualified for use in each product due to the costs and time required to validate a
second source of supply. As a result, we are dependent upon our current vendors to supply reliably the API required for
ongoing product manufacturing. During the year ended December31, 2014, we purchased approximately 42% of our inventory
from two suppliers. As of December31, 2014, amounts payable to these suppliers were immaterial. During the year ended
December31, 2013, we purchased approximately 37% of our inventory from three suppliers. Revenue Recognition Revenue is recognized for product sales
and contract manufacturing product sales upon passing of risk and title to the customer, when estimates of the selling price and
discounts, rebates, promotional adjustments, price adjustments, returns, chargebacks, and other potential adjustments are reasonably
determinable, collection is reasonably assured, and we have no further performance obligations. Contract manufacturing arrangements
are typically less than two weeks in duration, and therefore the revenue is recognized upon completion of the aforementioned factors
rather than using a proportional performance method of revenue recognition. The estimates for discounts, rebates, promotional adjustments,
price adjustments, returns, chargebacks, and other potential adjustments reduce gross revenues to net revenues in the accompanying
consolidated statements of operations, and are presented as current liabilities or reductions in accounts receivable in the accompanying
consolidated balance sheets see Accruals for Chargebacks, Rebates, Returns, and Other Allowances. Historically,
we have not entered into revenue arrangements with multiple elements. Occasionally,
we engage in contract services, which include product development services, laboratory services, and royalties on net sales of
certain contract manufactured products. For these services, revenue is recognized according to the terms of the agreement with
the customer, which sometimes include substantive, measurable risk-based milestones, and when we have a contractual right
to receive such payment, the contract price is fixed or determinable, the collection of the resulting receivable is reasonably
assured, and we have no further performance obligations under the agreement. Cash and Cash Equivalents We consider all highly liquid instruments
with maturities of three months or less when purchased to be cash equivalents. All interest bearing and non-interest bearing
accounts are guaranteed by the FDIC up to $250 thousand. We may maintain cash balances in excess of FDIC coverage. We
consider this to be a normal business risk. In conjunction with the Merger, we acquired
restricted cash, none of which remained at December 31, 2013 or 2014.   58
ANI Pharmaceuticals, Inc. and Subsidiary
Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements
For the years ended December 31, 2014 and
2013 1. DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS AND SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING
POLICIES Continued Accounts Receivable We extend credit to customers on an unsecured
basis. We use the allowance method to provide for doubtful accounts based on our evaluation of the collectability of accounts receivable,
whereby we provide an allowance for doubtful accounts equal to the estimated uncollectible amounts. Our estimate is based on historical
collection experience and a review of the current status of trade accounts receivable. We determine trade receivables to be delinquent
when greater than 30days past due. Receivables are written off when it is determined that amounts are uncollectible. We determined
that no allowance for doubtful accounts was necessary as of December31, 2014 and 2013. Accruals for Chargebacks, Rebates, Returns and Other Allowances Our
generic and branded product revenues are typically subject to agreements with customers allowing chargebacks,
Medicaid rebates, product returns, administrative fees, and other rebates and prompt payment discounts. We accrue for these
items at the time of sale based on the estimates and methodologies described below. In the aggregate, these accruals exceed
50% of generic and branded gross product sales and reduce gross revenues to net revenues in the accompanying consolidated
statements of operations, and are presented as current liabilities or reductions in accounts receivable in the accompanying
consolidated balance sheets. We continually monitor and re-evaluate the accruals as additional information becomes available,
which includes, among other things, updates to trade inventory levels, claims data from recent periods, and customer product
mix. We make adjustments to the accruals at the end of each reporting period, to reflect any such updates to the relevant
facts and circumstances. Accruals are relieved upon receipt of payment from or upon issuance of credit to the
customer. Chargebacks Chargebacks, primarily from wholesalers, result
from arrangements we have with indirect customers establishing prices for products which the indirect customer purchases through
a wholesaler. Alternatively, we may pre-authorize wholesalers to offer specified contract pricing to other indirect customers.
Under either arrangement, we provide a chargeback credit to the wholesaler for any difference between the contracted price with
the indirect customer and the wholesaler invoice price, typically Wholesale Acquisition Cost WAC. Chargeback credits are calculated as follows Prior period chargebacks claimed by wholesalers
are analyzed to determine the actual average selling price ASP for each product. This calculation is performed by
product by wholesaler. ASPs can be affected by several factors such as A change in customer mix A change in negotiated terms with customers A change in product sales mix A change in the volume of off-contract purchases Changes in WAC As necessary, we adjust ASPs based on anticipated changes in the
factors above. The difference between ASP and WAC is recorded
as a reduction in both gross revenues in the consolidated statements of operations and accounts receivable in the consolidated
balance sheets, at the time we recognize revenue from the product sale.   59
ANI Pharmaceuticals, Inc. and Subsidiary
Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements
For the years ended December 31, 2014 and
2013 1. DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS AND SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING
POLICIES Continued To evaluate the adequacy of our chargeback
accruals, we obtain on-hand inventory counts from the wholesalers. This inventory is multiplied by the chargeback amount, the difference
between ASP and WAC, to arrive at total expected future chargebacks, which is then compared to the chargeback accruals. We continually
monitor chargeback activity and adjust ASPs when we believe that actual selling prices will differ from current ASPs. Medicaid Rebates We
participate in certain qualifying federal and state Medicaid rebate programs whereby discounts and rebates are provided
to participating programs after the final dispensing of the product by a pharmacy to a Medicaid plan participant.
Medicaid rebates are typically billed up to 135days after the product is shipped. Medicaid rebate amounts per product
unit are established by law, based on the Average Manufacturer Price AMP, which is reported on a
monthly and quarterly basis, and, in the case of branded products, best price, which is reported on a quarterly basis. Our
Medicaid reserves are based on expected claims from state Medicaid programs. Estimates for expected claims are driven
by patient usage, sales mix, calculated AMP or best price, as well as inventory in the distribution channel that will be
subject to a Medicaid rebate. As a result of the delay between selling the products and rebate billing, our Medicaid rebate
reserve includes both an estimate of outstanding claims for end-customer sales that occurred but for which the related claim
has not been billed as well as an estimate for future claims that will be made when inventory in the distribution channel is
sold through to plan participants. To evaluate the adequacy of our Medicaid rebate
reserve, we review the reserve on a quarterly basis against actual claims data to ensure the liability is fairly stated. We continually
monitor our Medicaid rebate reserve and adjust our estimates if we believe that actual Medicaid rebates may differ from our established
accruals. Accruals for Medicaid rebates are recorded as a reduction to gross revenues in the consolidated statements of operations
and as an increase to the Medicaid rebate reserve in the consolidated balance sheets. Returns We maintain a return policy that allows customers
to return product within a specified period prior to and subsequent to the expiration date. Generally, product may be returned
for a period beginning six months prior to its expiration date to up to one year after its expiration date. Our product returns
are settled through the issuance of a credit to the customer. Our estimate for returns is based upon historical experience with
actual returns. While such experience has allowed for reasonable estimation in the past, history may not always be an accurate
indicator of future returns. We continually monitor our estimates for returns and make adjustments when we believe that actual
product returns may differ from the established accruals. Accruals for returns are recorded as a reduction to gross revenues in
the consolidated statements of operations and as an increase to the return goods reserve in the consolidated balance sheets. Administrative Fees and Other Rebates Administrative fees or rebates are offered
to wholesalers, group purchasing organizations and indirect customers. We accrue for fees and rebates, by product by wholesaler,
at the time of sale based on contracted rates and ASPs. To evaluate the adequacy of our administrative
fee accruals, we obtain on-hand inventory counts from the wholesalers. This inventory is multiplied by the ASPs to arrive at total
expected future sales, which is then multiplied by contracted rates. The result is then compared to the administrative fee accruals.
We continually monitor administrative fee activity and adjust our accruals when we believe that actual administrative fees will
differ from the accruals. Accruals for administrative fees and other rebates are recorded as a reduction in both gross revenues
in the consolidated statements of operations and accounts receivable in the consolidated balance sheets.   60

$471 Inventories Inventories consist of raw materials, packaging
materials, work-in-progress, and finished goods. Inventories are stated
at the lower of standard cost or net realizable value. We periodically review and adjust standard costs, which generally approximate
weighted average cost. Property and Equipment Property and equipment are recorded at cost.
Expenditures for repairs and maintenance are charged to expense as incurred. Depreciation is recorded on a straight-line basis
over estimated useful lives as follows   Buildings and improvements
20 - 40years
Machinery, furniture and equipment
3 - 10years Construction in progress includes the cost
of construction and other direct costs attributable to the construction, along with capitalized interest, if any. Depreciation
is not recorded on construction in progress until such time as the assets are placed in service. We review
property and equipment for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset
may not be recoverable. Recoverability of the long-lived asset is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of the asset
to future undiscounted net cash flows expected to be generated by the asset. If such assets are considered to be impaired, the
impairment to be recognized is measured by the amount by which the carrying amount of the assets exceeds the estimated fair value
of the assets. Assets held for disposal are reportable at the lower
of the carrying amount or fair value, less costs to sell. We determined that no assets were impaired and no assets were held for
disposal as of December31, 2014 and 2013.   61

DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS AND SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES Continued Intangible Assets Intangible assets were acquired as part of
the Merger and several asset acquisition transactions. These assets include product rights for the 31 previously marketed generic
products we acquired from Teva, product rights for our branded products Lithobid and Vancocin, fully amortized product
rights for Reglan and a generic product, and the Teva license related to our male testosterone gel. These intangible assets originally
were recorded at fair value and are stated net of accumulated amortization. The rights and licenses are amortized over
their remaining estimated useful lives, ranging from 2 to 11years, based on the straight-line method. Management reviews
definite-lived intangible assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may
not be recoverable, in a manner similar to that for property and equipment. Goodwill Goodwill relates to the Merger and represents
the excess of the total purchase consideration over the fair value of acquired assets and assumed liabilities, using the purchase
method of accounting. Goodwill is not amortized, but is subject to periodic review for impairment. Goodwill is reviewed annually,
as of October31, and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the goodwill might
not be recoverable. We perform our review of goodwill on our one reporting unit. Before
employing detailed impairment testing methodologies, we first evaluate the likelihood of impairment by considering
qualitative factors relevant to our reporting unit. When performing the qualitative assessment, we evaluate events and
circumstances that would affect the significant inputs used to determine the fair value of the goodwill. Events and
circumstances evaluated include: macroeconomic conditions that could affect us, industry and market considerations for the
generic pharmaceutical industry that could affect us, cost factors that could affect our performance, our financial
performance including share price, and consideration of any company-specific events that could negatively affect us, our
business, or the fair value of our business. If we determine that it is more likely than not that goodwill is impaired, we will then
apply detailed testing methodologies. Otherwise, we will conclude that no impairment has occurred. Detailed
impairment testing involves comparing the fair value of our one reporting unit to its carrying value, including goodwill. Fair
value reflects the price a market participant would be willing to pay in a potential sale of ANI. If the fair value exceeds carrying
value, then it is concluded that no goodwill impairment has occurred. If the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeds its
fair value, a second step is required to measure possible goodwill impairment loss. The second step includes hypothetically valuing
the tangible and intangible assets and liabilities of our one reporting unit as if it had been acquired in a business combination.
Then, the implied fair value of our one reporting unit goodwill is compared to the carrying value of that goodwill. If the carrying
value of our one reporting unit goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of the goodwill, we recognize an impairment loss in
an amount equal to the excess, not to exceed the carrying value.   62

Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements
For the years ended December 31, 2014 and
2013 1.DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS AND SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES Continued Collaborative Arrangements At times, we have entered into arrangements with various commercial
partners to further business opportunities. In collaborative arrangements such as these, when we are actively involved and exposed
to the risks and rewards of the activities and are determined to be the principal participant in the collaboration, we classify
third party costs incurred and revenues in the consolidated statements of operations on a gross basis.
Otherwise, third party revenues and costs generated by collaborative arrangements are presented on a net basis. Payments between
us and the other participants are recorded and classified based on the nature of the payments. Research and Development Expenses Research and development costs are expensed
as incurred and primarily consist of expenses relating to product development. Research and development costs totaled $27 million
and $17 million for the years ended December31, 2014 and 2013, respectively. Stock-Based Compensation We
have a stock-based compensation plan that includes stock options and restricted stock, which are awarded in exchange for
employee and non-employee director services. We recognize the estimated fair value of stock-based awards and classify the
expense where the underlying salaries are classified. For the year ended December 31, 2014, $01 million of expense related
to stock-based awards was classified as cost of goods sold, $01 million was classified as research and development expense
and $32 million was classified as sales, general and administrative expense in the accompanying consolidated statements of
operations. For the year ended December 31, 2013, all stock-based awards were classified as sales, general and administrative
expense in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations. Stock-based compensation cost for stock options is
determined at the grant date using an option pricing model and stock-based compensation cost for restricted stock is based on
the closing market price of the stock at the grant date. The value of the award that is ultimately expected to vest is
recognized as expense on a straight-line basis over the employee requisite service period. Valuation
of stock awards requires us to make assumptions and to apply judgment to determine the fair value of the awards. These assumptions
and judgments include estimating the future volatility of our stock price, dividend yields, future employee turnover rates, and
future employee stock option exercise behaviors. Changes in these assumptions can affect the fair value estimate. Income Taxes We use the asset and liability method of accounting
for income taxes. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based
on differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities and are measured using the enacted tax rates
and laws that are expected to be in effect when the differences are expected to reverse. The effect on deferred tax assets and
liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in the period that such tax rate changes are enacted. The measurement of a deferred
tax asset is reduced, if necessary, by a valuation allowance if it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred
tax asset will not be realized. We calculate income tax benefits related to stock-based compensation arrangements using
the with and without method. We use a
recognition threshold and a measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of tax positions taken
or expected to be taken in a tax return. For those benefits to be recognized, a tax position must be more-likely-than-not to be
sustained upon examination by taxing authorities. We have not identified any uncertain income tax positions that could have a material
impact to the consolidated financial statements. We are subject to taxation in various jurisdictions in the U.S. and remain subject
to examination by taxing jurisdictions for the years 1998 and all subsequent periods due to the availability of net operating loss
carryforwards.   63

Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements
For the years ended December 31, 2014 and
2013 1. DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS AND SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING
POLICIES Continued We recognize interest and penalties accrued
on any unrecognized tax exposures as a component of income tax expense. We did not have any such amounts accrued as of December31,
2014 and 2013. We consider potential tax effects resulting
from discontinued operations and record intra-period tax allocations, when those effects are deemed material. Earnings/Loss per Share Basic earnings/loss per share is computed
by dividing net income/loss available to common shareholders by the weighted-average number of shares of common stock outstanding
during the period. Our unvested restricted shares and certain
of our outstanding warrants contain non-forfeitable rights to dividends, and therefore are considered to be participating securities;
the calculation of basic and diluted earnings/loss per share excludes from the numerator net income but not net loss attributable
to the unvested restricted shares and to the participating warrants, and excludes the impact of those shares from the denominator. For purposes of determining
diluted earnings/loss per share, we have elected a policy to assume that the principal portion of the Notes see Note 3 is settled
in cash. As such, the principal portion of the Notes has no effect on either the numerator or denominator when determining diluted
earnings/loss per share. Any conversion gain is assumed to be settled in shares and is incorporated in diluted earnings/loss
per share using the treasury method. The warrants issued in conjunction with the issuance of the Notes see Note 3 are considered
to be dilutive when they are in-the-money relative to our average stock price during the period; the bond hedge purchased in conjunction
with the issuance of the Notes is always considered to be anti-dilutive. For periods of net income, and when the effects
are not anti-dilutive, we calculate diluted earnings per share by dividing net income available to common shareholders by the weighted-average
number of shares outstanding plus the impact of all potential dilutive common shares, consisting primarily of common stock options,
unvested restricted stock awards, stock purchase warrants, and any conversion gain on our 30% Convertible Senior Notes due December
1, 2019 the Notes, see Note 3, using the treasury stock method. For periods of net loss, diluted loss per share
is calculated similarly to basic loss per share.   64

and the impact of the potential common shares would be anti-dilutive. The
number of anti-dilutive shares, which have been excluded from the computation of diluted earnings loss per share and which include
the shares underlying the Notes, were 47 million and 27 million for the years ended December31, 2014 and 2013. As

awards, and 25 million warrants exercisable for common stock outstanding. Stock Splits and Other Reclassifications In July 2013, our Board of Directors and stockholders
approved a resolution to effect a one-for-six reverse stock split of our common stock and Class C Special stock with no corresponding
change to the par values. The number of authorized shares of common stock, Class C Special stock and blank check preferred stock
was reduced proportionally. Common stock and Class C Special stock
for all periods presented have been adjusted retrospectively to reflect the one-for-six reverse stock split.   65

For the years ended December 31, 2014 and

POLICIES Continued Fair Value of Financial Instruments Our
consolidated balance sheets
include various financial instruments primarily cash and cash equivalents, prepaid expenses, accounts receivable, accounts payable,
accrued expenses, and other current liabilities that are carried at cost and that approximate fair value. The fair value of our
long-term indebtedness is estimated based on the quoted prices for the same or similar issues, or on the current rates we have
been offered for debt of the same remaining maturities. Fair value is the price that would be received from the sale of an asset
or paid to transfer a liability assuming an orderly transaction in the most advantageous market at the measurement date. U.S.GAAP
establishes a hierarchical disclosure framework which prioritizes and ranks the level of observability of inputs used in measuring
fair value. These tiers include Level1Quoted prices unadjusted in active markets that
are accessible at the measurement date for identical assets or liabilities. The fair value hierarchy gives the highest priority
to Level1 inputs. Level2Observable market-based inputs other than quoted
prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. Level3Unobservable inputs are used when little or no market
data is available. The fair value hierarchy gives the lowest priority to Level3 inputs. See Note7 for additional information regarding
fair value. Segment Information We currently operate in a single business segment. Recent Accounting Pronouncements In August 2014, the
FASB issued guidance requiring management to evaluate on a regular basis whether any conditions or events have arisen
that could raise substantial doubt about the entitys ability to continue as a going concern. The guidance 1 provides
a definition for the term substantial doubt, 2 requires an evaluation every reporting period, interim periods
included, 3 provides principles for considering the mitigating effect of managements plans to alleviate the
substantial doubt, 4 requires certain disclosures if the substantial doubt is alleviated as a result of managements
plans, 5 requires an express statement, as well as other disclosures, if the substantial doubt is not alleviated, and 6
requires an assessment period of one year from the date the financial statements are issued. The standard is effective for
our reporting year beginning January 1, 2017 and early adoption is permitted. We do not expect the adoption of this standard
to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. In May 2014, the FASB issued guidance for revenue
recognition for contracts, superseding the previous revenue recognition requirements, along with most existing industry-specific
guidance. The guidance requires an entity to review contracts in five steps: 1 identify the contract, 2 identify performance
obligations, 3 determine the transaction price, 4 allocate the transaction price, and 5 recognize revenue. The new standard
will result in enhanced disclosures regarding the nature, amount, timing and uncertainty of revenue arising from contracts with
customers. The standard is effective for our reporting year beginning January 1, 2017 and early adoption is not permitted. We are
currently evaluating the impact, if any, that this standard will have on our consolidated financial statements.   66

Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements
For the years ended December 31, 2014 and
2013 1. DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS AND SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING
POLICIES Continued In July
2013, the Financial Accounting Standards Board FASB issued guidance for the presentation of an unrecognized tax
benefit when a net operating loss NOL carryforward, a similar tax loss, or a tax credit carryforward exists. The
guidance requires an entity to present in the financial statements an unrecognized tax benefit, or a portion of an unrecognized
tax benefit, as a reduction to a deferred tax asset for an NOL carryforward, a similar tax loss, or a tax credit carryforward.
If the NOL carryforward, a similar tax loss, or a tax credit carryforward is not available at the reporting date under the tax
law of the jurisdiction or the tax law of the jurisdiction does not require the entity to use, and the entity does not intend to
use, the deferred tax asset for such purpose, the unrecognized tax benefit will be presented in the financial statements as a liability
and will not be combined with deferred tax assets. This guidance does not require any additional recurring disclosures and is effective
for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2013. The adoption of this standard in 2014 did not have a material impact on our
consolidated financial statements. We have evaluated all other issued and unadopted
Accounting Standards Updates and believe the adoption of these standards will not have a material impact on its consolidated results
of operations, financial position, or cash flows. 2. BUSINESS COMBINATION On June 19, 2013, BioSante acquired ANIP in
an all-stock, tax-free reorganization. We are operating under the leadership of the ANIP management team and the board of directors
is comprised of two former directors from BioSante and five former ANIP directors. BioSante issued to ANIP stockholders shares
of BioSante common stock such that the ANIP stockholders owned 57% of the combined companys shares outstanding, and the
former BioSante stockholders owned 43%. In addition, immediately prior to the Merger, BioSante distributed to its then current
stockholders contingent value rights CVR providing payment rights arising from a future sale, transfer, license
or similar transactions involving BioSantes LibiGel female testosterone gel. The Merger was accounted for as a reverse acquisition
pursuant to which ANIP was considered the acquiring entity for accounting purposes. As such, ANIP historical results of operations
replace BioSante historical results of operations for all periods prior to the Merger. BioSante, the accounting acquiree, was
a publicly-traded pharmaceutical company focused on developing high value, medically-needed products. ANIP entered into the Merger
to secure additional capital and gain access to capital market opportunities as a public company. The results of operations of both companies
are included in our consolidated financial statements for all periods after completion of the Merger. Transaction Costs In conjunction with the Merger, we incurred
approximately $71 million in transaction costs, which were expensed in the periods in which they were incurred. These costs include   Category

used in determining the purchase price was $122 per share, the closing price on June 19, 2013, which resulted in a total purchase
consideration of $298 million. The fair value of all additional consideration, including the vested BioSante stock options and
CVRs, was immaterial. The following presents the final allocation of the purchase consideration to the assets acquired and liabilities

and relates primarily to intangible assets that do not qualify for separate recognition. As a result of purchase accounting related
to the Merger, we established deferred tax assets of $96 million, deferred tax liabilities of $39 million, and a valuation allowance
of $57 million, netting to deferred tax assets of $0. Former BioSante operations generated no revenue
and no expense in the year ended December 31, 2014. Former BioSante operations generated $05 million of revenue in a non-recurring

of our Notes in a registered public offering. After deducting the underwriting discounts and commissions and other expenses including
the net cost of the bond hedge and warrant, discussed below, the net proceeds from the offering were approximately $1226 million.
The Notes pay 30% interest semi-annually in arrears on June1 and December 1 of each year, starting on June 1, 2015 and are
due December 1, 2019. The Notes are convertible into 2,068,793 shares of common stock, based on an initial conversion price of
$6948 per share. The Notes are convertible at the option of
the holder i during any calendar quarter beginning after March 31, 2015, if the last reported sale price of the common stock
for at least 20 trading days whether or not consecutive during a period of 30 consecutive trading days ending on the last trading
day of the immediately preceding calendar quarter is greater than or equal to 130% of the conversion price on each applicable trading
day, ii during the five business days after any five consecutive trading day period in which the trading price per $1,000 principal
amount of the Notes for each trading day of such period was less than 98% of the product of the last reported sale price of our
common stock and the conversion rate on each such trading day; and iii on or after June 1, 2019 until the second scheduled trading
day immediately preceding the maturity date. Upon conversion by the holders, we may
elect to settle such conversion in shares of our common stock, cash, or a combination thereof. As a result of our cash
conversion option, we separately accounted for the value of the embedded conversion option as a debt discount with an offset
to APIC of $336 million. The value of the embedded conversion option was determined based on the estimated fair value of
the debt without the conversion feature, which was determined using market comparables to estimate the fair value of
similar non-convertible debt see Note 7; the debt discount is being amortized as additional non-cash interest expense using
the effective interest method over the term of the Notes. Offering costs of $55 million have been
allocated to the debt and equity components in proportion to the allocation of proceeds to the components, as deferred
financing costs and equity issuance costs, respectively. The deferred financing costs of $42 million are being amortized as
additional non-cash interest expense using the straight-line method over the term of the debt, since this method was not
significantly different from the effective interest method. The $13 million portion allocated to equity issuance costs
was charged to APIC.   69

to simultaneously enter into bond hedge or purchased call and warrant or written call transactions
with an affiliate of one of the offering underwriters collectively, the Call Option Overlay. We entered into the
Call Option Overlay to synthetically raise the initial conversion price of the Notes to $9621 per share and reduce the potential
common stock dilution that may arise from the conversion of the Notes. The exercise price of the bond hedge is $6948 per share,
with an underlying 2,068,792 common shares; the exercise price of the warrant is $9621 per share of our common stock, also with
an underlying 2,068,792 common shares. Because the bond hedge and warrant are both indexed to our common stock and otherwise would
be classified as equity, we recorded both elements as equity, resulting in a net reduction to APIC of $156 million. The carrying value of

goodwill of $18 million in our one reporting unit. We assess the recoverability of the carrying value of goodwill on an annual
basis as of October 31 of each year, and whenever events occur or circumstances changes that would, more likely than not, reduce
the fair value of our reporting unit below its carrying value. For the goodwill impairment analysis performed
at October 31, 2014, we performed a qualitative assessment to determine whether it was more likely than not that our goodwill asset
was impaired in order to determine the necessity of performing a quantitative impairment test, under which management would calculate
the assets fair value. When performing the qualitative assessment, we evaluate events and circumstances that would affect
the significant inputs used to determine the fair value of the goodwill. Events and circumstances evaluated include: macroeconomic
conditions that could affect us, industry and market considerations for the generic pharmaceutical industry that could affect us,
cost factors that could affect our performance, our financial performance including share price, and consideration of any company-specific
events that could negatively affect us, our business, or our fair value. Based on our assessment of the aforementioned factors,
it was determined that it was more likely than not that the fair value of our one reporting unit is greater than its carrying amount
as of October 31, 2014, and therefore no quantitative testing for impairment was required. In addition to the qualitative impairment analysis
performed at October 31, 2014, there were no events or changes in circumstances that could have reduced the fair value of our reporting
unit below its carrying value from October 31, 2014 to December 31, 2014. No impairment loss was recognized during the years ended
December 31, 2014 and 2013, and the gross and net balance of goodwill was $18 million as of December 31, 2014 and 2013.   71

to purchase the Teva Purchase Agreement Abbreviated New Drug Applications ANDAs to produce 31 generic
drug products from Teva Pharmaceuticals Teva for $125 million in cash and a percentage of future gross profits
from product sales. According to the terms of the Teva Purchase Agreement, Teva was required to provide soft copy materials and
transfer ownership of the ANDAs to us within five business days of signing the Teva Purchase Agreement, and we were required to
pay the first installment of $85 million upon receipt thereof. Teva provided the soft copy materials and transferred ownership
of the ANDAs to us on January 2, 2014 and we paid the first installment of $85 million to Teva on January 2, 2014. Teva was also
required to provide hard copy materials to us within 90 days of signing the Teva Purchase Agreement. Teva provided the hard copy
materials on March 5, 2014 and we paid the $40 million balance on March 6, 2014. The drug products include 20 solid-oral immediate
release products, four extended release products and seven liquid products. The ANDAs are being amortized in full over their useful
lives, averaging 10 years. Acquisition of Lithobid Product Rights In July 2014, we entered into an agreement
to purchase the Lithobid Purchase Agreement the product rights to Lithobid from Noven Therapeutics, LLC Noven
for $110 million in cash at closing, and $10 million in cash if certain approvals are received from the FDA on or before June
30, 2015. This $10 million contingent payment was paid in January 2015 and is included in accounts payable at December 31, 2014
in the consolidated balance sheet. Pursuant to the terms of the Lithobid Purchase Agreement, we acquired the intellectual property
rights and NDA associated with Lithobid, as well as a small amount of raw material inventory. The $120 million product rights
intangible asset is being amortized over its estimated useful life of 10 years. Acquisition of Vancocin Product Rights In August 2014, we entered into an agreement
to purchase the Vancocin Purchase Agreement the product rights to Vancocin from Shire ViroPharma Incorporated Shire
for $110 million in cash at closing. Pursuant to the terms of the Vancocin Purchase Agreement, we acquired the U.S. intellectual
property rights and NDA associated with Vancocin, two related ANDAs, and certain equipment and inventory. The $105 million product
rights intangible asset is being amortized over its estimated useful life of 10 years. Definite-lived Intangible Assets The components of net definite-lived intangible assets

from the sale of an asset or paid to transfer a liability assuming an orderly transaction in the most advantageous market at the
measurement date. U.S.GAAP establishes a hierarchical disclosure framework which prioritizes and ranks the level of observability
of inputs used in measuring fair value. Financial Assets and Liabilities Measured at Fair Value on a
Recurring Basis The inputs used in measuring the fair value
of cash and cash equivalents are considered to be Level1 in accordance with the three-tier fair value hierarchy. The fair
market values are based on period-end statements supplied by the various banks and brokers that held the majority of our funds. Our CVRs Note 2 are considered to be contingent
consideration and are classified as liabilities. As such, the CVRs were recorded as purchase consideration at their estimated fair
value, using Level 3 inputs, and are marked to market each reporting period until settlement. The fair value of CVRs is estimated
using the present value of managements projection of the expected payments pursuant to the terms of the CVR agreement, which
is the primary unobservable input. If our projection or expected payments were to increase substantially, the value of the CVRs
could increase as a result. The present value of the liability was calculated using a discount rate of 15%. We determined that
the fair value of the CVRs was immaterial as of December 31, 2014 and 2013. We also determined that the changes in such fair value
were immaterial, for the year ended December 31, 2014 and period from the date of the Merger to December 31, 2013.   73

Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements
For the years ended December 31, 2014 and
2013 7. FAIR VALUE DISCLOSURES Continued Prior to the Merger, ANIPs warrants
to purchase common and preferred stock were classified as derivative liabilities and were measured at fair value using level3
inputs. The fair value of stock purchase warrants was determined using a two-step process that included valuing ANIP equity using
both market and discounted cash flow methods, and then apportioning that value, using an equity allocation model, to each of ANIP
classes of stock. These models require the use of unobservable inputs such as fair value of ANIP common and preferred stock,
expected term, anticipated volatility, future interest and interest rates, expected cash flows and the number of outstanding common
and preferred shares as of a future date. All such stock purchase warrants expired in connection with the Merger. The following table presents our financial
assets and liabilities that were accounted for at fair value on a recurring basis as of December31, 2014 and 2013, by level
within the fair value hierarchy in thousands       Description

Financial Liabilities Measured at Fair Value on a Non-Recurring
Basis In December 2014, we issued
$1438M of Notessee Note 3. Because we have the option to cash settle the potential conversion of the Notes in cash, we
separated the embedded conversion option feature from the debt feature and account for each component separately, based on the
fair value of the debt component assuming no conversion option. The calculation of the fair value of the debt component required
the use of Level 3 inputs, and was determined by calculating the fair value of similar non-convertible debt, using a theoretical
interest rate of 9%. The theoretical interest rate was determined from market comparables to estimate what the interest rate would
have been if there was no conversion option embedded in the Notes. The fair value of the embedded conversion option was calculated
using the residual value method and is classified as equity. As of December 31, 2014, the fair value of the Notes approximates
their carrying value of $1107 million. A portion of the offering proceeds was used
to simultaneously enter into bond hedge or purchased call and warrant or written call transactions
with an affiliate of one of the offering underwriters see Note 3. The
exercise price of the bond hedge is $6948 per share, with an underlying 2,068,792 common shares; the exercise price of the warrant
is $9621 per share of our common stock, also with an underlying 2,068,792 common shares. We calculated the fair value of
the bond hedge based on the price we paid to purchase the call. We calculated the fair value of the warrant based on the price
at which the affiliate purchased the warrants from us. Because the bond
hedge and warrant are both indexed to our common stock and otherwise would be classified as equity, we recorded both elements as
equity, resulting in a net reduction to APIC of $156 million. Non-Financial Assets and Liabilities Measured at Fair Value on
a Recurring Basis We have no non-financial assets and liabilities
that are measured at fair value on a recurring basis.   74
ANI Pharmaceuticals, Inc. and Subsidiary
Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements
For the years ended December 31, 2014 and
2013 7. FAIR VALUE DISCLOSURES Continued Non-Financial Assets and Liabilities Measured at Fair Value on
a Non-Recurring Basis We measure our long-lived assets, including
property, plant and equipment, intangible assets and goodwill, at fair value on a non-recurring basis. These assets are recognized
at fair value when they are deemed to be other-than-temporarily impaired. No such fair value impairment was recognized in the years
ended December 31, 2014 and 2013. Acquired Non-Financial Assets Measured at Fair Value In July 2014, we acquired from Noven
the product rights associated with Lithobid, as well as a small amount of raw material inventory, for total consideration
of $120 million Note 6. In addition, we capitalized $45 thousand of legal costs directly related to the transaction.
These assets were recorded at their relative fair values, which were determined based on Level 3 unobservable inputs. In
order to determine the fair value of the product rights, we used the present value of the estimated cash flows related to the
product rights, using a discount rate of 10%. The $120 million of product rights will be amortized over their 10 year useful
life, and will be tested for impairment when events or circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the assets may not
be recoverable. No such triggering events were identified during the period from the date of acquisition to December 31,
2014 and therefore no impairment loss was recognized in 2014. We recorded $86 thousand of
inventory. The value of the raw material inventory was determined based on the most recent purchase price of the
material. In August 2014, we acquired from Shire
the U.S. product rights associated with Vancocin, certain equipment, and inventory, for total consideration of $110 million
Note 6. In addition, we capitalized $01 million of legal costs directly related to the transaction. These assets were
recorded at their relative fair values, which were determined based on Level 3 unobservable inputs. In order to determine the
fair value of the product rights, we used the present value of the estimated cash flows related to the product rights, using
a discount rate of 10%. The $105 million of value assigned to the product rights will be amortized over their 10 year useful
life, and will be tested for impairment when events or circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the assets may not
be recoverable. No such triggering events were identified during the period from the date of acquisition to December 31,
2014 and therefore no impairment loss was recognized in 2014. The
$02 million of value assigned to the equipment was determined based on the amount for which we believe we would be able to
sell the equipment. The equipment will be depreciated over its estimated 10 year useful life, and would be re-valued at the
fair value if deemed to be other-than-temporarily impaired. We recorded $04 million of inventory. The value of the raw
material inventory was determined based on the most recent purchase price of the material. The value of the finished goods
inventory was determined based on the estimated sales to be generated from the finished goods, less costs to sell, including
a reasonable margin. 8. SHAREHOLDERS EQUITY Authorized shares We are authorized to issue up to 333 million
shares of common stock with a par value of $00001 per share, 08 million shares of classC special stock with a par value
of $00001 per share, and 17 million shares of undesignated preferred stock with a par value of $00001 per share at December
31, 2014. There were 114 million and 96 million shares
of common stock issued and outstanding as of December31, 2014 and 2013, respectively.   75

special stock issued and outstanding as of both December31, 2014 and 2013. Each share of classC special stock entitles
its holder to one vote per share. Each share of classC special stock is exchangeable, at the option of the holder, for one
share of our common stock, at an exchange price of $9000 per share, subject to adjustment upon certain capitalization events.
Holders of classC special stock are not entitled to receive dividends or to participate in the distribution of our assets
if we were to liquidate, dissolve, or wind-up the company. The holders of classC special stock have no cumulative voting,
preemptive, subscription, redemption or sinking fund rights. There were no shares of undesignated preferred
stock outstanding as of December31, 2014 or 2013. Equity Offerings On March 10, 2014, we completed a follow-on
public offering of 16 million shares of our common stock at a public offering price of $3100 per share the March 2014
Offering. We received gross proceeds of $500 million, or net proceeds of $467 million after deducting costs of $33 million,
including the underwriters fees and commissions, as well as expenses directly related to the March 2014 Offering. The number
of shares sold in the March 2014 Offering includes the exercise in full by the underwriters of their option to purchase an additional
02 million shares of common stock. Warrants Warrants to purchase an aggregate of 25 million
shares as adjusted for the July 17, 2013 one-for-six reverse split, when applicable of our common stock were outstanding and

under the ANI Pharmaceuticals, Inc. Amended and Restated 2008 Stock Incentive Plan the 2008 Plan. As of December
31, 2014, 06 million shares of our common stock remained available for issuance under the 2008 Plan. We
measure the cost of equity-based service awards based on the grant-date fair value of the award. The cost is recognized over the
period during which an employee is required to provide service in exchange for the award or the requisite service period. We recognize
stock-based compensation expense ratably over the vesting periods of the awards, adjusted for estimated forfeitures. We
incurred $34 million and $36
thousand of non-cash, stock-based compensation cost for the years ended December31, 2014 and 2013, respectively in
connection with the 2008 Plan. In 2014, $01 million of the stock-based compensation cost was recognized as cost of sales, $01
million was recognized as research and development expense, and $32 million was recognized as
sales, general and administrative expense in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations. All of the 2013 stock-based
compensation cost was included in sales, general and administrative expense
in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations.An income tax benefit related to $44 million of stock-based compensation
tax deductions was recognized in our 2014 consolidated statements of operations. No income tax benefit was recognized in our 2013
consolidated statements of operations for stock-based compensation arrangements. Stock Options Outstanding employee stock options generally
vest over a period of three or four years and have 10-year contractual terms.Upon exercise of an option, we issue new shares
of our common stock. For
2014 and 2013, the fair value of each option grant was estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option-pricing
model, using the following weighted average assumptions

Risk-free interest rate
155% - 203%
172   Expected stock price volatility

5500   Dividend yield
We use the simplified method to estimate
the life of options. In 2014, 03 million options granted by the board of directors but requiring shareholder approval were
approved at the May 22, 2014 shareholders meeting. As a result, the fair values of these options were calculated using
the simplified method less the time between the grant date and the date of the approval, or 539 years. The risk-free
interest rate used is the yield on a U.S. Treasury note as of the grant date with a maturity equal to the estimated life of
the option.We calculated an estimated volatility rate based on the closing prices of several competitors that
manufacture similar products.We have not issued
a cash dividend in the past nor do we have any current plans to do so in the future; and therefore, an expected dividend
yield of zero was used. Forfeitures are estimated at the time of grant and revised through a cumulative catch-up
adjustment in the period of change if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates.For stock options granted during
the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013, we used an estimated forfeiture rate of zero for directors and officers and a
forfeiture rate of 51% for non-officer employees. On August 20, 2014, the Board of Directors
approved a grant of options to purchase 25 thousand shares of common stock to one of our officers. On April 1, 2014, the Board of Directors approved
grants of options to purchase 59 thousand shares of common stock to our officers and options to purchase 16 thousand shares of
common stock to non-employee directors.   77

Plan, subject to shareholder approval of an increase in the total shares available for issuance under the 2008 Plan. The
increase in total shares was approved by shareholders at the May 22, 2014 annual meeting, at which time we began recognizing
stock-based compensation expense related to these awards. In 2013, the Board of Directors granted options
to purchase 21 thousand shares of common stock and 50 thousand shares of restricted stock to non-officer directors under the 2008
Plan. A summary of stock option activity under the

in cash from the exercise of stock options and recorded a $06 million tax benefit related to these exercises. Restricted Stock Awards On April 1, 2014, the Board of Directors approved
grants of 30 thousand shares of restricted stock to our officers. The restricted stock was granted subject to shareholder approval
of an increase in the total restricted stock available for grant under the 2008 Plan. The increase in total restricted stock available
for grant under the 2008 Plan was approved by shareholders at the May 22, 2014 annual meeting and the restricted stock was granted
as of May 22, 2014. The RSAs vest one-fourth per year, over four years
on the anniversary of the grant date, provided that the officer continues to serve as an ANI employee on each of the vesting dates.
Shares of our common stock delivered to the officers will be unrestricted upon vesting. During the vesting period, the recipient
of the restricted stock has full voting rights as a stockholder and would receive dividends, if declared, even though the restricted
stock remains subject to transfer restrictions and will generally be forfeited upon termination of the officer
prior to vesting. The fair value of each RSA is based on the market value
of our stock on the date of grant.   78

As of December 31, 2014, we had Federal net
operating loss carryforwards of approximately $329 million, which expire beginning in 2018, and a portion of which arose as a
result of the Merger. The utilization of the net operating loss carryforwards are limited in future years as prescribed by Section382
of the U.S. Internal Revenue Code; our current annual limitation of the Federal net operating loss is approximately $112 million
per year. We are required to establish a
valuation allowance for deferred tax assets if, based on the weight of available evidence, it is more likely than not that
some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. The ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is
dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which those temporary differences become
deductible. We consider the projected future taxable income and tax planning strategies in making this assessment. Based upon
the level of historical taxable income and projections for future taxable income in previous periods, we had provided a full
valuation allowance as of December 31, 2013. In the fourth quarter of 2014, we determined that certain deferred tax assets
that had previously been reserved would now more likely than not be realized through the generation of future taxable income
and, as a result, recognized an income tax benefit of $167 million related to the reversal of the majority of the
valuation allowance. As of December 31, 2014, we have provided a valuation allowance against certain state net operating loss
carryforwards of approximately $01 million. We are subject to income taxes in numerous
jurisdictions in the U.S. Significant judgment is required in evaluating our tax positions and determining our provision for income
taxes. We establish liabilities for tax-related uncertainties based on estimates of whether, and the extent to which, additional
taxes will be due. These liabilities are established when we believe that certain positions might be challenged despite our belief
that our tax return positions are fully supportable. We adjust these liabilities in light of changing facts and circumstances,
such as the outcome of a tax audit. The provision for income taxes includes the impact of changes to the liability that is considered
appropriate. We identified no material uncertain tax positions as of December 31, 2014 and 2013.   81

Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements
For the years ended December 31, 2014 and
2013 10. INCOME TAXES Continued We are subject to income tax audits in all
jurisdictions for which we file tax returns. Tax audits by their nature are often complex and can require several years to complete.
Neither ANI Pharmaceuticals, Inc. nor any of its subsidiaries is currently under audit in any jurisdiction. All of our income tax
returns remain subject to examination by tax authorities due to the availability of net operating loss carryforwards. 11. COLLABORATIVE ARRANGEMENTS RiconPharma LLC In July 2011, we entered into a collaborative

expense for the years ended December31, 2014 and 2013 totaled $70 thousand and $36 thousand,
respectively. Vendor Purchase Minimums We have supply
agreements with three vendors that include purchase minimums. Pursuant to these agreements, we will be required to purchase a total
of $58 million of API from these three vendors during the year ended December 31, 2015. Monitoring and Advisory Fees Prior to the Merger, we were required to pay
monitoring and advisory fees to two investors. A total of $05 million was included in other expense in the accompanying consolidated
statements of operations for the year ended December 31, 2013. These fees were paid quarterly in advance on the first business
day of each calendar quarter. Included
in the $05 million above and in conjunction with the Merger, we paid additional monitoring and advisory fees totaling $04
million to the same two investors Note 2. Upon completion of the Merger,
our obligation to pay monitoring and advisory fees was terminated. Government Regulation Our products and facilities are subject to
regulation by a number of federal and state governmental agencies. The Food and Drug Administration FDA, in particular,
maintains oversight of the formulation, manufacture, distribution, packaging and labeling of all of our products. The Drug Enforcement
Administration DEA maintains oversight over our products that are considered controlled substances. Unapproved Products Two of our products, Esterified Estrogen with
Methyltestosterone EEMT and Opium Tincture, are
marketed without approved New Drug Applications NDAs or Abbreviated New Drug Applications ANDAs. During
the years ended December31, 2014 and 2013, net revenues for these products totaled $298million and $146 million,
respectively.   84
ANI Pharmaceuticals, Inc. and Subsidiary
Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements
For the years ended December 31, 2014 and
2013 12. COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES Continued The
FDA policy with respect to the continued marketing of unapproved products is stated in the FDA September 2011 Compliance Policy
Guide Sec. 440100 titled Marketed New Drugs without Approved NDAs or ANDAs. Under this policy, the FDA has stated
that it will follow a risk-based approach with regard to enforcement against such unapproved products. The FDA evaluates whether
to initiate enforcement action on a case-by-case basis, but gives higher priority to enforcement action against products in certain
categories, such as those marketed as unapproved drugs with potential safety risks or that lack evidence of effectiveness. We believe
that, so long as we comply with applicable manufacturing standards, the FDA will not take action against us
under the current enforcement policy. There can be no assurance, however,
that the FDA will continue this policy or not take a contrary position with any individual product or group of products. If the
FDA were to take a contrary position, we may be required to seek FDA approval for these products or withdraw such products from
the market. If we decide to withdraw the products from the market, our net revenues for generic pharmaceutical products
would decline materially, and if we decide to seek FDA approval, we would face increased expenses and might need to suspend sales
of the products until such approval was obtained, and there are no assurances that we would receive such approval. In addition, one group of products that we
manufacture on behalf of a contract customer is marketed by that customer without an approved NDA. If the FDA took enforcement
action against such customer, the customer may be required to seek FDA approval for the group of products or withdraw them from
the market. Our contract manufacturing revenues for the group of unapproved products for the years ended December31, 2014
and 2013 were $12million and $20million, respectively. We received royalties on the net sales of a
group of contract-manufactured products, which are marketed by the contract customer without an approved NDA. If the FDA took enforcement
action against such customer, the customer may be required to seek FDA approval for the group of products or withdraw them from
the market. Our royalties on the net sales of these unapproved products were $03 million for the years ended December31,
2014 and 2013. Louisiana Medicaid Lawsuit On September11, 2013, the Attorney General
of the State of Louisiana filed a lawsuit in Louisiana state court against numerous pharmaceutical companies, including us, under
various state laws, alleging that each defendant caused the states Medicaid agency to provide reimbursement for drug products
that allegedly were not approved by the FDA and therefore allegedly not reimbursable under the federal Medicaid program. The lawsuit
relates to three cough and cold prescription products manufactured and sold by our former Gulfport, Mississippi operation, which
was sold in September 2010. Through its lawsuit, the state seeks unspecified damages, statutory fines, penalties, attorneys
fees and costs. On October15, 2013, the defendants removed the lawsuit to the U.S. District Court. On November14, 2013,
the state filed a motion to remand the lawsuit to the Louisiana state court. On September 30, 2014, the U.S. District Court remanded
the case from the federal to the state court. While we cannot predict the outcome of the lawsuit at this time, we could be
subject to material damages, penalties and fines. We intend to vigorously defend against all claims in the lawsuit. Other Commitments and Contingencies All manufacturers of the drug Reglan and its
generic equivalent metoclopramide, including ANI, are facing allegations from plaintiffs in various states, including California,
New Jersey and Pennsylvania, claiming bodily injuries as a result of ingestion of metoclopramide or its brand name, Reglan, prior
to the FDA February 2009 Black Box warning requirement. In August 2012, we were dismissed with prejudice from all New Jersey
cases. We consider our exposure to this litigation to be limited due to several factors: 1 the only generic metoclopramide that
we manufactured prior to the implementation of the FDA warning requirement was an oral solution introduced after May 28, 2008;
2 our market share for the oral solution was a very small portion of the overall metoclopramide market; and 3 once we received
a request for change of labeling from the FDA, we submitted our proposed changes within 30 days, and such changes were subsequently
approved by the FDA.   85
ANI Pharmaceuticals, Inc. and Subsidiary
Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements
For the years ended December 31, 2014 and
2013 12. COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES Continued At the present time, we are unable to assess
the likely outcome of the cases in the remaining states. Our insurance company has assumed the defense of this matter. However,
our current product liability insurance policy contains absolute exclusions for claims related to Reglan and metoclopramide. We
cannot provide assurances that the outcome of these matters will not have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition,
and operating results. Furthermore, like all pharmaceutical manufacturers, we may be exposed to other product liability claims
in the future, which could further limit our coverage under future insurance policies or cause those policies to become more expensive,
which could harm our business, financial condition, and operating results.   86
