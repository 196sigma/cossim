Description
of Business and Summary of Significant Accounting
Policies   Description of Business.RealNetworks, Inc.
and subsidiaries RealNetworks or Company is a leading global
provider of network-delivered digital media products and
services. The Company also develops and markets software
products and services that enable the creation, distribution and
consumption of digital media, including audio and video.   Inherent in the Companys business are various risks and
uncertainties, including limited history of certain of its
product and service offerings and its limited history of
offering premium subscription services on the Internet. The
Companys success will depend on the acceptance of the
Companys technology, products and services and the ability
to generate related revenue.   Basis of Presentation.The consolidated
financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its
wholly-owned and majority-owned subsidiaries. All significant
intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in
consolidation. The Company acquired 997% of WiderThan Co., Ltd.
during the quarter ended December31, 2006. The
accompanying financial statements include 100% of the financial
results of WiderThan beginning October31, 2006. The
minority interest in the earnings of WiderThan for the period
November1, 2006 to December31, 2006 was nominal.   Use of Estimates.The preparation of financial
statements in conformity with accounting principles generally
accepted in the U.S.requires management to make estimates
and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and
liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at
the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of
revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual
results could differ from those estimates.   Cash, Cash Equivalents, and Short-Term
Investments.The Company considers all short-term
investments with a remaining contractual maturity at date of
purchase of three months or less to be cash equivalents.   The Company has classified as available-for-sale all marketable
debt and equity securities for which there is determinable fair
market value and there are no restrictions on the Companys
ability to sell. Available-for-sale securities are carried at
fair value, based on quoted market prices, with unrealized gains
and losses reported as a separate component of
shareholders equity, net of applicable income taxes. All
short-term investments have remaining contractual maturities of
two years or less. Realized gains and losses and declines in
value judged to be other-than-temporary on available-for-sale
securities are included in other income, net. Realized and
unrealized gains and losses on available-for-sale securities are
determined using the specific identification method.   Trade Accounts Receivable.Trade accounts
receivable are recorded at the invoiced amount and do not bear
interest. The allowance for doubtful accounts is the
Companys best estimate of the amount of probable credit
losses in the Companys existing accounts receivable. The
Company determines the allowance based on analysis of historical
bad debts, customer concentrations, customer credit-worthiness
and current economic trends. The Company reviews its allowance
for doubtful accounts quarterly. Past due balances over
90days and specified other balances are reviewed
individually for collectibility. All other balances are reviewed
on an aggregate basis. Account balances are written off against
the allowance after all means of collection have been exhausted
and the potential for recovery is considered remote. The Company
does not have any off-balance sheet credit exposure related to
its customers.   Concentration of Credit Risk.Financial
instruments that potentially expose the Company to
concentrations of credit risk consist primarily of cash and cash
equivalents, short-term investments, and accounts receivable.
The Company maintains its cash and cash equivalents with high
credit quality financial institutions. Short-term investments
consist of U.S.government and government agency securities
and corporate notes and bonds. The Company derives a significant
portion of its revenue from a large number of individual
subscribers   
58 Table of Contents   REALNETWORKS,

NOTES TO
CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTSContinued   spread globally. The Company also derives revenue from several
large customers. If the financial condition or results of
operations of any one of the large customers deteriorates
substantially, the Companys operating results could be
adversely affected. To reduce credit risk, management performs
ongoing credit evaluations of the financial condition of
significant customers. The Company does not generally require
collateral and maintains reserves for estimated credit losses on
customer accounts when considered necessary.   Deferred costs.The Company defers costs on
projects for service revenues and system sales. Deferred costs
consist primarily of direct and incremental costs to customize
and install systems, as defined in individual customer
contracts, including costs to acquire hardware and software from
third parties and payroll and related costs for employees and
other third parties. Deferred costs are capitalized during the
implementation period.   The Company recognizes such costs in accordance with its revenue
recognition policy by contract. For revenue recognized under the
completed contract method, costs are deferred until the products
are delivered, or upon completion of services or, where
applicable, customer acceptance. For revenue recognized under
the percentage of completion method, costs are recognized as
products are delivered or services are provided. For revenue
recognized ratably over the term of the contract, costs are also
recognized ratably over the term of the contract, commencing on
the date of revenue recognition. At each balance sheet date, the
Company reviews its deferred costs, to ensure they are
ultimately recoverable. Any anticipated losses on uncompleted
contracts are recognized when evidence indicates the estimated
total cost of a contract exceeds its estimated total revenue or
if actual deferred costs exceed contractual revenue.   Long-term portion of deferred costs have been included in other
assets in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets.   Depreciation and Amortization.Depreciation
and amortization of equipment, software, and leasehold
improvements are computed using the straight-line method over
the lesser of the estimated useful lives of the assets or the
lease term. Approximate useful life of equipment and software is
three years and for leasehold improvements is two to ten years.   Depreciation expense during the years ended December31,
2006, 2005, and 2004 was $135million, $103million,
and $98million, respectively.   Equity Investments.The cost method is used to
account for equity investments in companies in which the Company
holds less than a 20percent voting interest, does not
exercise significant influence, and the related securities do
not have a quoted market price.   Other Intangible Assets.Other intangible
assets consist primarily of the fair value of customer
agreements and contracts, developed technology, patents,
trademarks and tradenames acquired in business combinations.
Other intangible assets are amortized on a straight line basis
over three to seven years, which approximates their estimated
useful lives.   Goodwill.Goodwill represents the excess of
the purchase price over the fair value of identifiable tangible
and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed in
business combinations. Goodwill is tested at least annually for
impairment and more frequently if events and circumstances
indicate that it might be impaired. The annual impairment test
is performed in the fourth quarter of the Companys fiscal
year. Factors the Company considers important which could
trigger an impairment review include the following   
poor economic performance relative to historical or projected
operating results   
significant negative industry, economic or company specific
trends   
changes in the manner of our use of the assets or the plans for
our business;and   
loss of key personnel.   
59 Table of Contents   REALNETWORKS,
INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES
NOTES TO
CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTSContinued   Long-Lived Assets.The Company reviews its
long-lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in
circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may
not be recoverable. Recoverability of assets held and used is
measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of the assets to
the estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected to be
generated by the assets. If such assets are considered to be
impaired, the impairment to be recognized is measured by the
amount by which the carrying amount of the assets exceeds their
fair value estimated on discounted future cash flows.   Fair Value of Financial Instruments.At
December31, 2006, the Company had the following financial
instruments: cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments,
accounts receivable, accounts payable, accrued liabilities, and
convertible debt. The carrying value of cash and cash
equivalents, accounts receivable, accounts payable, and accrued
liabilities approximates their fair value based on the liquidity
of these financial instruments or based on their short-term
nature. Short-term investments are carried at fair value based
on quoted market prices. The fair value of convertible debt,
which has a carrying value of $1000million, was
$1257million and $972million at December31,
2006 and 2005, respectively.   Research and Development.Costs incurred in
research and development are expensed as incurred. Software
development costs are required to be capitalized when a
products technological feasibility has been established
through the date the product is available for general release to
customers. The Company has not capitalized any software
development costs, as technological feasibility is generally not
established until a working model is completed, at which time
substantially all development is complete.   Revenue Recognition.The Company recognizes
revenue in accordance with the following authoritative
literature: AICPA Statement of Position SOP
No97-2,
Software Revenue Recognition;
SOPNo98-9,
Software Revenue Recognition with Respect to Certain
Arrangements;
SOPNo81-1,

Reporting Revenue Gross as a Principal versus Net as an
Agent. Generally the Company recognizes revenue when there
is persuasive evidence of an arrangement, the fee is fixed or
determinable, the product or services have been delivered and
collectibility of the resulting receivable is reasonably assured.   Consumer subscription products are paid in advance, typically
for monthly, quarterly or annual periods. Subscription revenue
is recognized ratably over the related subscription period.
Revenue from sales of downloaded individual tracks, albums and
games are recognized at the time the music or game is made
available, digitally, to the end user.   The Company has arrangements whereby customers pay one price for
multiple products and services and in some cases, involve a
combination of products and services. For arrangements with
multiple deliverables, revenue is recognized upon the delivery
of the individual deliverables in accordance with EITF Issue
No00-21.
In the event that there is no objective and reliable evidence of
fair value of the delivered items, the revenue recognized upon
delivery is the total arrangement consideration less the fair
value of the undelivered items. The Company applies significant
judgment in establishing the fair value of multiple elements
within revenue arrangements.   The Company recognizes revenue on a gross or net basis, in
accordance with EITF Issue
No99-19.
In most arrangements, the Company contracts directly with end
user customers, is the primary obligor and carries all
collectibility risk. In such arrangements the Company reports
the revenue on a gross basis. In some cases, the Company
utilizes third-party distributors to sell products or services
directly to end user customers and carries no collectibility
risk. In such instances the Company reports the revenue on a net
basis.   The Company recognizes revenue for its software products
pursuant to the requirements of
SOPNo97-2,
as amended by
SOPNo98-9.
If the Company provides consulting services that are considered
essential to the   
60 Table of Contents   REALNETWORKS,
INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES
NOTES TO
CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTSContinued   functionality of the software products, both the software
product revenue and services revenue are recognized under
contract accounting in accordance with the provisions of
SOPNo81-1.
Revenue from these arrangements is either recognized under the
percentage of completion method based on the ratio of direct
labor hours incurred to total projected labor hours, or on the
completed contract method based on customer specific
arrangement. Revenue from software license agreements with
original equipment manufacturers OEM is recognized when the
OEM delivers its product incorporating the Companys
software to the end user.   Revenue generated from advertising appearing on the
Companys websites and from advertising included in its
products is recognized as revenue as the delivery of the
advertising occurs.   Advertising Expenses.The Company expenses the
cost of advertising and promoting its products as incurred. Such
costs are included in sales and marketing expense and totaled
$512million in 2006, $400million in 2005, and
$130million in 2004.   Foreign Currency.The functional currency of
the Companys foreign subsidiaries is the local currency of
the country in which the subsidiary operates. Assets and
liabilities of foreign operations are translated into
U.S.dollars using rates of exchange in effect at the end
of the reporting period. The net gain or loss resulting from
translation is shown as translation adjustment and included in
accumulated other comprehensive income in shareholders
equity. Income and expense accounts are translated into
U.S.dollars using average rates of exchange. Gains and
losses from foreign currency transactions are included in the
consolidated statements of operations. There were no significant
gains or losses on foreign currency transactions in 2006, 2005,
and 2004.   Derivative Financial Instruments.The Company
conducts business internationally in several currencies. As
such, it is exposed to adverse movements in foreign currency
exchange rates. A portion of these risks are managed through the
use of financial derivatives, but fluctuations could impact the
Companys results of operations and financial position. The
Companys foreign currency risk management program reduces,
but does not entirely eliminate, the impact of currency exchange
rate movements.   Generally, the Companys practice is to manage foreign
currency risk for the majority of material short-term
intercompany balances through the use of foreign currency
forward contracts. These contracts require the Company to
exchange currencies at rates agreed upon at the contracts
inception. Because the impact of movements in currency exchange
rates on forward contracts offsets the related impact on the
short-term intercompany balances, these financial instruments
help alleviate the risk that might otherwise result from certain
changes in currency exchange rates. The Company does not
designate its foreign exchange forward contracts related to
short-term intercompany accounts as hedges and, accordingly, the
Company adjusts these instruments to fair value through results
of operations. However, the Company may periodically hedge a
portion of its foreign exchange exposures associated with
material firmly committed transactions and long-term investments.   All derivatives, whether designated in hedging relationships or
not, are recorded on the balance sheet at fair value. If the
derivative is designated a hedge, then depending on the nature
of the hedge, changes in fair value will either be recorded
immediately in results of operations, or be recognized in
accumulated other comprehensive income until the hedged item is
recognized in results of operations.

taxes using the asset and liability method, under which deferred
income taxes are provided for temporary differences between
financial reporting basis and tax basis of the Companys
assets and liabilities and operating loss and tax credit
carryforwards. A valuation allowance is established when
necessary to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount expected
to be realized. Deferred tax assets and liabilities and
operating loss and tax credit carryforwards are measured using
enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the
years in which those temporary differences and operating loss
and tax credit carryforwards are expected to be recovered or
settled.   Stock-Based Compensation.Effective
January1, 2006, the Company adopted the provisions of, and
began accounting for stock-based compensation in accordance
with, Statement of Financial Accounting Standards SFAS
No123R revised 2004, Share-Based
Payment, which replaced SFAS123, Accounting for
Stock-Based Compensation and supersedes Accounting
Principles Board Opinion APB No25, Accounting for
Stock Issued to Employees. Under the fair value provisions
of this statement, stock-based compensation cost is measured at
the grant date based on the fair value of the award and is
recognized as expense over the requisite service period, which
is the vesting period. The Company uses the Black-Scholes
option-pricing model to determine the fair-value of stock-based
awards under SFASNo123R, consistent with that used
for pro forma disclosures under SFASNo123. The
Company utilized the modified prospective transition method,
which requires that stock-based compensation expense be recorded
for all new and unvested stock options and employee stock
purchase plan shares that are ultimately expected to vest as the
requisite service is rendered beginning on January1, 2006,
the first day of the Companys 2006 fiscal year.
Stock-based compensation expense for awards granted prior to
January1, 2006 is based on the grant date fair-value as
determined under the pro forma provisions of
SFASNo123.   Prior to January1, 2006, the Company had elected to apply
the disclosure-only provisions of SFASNo123.
Accordingly, the Company accounted for stock-based compensation
transactions with employees using the intrinsic value method
prescribed in APB No25 and related interpretations.
Compensation cost for employee stock options was measured as the
excess, if any, of the fair value of the Companys common
stock at the date of grant over the stock option exercise price.
Compensation cost for awards to non-employees   
62 Table of Contents   REALNETWORKS,

STATEMENTSContinued   was based on the fair value of the awards in accordance with
SFASNo123. Furthermore, the Company recognized
compensation cost related to fixed employee awards on an
accelerated basis over the applicable vesting period using the
methodology described in FASB Interpretation FIN No28,
Accounting for Stock Appreciation Rights and Other Variable
Stock Option or Award Plans.   At December31, 2006, the Company had six stock-based
employee compensation plans, which are described more fully in
Note13.   Net Income Loss Per Share.Basic net income
loss per share is computed by dividing net income loss by
the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during
the period. Diluted net income per share is computed by dividing
net income by the weighted average number of common and dilutive
potential common shares outstanding during the period. As the
Company had a net loss in 2004, basic and diluted net loss per
share are the same for the year. Potentially dilutive securities
outstanding were not included in the computation of diluted net
loss per common share because to do so would have been
anti-dilutive. The share count used to compute basic and diluted
net income loss per share is calculated as follows in

Companys accumulated other comprehensive income as of
December31, 2006 and 2005 consisted of unrealized gains
losses on marketable securities and foreign currency
translation gains losses. The tax effect of unrealized gains

No05-06 are effective on a prospective basis for
leasehold improvements purchased or acquired beginning in the
second quarter of fiscal 2006. Adoption of Issue
No05-06
did not have a material effect on the Companys
consolidated financial statements.   In June 2006, the FASB issued FINNo48,
Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes an
interpretation of FASB Statement No109.
FINNo48 prescribes a recognition threshold and
measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition
and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken
in a tax return, and provides guidance on derecognition,
classification, interest and penalties, accounting in interim
periods, disclosure, and transition. FINNo48 is
effective for fiscal years beginning after December15,
2006. The Company does not expect the adoption of
FINNo48 to have a material impact on its
consolidated financial statements.   In June 2006, the FASB ratified the consensus reached on EITF
Issue
No06-3,
How Taxes Collected from Customers and Remitted to
Governmental Authorities Should Be Presented in the Income
Statement That Is, Gross Versus Net Presentation. The
scope of Issue
No06-3
includes any transaction-based tax assessed by a governmental
authority that is imposed concurrent with or subsequent to a
revenue-producing transaction between a seller and a customer.
The scope does not include taxes that are based on gross
receipts or total revenues imposed during the inventory
procurement process. Gross versus net income statement
classification of that tax is an accounting policy decision and
a voluntary change would be considered a change in accounting
policy requiring the application of SFASNo154,
Accounting Changes and Error Corrections.The
following disclosures will be required for taxes within the
scope of this issue that are significant in amount: 1the
accounting policy elected for these taxes; and 2the
amounts of the taxes reflected gross as revenue in the income
statement on an interim and annual basis for all periods
presented. Issue
No06-3
is effective for interim and annual periods beginning after
December15, 2006. The Company does not expect the adoption
of Issue
No06-3
to have a material impact on its consolidated financial
statements.   In September 2006, the SEC issued SABNo108,
Considering the Effects of Prior Year Misstatements when
Quantifying Current Year Misstatements.
SABNo108 requires analysis of misstatements using
both an income statement approach and a balance sheet approach
in assessing materiality and provides for a one-time cumulative
effect transition adjustment. SABNo108 is effective
for fiscal years ending after November15, 2006. The
adoption of SABNo108 did not have a material effect
on the Companys consolidated financial statements.   In September 2006, the FASB issued SFASNo157,
Fair Value Measurements, which defines fair value,
establishes a framework for measuring fair value in generally
accepted accounting principles, and expands disclosures about
fair value measurements. SFASNo157 does not require
any new fair value measurements, but provides guidance on how to
measure fair value by providing a fair value hierarchy used to
classify the source of the information. This statement is
effective for fiscal years beginning after November15,
2007 and interim periods within those fiscal years. The Company
is currently assessing the impact of SFASNo157 on
its consolidated financial statements.

Stock-Based
Compensation   Effective January1, 2006, the Company adopted the
provisions of, and began accounting for stock-based compensation
in accordance with,
SFASNo123revised 2004,
Share-Based Payment, which replaced SFAS123,
Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation and supersedes
APB No25, Accounting for Stock Issued to
Employees. Under the fair value provisions of this
statement, stock-based compensation cost is measured at the
grant date based on the fair value of the award and is
recognized as expense over the requisite service period, which
is the vesting period. The Company uses the Black-Scholes
option-pricing model to   
64 Table of Contents   REALNETWORKS,

NOTES TO
CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTSContinued   determine the fair-value of stock-based awards under
SFASNo123R, consistent with that used for pro forma
disclosures under SFASNo123. The Company utilized
the modified prospective transition method, which requires that
stock-based compensation expense be recorded for all new and
unvested stock options and employee stock purchase plan shares
that are ultimately expected to vest as the requisite service is
rendered beginning on January1, 2006, the first day of the
Companys 2006 fiscal year. Stock-based compensation
expense for awards granted prior to January1, 2006 is
based on the grant date fair-value as determined under the pro
forma provisions of SFASNo123.   The expected term of the options represents the estimated period
of time until exercise and is based on historical experience of
similar awards, including the contractual terms, vesting
schedules and expectations of future employee behavior. During
the year ended December31, 2006, expected stock price
volatility is based on a combination of historical volatility of
the Companys stock for the related expected term and the
implied volatility of its traded options. Prior to the adoption
of SFASNo123R, expected stock price volatility was
estimated using only historical volatility. The risk-free
interest rate is based on the implied yield available on
U.S.Treasury zero-coupon issues with a term equivalent to
the expected term of the stock options. The Company has not paid
dividends in the past.   In accordance with SFASNo123R the Company presents
excess tax benefits from the exercise of stock-based
compensation awards as a financing activity in the consolidated
statement of cash flows for periods in which an excess tax
benefit is recorded. As a result of the implementation of
SFASNo123R, cash benefit of $392million was
recorded during the year ended December31, 2006 which
resulted in a decrease in cash provided by operating activities
and a decrease in cash used in financing activities.   The Company recognizes compensation cost related to stock
options granted prior to the adoption of SFASNo123R
on an accelerated basis over the applicable vesting period using
the methodology described in FINNo28, Accounting
for Stock Appreciation Rights and Other Variable Stock Option or
Award Plans. The Company recognizes compensation cost
related to options granted subsequent to the adoption of
SFASNo123R on a straight-line basis over the
applicable vesting period. At December31, 2006, the
Company had options outstanding under six stock-based
compensation plans. The Company issues new shares of its common
stock to satisfy stock option exercises.   Stock-based compensation expense recognized in the

Equity
Investments   The Company has certain equity investments that are accounted
for under the cost method of accounting. The cost method is used
to account for equity investments in companies in which the
Company holds less than a 20percent voting interest, does
not exercise significant influence, and for which the related
securities do not have a quoted market price.   The Company has certain equity investments in publicly traded
companies in which the Company holds less than a 20percent
voting interest. The investments are accounted for at market
value. Changes in the market value of the investments are
recognized as unrealized gains losses, net of income tax, and
are recorded in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets as
a component of accumulated other comprehensive income.   During the quarter ended March31, 2006, the Company
established Beijing RealNetworks Technology Co., Ltd, a Wholly
Owned Foreign Entity WOFE which operates an Internet retail
website in the Peoples Republic of China PRC in
cooperation with a PRC affiliate. The results of operations of
the WOFE have been included in the Companys consolidated
results since the establishment date of the WOFE. The PRC
regulates the WOFEs business through regulations and
license requirements restricting: ithe scope of foreign
investment in the Internet, retail and delivery sectors;
iiInternet content; and iiithe sale of certain
media products. In order to meet the PRC local ownership and
regulatory licensing requirements, the WOFEs business is
operated through a PRC affiliate which is owned by nominee
shareholders who are PRC nationals and RealNetworks employees.
The WOFE does not own any capital stock of the PRC affiliate,
but is the primary beneficiary of future losses or profits
through contractual rights. As a result, the Company
consolidates the results of the PRC affiliate in accordance with
FINNo46R, Consolidation of Variable Interest
Entities. The net assets and operating results for the PRC
affiliate were not significant during the year ended

equity investments in publicly traded companies consists
primarily of approximately 106% of outstanding shares of
J-Stream
Inc.
J-Stream,
a Japanese media services company. These equity investments are
accounted for as
available-for-sale.
The market value of these shares has increased from the original
cost of $913,000, resulting in a carrying value of
$202million and $434million as of
December31, 2006 and 2005, respectively. The increase over
the cost basis, net of income tax is $141million and
$289million at December31, 2006 and 2005,
respectively, and is reflected as a component of accumulated
other comprehensive income. In July 2005, the Company disposed
of a portion of the investment in
J-Stream
through open market trades, which resulted in net proceeds of
$119million, and recognition of a gain, net of income tax
and a loss associated with a previously cancelled foreign
currency hedge related to the investment, of $84million
during the year ended December31, 2005. The disposition
resulted in a tax expense and a related offset to accumulated
other comprehensive income of $33million during the year
ended December31, 2005. There were no similar gains or
losses in 2006 or 2004. The market for these investments is
relatively limited and the share price is volatile. Although the

75 Table of Contents   REALNETWORKS,

STATEMENTSContinued   value of the investments was $202million at
December31, 2006, there can be no assurance that a gain of
this magnitude, or any gain, can be realized through the
disposition of these shares.   Based upon an evaluation of the facts and circumstances during
the quarter ended December31, 2006, the Company determined
that an
other-than-temporary
decline in fair value had occurred in one of its privately-held
investments, resulting in an impairment charge of
$31million to reflect changes in the fair value of the
investment.   The Companys equity investment in MusicNet, Inc.
MusicNet was accounted for under the equity method of
accounting. Under the equity method of accounting, the
Companys share of the investees earnings or loss was
included in the Companys consolidated operating results.
During the quarter ended June30, 2005, the Company

Loss on
Excess Office Facilities and Content Agreement   In October 2000, the Company entered into a
10-year
lease agreement for additional office space located near its
corporate headquarters in Seattle, Washington. Due to a
subsequent decline in the market for office space in Seattle and
the Companys re-assessment of its facilities requirements
in 2001, the Company accrued for estimated future losses on
excess office facilities. Additionally, the Company accrued for
estimated future losses on this facility in 2002 and 2003 based
on changes in market conditions and securing tenants at rates
lower than those used in the original estimate.   During the year ended December31, 2006 the Company
recorded $738,000 of additional loss due to building operating
expenses that are not expected to be recovered under the terms
of the existing sublease arrangements. The Company did not
identify any factors which caused it to revise its estimates
during the years ended December31, 2005, and 2004. The
estimated loss as of December31, 2006 consists of
$99million of sublease income under existing sublease
arrangements.   In September 2004, the Company renegotiated its existing lease
for its headquarters building. In addition, the Company ceased
use of 16,000square feet of office space, which was
returned to the landlord in May 2005 in accordance with the
amended lease agreement. The Company recorded a loss on excess
office facilities of $866,000 related to the expensing of net
leasehold improvements and rent for the period between
October1, 2004 and April30, 2005 in connection with
vacating the excess space.   In March 2004, the Company cancelled a content licensing
agreement with one of its content partners. Under the terms of
the cancellation agreement, the Company gave up rights to use
the content and ceased using the content in any of its products
or services as of March31, 2004. The resulting expense of

Convertible
Debt   During 2003, the Company issued $1000million aggregate
principal amount of zero coupon convertible subordinated notes
due July1, 2010, pursuant to Rule144A under the
Securities Act of 1933, as amended. The notes are subordinated
to any Company senior debt and are also effectively subordinated
in right of payment to all indebtedness and other liabilities of
its subsidiaries. The notes are convertible into shares of the
Companys common stock based on an initial effective
conversion price of $930 if 1the closing sale price of
the Companys common stock exceeds $1023, subject to
certain restrictions, 2the notes are called for
redemption, 3the Company makes a significant
distribution to its shareholders or becomes a party to a
transaction that would result in a change in control, or
4the trading price of the notes falls below 95% of the
value of common stock that the notes are convertible into,
subject to certain restrictions; one of which allows the
Company, at its discretion, to issue cash or common stock or a
combination thereof upon conversion. On or after July1,
2008, the Company has the option to redeem all or a portion of
the notes that have not been previously purchased, repurchased,
or converted, in exchange for cash at 100% of the principal
amount of the notes. The purchaser may require the Company to
purchase all or a portion of its notes in cash on July1,
2008 at 100% of the principal amount of the notes. As a result
of this issuance, the Company received proceeds of
$970million, net of offering costs. The offering costs
are included in other assets and are being amortized over a
5-year
period. Interest expense from the amortization of offering costs
in the amount of $600,000 is recorded in interest income, net
during each of the years ended December31, 2006, 2005, and

that are determinable by the Board of Directors when
determination of a new series of preferred stock has been
established.   Shareholder Rights Plan.On October16,
1998, the Companys board of directors declared a dividend
of one preferred share purchase right Right in connection with
its adoption of a Shareholder Rights Plan dated December4,
1998, for each outstanding share of the Companys common
stock on December14, 1998 Record Date. Each share of
common stock issued after the Record Date will be issued with an
attached Right. The Rights will not immediately be exercisable
and detachable from the common stock. The Rights will become
exercisable and detachable only following the acquisition by a
person or a group of 15percent or more of the outstanding
common stock or ten days following the announcement of a tender
or exchange offer for 15percent or more of the outstanding
common stock Distribution Date. After the Distribution Date,
each Right will entitle the holder to purchase for $3750

that of one share of the Companys common stock. Upon a
person or a group acquiring 15percent or more of the
outstanding common stock, each Right will allow the holder
other than the acquirer to purchase common stock or securities
of the Company having a then current market value of two times
the Exercise Price of the Right. In the event that following the
acquisition of 15percent of the common stock by an
acquirer, the Company is acquired in a merger or other business
combination or 50percent or more of the Companys
assets or earning power are sold, each Right will entitle the
holder to purchase for the Exercise Price, common stock or
securities of the acquirer having a then current market value of
two times the Exercise Price. In certain circumstances, the
Rights may be redeemed by the Company at a redemption price of
$00025per Right. If not earlier exchanged or redeemed,
the Rights will expire on December4, 2008.   Equity Compensation Plans.The Company has six

of the common stock at the grant date.   Restricted Stock Units.In 2006, the Company
granted restricted stock units representing 80,834shares
of common stock with a weighted average fair value of $1138
pursuant to the Companys 2005 Stock Incentive Plan 2005

program through August 2005. There were no repurchases during
2005 or 2004 related to the September 2001 repurchase program.
In August 2005, the Companys Board of Directors authorized
a share repurchase program for the repurchase of up to an

time to time, depending on market conditions, share price, and
other factors in the open market or through private
transactions, in accordance with SEC requirements. The Company
entered into a

$91million at December31, 2006 and 2005,
respectively. The Company records a valuation allowance when it
is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred
tax assets will not be realized. The ultimate realization of the
deferred tax assets depends on the ability to generate
sufficient taxable income of the appropriate character in the
appropriate taxing jurisdictions. Based on an evaluation of
expected future taxable income in 2007 and 2008 related
primarily to the Companys settlement with Microsoft
Corporation outlined in Note15, the Company determined
it is more likely than not that certain deferred tax assets will
be realized and therefore reversed the related valuation
allowance on these assets in the fourth quarter of 2005. In
2006, the Company has continued to provide a valuation allowance
on the deferred tax assets that the Company believes are not
more likely than not to be utilized.   The net decrease in valuation allowance was $10million
and $2204million during the years ended December31,
2006 and 2005, respectively. The valuation allowance increased
by $104million during the year ended December31,
2004. The 2006net decrease in the valuation allowance is
comprised of an increase of $18million due primarily to
an increase in certain deferred tax assets and an decrease of
$28million for the write-off of state net operating loss

reduction was recorded as an increase in additional
paid-in-capital
to reflect the use of net operating losses derived from the
benefit of stock option exercises for tax purposes,
$420million was reflected in the Companys
consolidated statement of operations, and $75million was
recorded as a reduction of goodwill to reduce the valuation
allowance on net operating losses from acquired subsidiaries.   The Companys United States Federal net operating loss
carryforwards totaled $500million and $1882million
at December31, 2006 and 2005, respectively. These net
operating loss carryforwards begin to expire between 2010 and
2024. In 2006, the remaining net operating loss carryforwards
are from acquired subsidiaries that are limited under Internal
Revenue Code Section382. In the event that the Company
generates taxable income to utilize these net operating loss
carryforwards, goodwill will be reduced by $90million.   The Company has not provided for U.S.deferred income taxes
or withholding taxes on
non-U.S.subsidiaries
undistributed earnings. These earnings are intended to be
permanently reinvested in operations outside of the U.S.If
these amounts were distributed to the U.S., in the form of
dividends or otherwise, the Company could be subject to
additional U.S.income taxes. It is not practicable to
determine the U.S.federal income tax liability or benefit
on such earnings due to the availability of foreign tax credits
and the complexity of the computation, if such earnings were not
deemed to be permanently reinvested.   As of December31, 2006 the Company had not made a final
determination to maintain WiderThan Americas, Inc., currently a
wholly-owned subsidiary of WiderThan, as a direct subsidiary of
WiderThan or as a direct subsidiary of RealNetworks, Inc. The
determination of the final structure may impact the amount of
deferred tax liability and goodwill, if the decision is made
within a reasonable time from the date of acquisition. In
general, if the decision is made after one year following the
date of acquisition it may impact income tax expense.

2005, and 2004 was $85million, $76million, and
$74million, respectively.   Borrowing Arrangements. The Companys
subsidiary, WiderThan, has entered into three lines of credit
with three Korean domestic banks with an aggregate maximum
available limit of $44million at interest rates ranging
from 15% to 16% over the rate earned on the underlying
deposits. During the year ended December31, 2006 the
Company did not draw on these lines of credit and there were no
outstanding balances as of December31, 2006.   The employees of the Companys subsidiary, WiderThan, use
corporate charge cards issued by a Korean domestic bank with a
total line of credit of up to $56million. The charged
amounts are generally payable in the following month depending
on the billing cycle and are included in accounts payable in the
accompanying consolidated balance sheets. In general, the term
of the agreement is for one year, with automatic renewal in
April of each year. The agreement may be terminated in writing
by mutual agreement between the bank and the Company. The
Company is not subject to any financial or other restrictive
covenants under the terms of this agreement.   The Companys subsidiary, WiderThan, has a letter of credit
of up to $50million with a Korean domestic bank for
importing goods. This letter of credit facility has a one-year
maturity renewable every April, and carries an interest rate
of 25% over the London Inter-Bank Offer Rate LIBOR.
Borrowings under this letter of credit are collateralized by
import documents and goods being imported under such
documentation. To the extent that the Company has any
outstanding balance, the Company is subject to standard
covenants and notice requirements under the terms of this
facility, such as covenants to consult with the lender prior to
engaging in certain events, which include, among others, mergers
and acquisitions or sale of material assets or to furnish
certain financial and other information. The Company is not,
however, subject to any financial covenant requirements or other
restrictive covenants that restrict the Companys ability
to utilize this facility or to obtain financing elsewhere.
During the year ended December31, 2006, the Company did
not draw on the letter of credit and there was no outstanding
balance as of December31, 2006.   The Companys subsidiary, WiderThan, has purchased
guarantees amounting to $600,000 from Seoul Guarantee Insurance
which guarantees payments for one year under certain supply
contracts the Company has with a customer in Korea.   401k Retirement Savings Plan.The Company
has a salary deferral plan 401k Plan that covers
substantially all employees. Under the plan, eligible employees
may contribute up to 50% of their pretax salary, subject to the
Internal Revenue Service annual contribution limits. During the
years ended December31, 2006 and 2005 the Company matched
50% of employee contributions to the 401k Plan, on up to three
percent of participating employees compensation, and
contributed $858,000 and $500,000, respectively, in matching
contributions. The Company did not make matching contributions
during 2004. The Company can terminate the matching
contributions at its discretion. The Company has no other
post-employment or post-retirement benefit plans.   Litigation.In August 2005, a lawsuit was
filed against the Company in the U.S.District Court for
the District of Maryland by Ho Keung Tse, an individual residing
in Hong Kong. The suit alleges that certain of the
Companys products and services infringe the
plaintiffs patent relating to the distribution of
digital files, including sound tracks, music, video and
executable software in a manner which restricts unauthorized
use. The plaintiff seeks to enjoin the Company from the
allegedly infringing activity and to recover treble damages for
the alleged infringement. The Companys co-defendants were
granted a motion to transfer the lawsuit from

STATEMENTSContinued   the District of Maryland to the Northern District of California
in 2006. The Company disputes the plaintiffs allegations
in the action and intends to vigorously defend itself.   In June 2005, an association representing certain music
producers in Korea sent the Companys WiderThan subsidiary
a notice demanding payment of fees for the Companys use in
its carrier application services since July 2004 of songs over
which the association claims it holds certain rights. The
Company used, and paid fees for, these songs under licensing
agreements with independent music label companies and such
agreements contain representations that these music label
companies are the rightful, legal owner of the songs.
Nevertheless, the association is claiming that it is the
rightful owner. The Company is currently investigating the merit
of the associations claims and the scope of any potential
liability. Under the Companys licensing agreements, the
independent music label companies are required to indemnify the
Company for any losses resulting from their breach of
representations. Should the Company become liable to the
association in this matter, the Company intends to exercise its
indemnity rights under its licensing agreements with the
independent music label companies.   In June 2003, a lawsuit was filed against the Company and
Listen.com, Inc. Listen in federal district court for the
Northern District of Illinois by Friskit, Inc. Friskit,
alleging that certain features of the Companys and
Listens products and services willfully infringe certain
patents relating to allowing users to search for streaming
media files, to create custom playlists, and to listen to the
streaming media file sequentially and continuously.
Friskit seeks to enjoin the Company from the alleged infringing
activity and to recover treble damages from the alleged
infringement. The Company has filed its answer and a
counterclaim against Friskit challenging the validity of the
patents at issue. The trial court has also granted the
Companys motion to transfer the action to the Northern
District of California. The Company disputes Friskits
allegations in this action and intends to vigorously defend
itself.   In December 2003, the Company filed suit against Microsoft
Corporation Microsoft in the U.S.District Court for the
Northern District of California, pursuant to U.S. and California
antitrust laws, alleging that Microsoft has illegally used its
monopoly power to restrict competition, limit consumer choice,
and attempt to monopolize the field of digital media. On
October11, 2005, the Company and Microsoft entered into a
settlement agreement pursuant to which the Company agreed to
settle all antitrust disputes worldwide with Microsoft,
including the U.S.litigation. Upon settlement of the legal
disputes, the Company and Microsoft entered into two commercial
agreements that provide for collaboration in digital music and
casual games. The combined contractual payments related to the
settlement agreement and the two commercial agreements to be
made by Microsoft to the Company over the terms of the
agreements are $7610million. As of December31,
2006, Microsoft had paid the Company $6999million under
the agreements for which the Company recorded a gain of
$2204million and $4225million, during 2006 and
2005, respectively, that is included in antitrust litigation
benefit expenses, net in the statement of operations and
comprehensive income loss. The remaining $611million
was received from Microsoft in January 2007.   From time to time the Company is, and expects to continue to be,
subject to legal proceedings and claims in the ordinary course
of its business, including employment claims, contract-related
claims, and claims of alleged infringement of third-party
patents, trademarks and other intellectual property rights.
These claims, including those described above, even if not
meritorious, could force the Company to spend significant
financial and managerial resources. The Company is not aware of
any legal proceedings or claims that the Company believes will
have, individually or taken together, a material adverse effect
on the Companys business, prospects, financial condition
or results of operations. However, the Company may incur
substantial expenses in defending against third-party claims and
certain pending claims are moving closer to trial. The Company
expects that its potential costs of defending these claims may
increase as the disputes move into the trial phase of the
proceedings. In the event of a determination adverse to the
Company, the Company may incur substantial monetary liability,
and/or be
required to change its business practices. Either of these could
have a material adverse effect on the Companys financial
position and results of operations.

contained within many of the Companys customer license and
service agreements, and give rise only to the disclosure
requirements prescribed by FINNo45.   Indemnification and warranty provisions contained within the
Companys customer license and service agreements are
generally consistent with those prevalent in the Companys
industry. The duration of the Companys product warranties
generally does not exceed 90days following delivery of the
Companys products. The Company has not incurred
significant obligations under customer indemnification or
warranty provisions historically and does not expect to incur
significant obligations in the future. Accordingly, the Company
does not maintain accruals for potential customer
indemnification or warranty-related obligations.

CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTSContinued   Results for the quarter ended December31, 2006 include the
acquisition of WiderThan.   The operating income and net income during the quarter ended
December31, 2005 was higher compared to the other periods
presented due primarily to the impact of the settlement and
commercial agreements with Microsoft. For further discussion
regarding these agreements, refer to Note15,
Litigation.   In May 2005, the Company entered into a purchase agreement with
a third-party vendor to acquire certain products and services.
The Company was to be invoiced for the products and services at
the time of receipt by the vendor. During the quarter ended
December31, 2005, the Company decided to cancel the
purchase agreement. As a result, the Company recorded a loss of
$85million during the quarter ended December31,
2005 in order to reflect the products and services that have
been delivered, or to which the Company had committed, at their
net realizable value.   
91 Table of Contents   REPORT OF
INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM   The Board of Directors and Shareholders   RealNetworks, Inc.   We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of
RealNetworks, Inc. and subsidiaries as of December31, 2006
and 2005, and the related consolidated statements of operations
and comprehensive income loss, shareholders equity and
cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended
December31, 2006. These consolidated financial statements
are the responsibility of the Companys management. Our
responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated
financial statements based on our audits.   We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the
Public Company Accounting Oversight Board United States. Those
standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are
free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a
test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in
the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the
accounting principles used and significant estimates made by
management, as well as evaluating the overall financial
statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a
reasonable basis for our opinion.   In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred
to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial
position of RealNetworks, Inc. and subsidiaries as of
December31, 2006 and 2005, and the results of their
operations and their cash flows for each of the years in the
three-year period ended December31, 2006, in conformity
with U.S.generally accepted accounting principles.   As discussed in Note1 to the consolidated financial
statements, effective January1, 2006, the Company adopted
the provision of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards
No123 revised 2004, Share-Based Payment.   We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the
Public Company Accounting Oversight Board United States, the
effectiveness of RealNetworks, Inc.s internal control over
financial reporting as of December31, 2006, based on
criteria established in Internal Control Integrated
Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of
the Treadway Commission COSO, and our report dated
February26, 2007 expressed an unqualified opinion on
managements assessment of, and the effective operation of,
internal control over financial reporting.   /s/KPMG
LLP   Seattle, Washington   February26, 2007   
92 Table of Contents   REPORT OF
INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM   The Board of Directors and Shareholders   RealNetworks, Inc.   We have audited managements assessment, included in the
accompanying Managements Annual Report on Internal Control
over Financial Reporting, appearing under Item9A, that
RealNetworks, Inc. maintained effective internal control over
financial reporting as of December31, 2006, based on
criteria established in Internal Control Integrated
Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of
the Treadway Commission COSO. The Companys management is
responsible for maintaining effective internal control over
financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness
of internal control over financial reporting. Our responsibility
is to express an opinion on managements assessment and an
opinion on the effectiveness of the Companys internal
control over financial reporting based on our audit.   We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the
Public Company Accounting Oversight Board United States. Those
standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control
over financial reporting was maintained in all material
respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of
internal control over financial reporting, evaluating
managements assessment, testing and evaluating the design
and operating effectiveness of internal control, and performing
such other procedures as we considered necessary in the
circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable
basis for our opinion.   A companys internal control over financial reporting is a
process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the
reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of
financial statements for external purposes in accordance with
generally accepted accounting principles. A companys
internal control over financial reporting includes those
policies and procedures that 1pertain to the maintenance
of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly
reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the
company; 2provide reasonable assurance that transactions
are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial
statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting
principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company
are being made only in accordance with authorizations of
management and directors of the company; and 3provide
reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of
unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the
companys assets that could have a material effect on the
financial statements.   Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over
financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.
Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future
periods are subject to the risk that controls may become
inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree
of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.   In our opinion, managements assessment that RealNetworks,
Inc. maintained effective internal control over financial
reporting as of December31, 2006, is fairly stated, in all
material respects, based on criteria established in Internal
Control Integrated Framework issued by the Committee
of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission COSO.
Also, in our opinion, RealNetworks, Inc. maintained, in all
material respects, effective internal control over financial
reporting as of December31, 2006, based on criteria
established in Internal Control Integrated Framework
issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the
Treadway Commission COSO.   RealNetworks, Inc. acquired WiderThan Co., Ltd. during 2006, and
management excluded from its assessment of the effectiveness of
WiderThan Co., Ltd.s internal control over financial
reporting as of December31, 2006, WiderThan Co.,
Ltd.s internal control over financial reporting associated
with total assets of $431,681,000 and net revenue of $26,670,000
included in the consolidated financial statements of
RealNetworks, Inc. as of and for the year ended
December31, 2006. Our audit of internal control over
financial reporting of RealNetworks, Inc. also excluded an
evaluation of the internal control over financial reporting of
WiderThan Co., Ltd.

income loss, shareholders equity and cash flows for each

disclosure controls and procedures as such term is
defined under
Rule13a-15e
and
15d-15e
promulgated under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as
amended the Exchange Act. Based on their evaluation, the
principal executive officer and principal financial officer
concluded that, as of the end of the period covered by this
report, the Companys disclosure controls and procedures
were effective for the purpose of ensuring that the information
required to be disclosed in the reports that the Company files
or submits under the Exchange Act 1is recorded,
processed, summarized, and reported within the time period
specified in the Securities and Exchange Commission rules and
forms and 2is accumulated and communicated to the
Companys management, including its principal executive and
principal financial officers, as appropriate to allow timely
decisions regarding required disclosure.   Managements
Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial
Reporting   Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining
adequate internal control over financial reporting, as such term
is defined in Exchange Act
Rules13a-15f.
Under the supervision and with the participation of our
management, including our principal executive officer and
principal financial officer, we conducted an evaluation of the
effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting
based on the framework in Internal Control
Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring
Organizations of the Treadway Commission COSO. Based on our
evaluation, our management concluded that, as of
December31, 2006, RealNetworks maintained effective
internal control over financial reporting.   In making its assessment of the effectiveness of internal
control over financial reporting as of December31, 2006,
management has excluded WiderThan Co., Ltd. because this company
was acquired on October31, 2006. The assets and net
revenue of WiderThan Co., Ltd., as of and for the twelve months
ended December31, 2006 were $4317million and
$267million, respectively, representing 33% and 7   respectively, of the Companys consolidated assets and net
revenue as of and for the twelve months ended December31,
2006.   KPMG LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, has
issued an attestation report on our managements assessment
of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial
reporting as of December31, 2006. KPMGs attestation
report regarding the effectiveness of managements
assessment of internal control over financial reporting is
included herein.   Changes
in Internal Control over Financial Reporting   The Companys management, with the participation of the
principal executive officer and principal financial officer, has
evaluated the changes to the Companys internal control
over financial reporting that occurred during the fiscal quarter
ended December31, 2006 as required by
paragraphdof
Rules13a-15
and 15d-15
of the Exchange Act and has concluded that there were no such
changes that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely
to materially affect, the Companys internal control over
financial reporting.
