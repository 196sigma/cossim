Item 8. FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTAL DATA                    14             REPORT OF INDEPENDENT ACCOUNTANTS
The Board of Directors and Stockholders
ALGOS PHARMACEUTICAL CORPORATION We have audited the accompanying balance sheets of Algos Pharmaceutical
Corporation a development stage enterprise as of December 31, 1996 and 1995,
and the related statements of operations, stockholders' equity and cash flows
for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 1996. These
financial statements are the responsibility of the Company management. Our
responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on
our audits.
We conducted our audits in accordance with generally accepted auditing
standards. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material
misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting
the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes
assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by
management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.
We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in
all material respects, the financial position of Algos Pharmaceutical
Corporation as of December 31, 1996 and 1995 and the results of its operations
and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31,
1996, in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles.

19             ALGOS PHARMACEUTICAL CORPORATION
A DEVELOPMENT STAGE ENTERPRISE
NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 1. ORGANIZATION
Algos Pharmaceutical Corporation the Company, is engaged primarily in the
development of proprietary pain management pharmaceuticals. Since its formation
in January 1992, the Company has devoted a substantial portion of its efforts to
developing products, licensing technology, filing regulatory applications and
raising capital. The Company is subject to a number of risks common to companies
in similar stages of development including, but not limited to, the lack of
assurance of successful product development, the absence of manufacturing
facilities, and the risk of technological obsolescence.
In May 1996, the Company effected an 83-for-1 stock split in the form of a
stock dividend. All historical share and per share data have been restated to
reflect the stock split.
2. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
Use of Estimates
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted
accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that
affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of
contingent assets and liabilities at the dates of the financial statements and
the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods.
Actual results could differ from those estimates.
Development Stage Enterprise
The accompanying statements have been prepared in accordance with the provisions
of Statement of Financial Accounting Standard SFAS No. 7, Accounting and
Reporting by Development Stage Enterprises.
Cash and Cash Equivalents
The Company considers money market securities with maturities of three months or
less, when purchased, to be cash equivalents.
Property and Equipment, Net
Property and equipment are recorded at cost less accumulated depreciation.
Depreciation is provided on the straight-line method over the estimated useful
lives of the assets which range from three to seven years. Gains and losses on
depreciable assets retired or sold are recognized in the statement of operations
in the year of disposal. Repairs and maintenance expenditures are expensed as
incurred.
Revenue
License fees are recognized as revenue when earned in accordance with the terms
of the underlying agreements.
Income Taxes
The Company accounts for income taxes under the provisions of SFAS No. 109,
Accounting for Income Taxes. SFAS No. 109 requires recognition of deferred tax
assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of temporary
differences between the financial statement and tax bases of assets and
liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect for the years in which the
differences are expected to reverse.
Stock Based Compensation
In October 1996, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued SFAS No. 123,
Accounting for Stock Based Compensation which requires expanded disclosures of
stock-based compensation arrangements with employees and encourages, but does
not require, the recognition of employee compensation expense related to stock
compensation based on the fair value of the equity instrument granted. The
Company has elected to adopt the disclosure requirements of this pronouncement.                    20             ALGOS PHARMACEUTICAL CORPORATION

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Earnings Per Share
Pro forma net loss per common share is based on the net loss and the weighted
average number of common shares after giving effect to the conversion of all
Series A Preferred Stock into 5,872,250 shares of common stock as of January 1,
1995. Pursuant to Securities and Exchange Commission Staff Accounting Bulletin
No. 83, all common stock options and other common stock equivalents granted by
the Company during the twelve months prior to the filing date of the
registration statement for the Company initial public offering of common stock
have been included in the calculation of pro forma weighted average common
shares outstanding as if they were outstanding for all periods prior to the
offering. Stock options and warrants granted prior to this twelve-month period
have not been included in the calculation of net loss per common share because
inclusion of such shares would be antidilutive.
Historical net loss per common share is based on the weighted average number of

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 7. INCOME TAXES
Prior to March 1, 1994, the Company had elected to be treated as an S
Corporation for federal income tax reporting purposes. Under this election, the
Company stockholders were responsible for reporting the Company federal
taxable loss on their personal tax returns. In connection with the issuance of
Series A Preferred Stock, the Company S status terminated and the corporation
converted to C Corporation status. The C Corporation assumed the tax bases of
the assets and liabilities of the S Corporation as of the termination date.
Accordingly, the Company records deferred taxes for the effect of cumulative
temporary differences in accordance with the provisions of SFAS No. 109 Accounting for Income Taxes' for federal tax purposes as of the termination
date. For state tax purposes, the Company has been treated as a C Corporation
since inception. At December 31, 1996, the Company had available net operating
loss carryforwards and research and development credits for federal income tax
purposes of approximately $4,000,000 and $149,000, respectively, which expire in
the years 2009 through 2011. The use of these net operating loss and credit
carryforwards may be subject to limitations under section 382 of the Internal
Revenue Code pertaining to changes in stock ownership. Due to the uncertainty of
their realization, no income tax benefits have been recorded by the Company for
these net operating loss or credit carryforwards as valuation allowances have
been established for any such benefits. The increase in the valuation allowance
amounted to $406,100, $906,300 and $1,122,200 in 1994, 1995, and 1996
respectively. Deferred tax assets and liabilities for federal and state income
taxes consist of the following                                    December 31

management technology which requires the Company to pay royalties based on sales
of licensed products and a share of royalties received from sublicensees.
Leases
Rent expense for the Company office facilities amounted to $12,608, $21,841 22,475 for the years ended December 31, 1994, 1995, and 1996 respectively and
$67,924 cumulatively from the date of inception. Minimum lease payments amount
to $56,607 in 1997 when the Company current lease agreement expires.
9. SIGNIFICANT AGREEMENTS
In June 1996, the Company entered into a license agreement with McNeil Consumer
Products Company, an affiliate of Johnson & Johnson, which provides McNeil with
exclusive worldwide marketing rights to certain of the Company products under
development. The Company received an initial payment of $2,000,000 in 1996 and
may receive additional payments based on the achievement of certain milestones.
McNeil will be responsible for substantially all of the remaining development
costs subsequent to an initial clinical study funded by the Company in 1996. In
addition, the Company will receive royalties based on sales of licensed
products, if any. The agreement may be terminated by McNeil after one year.
In December 1996, the Company entered into a development and marketing
collaboration and license agreement with Interneuron Pharmaceuticals, Inc. for
the development and commercialization of a product to treat acute migraine
headache. The agreement grants to Interneuron rights, co-exclusive with Algos,
to use Algos patents and know-how                    22             ALGOS PHARMACEUTICAL CORPORATION

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
to manufacture and market the product. After an initial stage of development,
which will be largely funded by Interneuron, the agreement provides that the
companies will generally share equally the remaining development costs,
including pre-clinical studies, clinical trials, and regulatory activities, and
similarly share in marketing and profits of the resulting product, if any. After
the initial stage of development, the agreement may be terminated by either
Company with the terminating party retaining an interest in a resulting product,
either in the form of a royalty on sales or the repayment of certain of its
development costs.
In 1996, the Company contributed certain intangible assets having no book value
to a newly formed company, and received preferred stock with an aggregate stated
value and liquidation preference of $2,800,000 and all of the transferee
common stock. The common stock was subsequently distributed to the Company
stockholders, warrant holders and certain of its employees. The preferred stock
provides for an annual cumulative dividend of 30%, which may be paid in the form
of cash or common stock, and a share of other earnings. The preferred stock may
be redeemed for the stated value plus accrued dividends at any time at the
transferee option or at the Company option at the end of two years. The
Company recorded no gain in connection with the transactions as management
believes that at the present time realization of the redemption value is not
assured.
10. STOCKHOLDERS' EQUITY
The Company is authorized to issue 10,000,000 shares of $01 par value per share
preferred stock with rights, preferences and limitations determined by the Board
of Directors of the Company, 100,000 of which have been designated Series B. In
1996, the Company issued 100,000 shares of convertible Series B Preferred Stock
in connection with an amendment to a license agreement with a university and
recorded an administrative expense of $915,000. Shares of Series B Preferred
Stock carry dividend rights equal to shares of Common Stock and are convertible
into an equal number of shares of Common Stock at any time on or after February
1, 1997. In connection with the Company initial public offering of Common
Stock, all shares of previously issued Series A Preferred Stock were converted
to Common Stock and Preferred Stock warrants were converted to Common Stock
warrants at a rate of 830 common shares for each preferred share or warrant.
Preferred Stock consists of the following                                    December 31,

11. OTHER RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS
Certain directors and shareholders of the Company have been associated with law
firms that rendered various legal services to the Company. The Company recorded
charges of approximately $163,000, $16,000 and $443,000 in 1994, 1995, and 1996
respectively, and $625,000 from the date of inception, for these services,
including services rendered in connection with issuances of stock. As of
December 31, 1995 and 1996, $2,500 and $4,500 of these charges were unpaid,
respectively.
12. STOCK OPTION PLANS
The 1996 Stock Option Plan authorizes the grant of non-qualified stock options
and incentive stock options to purchase shares of Common Stock covering 415,000
authorized but unissued or reacquired shares of Common Stock. Unless sooner
terminated by the Board of Directors, the 1996 Option Plan will expire on
January 31, 2006. The Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors has the
authority to select the persons to whom grants are to be made, to designate the
number of shares of Common Stock to be covered by such grants, to determine the
exercise price of options, to establish the period of exercisability of options,
and to take all other actions for the administration of the 1996 Option Plan.
The 1996 Option Plan permits the payment of the option exercise price to be made
in cash or                     23             ALGOS PHARMACEUTICAL CORPORATION

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
by delivery of shares of Common Stock valued at their fair market value on the
date of exercise or delivery of other property, or by a recourse promissory note
payable to the Company, or by a combination of the foregoing.
The 1996 Non-Employee Director Stock Option Plan covers 83,000 authorized but
unissued or reacquired shares of Common Stock and is intended to assist the
Company in attracting and retaining qualified non-employee directors. The
Director Plan is administered by the Board of Directors and provides for
automatic grants of non-qualified stock options to purchase 10,000 shares of
Common Stock to each non-employee director at the time of appointment or
election to the Board of Directors. The exercise price of the options shall be
the fair market value of a share of Common Stock on the date of grant. Each
option shall generally become exercisable in cumulative annual installments of
one-third on each of the first three annual meetings of the Company
stockholders following the date of grant so long as the non-employee director
continues to serve as a director of the Company. In addition, each non-employee
director shall be granted an option to purchase 5,000 shares of Common Stock
on an annual basis. Unless sooner terminated by the Board of Directors, the
Director Plan will expire in 2006.

1996, respectively: no dividend yield for all years, risk-free interest rates of
67%, 60%, and 62%, expected lives of 39, 10, and 39, and expected
volatility of 55% after October 1996.
