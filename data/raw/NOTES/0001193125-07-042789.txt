Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements Note 1: Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Principles of Consolidation. The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Tupperware Brands Corporation and all of its subsidiaries Tupperware Brands, the Company. All significant intercompany accounts and
transactions have been eliminated. The Company acquired the direct selling businesses of Sara Lee Corporation on December5, 2005 the Acquisition or the Acquired Units, and the results of operations of the Acquired
Units are included as of that date. The Companys fiscal year ends on the last Saturday of December. As a result, the 2006 and 2004 fiscal years contain 52 weeks as compared with 53 weeks for fiscal year 2005. Use of Estimates. The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of
America requires management to make estimates and assumptions. These estimates and assumptions affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent liabilities at the date of the financial statements, as well as the
reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from these estimates. In May 2005, the
FASB issued SFAS 154, Accounting Changes and Error Corrections. This statement replaces APB No20, Accounting Changes and SFAS 3, Accounting Changes in Interim Financial Statements, and changed the requirements for the
accounting for and reporting of a change in accounting principle. The statement required retrospective application to prior periods financial statements of changes in accounting principle, unless it was impracticable to determine either the
period-specific effects or the cumulative effect of the change. This statement was effective for all accounting changes and corrections of errors in fiscal years beginning after December15, 2005. The Company has adopted all components of this
standard without material impact. Cash and Cash Equivalents. The Company considers all highly liquid investments with a maturity of
three months or less when purchased to be cash equivalents. As of December30, 2006 and December31, 2005, $334 million and $790 million, respectively, of the cash and cash equivalents included on the consolidated balance sheets were
held in the form of time deposits, certificates of deposit, high grade commercial paper, or similar instruments. Included in the cash
balance of $1022 million reported at the end of 2006, the Company had a cash balance of $103 million denominated in Venezuelan bolivars. The balance was primarily a result of favorable operating cash flows in the market. Due toVenezuelan
government restrictions on transfers of cash out of the country and control of exchange rates, the Company can not immediately repatriate this cash attheexchange rate used to translate the Venezuelan bolivars into U.S. dollars for
inclusion on the Companys consolidated balance sheet. It has applied for, and expects to receive, authorization in 2007 to transfer approximately half of the balance out of the country. It has also implemented other strategies in an effort to
eventuallyrepatriate the entire amount.The Company believes it couldimmediately repatriate the cash from Venezuela,but only at a significantly less favorable exchange rate. This would result in the Company having fewer U.S.
dollars than currently reported as a component of cash and cash equivalents on its consolidated balance sheet with the difference recorded as a foreign exchange loss in its consolidated income statement. Allowance for Doubtful Accounts. The Company maintains current and long-term receivable amounts with most of its independent distributors and
sales force in certain markets. The Company regularly monitors and assesses its risk of not collecting amounts owed to it by customers. This evaluation is based upon an analysis of amounts currently and past due along with relevant history and facts
particular to the customer. It is also based upon estimates of distributor business prospects, particularly related to the evaluation of the recoverability of long-term amounts due. This evaluation is performed market by market and account by
account based upon historical experience, market penetration levels, access to alternative channels and similar factors. It also considers collateral of the customer that could be recovered to satisfy debts. The Company records its allowance 
43 Table of Contents
for uncollectible accounts based on the results of this analysis. The analysis requires the Company to make significant estimates and as such, changes in
facts and circumstances could result in material changes in the allowance for doubtful accounts. Inventories. Inventories are
valued at the lower of cost or market. Inventory cost includes cost of raw material, labor and overhead. Domestically produced Tupperware inventories, approximately three percent of consolidated inventories at December30, 2006 and
December31, 2005, are valued on the last-in, first-out LIFO cost method. The first-in, first-out FIFO cost method is used for the remaining inventories. If inventories valued on the LIFO method had been valued using the FIFO method, they
would have been $36 million and $49 million higher at the end of 2006 and 2005, respectively. The Company writes down its inventory for obsolescence or unmarketable items equal to the difference between the cost of the inventory and estimated
market value based upon expected future demand. The demand is estimated based upon the historical success of product lines as well as the projected success of promotional programs, new product introductions and new markets or distribution channels.
The Company prepares projections of demand on an item by item basis for all of its products. If inventory on hand exceeds projected demand, the excess inventory is written down to its net realizable value. However, if actual demand is less than
projected by management, additional write-downs may be required. In November 2004, the FASB issued SFAS 151, Inventory Costsan
amendment of ARB no. 43, Chapter 4. This statement amended the guidance in ARB No43, Chapter 4, Inventory Pricing, to clarify the accounting for abnormal amounts of idle facility expense, freight, handling costs and wasted material
spoilage. It was effective for fiscal years beginning after June15, 2004 and did not have a material impact on the Company. Internal Use Software Development Costs. The Company capitalizes internal use software development costs as they are incurred and amortizes such costs over their estimated useful lives of three to five years beginning when the
software is placed in service. In December 2005, the Company capitalized $13 million of software development costs as part of the assets recorded resulting from the Acquisition. This amount represented the fair market value of internal use software
development costs at the acquisition date as determined by an internal analysis performed by the Company. The Company recorded these and all other previously capitalized internal use software development costs in property, plant and equipment. Net
unamortized costs included in property, plant and equipment were $177 million and $161 million at December30, 2006 and December31, 2005, respectively. Amortization cost related to internal use software development costs totaled $41
million, $50 million and $47 million in 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. Property, Plant and Equipment. Property, plant and
equipment are initially stated at cost. The Company recorded property, plant and equipment arising from the Acquisition at its fair market value as determined by the review of an independent third party with expertise in such valuation judgments.
Depreciation is determined on a straight-line basis over the following estimated useful lives of the assets:  Building and improvements
10 40 years Molds
4 years Production equipment
10 20 years Distribution equipment
3 5 years Computer/telecom equipment
3 5 years Capitalized software
3 5 years
Depreciation expense was $437 million, $441 million and $461 million in 2006, 2005 and 2004,
respectively. The Company considers the need for an impairment review when events occur that indicate that the book value of a long-lived asset may exceed its recoverable value. Impairments are discussed further in Note 3 to 
44 Table of Contents
the consolidated financial statements. Upon the sale or retirement of property, plant and equipment, a gain or loss is recognized equal to the difference
between sales price and net book value. Expenditures for maintenance and repairs are charged to DSA expense. In December 2004, the
FASB issued SFAS 153, Exchanges of Non-monetary Assetsan amendment of APB Opinion No29. The amendments eliminate the exception to fair value accounting for non-monetary exchanges of similar productive assets and replace it with a
broader exception for exchanges of non-monetary assets that do not have commercial substance. Under APB 29, accounting for an exchange of a productive asset for a similar productive asset or an equivalent interest in the same or similar productive
asset is to be based upon the recorded amount of the asset relinquished carryover basis with no gain or loss recognition.The transaction will now be accounted for based upon the fair value of the assets exchanged. The Statement was effective
for exchanges occurring in fiscal years beginning after June15, 2005 and is to be applied prospectively.This Statement has not had a material impact on the Company. Goodwill. Goodwill represents the excess of cost over the fair value of net assets acquired. The Companys recorded goodwill was
predominantly generated by the Acquisition in December 2005 and the acquisition of BeautiControl in October 2000. The Company uses discounted future cash flow estimates to determine the fair market value of the Acquired Units and BeautiControl
operations worldwide for purposes of conducting impairment reviews. The annual impairment reviews for the Acquisition and BeautiControl goodwill were completed in the third and second quarters, respectively, and no impairment charges were necessary.
The goodwill recorded on the Companys balance sheet at December30, 2006 which is primarily included in the International Beauty and BeautiControl North America segments, was $2736 million and $390 million, respectively, with smaller
amounts included in the Europe, Asia Pacific and North America segments. Other Intangible Assets. Other intangible assets are
recorded at their fair market values at the date of acquisition in accordance with the provisions of SFAS 141, Business Combinations and definite lived intangibles are amortized over their estimated useful lives in accordance with SFAS 142,
Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets. The other intangible assets included in the Companys consolidated financial statements at December30, 2006 and December31, 2005 are primarily related to the Acquisition and are recorded
at their respective fair market values. The value of other intangible assets and weighted average estimated useful lives excluding the impact of foreign currency translation are as follows:  December30, 2006

Company had no amortizable intangibles during 2004. The estimated aggregate annual amortization expense associated with the above intangibles for each of the five succeeding years is $127 million, $87 million, $54 million, $38 million and $27
million, respectively. Promotional and Other Accruals. The Company frequently makes promotional offers to members of its
independent sales force to encourage them to fulfill specific goals or targets for sales levels, party attendance, recruiting of new sales force members or other business-critical functions. The awards offered are in the form of cash, product
awards, special prizes or trips. A program is generally designed to recognize sales force members for achieving a primary
objective.An example is to reward the independent sales force for recruiting new sales force members.In this situation, the 
45 Table of Contents
Company offers a prize to sales force members that achieve a targeted number of recruits over a specified period.The period runs from a couple of weeks
to several months.The prizes are generally graded in that meeting one level may result in receiving a piece of jewelry with higher achievement resulting in more valuable prizes such as televisions and trips. Similar programs are designed to
reward current sales force members who reach certain goals by promoting them to a higher level in the organization where their earning opportunity would be expanded and they would take on additional responsibilities for recruiting new sales force
members and providing training and motivation to new and existing sales force members.Other business drivers such as the scheduling of new direct selling demonstrations, increasing the number of sales force members holding parties or
increasing end consumer attendance at parties may also be the focus of a program. The Company also offers cash awards for achieving
targeted sales levels.These types of awards are generally based upon the sales achievement of at least a mid-level member of the sales force and his or her down-line members.The down-line consists of those sales force members that have
been recruited directly by a given sales force member, as well as those recruited by his or her recruits.In this manner, sales force members can build an extensive organization over time if they are committed to recruiting and developing their
units.In addition to the bonus, the positive performance of a unit may also entitle its leader to the use of a company-provided vehicle and in some cases, the permanent awarding of a vehicle. Similar to the prize program noted earlier, these
programs generally offer varying levels of vehicles that are dependent upon performance. The Company accrues for the costs of these awards
during the period over which the sales force qualifies for the award and reports these costs primarily as delivery, sales and administrative expense. These accruals require estimates as to the cost of the awards based upon estimates of achievement
and actual cost to be incurred. During the qualification period, actual results are monitored and changes to the original estimates that are necessary are made when known. Total promotional expenses included in delivery, sales and administrative
expense were $2516 million, $2152 and $1966 million for 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. Like promotional accruals, other accruals
are recorded at the time when the liability is probable and the amount is reasonably estimable. Adjustments to amounts previously accrued are made when changes in the facts and circumstances that generated the accrual occur. Revenue Recognition. Revenue is recognized when goods are shipped to customers and the risks and rewards of ownership have passed to the customer
who, in most cases, is one of the Companys independent directors or distributors or a member of its independent sales force. When revenue is recorded, estimates of returns are made and recorded as a reduction of revenue. Discounts earned based
on promotional programs in place, volume of purchases or other factors are also estimated at the time of revenue recognition and recorded as a reduction of that revenue. Shipping and Handling Costs. The cost of products sold line item includes costs related to the purchase and manufacture of goods sold by the Company. Among these costs are inbound freight charges, purchasing
and receiving costs, inspection costs, internal transfer costs, and warehousing costs of raw material, work in process and packing materials. The warehousing and distribution costs of finished goods are included in the delivery, sales and
administrative expense line item. Distribution costs are comprised of outbound freight and associated labor costs. Fees billed to customers associated with the distribution of its products are classified as revenue. The shipping and handling costs
included in delivery, sales and administrative expense in 2006, 2005 and 2004 were $856 million, $658 million and $608 million, respectively. Advertising and Research and Development Costs. Advertising and research and development costs are charged to expense as incurred. Advertising expense totaled $147 million, $89 million and $75 million 2006, 2005 and 2004,
respectively. Research and development costs totaled $156 million, $139 million and $130 million, in 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. Research and development expenses primarily include salaries, contractor costs and facility costs. Both
advertising and research and development costs are included in delivery, selling and administrative expenses. 
46 Table of Contents
Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation. The Company has several stock-based employee and director
compensation plans, which are described more fully in Note 12 to the consolidated financial statements. Through 2002, the Company accounted for those plans under the intrinsic value recognition and measurement principles of Accounting Principles
Board Opinion No25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees, and related Interpretations. Effective with fiscal 2003, the Company began accounting for those plans using the fair-value-based method of accounting for stock options under
the provisions of SFAS 123, Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation, prospectively to all employee awards granted, modified, or settled after December28, 2002 as permitted under the transition guidance of SFAS 148, Accounting for
Stock-Based CompensationTransition and Disclosurean amendment of FAS 123. Awards under the Companys plans vest over periods up to seven years. Compensation cost for options that vest on a graduated schedule is recorded over
that time period. Therefore, the cost related to the stock-based employee compensation included in the determination of net income for 2005 and 2004 is less than that which would have been recognized if the fair-value-based method had been applied
to all awards since the original effective date of SFAS 123. Compensation expense associated with restricted stock grants is equal to the market value of the shares on the date of grant and is recorded pro rata over the required holding period. For
those restricted stock grants with performance criteria, the expense is recorded based on an assessment of achieving the criteria. Compensation expense associated with restricted stock grants was $25 million, $14 million and $06 million in 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. The following table illustrates the effect on net income and earnings per share if the fair
value recognition provisions of SFAS No123R had been applied to stock-based compensation since its effective date.  In millions except per share amounts

model with the following assumptions: dividend yield of 43 percent for 2006, 42 percent for 2005 and 51 percent for 2004 grants; expected volatility of 27 percent for 2006, 29 percent for 2005 and 40 percent for 2004; risk-free interest rates of
46 percent for 2006, 44 percent for 2005 and 39 percent for 2004; and expected lives of 6 years for 2006 and 2005 and 8 years for 2004. On March29, 2005, the Staff of the SEC issued Staff Accounting Bulletin No107 SAB 107, Share-Based Payment. SAB 107 was issued to provide guidance on SFAS 123R and its interaction with certain SEC rules and
regulations and to provide the SEC staff views regarding valuation of share-based payment arrangements. On April14, 2005, the SEC adopted a new rule through release number 33-8568, Amendment to Rule 4-01a of Regulation S-X regarding the
Compliance Date for Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No123 Revised 2004, Share-based Payment, to amend the effective date of SFAS 123R for registrants to fiscal years beginning after December15, 2005. As such,
effective January1, 2006, the Company adopted the provisions of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No123R, Share-Based Payment, and related interpretations, or SFAS 123R, to account for stock-based compensation using
the modified prospective transition method and therefore did not restate prior period results. SFAS 123R supersedes Accounting Principles Board Opinion 
47 Table of Contents
No25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees, and revises guidance in SFAS 123, Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation. Among other
things, SFAS 123R requires that compensation expense be recognized in the financial statements for share-based awards based on the grant date fair value of those awards. The modified prospective transition method applies to aunvested stock
options outstanding as of December31, 2005 and granted prior to December29, 2002, when the Company began recognizing in income the fair value of all newly issued or modified stock-based compensation awards under SFAS 123, and
bany new share-based awards granted subsequent to December31, 2005. Stock-based compensation expense in 2006 also includes the cumulative effect of estimating forfeitures as part of the fair value measurement that the Company
previously accounted for based on actual activity. This change had no material impact on results of operations. In 2005, the SEC Staff
offered its views on how companies should address non-substantive vesting conditions, such as retirement eligibility provisions, of share-based payment awards under SFAS 123, Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation, and APB 25, Accounting
for Stock Issued to Employees. Under SFAS 123 and APB 25, it specifies that awards are vested when the employees retention of the award is no longer contingent on providing subsequent service. The SEC clarified this provision to specify
that this would be the case for awards issued to employees who are or become retirement eligible during the vesting period when the award provides for accelerated vesting upon retirement. However, the prevalent accounting for this situation had been
to recognize the compensation cost over the nominal vesting period the vesting terms of the award. Companies that had been using this method, including the Company, were advised to continue doing so until adopting the provisions under SFAS 123R.
Upon adoption of 123R, any new grants going forward are to be recognized as compensation immediately if issued to individuals who are already retirement eligible, or vest over the period of time the individuals will become retirement eligible if
it is prior to the nominal vesting period of the grant. The impact to the Company of using this vesting approach for its 2006 grants was to accelerate recognition of $15 million of compensation expense. This is reflected in the amounts above.
The table below summarizes the impact on results of operations for the year ended December30, 2006, of expensing, under the
provisions of SFAS 123R, unvested options granted prior to December29, 2002:  in millions, except per share data
Year EndedDecember30,2006 Stock-based compensation expense 08 Income tax benefit 03 Net decrease in net income 05 Decrease in income per common share Basic 001 Diluted 001 SFAS 123 Rrequires the benefits associated with tax deductions in excess of recognized
compensation cost, generated upon the exercise of stock options, to be reported as a financing cash flow rather than as an operating cash flow as previously required. For the year ended December30, 2006 the Company did not generate any excess
cash tax benefits from option exercises, while for the year ended December31, 2005, it generated $03 million of such benefits. Additionally, prior to the Companys adoption of SFAS 123R, unearned compensation was presented as a separate component of shareholders equity. In accordance with the provisions of SFAS 123R, on January1, 2006, unearned
compensation was reclassified as additional paid-in-capital on the balance sheet for all periods presented. On August31, 2005, the
FASB issued FSP 123R-1, Classification and Measurement of Freestanding Financial Instruments Originally Issued in Exchange for Employee Services under FASB Statement No123R. The guidance defers the requirements of SFAS 123R that
a freestanding financial instrument originally subject

to Statement 123R becomes subject to the recognition and measurement requirements of other applicable accounting standards when the rights conveyed by the
instrument to the holder are no longer dependent upon the holder being an employee of the Company. A freestanding financial instrument originally issued as employee compensation would be subject to the recognition and measurement provisions of SFAS
123R throughout the life of the instrument, unless its terms are modified after the time the rights conveyed by the instrument are no longer dependent on the holder being an employee. This FSP supersedes guidance in FSP EITF 00-19-1,
Application of EITF Issue No. 00-19 to Freestanding Financial Instruments Originally Issued as Employee Compensation which was issued on May31, 2005. The FSP was effective in conjunction with SFAS 123R which was the first quarter of
2006. There was no impact to the Company upon implementation of the guidance in FSP 123R-1. On October18, 2005, the FASB issued
FSP SFAS 123R-2, Practical Accommodation to the Application of Grant Date as Defined in FASB Statement No123R. Under SFAS 123R, there is a requirement that a mutual understanding of the key terms and conditions of a share-based
payment award has been communicated before a grant can be deemed to have been made. This FSP clarifies that a mutual understanding of the key terms and conditions of the award can be presumed on the date the award is approved if 1the award
is a unilateral grant and the recipient does not have the ability to negotiate key terms and conditions of the award and 2if the key terms and conditions are communicated to the individual recipients within a relatively short time period
from the date of approval. The Company had no impact from the adoption of this standard. Accounting for Asset Retirement
Obligations. In March 2005, the FASB issued FASB Interpretation No47 Accounting for Conditional Asset Retirement Obligations FIN 47, which was issued to clarify the term conditional asset retirement obligation
as used in SFAS, 143 Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations, issued in June 2001. SFAS 143 refers to a companys legal obligation to perform an asset retirement activity in which the timing and or method of settlement are
conditional on a future event that may or may not be within the control of the entity.The obligation to perform the asset retirement activity is unconditional even though uncertainty exists about the timing and or method of
settlement.Thus, the timing and or method of settlement may be conditional on a future event.Accordingly, a company is required to recognize a liability for the fair value of a conditional asset retirement obligation if the fair value
of the liability can be reasonably estimated.The fair value of a liability for the conditional asset retirement obligation should be recognized when incurred-generally upon acquisition, construction, or development and or through the normal
operation of the asset.Uncertainty about the timing and or method of settlement of a conditional asset retirement obligation should be factored into the measurement of the liability when sufficient information exists. In the fourth quarter
of 2005, the Company recognized a liability for the fair market value of conditional future obligations associated with environmental issues at its manufacturing facilities in Belgium and the United States that the Company will be required to remedy
in Belgium in 2007 or 2008 and at some future date in the United States, when these assets are retired. In the fourth quarter of 2005, the Company recognized $08 million of expense, net of $04 million of tax benefit, representing the cumulative
effect of these conditional future obligations. The Company performs an annual evaluation of its obligations regarding this matter and is required to record depreciation and costs associated with accretion of the obligation. This was not material
for 2006 and is not expected to be material in the future. Income Taxes. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the
future tax consequences attributable to temporary differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases. Deferred tax assets also are recognized for credit carryforwards. Deferred tax
assets and liabilities are measured using the enacted rates applicable to taxable income in the years in which the temporary differences are expected to reverse and the credits are expected to be used. The effect on deferred tax assets and
liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date. An assessment is made as to whether or not a valuation allowance is required to offset deferred tax assets. This assessment requires
estimates as to future operating results as well as an evaluation of the effectiveness of the Companys tax planning strategies. These estimates are made on an ongoing basis based upon the Companys business plans and growth strategies in
each market and consequently, future material changes in the valuation allowance are possible.

In July 2006, the FASB issued FASB Interpretation No48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes
FIN 48. FIN 48 clarifies the accounting for income taxes by prescribing a minimum probability threshold that a tax position must meet before a financial statement benefit is recognized. The minimum threshold is defined in FIN 48 as a tax position
that is more likely than not to be sustained upon examination by the applicable taxing authority, including resolution of any related appeals or litigation processes, based on the technical merits of the position. The tax benefit to be recognized is
measured as the largest amount of benefit that is greater than 50 percent likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement. FIN 48 must be applied to all existing tax positions upon initial adoption. The cumulative effect of applying FIN 48 at
adoption, if any, is to be reported as an adjustment to opening retained earnings for the year of adoption. FIN 48 is effective for the Companys 2007 fiscal year. The Company is currently assessing the potential effect of FIN 48 on its
financial statements. Interest and penalties related to tax contingency or settlement items are recorded as a component of the provision
for income taxes on the Companys statement of income. The Company records accruals for tax contingencies as a component of accrued liabilities or other long-term liabilities on its balance sheet. Net Income Per Common Share. Basic per share information is calculated by dividing net income by the weighted average number of shares
outstanding. Diluted per share information is calculated by also considering the impact of potential common stock on both net income and the weighted average number of shares outstanding. The Companys potential common stock consists of
employee and director stock options and restricted stock. Restricted stock is excluded from the basic per share calculation and is included in the diluted per share calculation when doing so would not be anti-dilutive. The common stock elements of
the earnings per share computations are as follows in millions:  2006

Derivative Financial Instruments. The Company recognizes all derivative instruments as
either assets or liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets and measures those instruments at fair value. If certain conditions are met, a derivative may be specifically designated as a hedge. The accounting for changes in the value of a
derivative accounted for as a hedge depends on the intended use of the derivative and the resulting designation of the hedge exposure. Depending on how the hedge is used and the designation, the gain or loss due to changes in value is reported
either in earnings or in other comprehensive income. Gains or losses that are reported in other comprehensive income eventually are recognized in earnings; with the timing of this recognition governed by SFAS 133, Accounting for Derivative
Instruments and Hedging Activities, as amended by SFAS 149, Amendment of Statement 133 on Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities SFAS 149, and SFAS 138, Accounting for Certain Derivative Instruments and Certain Hedging
Activities. In February 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No159, The Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and Financial
Liabilities SFAS No159. SFAS No159 permits companies to choose to measure certain financial instruments and certain other items at fair value. The standard requires that unrealized gains and losses on items for which the fair
value option has been elected be reported in earnings. SFAS No159 is effective for the company beginning in the first quarter of fiscal year 2008, although earlier adoption is permitted. The company is currently evaluating the impact that
SFAS No159 will have on its consolidated financial statements.

The Company uses derivative financial instruments, principally over-the-counter forward exchange
contracts and local currency options with major international financial institutions, to offset the effects of exchange rate changes on net investments in certain foreign subsidiaries, forecasted purchase commitments, certain intercompany loan
transactions and the value of international cash flows. Gains and losses on instruments designated as hedges of net investments in a foreign subsidiary or intercompany transactions that are permanent in nature are accrued as exchange rates change,
and are recognized in shareholders equity, as foreign currency translation adjustments. Forward points and option costs associated with these net investment hedges are included in interest expense and other expense, respectively. Gains and
losses on contracts designated as hedges of intercompany transactions that are not permanent in nature are accrued as exchange rates change and are recognized in income. Gains and losses on contracts designated as hedges of identifiable foreign
currency firm commitments are deferred and included in the measurement of the related foreign currency transaction. Contracts hedging non-permanent intercompany transactions and identifiable foreign currency firm commitments are held to maturity. In
2005 the Company utilized interest rate swap agreements to convert a portion of its fixed-rate U.S. dollar long-term debt to floating rate U.S. dollar debt. Changes in the fair value of the swaps resulting from changes in market interest rates were
recorded as a component of net income which offset the changes in the related long-term debt. Finally, the Company has entered into a series of euro put options that it considers to be a hedge of a portion of its expected current year
euro-denominated cash flow from operating activities. However, these options are not considered to be a hedge under U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, and therefore when they are marked to market at the end of each accounting period,
gain or losses will be included as a component of other income or expense, as applicable. See Note 7 to the consolidated financial statements. Foreign Currency Translation. Results of operations of foreign subsidiaries are translated into U.S. dollars using the average exchange rates during the year. The assets and liabilities of those subsidiaries, other than those of
operations in highly inflationary countries, are translated into U.S. dollars using exchange rates at the balance sheet date. The related translation adjustments are included in accumulated other comprehensive loss. Foreign currency transaction
gains and losses, as well as re-measurement of financial statements of subsidiaries in highly inflationary countries, are included in income. Product Warranty. Tupperware brand
products are guaranteed against chipping, cracking, breaking or peeling under normal non-commercial use of the product. The cost of replacing defective products is not material. Reclassifications. Certain prior year amounts have been reclassified in the consolidated financial statements to conform to current year
presentation. The statement of cash flows for 2005 includes a reclassification between net cash provided by operating activities and net
cash from financing activities. In the fourth quarter of 2005 the Company made make-whole payments of $22 million related to the early repayment of its 791 percent Notes due 2011 and six million dollars for the discharge of obligations related to
$100 million of notes due in 2006 see Note 7 to the consolidated financial statements. These payments were included in the statement of cash flows as a $274 million increase to net income in arriving at net cash provided by operating activities
and a decrease to net cash from financing activities for the same amount. Within the 2005 statement of income the $274 million was recorded as interest expense. This reclassification reduced the Companys 2005 net cash provided by operating activities by $274 million to $1402 million versus $1676 million as previously disclosed and increased the Companys 2005
net cash from financing activities by the same amount to $4595 million versus $4321 million as previously disclosed. There was no change to the net increase in cash and cash equivalents. Additionally, none of the Companys debt covenants were
affected by the reclassification.

Note 2: Business Combination On December5, 2005, Tupperware Brands acquired 100 percent of the net assets of the direct selling businesses of Sara Lee Corporation and originally included these businesses in the International Beauty segment.
See Note 13 for a description of the composition of the International Beauty segment. The Acquired Units sell a wide variety of consumable products, primarily color cosmetics, skin care, fragrances and toiletries in 21 countries in North and South
America, Asia Pacific, Southern Africa and Europe under the brand names House of Fuller, Nutrimetics, NaturCare, Avroy
Shlain, Nuvo Cosmeticos and Swissgarde through a sales force of 898,000 independent consultants as of December30, 2006.
This acquisition was made to advance the strategy, begun with the acquisition of BeautiControl in 2000, of adding consumable items to the product category mix by expanding into beauty and personal care products. The results of operations for the
Acquired Units are included in the Companys Consolidated Statement of Income beginning on the acquisition date. The acquisition cost
was $5692 million in cash. The acquisition and the retirement of the Companys then existing $250 million in long term notes, was funded through cash on hand and a new $775 million secured seven-year term loans which carry an interest rate of
LIBOR plus 150 basis points. The total cost of the acquisition has been allocated to the assets acquired and the liabilities assumed based on their respective fair values at the date of acquisition, in accordance with SFAS 141, Business
Combinations. Goodwill, none of which is deductible for tax purposes, and other intangibles recorded in connection with the acquisition totaled $2564 and $2397 on December30, 2006, respectively, and are reported primarily within the
International Beauty segment with $299 million and $527 million in the Europe and Asia Pacific segments, respectively. The goodwill and intangible assets include a cumulative adjustment for foreign currency translation of $16 million and $21
million, respectively. The goodwill amounts recognized in the acquisition resulted primarily from the acquisition of the assembled workforce, including a management team with a proven track record of success in direct selling as well as employed
field representatives in several significant markets. Of the $2630 million of acquired intangible assets, $1974 million was assigned to registered trademarks, which were determined to have indefinite useful lives. Of the remaining balance of
intangible assets acquired, $620 million was assigned to sales force relationships and $36 million was assigned to product formulations which are being amortized over weighted average useful lives of 6 to 12 years and 3 years, respectively.
Aggregate amortization expense associated with the above intangible assets recorded in 2006 and 2005 subsequent to the acquisition date was $237 million and $17 million, respectively, and the estimated annual amortization expense for each of the
five succeeding years is $127 million, $87 million, $54 million, $38 million and $27 million, respectively. The unaudited condensed
pro forma consolidated statements of income for 2005 and 2004, assuming the purchase of the Acquired Units as of the beginning of fiscal 2004 are as follows:  For the Year Ended

Note 3: Re-engineering Costs The Company continually reviews its business models and operating methods for opportunities to increase efficiencies and/or align costs with business performance. Pretax costs incurred in the re-engineering and
impairment charges caption by category were as follows:  In millions

2004
Severance 75 102 25
Asset impairment 01 65 45 Total re-engineering and impairment charges 76 167 70 In 2006, the Company recorded $75 million of severance costs related primarily to actions taken
to reduce headcount at the Companys Canada, Philippines, Australia and European marketing and manufacturing operations. In total, approximately 260 positions were eliminated primarily in the Philippines and Europe. The asset impairment cost of
$01 million was associated with the write down of assets at the Companys Philippines facility. The current values are based on the assets fair market value as determined by market appraisals performed at the time of recording the
impairment. In 2005, the Company recorded $102 million of severance costs related primarily to actions taken to reduce headcount at the
Companys South Carolina, Orlando, Belgium, France and Portugal operations. In total, approximately 350 positions were eliminated primarily in the United States. The shift of manufacturing capacity from the Companys facility in South
Carolina which accounts for inventory using the LIFO basis of valuation to other manufacturing facilities which use the FIFO method of valuation resulted in a reduction in the Companys LIFO reserve of $56 million which is included as part of
cost of products sold See Note 4 to the consolidated financial statements. This shift was completed by the end of 2005. The asset impairment costs of $65 million were primarily associated with write-downs at the Companys United States
facilities including the write-down of certain warehousing and distribution facilities and equipment at the Companys South Carolina facility and its former manufacturing facility in Halls, Tennessee. The current values are based on the
assets fair market value as determined by market appraisals performed during 2006. In 2004 the Company incurred severance costs
related to the reduction in headcount of approximately 220 associated with actions to reduce the sales and marketing function in the U.S. business due to a change in the Companys sales force compensation plan, the rationalization of
manufacturing operations in the Philippines and Japan, and downsizing of operations in North America, Brazil, Korea and New Zealand. Asset impairment costs incurred were primarily the result of write-downs of the book value of certain machinery in
the United States and Philippines manufacturing operations, the Companys former manufacturing facility in Halls, Tennessee and the net investment in the Companys operations in Argentina. Total impairment write-downs are based on the
excess of book value over the estimated fair market values of the assets impaired. Fair values were determined based on quoted market prices and discounted cash flows. Pretax costs incurred in connection with the re-engineering program included above and in cost of products sold were as follows:  In millions

result of re-engineering actions taken in 2006 and is expected to be largely paid out by the end of the first quarter of 2007. The accrual adjustment in 2005 related to the resolution of a litigation claim. The 2004 adjustment was primarily related
to lower severance costs than originally estimated. Note 4: Inventories  In millions

The Company entered into a credit agreement on December5, 2005 Term Loan Facility, in
conjunction with closing the Acquisition. The Credit Agreement provided for $775 million of term loans and a $200 million revolving credit facility that expires December5, 2010 and replaced the Companys then existing revolving credit
facility of the same amount. Proceeds from the term loans were used, largely, to fund the Acquisition, retire existing long-term notes and pay various acquisition fees and expenses. The Term Loan Facility is a floating rate debt instrument but the
Company is required to maintain at least 40 percent of total outstanding debt at fixed rates. Quarterly principal payments of $19 million each began April2, 2006; however, the agreement permits the Company to omit these payments if certain
prepayments have been made during the previous four quarters. The Company made such optional principal prepayments in 2006 totaling $630 million, and therefore the first required quarterly payment is now not due until January2, 2008. The debt
agreement also requires that any proceeds generated by the sale of land be used to pay down the term loan, thus in 2006 additional payments of $128 million were made. A final principal payment of $6305 million is due to be paid on December5,
2012. The debt is secured by substantially all of the Companys domestic assets plus a 65 percent stock pledge of its significant foreign subsidiaries. At December30, 2006, the Company had $3072 million of unused lines of credit, including $1862 million under the committed, secured $200 million revolving line of credit and $1210 million available under
various uncommitted lines around the world. The Company satisfies most of its short-term financing needs utilizing its committed, secured revolving line of credit. Interest paid on total debt, excluding credits from interest rate swaps and forward
contracts, in 2006, 2005, and 2004 was $536 million, $489 million and $150 million, respectively. The interest paid in 2005 includes make whole payments of $219 million relating to the early prepayment of the 791 percent Notes due
2011. It also includes the pre-funding of $60 million of interest due under the terms of the 725 percent Notes that had been due in 2006. Both the 2011 and 2006 Notes were retired in connection with the Acquisition. During 2006, the Company renegotiated a line of credit with a financial institution in Australia. One of the terms for this credit facility required the
Company to grant to the lender a lien on certain real estate located in Australia. This line of credit totals $45 million, and is included in the unused uncommitted lines of credit included above. The real estate used to secure this line of credit
had a book value of $63 million at the end of 2006. The Credit Agreement contains covenants of a similar nature to those under the
previous agreement and customary for similarly rated companies. While the covenants are restrictive and could inhibit the Companys to borrow, to pay dividends, acquire its own stock or make capital investments in its business, this is not
currently expected to occur. The primary financial covenants are a fixed charge coverage ratio, a leverage ratio and an adjusted net worth
requirement. The covenant restrictions include adjusted covenant earnings and net worth measures that are non-GAAP measures. The non-GAAP measures may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other entities and exclude unusual,
non-recurring gains, certain non-cash charges and changes in accumulated other comprehensive income. Discussion of these measures is presented here to provide an understanding of the Companys ability to borrow and to pay dividends should
certain covenants not be met and caution should be used when comparing this information with that of other companies. The Companys
fixed charge ratio is required to be in excess of 105 through September29, 2007 at which point the requirement becomes more difficult to meet as it increases to 120 and then increases annually after the end of each fiscal third quarter until
it reaches 150 after the end of the third quarter of 2010. The leverage ratio must be below 350 through the third quarter of 2007. Beginning with the fourth quarter of 2007 the required ratio declines to 325 through the third quarter of 2008 and
to 275 and 250 in the fourth quarters of 2009 and 2010, respectively, and remains at 250 for the remaining term of the credit agreement. The fixed charge and leverage ratio covenants are based upon trailing four quarter amounts. The
Companys fixed charge and leverage ratios for the year ended December30, 2006 were 142 and 3021 respectively.

The adjusted net worth requirement was $3303 million as of December30, 2006. The requirement
increases quarterly by 50 percent of the Companys consolidated net income. There is no adjustment for losses. The Companys adjusted consolidated net worth at the end of 2006 was $3911 million.  Adjusted net worth in millions

their fair values at December30, 2006 and December31, 2005. The approximate fair value of the Companys term loans was $6692 million at December30, 2006 since the entire issue consists of floating rate debt. The fair value of
the remaining long-term debt approximated its book value at the end of 2006 and 2005. Derivative Financial Instruments Following is a listing of the Companys outstanding derivative financial instruments as of December30, 2006 and December31, 2005:

currency exchange rates on the earnings, cash flows and financial position of its international operations. Although this currency risk is partially mitigated by the natural hedge arising from the Companys local manufacturing in many markets,
a strengthening U.S. dollar generally has a negative impact on the Company. In response to this fact, the Company uses financial instruments to hedge certain of its exposures and to manage the foreign exchange impact to its financial statements. At
its inception, a derivative financial instrument used for hedging is designated as a fair value, cash flow or net equity hedge. Fair value
hedges are entered into with financial instruments such as forward contracts with the objective of limiting exposure to certain foreign exchange risks primarily associated with accounts receivable, accounts payable and non-permanent intercompany
transactions. In assessing hedge effectiveness, the Company excludes

forward points, which are considered by the Company to be components of interest expense. In December 2005 and January 2006, the Company effectively
converted $3750 million of its floating rate borrowings to fixed rate debt through interest rate swaps. The agreements call for the Company to receive a floating rate equal to the 3 month U.S. dollar LIBOR rate and pay a weighted average fixed rate
of 481 percent. The swap agreements expire in 2009 through 2012. These agreements have been designated as cash flow hedges with interest payments designed to match the interest payments due on the term loans due 2012. The impacts of these
agreements are recorded in interest expense. On July1, 2003, the Company entered into two swap agreements effective
September29, 2003 as a hedge of the fair value of its $150 million 791 percent debt due July 2011. Each swap agreement converted a portion of the borrowing from fixed to floating rate interest. The Company received premiums of approximately
$08 million for both agreements. Changes in the fair value of the swaps resulting from changes in market interest rates were recorded as a component of net income along with the offsetting changes in the fair value of the related debt instrument to
the extent that the hedge was effective. Ineffectiveness was insignificant in 2006, 2005 and 2004. The swap agreements both had original maturity dates of July15, 2011 and notional amounts of $75 million each. Under the terms of the swaps, the
Company received semi-annual interest payments coinciding with the interest payments on the underlying debt of 791 percent and paid a variable rate based on the 6 month LIBOR rate plus a spread of about 37 percentage points. As part of the
Acquisition, the Company terminated these swaps and generated a loss of $31 million which was originally deferred. Upon closing the Acquisition and retirement of the debt, these deferred losses, along with the remaining previously deferred gains
totaling $08 million were recorded as a component of interest expense. Effective July30, 2002, the Company terminated two interest
rate swap agreements having notional amounts of $50 million and $75 million and generating gains of approximately $17 million and $33 million, respectively. These gains were capitalized as a component of debt and were being recognized as a
reduction of net interest expense. Additionally, in the fourth quarter of 2001, the Company terminated a swap agreement having a notional amount of $75 million and generating a net gain of $54 million. This gain was capitalized as a component of
debt and was being recognized as a reduction of net interest expense over the remaining life of the debt. This debt was retired in connection with the Acquisition in December 2005 and the deferred gains on the previously terminated swaps were
recognized as a component of interest expense in 2005. The fair value hedging relationships the Company has entered into have been highly
effective and the ineffectiveness recognized in other expense for the years 2006, 2005 and 2004 was immaterial. During the first quarter
of 2002, the Company entered into an interest rate swap agreement with a notional amount of 67 billion Japanese yen that matured on January24, 2007. The Company paid a fixed rate payment of 063 percent semi annually and received a Japanese
yen floating rate based on the LIBOR rate. This agreement converted the variable interest rate implicit in the Companys rolling net equity hedges in Japan to a fixed rate. While the Company believed that this agreement provided a valuable
economic hedge against rising interest rates in Japan, it did not qualify for hedge accounting treatment under SFAS No133, Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities. Accordingly, changes in the market value of the
swap were recorded as a component of interest expense as incurred. Over the life of the swap, any cumulative gains or losses since the inception of the agreement were reduced to zero. As of December30, 2006, the cumulative loss was $04
million, which was fully recognized in 2007. The change in the cumulative loss for 2005 was a net gain of $04 million. The Company also
uses derivative financial instruments to hedge foreign currency exposures resulting from firm purchase commitments or anticipated transactions, and classifies these as cash flow hedges. The Company generally enters into cash flow hedge contracts for
periods ranging from three to twelve months. The effective portion of the gain or loss on the hedging instrument is recorded in other comprehensive loss, and is reclassified into earnings as the transactions being hedged are recorded. As such, the
balance at the end of the year in other comprehensive loss will be reclassified into earnings within the next twelve months. The associated asset or liability on the open hedge is recorded in other current assets or accrued liabilities as
applicable. As of December30, 2006,December31, 2005 and December25, 2004, the balance in other comprehensive loss net of 
60 Table of Contents
tax resulting from open hedges designated as cash flow hedges was a $02 million, $08 million and $05 million, respectively. The change in the balance in
other comprehensive loss was a net gain loss of $06 million, $03 million and $02 million during the years ended December30, 2006,December31, 2005 and December25, 2004, respectively. The ineffective portion in other
expense was immaterial. The Company had intended to refinance its $100 million notes that were due in 2006. To protect itself from the
risk of higher interest rates, in 2005 the Company entered into an agreement to lock in a fixed treasury rate of approximately 470 percent, as compared with a current market rate of approximately 435 percent that provided the base interest for the
debt originally expected to be issued in the refinancing. This derivative had been designated as a cash flow hedge and was recorded at its fair value on a quarterly basis. Pending the expected issuance of the new debt, any gains or losses, to the
extent they represented an effective hedge, were recorded as a component of other comprehensive income. In the third quarter 2005, in anticipation of the Acquisition, when it was no longer probable that the refinancing of this debt would occur, the
Company terminated these agreements and recorded a loss of $31 million as a component of interest expense. In addition to fair value and
cash flow hedges, the Company uses financial instruments such as forward contracts and options to hedge a portion of its net equity investment in international operations, and classifies these as net equity hedges. For the years 2006, 2005 and 2004,
the Company recorded pre-tax net gains/losses associated with these hedges of $333 million, $257 million and $236 million, respectively, in other comprehensive loss. Due to the permanent nature of the investments, the Company does not
anticipate reclassifying any portion of this amount to the income statement in the next 12 months. The Companys derivative financial
instruments at December30, 2006 and December31, 2005 consisted solely of the financial instruments summarized above. All of the contracts, with the exception of the interest rate swaps, mature within 18 months. Related to the forward
contracts, the buy amounts represent the U.S. dollar equivalent of commitments to purchase foreign currencies and the sell amounts represent the U.S. dollar equivalent of commitments to sell foreign currencies, all translated
at the year-end market exchange rates for the U.S. dollar. All forward contracts are hedging net investments in certain foreign subsidiaries, cross-currency intercompany loans that are not permanent in nature as well as cross currency external
payables and receivables, or forecast purchase commitments. The Companys theoretical credit risk for each derivative instrument is
its replacement cost, but management believes that the risk of incurring credit losses is remote and such losses, if any, would not be material. The Company also is exposed to market risk on its derivative instruments due to potential changes in
foreign exchange rates; however, such market risk would be substantially offset by changes in the valuation of the underlying items being hedged. For all outstanding derivative instruments, the net accrued losses were $02 million, $01 million and
$06 at December30, 2006,December31, 2005 and December25, 2004, respectively, and were recorded either in accrued liabilities or other assets depending upon the net position of the individual contracts. While certain of the
Companys fair value hedges of non-permanent intercompany loans mitigate its exposure to foreign exchange gains or losses, they result in an impact to operating cash flows as the hedges are settled. However, the cash flow impact of certain of
these exposures is in turn offset by hedges of net equity and other forward contracts. The notional amounts listed in the table above change based upon the Companys outstanding exposure to fair value fluctuations. In January 2005, in order to hedge against the impact of a strengthening U.S. dollar, the Company entered into ten euro option agreements. Eight of the
options were to hedge a portion of its net equity investments denominated in euros, and the other two were deemed speculative because they did not meet the requirements for hedge accounting. The options strike prices were approximately 1256
U.S. dollars to the euro as compared with a market rate of 1326 U.S. dollars to the euro when the options were purchased. The effect of these options was to protect the value of the Companys euro net equity and cash flows with a floor of
1256 U.S. dollars to the euro by giving the Company the option to sell euros at that value. The hedge options had an original combined notional value of 494million euro and expiration dates at various points during 2005. The speculative
options 
61 Table of Contents
had an original combined notional value of 205million euro, with one of the options with a notional value of 63million euro having an
expiration date of September 2005 and the other with a notional value of 142million euro having an expiration date of October 2005. When the exchange rates were above the strike price of the option immediately prior to their expiration, the
Company allowed the options to expire unexercised. Conversely, when the U.S. dollar was at a rate below 1256 U.S. dollars to the euro immediately prior to the expiration of the option contracts, they were exercised. At the end of each quarter, the
Company revalued the open options and recorded any change in fair value as a component of other comprehensive income for equity hedge options and as a component of other income or expense for the speculative options. For the year ended
December31, 2005, the Company exercised 6 options with an aggregate notional amount of 455million euros and allowed 4 with an aggregate notional amount of 244million euros to expire unexercised. The Company recorded a net pre-tax
gain of $10 million associated with the settlement of these options and had a gain of $17 million associated with exercised hedge options that was recorded in equity. The Company entered into similar option agreements in 2004, all of which were
accounted for as hedges, and all of which expired unexercised during the year. In 2006 the Company did not purchase or sell currency options while in 2005 and 2004 the Company recorded a net pretax loss of $11 million and $17 million,
respectively, for the cost of the options. During the first quarter of 2007, in order to protect the value of a portion of the
Companys euro-based cash flows expected during 2007, the Company purchased a series of put options, giving the Company the right, but not the obligation, to sell approximately 340million euros in exchange for US dollars. The put options
expire on various dates throughout 2007, and they have a weighted average strike price of about 128 dollars per euro. The Company paid premiums for these put options totaling about $05 million. Although the Company considers these put options to
be a hedge of its exposure to changes in the value of the euro, they do not qualify for hedge accounting under SFAS 133. Accordingly, the value of the options will be marked to market at the end of each quarter of 2007, with any change in value
recorded as a component of other income or expense, applicable. The maximum net expense that will be recognized is the $05 million premium already paid., and these premiums will be recorded as other expense during 2007. Additionally, changes in the
market value of the options will also be recorded as other income or expense each quarter in 2007. During the first quarter of 2007, the
Company will begin hedging $50 million worth of its yen net equity and $300 million of its euro net equity through a series of new forward contracts. This will significantly reduce interest expense in the future with an approximate $50 million
impact in 2007. The initial forward contracts will mature in 2007 and 2008 and will be settled in cash such that the Company will be exposed to fluctuations in the value of the yen and euro versus the U.S. dollar. Over time, this exposure is
expected to be offset by changes in the value of operating cash flows generated in the yen and the euro. Note 8: Subscriptions Receivable
In October 2000, a subsidiary of the Company adopted a Management Stock Purchase Plan the MSPP, which provided for eligible
executives to purchase Company stock using full recourse loans provided by the subsidiary. Under the MSPP, the Company loaned $136 million to 33 senior executives to purchase 847,000 common shares from treasury stock. In 2001 and 2002, an
additional nine senior executives purchased 74,500 shares of common stock from treasury stock utilizing loans totaling $17 million. The loans have annual interest rates of 521 percent to 596 percent, and all dividends, while the loans are
outstanding, are applied toward interest due. Each of the loans has scheduled repayment dates of 25 percent on the fifth and sixth anniversaries of the loan issuance, with the balance due on the eighth anniversary. During 2006, thirteen participants
surrendered a total of 99,388 shares of the Companys common stock to the Company at current market prices to satisfy loans totaling $21 million. In addition, five participants made cash payments to satisfy loan payment obligations totaling
$02 million. During 2005, eighteen participants surrendered a total of 254,441 shares of the Companys common stock back to the Company at current market prices to satisfy loans totaling $56 million. In addition, four participants made cash
payments to satisfy loan payment obligations totaling $06 million. During 2004, two 
62 Table of Contents
participants left the Company and surrendered, at the current market price, 36,882 shares to the Company to satisfy loans totaling $07 million. Also during
2004, a participant left the Company and made a $07 million cash payment to satisfy the loan obligation and another participant elected to make a voluntary advance loan payment of $06 million. Under the terms of the MSPP, if at the scheduled
repayment date a loan remains outstanding and the Companys stock price per share is below the market price when the loan was originated, the Company will make cash bonus payments equal to the amount the value of the stock is below its purchase
price, up to 25 percent of the outstanding principal on the loan then due. For each share purchased, an option on two shares was granted under the 2000 Incentive Plan. See Note 13 to the consolidated financial statements. The loans have been
recorded as subscriptions receivable and are secured by the shares purchased. Principal amounts are due as follows: $02 million in 2007; $26 million in 2008 and $05 million in 2009. No further loans or sales of stock are being made under this
Plan. In 2006 and 2005, the Company returned to income $04 million and $08 million, respectively, of a provision recorded since the
adoption of the MSPP for the potential cash bonus payments described above associated with principal amounts due in 2006 and 2005. This was due to the associated loans being repaid prior to their due dates. The Company will continue to accrue for
the cost of potential future cash bonus payments associated with loans that remain outstanding. On November30, 1998, the Company
made a non-recourse, non-interest bearing loan of $77 million the loan to its chairman and chief executive officer chairman, the proceeds of which were used by the chairman to buy in the open market 400,000 shares of the Companys common
stock the shares at an average price of $1912 per share. The shares were pledged to secure the repayment of the loan. The loan was recorded as a subscription receivable and was due November12, 2006, with voluntary prepayments permitted
commencing November12, 2002, and mandatory prepayments required equal to 10 percent of annual bonus payments. On October26, 2006 the Companys chairman and chief executive officer surrendered 330,368 shares of the Companys
common stock at a market price of $2149 in satisfaction of the $71 million outstanding balance, which had previously been reduced through cash payments of $06 million. Note 9: Accumulated Other Comprehensive Loss  In millions

At December30, 2006, the Company had domestic federal and state net operating loss carry forwards
of $892 million, separate state net operating loss carry forwards of $770 million, and foreign net operating loss carry forwards of $3559 million. Of the total foreign and domestic net operating loss carry forwards, $3210 million expire at
various dates from 2007 to 2026, while the remainder have unlimited lives. During 2006, the Company realized net cash benefits of $58 million related to foreign net operating loss carry forwards. At December31, 2006, the Company had estimated
foreign tax credit carry forwards of $502 million, most of which expire beginning in 2014 if not utilized. These valuation allowances relate to tax assets in jurisdictions where it is managements best estimate that there is not a greater than
50 percent probability that the benefit of the assets will be realized in the associated tax returns. The likelihood of realizing the benefit of deferred tax assets is assessed on an ongoing basis. Consequently, future material changes in the
valuation allowance are possible. The Company paid received refunds income taxes, net, in 2006, 2005 and 2004 of $295 million, $347 million and $458 million, respectively. The Company has foreign subsidiaries which receive tax holidays that
will expire in 2007 and 2009 if not renewed or extended. There are various factors which may impact the amount of the annual benefit derived from the tax holiday. The net benefit of the tax holidays in 2006 and 2005 was $64 million and $40
million, respectively. In July 2006, the FASB issued FASB Interpretation No48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes
FIN 48. FIN 48 clarifies the accounting for income taxes by prescribing a minimum probability threshold that a tax position must meet before a financial
statement benefit is recognized. The minimum threshold is defined in FIN 48 as a tax position that is more likely than not to be sustained upon examination by the applicable taxing authority, including resolution of any related appeals or litigation
processes, based on the technical merits of the position. The tax benefit to be recognized is measured as the largest amount of benefit that is greater than 50 percent likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement. FIN 48 must be applied to all
existing tax positions upon initial adoption. The cumulative effect of applying FIN 48 at adoption, if any, is to be reported as an adjustment to opening retained earnings for the year of adoption. FIN 48 is effective for the Companys 2007
fiscal year. The Company is currently assessing the potential effect of FIN 48 on its financial statements. On December21, 2004, the
FASB issued two FSPs which address issues related to recently enacted tax legislation. FSP 109-1, Application of FASB Statement No109, Accounting for Income Taxes, for the Tax Deduction Provided to U.S.-Based Manufacturers by the American
Jobs Creation Act of 2004, clarifies that the tax deduction for domestic manufacturers under the American Jobs Creation Act should be accounted for as a special deduction as opposed to a rate reduction. The benefit of this provision is
insignificant. FSP 109-2, Accounting and Disclosure Guidance for the Foreign Earnings Repatriation Provision within the American Jobs
Creation Act of 2004, provides accounting and disclosure guidance for the special one-time dividends received deduction allowed by the act on the repatriation of certain foreign earnings to a U.S. taxpayer. The Company elected not avail itself
of this deduction. The Company has $5462 million of undistributed earnings of international subsidiaries. The Company has not provided
for U.S. deferred income taxes on these undistributed earnings because of its intention to indefinitely reinvest these earnings. Effective
January1, 2006 the Company adopted the provisions of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No123R, Share-Based Payment, and related interpretations, or SFAS 123R, to account for stock-based compensation using the modified
prospective transition method and therefore will not restate prior period results. SFAS123R, requires that recognition of tax windfall benefits related to the exercise of employee stock-based compensation be delayed until the period that the
reduction will reduce income taxes payable. Due to current year domestic net operating losses of $543 million, the Company did not recognize $05 million of benefits for deductions associated with the exercise of employee stock options in 2006. The
Company recognized $20 million and $02 million, respectively, of benefits for deductions associated with the exercise of employee stock options in 2005 and 2004, respectively. These benefits were added directly to paid-in capital, and were not
reflected in the provision for income taxes.

Note 11: Retirement Benefit Plans Pension Plans. The Company has various defined benefit pension plans covering substantially all domestic employees, employed as of June30, 2005, except those employed by BeautiControl, and certain
employees in other countries. In addition to providing pension benefits, the Company provides certain postretirement healthcare and life insurance benefits for selected U.S. and Canadian employees. Most employees and retirees outside the United
States are covered by government healthcare programs. Employees may become eligible for these benefits if they reach normal retirement age while working for the Company and satisfy certain years of service requirements. The medical plans are
contributory for post-1994 retirees, with retiree contributions adjusted annually, and contain other cost-sharing features, such as deductibles and coinsurance. The medical plans include an allowance for Medicare for post-65 age retirees. In
December 2003, the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement and Modernization Act of 2003 the Act was signed into law. The Act provides new prescription drug benefits under Medicare as well as providing for a federal subsidy to be paid to plans
that are at least actuarially equivalent to Medicare in their prescription drug plans. In May 2004, the FASB issued FSP No. FAS 106-2, Accounting and Disclosure Requirements Related to the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement and Modernization
Act of 2003. This FSP provides guidance on accounting for the effects of the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement and Modernization Act of 2003 by employers whose prescription drug benefits are actuarially equivalent to the drug benefit under
Medicare Part D. It also contains basic guidance on related income tax accounting and rules for transition allowing prospective or retroactive adoption and was effective for the third quarter of 2004. The Company elected prospective adoption of the
FSP guidance and the effect of the subsidy on the net periodic postretirement benefit cost for 2004 was to reduce the interest cost by $02 million and the amortization of the actuarial loss by $02 million. In the fourth quarter of 2006 the Company amended its domestic retiree medical plan effective April1, 2007. Prior to the effective date but after
January1, 1995, the Company subsidized the cost of health care for retirees based on age and years of service. For under age 65 retirees, the amendment altered the Companys contribution from a percent of cost to a fixed amount. For over
age 65 retirees, the amendment lowered the fixed subsidy amount. For former associates retired prior to January1, 1995 and under the age of 80, the amendment introduced a monthly premium charge of $35 per covered adult. The change resulted in
a decrease of expense of $03 million in 2006 and is expected to decrease the annual cost by approximately $18 million in 2007 and thereafter. Effective June30, 2005, the Company froze the benefits to participants under its U.S. defined benefit pension plans. This action necessitated a re-measurement of its accumulated benefit obligation under the plans and resulted in a
pretax increase of $51 million $33 million after tax. As part of its re-measurement, the Company decreased its discount rate assumption from 575 percent to 50 percent. Other assumptions remained consistent with those previously used. The
Company also recorded an immaterial curtailment loss in the second quarter of 2005 related to this action. In conjunction with the benefit freeze, the Company increased its basic contribution related to one of its domestic defined contribution plans
from 3 percent of eligible employee compensation up to the Social Security Wage Base to 5 percent. Effective December30, 2006, the
Company adopted the recognition and disclosure provisions of SFAS No158 Employers Accounting for Defined Benefit Pension and Other Postretirement Plans, an amendment of FASB Statements No87, 88, 106, and 132R. This Statement
requires employers to recognize in their balance sheets the overfunded or underfunded status of defined benefit post-retirement plans, measured as the difference between the fair value of plan assets and the benefit obligation the projected benefit
obligation for pension plans and the accumulated postretirement benefit obligation for other post-retirement plans. Employers must recognize the change in the funded status of the plan in the year in which the change occurs through accumulated
other comprehensive income. This Statement also requires plan assets and obligations to be measured as of the employers balance sheet date. Prior to the adoption of the recognition provisions of SFAS No158, the Company accounted for its defined benefit post-retirement plans under SFAS No87, Employers Accounting for Pensions and SFAS No106, 
66 Table of Contents
Employers Accounting for Postretirement Benefits Other Than Pensions. SFAS No87 required that a liability minimum pension liability be
recorded when the accumulated benefit obligation ABO liability exceeded the fair value of plan assets. Any adjustment was recorded as a non-cash charge to accumulated other comprehensive income in shareholders equity. SFAS No106
required that the liability recorded should represent the actuarial present value of all future benefits attributable to an employees service rendered to date. Under both SFAS No87 and No106, changes in the funded status were not
immediately recognized; rather they were deferred and recognized ratably over future periods. Upon adoption of the recognition provisions of SFAS No158, the Company recognized the amounts of prior changes in the funded status of its
post-retirement benefit plans through accumulated other comprehensive income loss. As a result, the Company recognized the following adjustments in

pension plans at December30, 2006 and December31, 2005 was $1635 million and $1279 million, respectively. At December30, 2006 and December31, 2005, the accumulated benefit obligations of certain pension plans exceeded those
plans assets. For those plans, the accumulated benefit obligations were $1238 million and $1073 million, and the fair value of their assets was $522 million and $425 million as of December30, 2006 and December31, 2005,
respectively. The accrued benefit cost for the pension plans is reported in accrued liabilities and other long-term liabilities. The costs

The overall long-term rates-of-return-on-assets for the U.S. pension plans were chosen from the
range of likely results of compound average annual returns over a 20-year time horizon. The range was calculated by modeling a probable rate-of-return based on historical data for the period 1926-2002 for stocks, bonds and cash 
69 Table of Contents
and was applied to the Companys current target asset mix for the plan. The long-term rate-of-return for foreign pension plans was also selected from
probable returns based on historical data as calculated by the actuaries as well as comparisons to trends in other companies. The Company
utilizes a published rating index of a portfolio of high quality, fixed-income debt instruments as a benchmark for the discount rates used to determine the benefit obligations of its plans. For the U.S. plans, the discount rate was based on the rate
of return for a portfolio of Moodys AA rated high quality bonds with maturities that are consistent with the projected future benefit payment obligations of the plans. The weighted average discount rate for the U.S. and foreign plans for 2006
were 58 percent and 44 percent, respectively and 55 percent and 50 percent, respectively for 2005. The assumed healthcare cost trend
rate for 2006 was 80 percent for both post-65 age participants and pre-65 age participants, decreasing to 50 percent in 2010. The healthcare cost trend rate assumption has a significant effect on the amounts reported. A one percentage point change
in the assumed healthcare cost trend rates would have the following effects:  In millions

The Companys
weighted-average asset allocations at December30, 2006 and December31, 2005 by asset category were as follows:  2006 2005 Asset Category

100 100 100 100 The Companys specific return objective on its U.S. pension plan is to achieve each year a
return greater than or equal to the return that would have been earned by a portfolio invested approximately 60 percent in equity securities and 40 percent in fixed income securities. The Company has adopted the following asset class allocations for
its U.S. pension plan: 62 percent in equity securities 32 percent large U.S. stocks, 20 percent small U.S. stocks, and 10 percent international stocks and 38 percent fixed income securities 36 percent bonds and 1 percent U.S. cash equivalents.
At each quarter end, the asset classes may be rebalanced to obtain the target asset mix if the percentages fall outside of acceptable range variances. The investment policy is reviewed from time to time to ensure consistency with the long-term
objective of funding at least 90 percent of the plans liabilities. Options, derivatives, forwards, futures contracts, short positions, or margined positions may be held in reasonable amounts as deemed prudent. Transactions that would
jeopardize the tax-exempt status of the plan are not allowed. Lending of securities may be permitted in cases in which an appropriate gain can be realized. The Company does not invest in any of its own stock; however, this restriction does not
prevent investment in insurance company accounts, other commingled or mutual funds, or any index funds which may hold securities of the Company. Additional guidelines for investment managers selected by the Company to manage equity securities
prohibit the securities of one company or affiliated group, other than U.S. government securities, to exceed 5 percent of the portfolio and that no more than 25 percent of a separately managed portfolio be invested in any one industry, unless that
industry represents greater than 20 percent of the benchmark market index. International equity investments shall be diversified by country and by industry and primarily include securities 
70 Table of Contents
listed on significant exchanges. Equity portfolios may include a small portion of convertible bonds and preferred stock but these securities do not
substitute as bonds within the portfolios. Investment managers selected by the Company to manage the fixed income investments are also prohibited from holding more than 5 percent in any one company or affiliated group of companies, other than U.S.
government securities, and from holding more than 25 percent of investments in any one industry. In addition, no more than 25 percent of the fixed income portfolio may be invested in foreign securities and no more than 25 percent of the portfolio
may be invested in below investment grade securities. The Companys return objective for its foreign plans is to achieve a return of
approximately 63 percent to 65 percent. To achieve this return, the foreign plans weighted average target allocations for its investments are 60 percent equity securities and 40 percent fixed income, cash and money market investments. 
The Company expects to contribute $86 million to its U.S. and foreign pension plans and $44 million to its other U.S. postretirement benefit plan in
2007. The Company also has several savings, thrift and profit-sharing plans. Its contributions to these plans are in part based upon
various levels of employee participation. The total cost of these plans was $55 million in 2006, $41 million in 2005 and $23 million in 2004. The following benefit payments, which reflect expected future service, as appropriate, are expected to be paid for the Companys foreign and U.S. plans:  Years

Included in the postretirement benefits in the table above are expected payments for prescription
drug benefits. As a result of the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement and Modernization Act of 2003 discussed above, the Company expects subsidy receipts of $66 million from 2007 through 2016 related to these prescription drug benefits.
Note 12: Incentive Compensation Plans Incentive Plans. On May17, 2006 the shareholders of the Company approved the adoption of the Tupperware Brands Corporation 2006 Incentive Plan the 2006 Incentive Plan. The 2006 Incentive Plan provides for the
issuance of cash and stock-based incentive awards to employees and certain non-employee participants. Stock-based awards may be in the form of performance awards, stock options, stock appreciation rights, restricted stock awards and restricted stock
unit awards. The total number of shares available for grant under the 2006 Incentive Plan as of December30, 2006, was 3,862,912 of which 1,092,344 could be issued in the form of restricted stock. Other than for options on 157,118 shares exchanged for certain BeautiControl options in connection with the 2000 acquisition, all options exercise
prices are equal to the underlying shares grant-date market values. Outstanding unvested options generally vest in one-third increments on the anniversary of the grant date in each of the following three years; however, certain options granted
in 2000 and 2001 vest seven years after the date of grant. The vesting of these options may be accelerated if certain stock price appreciation goals are attained. No such acceleration occurred in 2006 and 535,718 shares were vested prior to 2006. At
December30, 2006, options of this type to purchase 1,009,306 shares were outstanding. The unvested options will vest in November 2008, or earlier. 
71 Table of Contents
All outstanding options have exercise periods that are 10 years from the date of grant and outstanding
restricted shares have initial vesting periods ranging from one to three years. Under the plan, awards that are canceled or expire are added back to the pool of available shares. Director Plan. On May17, 2006 the Companys shareholders also approved amendments to the Tupperware Brands Corporation Director Stock
Plan Director Stock Plan. The amendments expand the types of awards that may be issued under the Director Stock Plan to include restricted stock and restricted stock unit awards and authorize the Compensation and Management Development
Committee of the Board of Directors to grant equity-based awards in amounts and with terms and conditions that permit the Company to attract and retain qualified directors. Under the Director Stock Plan, non-employee directors are obligated to receive one-half of their annual retainers in the form of stock and may elect to
receive the balance of their annual retainers in the form of stock or cash. In addition, each non-employee director on the date of the Companys annual meeting of shareholders receives a stock grant in such form and amount as may be determined
by the Compensation and Management Development Committee of the Board of Directors. The number of shares authorized for grant under the Director Stock Plan and the number of shares available for grant as of December30, 2006, were 600,000 and
282,024, respectively. Through 2002, the Company accounted for its stock-based compensation under the intrinsic value recognition and
measurement principles of Accounting Principles Board Opinion No25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees, and related Interpretations. Effective with fiscal 2003, the Company began accounting for those plans using the
fair-value-based method of accounting for stock options under the provisions of SFAS 123 prospectively to all employee awards granted, modified, or settled after December28, 2002 as permitted under the transition guidance of SFAS 148,
Accounting for Stock-Based CompensationTransition and Disclosurean amendment of FAS 123. Compensation cost for options that vest on a graduated schedule is recorded over that time period. Therefore, the cost related to the
stock-based employee compensation included in the determination of net income for 2005 and 2004 is less than that which would have been recognized if the fair-value-based method had been applied to all awards since the original effective date of
SFAS 123. Compensation expense associated with time-based restricted stock grants is equal to the market value of the shares on the date of grant and is recorded pro rata over the required holding period. In 2006, the Company awarded performance
restricted shares and for these the expense is recorded based on an assessment of achieving a defined level of sales and net income growth within the next three years. Compensation expense associated with restricted stock grants was $25 million, $14 million and $06 million in 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. Earned cash performance awards of $157 million, $93 million and $122 million were included in the consolidated statement of income for 2006, 2005 and
2004, respectively.

Note 13: Segment Information The Company manufactures and distributes a broad portfolio of products primarily through independent direct sales consultants. Certain international operating segments have been aggregated based upon consistency of
economic substance, products, production process, class of customers and distribution method. As a result of changes in the Companys management structure as well as a re-evaluation of the Companys operating segment definitions, the
Company reorganized its previously reported segments as follows:  There have been no changes to the Companys BeautiControl North America segment.  International BeautiControl operations are reported in the segments in which the business component geographically resides.  The International Beauty reportable segment included the acquired businesses operated primarily under the brand names noted above, as well as the Companys
Tupperware operations in Central and South America and the Philippines which were included in the Companys Latin America and Asia Pacific reportable segments prior to 2006, respectively.  The Companys Tupperware and BeautiControl operations in Mexico are included in the North America segment; they were included in the Latin America reportable
segment prior to 2006.  With the movement of Central and South America as well as Mexico, the Company no longer has a Latin America reportable segment.  The Companys NaturCare brand business operating in Japan is included in the Asia Pacific segment; it was previously included in the International Beauty reportable segment. This change includes the transfer of
intangible assets and goodwill of $302 million and $243 million, respectively.  The Companys Avroy Shlain and Swissgarde brand businesses are now included in the Europe segment; they were previously included in the International Beauty reportable segment. This change includes the transfer of intangible
assets and goodwill of $166 million and $163 million, respectively. Prior period data has been reclassified to reflect
these changes. The Companys reportable segments include the following businesses:  Europe
Primarily food storage, preparation and serving containers, professional kitchen tools, microwave cookware and educational toys marketed under the Tupperware brand worldwide. Europe includes Avroy Shlain and Swissgarde, the beauty and personal care units in Southern Africa. Asia Pacific includes
NaturCare, the beauty and personal care unit in
Japan.
Asia Pacific North America BeautiControl North America
Premium cosmetics and skin care products marketed under the BeautiControl brand in the United States and Canada. International Beauty
Primarily beauty and personal care products in Latin and South America, Asia Pacific and Europe under the brand names House of Fuller, Nutrimetics and Nuvo Cosmeticos. Also includes the Tupperware units in the Philippines and Central and South America.

In 2002, the Company began to sell land held for development near its Orlando, Florida headquarters. During 2006, 2005 and 2004, pretax gains from these sales were $93 million 40 million and $116 million, respectively, and were recorded in other, net in the table above. Internal costs for management incentives directly related to these sales were $02 million, $01 million and $03 million in 2006, 2005 and 2004, and
were recorded in unallocated expenses. b.
The re-engineering and impairment charges line provides for severance and other exit costs. Total after-tax impact of these costs was $58 million, $105 million and $43 million in
2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. See Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements. c.
During 2006 and 2004, the Company recorded pretax gains of $44 million and $15 million, respectively, as a result of the insurance settlement from hurricane damage suffered at the
Companys headquarters location in Orlando, Florida. Additionally, in 2006 the Company recorded expense of $12 million related to a loss arising from a fire at its former manufacturing facility in Tennessee. These gains and impairment are
included in other, net in the table above. Sales and segment profit in the preceding table are from transactions with
customers. Inter-segment transfers of inventory are accounted for at cost. Sales generated by product line, except beauty and personal care versus Tupperware, are not captured in the financial statements and disclosure of the information is impractical. Sales to a single customer did not exceed 10
percent of total sales in any segment. Export sales were insignificant. Sales to customers in Germany were $1980 million, $2310 million and $2526 million in 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. Sales of Tupperware and beauty products to customers
in Mexico were $3704 million, $1152 million and $837 million in 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. There was no other foreign country in which sales were material to the Companys total sales. Sales of Tupperware and BeautiControl products
to customers in the United States were $2849 million, $2876 million and $2966 million in 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. Unallocated expenses are corporate expenses and other items not directly related to the operations of any particular
segment. Corporate assets consist of cash, buildings and assets maintained for general corporate purposes. As of the end of 2006, 2005 and
2004, respectively, long-lived assets in the United States were $901 million, $1063 million and $981 million. As of December30,
2006 and December31, 2005 the Companys net investment in international operations was $8916 million and $8522 million, respectively. The Company is subject to the usual economic risks associated with international operations; however,
these risks are partially mitigated by the broad geographic dispersion of the Companys operations. Included in the cash balance of
$1022 million reported at the end of 2006, was a cash balance of $103 million denominated in Venezuelan bolivars. The balance is primarily a result of favorable operating cash flows in the market. Due toVenezuelan government restrictions on
transfers of cash out of the country and control of exchange rates, the Company can not immediately repatriate this cash attheexchange rate used to translate the Venezuelan bolivars into U.S. dollars for inclusion on the Companys
consolidated balance sheet. It will apply for, and expects to receive, authorization in 2007 to transfer approximately half of such amount out of the country. It has also implemented other strategies in an effort to eventuallyrepatriate the
current cash balance.The Company believes it couldimmediately repatriate the cash from Venezuela,but it would only be able to do soat a significantly less favorable exchange rate. This would result in the Company having fewer
U.S. dollars than currently reported as a component of cash and cash equivalents on its consolidated balance sheet with the difference recorded as a foreign exchange loss in its consolidated income statement. Note 14: Commitments and Contingencies The Company
and certain subsidiaries are involved in litigation and various legal matters that are being defended and handled in the ordinary course of business. Included among these matters are environmental issues. 
76 Table of Contents
The Company does not include estimated future legal costs in any necessary accruals. The Company believes that it is remote that the Companys
contingencies will have a material adverse effect on its financial position, results of operations or cash flow. In 2006 the Company
recorded a pretax loss of $12 million as a result of a fire at its former manufacturing facility in Halls, Tennessee. The amount recorded is based on its current best estimate. As more information becomes available related to this event,
adjustments may be necessary. Kraft Foods, Inc., which was formerly affiliated with Premark International, Inc., the Companys former
parent and Tupperware, has assumed any liabilities arising out of certain divested or discontinued businesses. The liabilities assumed include matters alleging product liability, environmental liability and infringement of patents. As part of the
Acquisition, Sara Lee Corporation indemnified the Registrant for any liabilities arising out of any existing litigation at the time of the Acquisition and for certain legal matters arising out of circumstances which might relate to periods before or
after the date of the acquisition. Leases. Rental expense for operating leases totaled $267 million in 2006, $275 million in 2005
and $289 million in 2004. Approximate minimum rental commitments under non-cancelable operating leases in effect at December30, 2006, were: 2007$247 million; 2008$162 million; 2009$97 million; 2010$66million,
2011$37million and after 2011$88 million. Leases included in the minimum rental commitments for 2007 and 2008 primarily relate to lease agreements for automobiles which generally have a lease term of 2-3 years. It is common for
lease agreements to contain various provisions for items such as step rent or other escalation clauses and lease concessions which may offer a period of no rent payment. These types of items are considered by the Company and are recorded into
expense on a straight line basis over the minimum lease terms. The Company has a lease agreement on a warehouse located in Europe which offers a purchase option of about $35 million, which is expected to approximate fair market value, at the end of
the lease term in 2010. There were no material lease agreements containing renewal options. Certain leases require the Company to pay property taxes, insurance and routine maintenance. In 2006, the Company initiated construction of a new Tupperware manufacturing facility which will replace its existing facility in Belgium. The total
cost of the new facility and equipment is estimated at approximately $21 million and is being financed via sales-lease-back transactions. The two new leases will be classified as a capital leases with terms of 15 years for the facility and 10 years
for the equipment and should commence in the second half of 2007. Additionally in 2006, the Companys BeautiControl subsidiary entered into an operating lease for a new manufacturing facility in Texas. The total future commitment under the new
lease is approximately $10 million over the next 10 years.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED CERTIFIED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM To the Board of Directors and Shareholders of Tupperware Brands Corporation: We have completed an integrated audit of Tupperware Brands Corporations consolidated financial statements and of its internal control over
financial reporting as of December30, 2006 in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board United States. Our opinions, based on our audits, are presented below. Consolidated financial statements and financial statement schedule In our opinion, the accompanying consolidated balance sheets and the related consolidated statements of income, of shareholders equity and comprehensive income and of cash flows present fairly, in all material
respects, the financial position of Tupperware Brands Corporation and its subsidiaries at December30, 2006 and December31, 2005, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended
December30, 2006 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. In addition, in our opinion, the financial statement schedule listed in the index appearing under a 2presents
fairly in all material respects, the information set forth therein and when read in conjunction with the related consolidated financial statements. These financial statements and financial statement schedule are the responsibility of the
Companys management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements and financial statement schedule based on our audits. We conducted our audits of these statements in accordance with the standards of the Public
Company Accounting Oversight Board United States. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit of financial statements
includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, and evaluating the overall financial statement
presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. As discussed in Note 11 to the financial statements,
the Company changed the manner in which it accounts for retirement obligations in fiscal 2006. Internal control over financial reporting
Also, in our opinion, managements assessment, included in Managements Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting
appearing in Item9A, that the Company maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of December30, 2006 based on criteria established in Internal ControlIntegrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring
Organizations of the Treadway Commission COSO, is fairly stated, in all material respects, based on those criteria. Furthermore, in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting
as of December30, 2006, based on criteria established in Internal Control Integrated Framework issued by the COSO. The Companys management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for
its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting. Our responsibility is to express opinions on managements assessment and on the effectiveness of the Companys internal control over financial reporting
based on our audit. We conducted our audit of internal control over financial reporting in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board United States. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to
obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. An audit of internal control over financial reporting includes obtaining an understanding of internal control over
financial reporting, evaluating managements assessment, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control, and performing such other procedures as we consider necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our
audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinions. A companys internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to
provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in 
79 Table of Contents
accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A companys internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures
that ipertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; iiprovide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as
necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors
of the company; and iiiprovide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the companys assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections
of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP Orlando, Florida February26, 2007

Part II  Item5. Controls and Procedures Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures The Company maintains disclosure controls and procedures as defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15e and 15d-15e that are designed to ensure that
information required to be disclosed in the Companys reports filed or submitted under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the Securities and Exchange Commissions rules and
forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to the Companys management, including the Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. In
designing and evaluating the disclosure controls and procedures, management recognized that controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives.
As of the end of the period covered by this report, management, under the supervision of the Companys Chief Executive Officer and
Chief Financial Officer, evaluated the effectiveness of the design and operation of the Companys disclosure controls and procedures. Based upon that evaluation, the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that the design
and operation of the disclosure controls and procedures were effective. Managements Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting
The Companys management is also responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting
as defined in Exchange Act Rule 13a-15f. As of the end of the period covered by this report, management, under the supervision of the Companys Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, evaluated the effectiveness of the
Companys internal control over financial reporting based on the framework in Internal ControlIntegrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organization of the Treadway Commission. Based upon that evaluation, the Chief
Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that the Companys internal control over financial reporting were effective as of the end of the period covered by this report. The Companys assessment of the internal control over
financial reporting as of December30, 2006, has been audited by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in their report which is included herein. Changes in Internal Controls There have been no
significant changes; except as noted below, in the Companys internal control over financial reporting during the Companys fourth quarter that have materially affected or are reasonably likely to materially affect its internal control
over financial reporting as defined in Rule 13a-15f promulgated under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. During October 2006, the
Company implemented an upgrade to its accounting system for the Tupperware United States and Canada units. The implementation involved changes in systems that included internal controls, and accordingly, these changes have required changes to our
system of internal controls. The Company has reviewed the controls affected by the implementation of the upgrade and made appropriate changes to affected internal controls. The Company believes that the controls as modified are appropriate and
functioning effectively to provide reasonable assurance on its internal controls over financial reporting.
