46 Table of Contents Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm The Board of Directors and Stockholders
Encore Medical Corporation We have audited the accompanying balance sheets of Encore Medical Corporation and subsidiaries as
of December31, 2005 and 2004, and the related consolidated statements of operations, changes in
stockholders equity and comprehensive income, and cash flows for each of the years in the
three-year period ended December31, 2005. In connection with our audits of the consolidated
financial statements, we also have audited financial statement schedule II. These consolidated
financial statements and schedule are the responsibility of the Companys management. Our
responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated financial statements and schedule
based on our audits. We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight
Board United States. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An
audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the
financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and
significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement
presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all
material respects, the financial position of Encore Medical Corporation and subsidiaries as of
December31, 2005 and 2004, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of
the years in the three-year period ended December31, 2005, in conformity with U.S. generally
accepted accounting principles. Also in our opinion, the related financial statement schedule,
when considered in relation to the basic consolidated financial statements taken as a whole,
presents fairly, in all material respects, the information set forth therein. We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight
Board United States, the effectiveness of Encore Medical Corporations internal control over
financial reporting as of December31, 2005, based on criteria established in Internal
ControlIntegrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway
Commission COSO, and our report dated March13, 2006 expressed an unqualified opinion on
managements assessment of, and the effective operation of, internal control over financial
reporting. s/ KPMG LLP Austin, Texas

See accompanying notes to consolidated financial statements. 51 Table of Contents ENCORE MEDICAL CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements 1. BASIS OF PRESENTATION AND DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS Basis of Presentation and Description of Business The accompanying consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Encore Medical
Corporation, a Delaware corporation, and its wholly owned subsidiaries and those entities in which
we hold a controlling interest individually and collectively referred to as us, we, our
company or Encore. We are a diversified orthopedic device company that develops, manufactures
and distributes a comprehensive range of high quality orthopedic devices, including sports medicine
equipment and products for orthopedic rehabilitation, pain management and physical therapy, and
surgical implants. Our products are used by orthopedic surgeons, physicians, therapists, athletic
trainers and other healthcare professionals to treat patients with musculoskeletal conditions
resulting from degenerative diseases, deformities, traumatic events and sports-related injuries,
and a substantial amount of our non-invasive medical devices and related accessories are primarily
used by patients for at-home physical therapy. We currently market and distribute our products through two operating divisions, our Surgical
Implant Division and our Orthopedic Rehabilitation Division. Our Surgical Implant Division offers a
comprehensive suite of reconstructive joint products and spinal implants. Our Orthopedic
Rehabilitation Division offers non-invasive medical products that are used before and after surgery
to assist in the repair and rehabilitation of soft tissue and bone, and to protect against further
injury; electrotherapy devices and accessories used to treat pain and restore muscle function;
iontophoretic devices and accessories used to deliver medication; clinical therapy tables and
traction equipment; and orthotics devices used to treat joint and spine conditions. Our products are subject to regulation by the Food and Drug Administration FDA with respect to
their sale in the United States, and we must, in many cases, obtain FDA authorization to market our
products before they can be sold in the United States. Additionally, we are subject to similar
regulations in many of the foreign countries in which we sell products. Principles of Consolidation The consolidated financial statements include our accounts, those of our wholly owned subsidiaries,
and those subsidiaries in which we own a controlling interest. Minority interests reflect the 50%
separate ownership of Medireha, which we have consolidated due to our controlling interest. All
significant intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. Use of Estimates The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted
in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect
the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at
the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the
reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. Cash and Cash Equivalents Cash consists of deposits with financial institutions. We consider all highly liquid investments
with original maturities of less than three months to be cash equivalents. While our cash and cash
equivalents are on deposit with high-quality institutions, such deposits exceed FDIC insured
limits. Allowance for Doubtful Accounts We must make estimates of the uncollectibility of accounts receivable. In doing so, management
analyzes accounts receivable and historical bad debts, customer concentrations, customer
credit-worthiness, current economic trends and changes in customer payment patterns when evaluating
the adequacy of the allowance for doubtful accounts. Sales Returns and Allowances We must make estimates of the amount of sales returns and allowances that will eventually be
granted. In doing so, management analyzes sales programs that are in effect, contractual
arrangements, market acceptance and historical trends when evaluating the adequacy of sales returns
and allowances accounts. Inventories Inventory is valued at the lower of cost or market, with cost being average cost. We establish
reserves for such issues as slow moving and excess inventory, product obsolescence and valuation
impairment. For all divisions, we utilize a specific identification methodology. In addition,
sales performance is reviewed on at least a quarterly basis to determine the amounts that should be
adjusted to the existing reserve. The reserved inventory items are primarily being disposed of by
scrapping or donating to charitable organizations. 52 Table of Contents Property and Equipment Property and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and amortization.
Depreciation is calculated for financial reporting purposes using the straight-line method over the
estimated useful lives of the assets that range from three to twenty-five years. Leasehold
improvements and assets subject to capital leases are amortized using the straight-line method over
the terms of the leases or lives of the assets, if shorter. We capitalize surgical implant
instruments that we provide to surgeons, free of charge, for use while implanting our products and
the related depreciation expense is recorded as a component of selling, general and administrative
expense. Maintenance and repairs are expensed as incurred. Capitalized Software Software is stated at cost less accumulated amortization and is amortized using the straight-line
method over its estimated useful life ranging from three to fiveyears. During the software application
development stage, capitalized costs include external consulting costs, cost of software licenses,
and internal payroll and payroll-related costs for employees who are directly associated with a
software project. Software assets are reviewed for impairment when events or circumstances
indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable over the remaining lives of the assets.
Upgrades and enhancements are capitalized if they result in added functionality which enable the
software to perform tasks it was previously incapable of performing. Software maintenance,
training and data conversion costs are expensed in the period in which they are incurred. Impairment of Long-Lived Assets Long-lived assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate
that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. Recoverability of assets to be held
and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset to undiscounted future net
cash flows expected to be generated by the asset. If such assets are considered to be impaired,
the impairment to be recognized is measured by the amount by which the carrying amount of the
assets exceeds the fair value of the assets. Assets to be disposed of are reported at the lower of
the carrying amount or fair value less costs to sell. Goodwill and Intangible Assets Goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of tangible and
identifiable intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed. Intangible assets consist of
agency rights, transferable licenses, distribution networks, intellectual property, non-compete
agreements and customer lists and are carried at cost less accumulated amortization. Amortization
of intangibles is computed using the straight-line method over periods ranging from one to twenty
years. On an annual basis, and between annual tests in certain circumstances, we review our
goodwill and intangible assets to determine if there has been any change in the useful lives of
goodwill or intangible assets, or whether there has been impairment of these assets. Shipping and Handling Costs The portion of shipping and handling costs, which are not reimbursed by customers, is included in
selling, general and administrative expense by our Orthopedic Rehabilitation Division. All
shipping and handling costs in the Surgical Implant Division are included in selling, general and
administrative expense. For the years ended December31, 2005, 2004 and 2003, $613,000, $500,000
and $450,000 of shipping and handling costs were included in selling, general and administrative
expenses. All remaining shipping and handling expenses are included as part of net sales and cost
of sales. Revenue Recognition We recognize revenue when 1persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, 2the price is fixed
or determinable, 3delivery has occurred and 4collectibility is reasonably assured. We sell our Surgical Implant Division products through a network of independent sales
representatives in the United States, as well as distributors outside the United States. We record
revenues from sales made by sales representatives, who are paid commissions upon the ultimate sale
of the products, at the time the product is used in a surgical procedure implanted in a patient
and a purchase order is received from the hospital. We record revenues from sales to customers
outside the United States at the time the product is shipped to the distributor. Our international
distributors, who sell the products to their customers, take title to the products, have no rights
of return except in certain limited instances following a change of control of Encore, and assume
the risk for credit and obsolescence. Distributors are obligated to pay us within specified terms,
regardless of when they sell the products. In addition, there is no price protection available to
distributors. We sell our Orthopedic Rehabilitation Division products through a variety of distribution channels.
We sell our clinical rehabilitation products to dealers. We record sales at the time the product
is shipped to the dealer. Dealers take title to the products, assume credit and product
obsolescence risks, must pay within specified periods regardless of when they sell or use the
products and have no price protection. For our home therapy products, we recognize wholesale
revenue when we ship our products to our wholesale customers. We recognize retail revenue, both
rental and purchase, when our product has been dispensed to the patient and the patients insurance
has been verified. For retail products that are sold from our inventories consigned at clinic
locations, we recognize revenue when we receive notice that the device has been prescribed and
dispensed to the patient and the insurance has been verified or preauthorization from the insurance
company has been obtained, when required. 53 Table of Contents We must make estimates of potential future product returns and other allowances related to current
period product revenue. To do so, our management analyzes historical returns, current economic
trends, and changes in customer demand and contractual terms when evaluating the adequacy of the
sales returns and other allowances. Significant management judgment must be used and estimates
must be made in connection with establishing the sales returns and other allowances in any
accounting period. Provisions for product returns and other allowances are recorded as a reduction
to revenue. Warranty Costs We provide expressed warranties on certain products, principally within our Orthopedic
Rehabilitation Division. The warranty periods typically range from one to three years, and provide
for customer return rights relative to defective product. At each reporting period, we estimate
our warranty obligations based upon historical experience and known product issues, if any. Activity in the warranty reserve during the years ended December31, 2005, 2004 and 2003 was as

Advertising Costs We expense the majority of advertising costs as they are incurred. During 2005, 2004 and 2003, such
costs approximated $31million, $20million and $13million, respectively. Research and Development Research and development expenses primarily relate to the technological development and enhancement
of reconstructive and spinal devices, as well as rehabilitation products. Research and development
costs are charged to expense as incurred. Income Taxes We account for income taxes under the asset and liability method. Under this method, deferred tax
assets and liabilities are recognized and measured using enacted tax rates in effect for the year
in which the differences are expected to be recognized. Valuation allowances are established when
necessary to reduce deferred tax assets to amounts that are more likely than not to be realized. Earnings Loss Per Share Basic earnings lossper common share has been computed using the weighted average number of
shares of common stock outstanding during the period and excludes any dilutive effects of options,
warrants or the conversion of the SeriesA Preferred Stock. Diluted earnings lossper share is
computed using the weighted average number of common stock and common stock equivalent shares
outstanding during the period. Common stock equivalent shares are excluded from the computation if
their effect is anti-dilutive. The number of common share equivalents outstanding is computed using
the treasury stock method. Foreign Currency Translation Our foreign subsidiaries use the local currency as their functional currency, which is
predominately the euro. Foreign currency assets and liabilities are translated into U.S. dollars
using the period-end exchange rate. Revenue and expenses are translated at the weighted average
exchange rate during the period. Translation gains and losses are reported in accumulated other
comprehensive income. Transaction gains and losses are reported in earnings as realized. Derivatives and Hedging Activities We use derivative financial instruments to manage the risk of fluctuations in foreign currency
exchange rates and interest rates. We evaluate the amount at risk, risk tolerance, cost of the
derivative, and our targeted mix of fixed and floating rates before entering into hedging
activities. On occasion we use forward contracts to hedge foreign currency cash flows and interest
rate swaps to hedge interest expense. Derivatives are recorded on the balance sheet and measured at
fair value. Gains and losses on cash flow hedges that qualify for hedge accounting treatment are
reported in accumulated other comprehensive income and are only reported in current income when
rate fluctuations of the hedged items are reported. Any ineffective portion of the derivatives
change in fair value is directly recognized in current income. We do not enter into derivative
instruments for speculative or trading purposes. Reclassifications The consolidated financial statements and accompanying footnotes reflect certain reclassifications,
including discontinued operations as described in Note 18. These reclassifications have no effect
on previously reported net income loss. 54 Table of Contents Fair Value of Financial Instruments The carrying amounts of our short-term financial instruments, including cash and cash equivalents,
accounts receivable and accounts payable, approximate fair values due to their short-term nature.
The fair values of our senior credit facility, notes payable and bank loan approximate their
carrying values, due to the variable interest rate features on these instruments. We estimate the
fair value of our long-term fixed rate notes based on market quotes
for notes outstanding. At December31, 2005, the fair value of
our notes was approximately $1609million. Stock-based Compensation Plans We have adopted the disclosure-only provisions of SFAS No148, Accounting for Stock-Based
Compensation Transition and Disclosures as well as those outlined in SFAS No123, Accounting
for Stock-Based Compensation. As permitted by SFAS 148 and SFAS 123, we continue to apply the
provisions of Accounting Principles Board Opinion No25, Accounting for Stock issued to
Employees and related interpretations in accounting for our plans. Accordingly, compensation cost
for employee stock options is measured as the excess, if any, of the quoted market price of our
stock at the date of the grant, over the amount an employee must pay to acquire the stock. Stock
based awards for non-employees are accounted for under the provisions of SFAS No123 and Emerging
Issues Task Force Consensus 96-18. Had compensation cost for all stock option grants been determined based on their fair value at the
grant dates, consistent with the method prescribed by SFAS 148 and SFAS 123, our net income loss
and earnings lossper share would have been adjusted to the pro forma amounts indicated below in
thousands, except per share information

comprehensive income lossrefers to unrealized gains and losses that are excluded from current
earnings and are recorded directly as an adjustment to stockholders equity. These gains and
losses often fluctuate before being realized, and are often long-term in nature. The Companys
other comprehensive income lossis comprised of foreign currency translation adjustments and
unrealized interest rate hedge gains and losses, net of tax. Recent Accounting Pronouncements In June2005, the FASB issued SFAS No154, Accounting Changes and Error Corrections, which
replaces APB Opinion No20, Accounting Changes, and FASB SFAS No3, Reporting Accounting
Changes in Interim Financial Statements. The Statement changes the accounting for, and reporting
of, a change in accounting principle. Statement 154 applies to all voluntary changes in accounting
principles and changes required by an accounting standard when the standard does not include
specific transition provisions. Statement 154 is effective for accounting changes and corrections
of errors in fiscal years beginning after December15, 2005. Earlier application is permitted for
accounting changes and corrections of errors during fiscal years beginning after June1, 2005. We
do not expect the adoption of SFAS No154 to have a material impact on our financial condition,
results of operations or cash flows. 55 Table of Contents In December2004, the FASB issued SFAS No123 Revised 2004, Share-Based Payment, which revises
SFAS No123, Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation and supersedes APB Opinion No25,
Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees. SFAS No123R amends SFAS No123 to require all
share-based payments to employees, including grants of employee stock options, to be recognized in
the income statement based on their fair values. Compensation expense is to be charged during the
vesting period. Pro forma disclosure will no longer be an alternative. On April14, 2005, the SEC
delayed the effective date for SFAS No123R to the first fiscal year beginning after June15,
2005. Therefore, this Statement will become effective for us in the first quarter of 2006. We
currently estimate the impact of the adoption of SFAS No123R on our financial position and
results of operations will range from approximately $35million
to $40million in 2006. In November2004, the FASB issued SFAS No151, Inventory Costs. This Statement amends the
guidance in ARB No43 Chapter4 Inventory Pricing, to require items such as idle facility costs,
excessive spoilage, double freight and rehandling costs to be expensed in the current period,
regardless of whether they are abnormal amounts or not. This Statement will become effective for
us in the first quarter of 2006. We do not expect the adoption of SFAS No151 to have a material
impact on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. 2. ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE A summary of activity in our accounts receivable reserves for doubtful accounts and sales returns

The market value of our debt is approximately $3120million as of December31, 2005. This was
determined using factors that included recent trade prices on fixed rate notes, prevailing interest
rates and the variable rate feature of the senior credit facility. The debt agreements related to the $180million senior credit facility and the $165million senior
subordinated notes payable contain warranties and covenants and require maintenance of certain
financial ratios. Default on any warranty or covenant could affect the ability to borrow under the
agreements and, if not waived or corrected, could accelerate the maturity of any borrowings
outstanding under both of the applicable agreements. As of December31, 2005, we are in compliance
with all debt covenants and warranties. In addition, these debt agreements restrict our ability to
iincur additional indebtedness; iiissue redeemable equity interests and preferred equity
interests; iiipay dividends or make distributions, repurchase equity interests or make other
restricted payments; ivmake capital expenditures; vcreate liens; vienter into transactions
with our affiliates; viimake investments; viiisell assets; or ixenter into mergers or
consolidations. In September2003, we repaid in full all principal amounts then outstanding under our $25million
credit facility and our $24million senior subordinated notes payable in conjunction with the
public offering we completed on August11, 2003. See Note 9 for additional detail regarding this
offering. In connection with the repayment, we recorded a charge due to the early repayment of our
outstanding debt, totaling $77million. All but approximately $650,000 of this amount represented
a non-cash expense for unamortized warrant and debt issue costs. 59 Table of Contents On October4, 2004, all amounts outstanding under our $25million credit facility which was $0
and our $24million senior subordinated notes payable which was $5million were paid in full and
those debt agreements were terminated. On March1, 2004, we acquired an exclusive license to manufacture and sell products incorporating a
patented implant design and mechanism for a total purchase price of $709,000. In connection with
this acquisition, we issued a $250,000 note to the holders of the patents. Payments under this note
were due in quarterly installments equal to 6% of our net sales of products utilizing this
technology. As of December31, 2005, the note was paid in full and the agreement terminated. In connection with our Empi acquisition, we assumed a note payable by Empi which Empi issued in
connection with its acquisition of Rehab MedEquip in 2002. The note bears interest of the greater
of 5% or the prime rate per annum, payable monthly. As of December31, 2005, the interest rate on
the note was 675%. At December31, 2005, the aggregate amounts of annual principal maturities of long-term debt and

8. CAPITAL STOCK Preferred Stock Preferred stock may be issued from time to time at the discretion of our Board of Directors the
Board with such designation, rights and preferences as the Board may determine. The preferred
stock may have dividend, liquidation, conversion, voting or other rights that may be more expansive
than the rights of the holders of the common stock. As of December31, 2005 and 2004, we have
1,000,000 shares of authorized preferred stock, of which 255,000 shares have been designated Series
A Preferred Stock. There are no shares of preferred stock issued or outstanding. On June12, 2001, we issued 132,353 shares of SeriesA Preferred Stock for net proceeds of
approximately $128million. The 132,353 shares of SeriesA Preferred Stock were immediately
convertible into 13,235,300 shares of our common stock. On January24, 2003, 750 shares of Series
A Preferred Stock were converted into 75,000 shares of common stock. On August11 60 Table of Contents 2003, 131,603 shares of SeriesA Preferred Stock, representing all of the remaining outstanding
shares of our SeriesA Preferred Stock, were converted into 13,160,300 shares of common stock. Common Stock On August11, 2003 we sold a total of 10,637,500 shares of our common stock at $400 per share in a
public offering. This offering generated total gross proceeds of approximately $426million. We
used the net offering proceeds of approximately $390million to repay $259million indebtedness
under our senior subordinated notes payable to CapitalSource Finance LLC, $20million of the term
loan debt under our senior credit facility with Bank of America, $106million to repay our
outstanding indebtedness under the revolving credit facility which was part of our senior credit
facility with Bank of America, and the remainder for general corporate purposes. On December17, 2003 we sold 6,000,000 shares of our common stock at $625 per share in a public
offering. This offering generated total gross proceeds of approximately $375million $345
million net offering proceeds, which was used for working capital and as a portion of the cash
purchase price component of the acquisition of Empi. On October4, 2004, we issued 8,000,000 shares of our common stock to Empi common stockholders and
option holders as a component of the purchase price for Empi. These shares were valued at $351
million, based on a $439 per share average closing price of Encores common stock on the Nasdaq
National Market for the period from two days before to two days after the announcement of the Empi
acquisition. Stock Option Plans We have a number of stock option plans. All options granted under the plans are exercisable for
common stock in Encore as described below. Non-employee stock compensation expense was
approximately $160,000, $135,000 and $155,000 for the years ended December31, 2005, 2004 and 2003,
respectively, which is included in selling, general and administrative expenses in the Consolidated
Statements of Operations. The 1996 Incentive Stock Plan provides for the grant of a variety of equity related awards,
including, but not limited to, incentive stock options, non-qualified stock options, stock
appreciation rights and restricted stock, to key employees of Encore and its subsidiaries. The
1997 Distributor Advisory Panel Stock Option Plan provides for the grant of stock options to those
persons or entities that are our sales representatives and distributors of our products. The 1997
Surgeon Advisory Panel Stock Option Plan provides for the grant of stock options to those surgeons
who are serving as members of our surgeon advisory panel. The 2000 Non-Employee Director Stock
Option Plan provides for the grant of options to non-employee directors of Encore. The Empi
individual option agreement plan includes incentive stock options and non-qualified stock options
available for grant to employees of Empi, who joined our company as a result of the acquisition of
Empi. The stock options granted under all of these plans are generally granted at fair value on the date
of grant, vest ratably over a predefined period and expire no more than ten years from the date of
grant. At December31, 2005, we had 1,612,893 shares available for grant and reserved a total of
5,631,198 shares of common stock for the plans. During 2004, we accelerated the vesting of certain Company stock options granted to employees under
the 1996 Incentive Stock Plan that had a per share option exercise price equal to or greater than
$728. The minimum $728 per share exercise price was greater than the closing price of the
Companys shares on the Nasdaq Stock Market on the effective date of the acceleration. As a result,
options to purchase approximately 773,500 shares of the Companys common stock with varying
remaining vesting schedules of between four months and thirty-two months, became immediately
exercisable. This acceleration was made considering long-term incentive compensation arrangements.
Because the exercise price was above the market price, no expense was recorded at the modification
date. A summary of the activity in our stock option plans is presented below

Warrants On February8, 2002, in connection with the financing for the acquisition of Chattanooga, we issued
a warrant to CapitalSource Holdings LLC, giving it the right to acquire for a period of five years
up to 2,198,614 shares of our common stock. On August14, 2003, we exercised our right to prepay $6
million of the principal amount of senior subordinated notes. Because we exercised this right,
CapitalSource conveyed to Galen Partners III, L.P., Galen Partners International III, L.P. and
Galen Employee Fund III, L.P., who collectively own approximately 19% of our outstanding stock the
Galen Entities, warrants to purchase 549,653 shares of our common stock. On October20, 2003,
CapitalSource exercised all of its remaining warrants for 1,648,961 shares of common stock. On
October2, 2004, the Galen Entities exercised all of its warrants for 549,653 shares of common
stock. No warrants were outstanding at December31, 2005 or December31, 2004. Issuance of Common Stock for Recourse Notes Payable In June2001, the Company sold approximately 12million shares of common stock at $102 per share
to certain executives of the Company. In exchange for the common stock, the Company accepted
promissory notes from the employees totaling $1,187,000, which bear interest at 8% per annum. The
promissory notes were initially collateralized by the 12million shares of common stock and are
full recourse to the assets of the executives. The notes have been recorded as a component of
stockholders equity in the consolidated balance sheet. In 2005, 2004 and 2003, we received
$102,000, $152,000 and $64,000, respectively, in note payments. 9. SEGMENT AND GEOGRAPHIC INFORMATION We have two reportable segments as defined by SFAS No131, Disclosures about Segments of an
Enterprise and Related Information. Our reportable segments are business units that offer
different products that are managed separately because each 62 Table of Contents business requires different manufacturing and marketing strategies. The Orthopedic Rehabilitation
Division offers non-invasive medical products that are used before and after surgery to assist in
the repair and rehabilitation of soft tissue and bone, and to protect against further injury;
electrotherapy devices and accessories used to treat pain and restore muscle function;
iontophoretic devices and accessories used to deliver medication; clinical therapy tables and
traction equipment; and orthotics devices used to treat joint and spine conditions. The Surgical
Implant Division sells reconstructive products including knee, hip, shoulder and spinal implants. Information regarding business segments is as follows in thousands

At December31, 2005 we maintain approximately $626,000 in state net operating loss carryforwards,
which expire over a period of 5 to 20years. Our European net operating loss carryforwards of
approximately $43million generally are not subject to expiration dates, unless the Company
triggers certain events. At December31, 2005 and 2004, we recorded gross deferred tax assets of $123million and $104
million and valuation allowances of $856,000 and $0, respectively. We have recorded a valuation
allowance against European net operating loss carryforwards due to uncertainties regarding our
ability to realize these deferred tax assets. This valuation allowance was recorded as an
adjustment to goodwill as these loss carryforwards were acquired in connection with the Empi
acquisition see Note 12. 64 Table of Contents On October22, 2004, the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004 was signed into law. Among other
items, the Act creates a temporary incentive to repatriate foreign earnings at a reduced rate.
This incentive is subject to a number of limitations and requirements, including adoption of a
specific domestic reinvestment plan for the repatriated funds. On December27, 2005, we
repatriated $45million in foreign earnings under this provision. Accordingly, we recognized a
charge of $271,000, which was recorded as income tax expense and increased our effective tax rate
by 17%. 11. EARNINGS PER SHARE Following is a reconciliation of the basic and diluted per share computations in thousands except

Because we incurred a net loss for the year ended December31, 2003, 11,586,456 incremental shares
from assumed conversions were not included in the computation of diluted earnings per share because
the inclusion of such would be anti-dilutive. For the years ended December31, 2005 and 2004 the
effect of 1,473,700 and 911,700 incremental shares from assumed conversions, respectively, were
excluded as anti-dilutive. 12. ACQUISITION OF EMPI On October4, 2004, we acquired Empi, a privately held Minnesota corporation. The total purchase
price of approximately $3698million was comprised of approximately $1728million payable to the
Empi common stockholders and option holders in cash, along with eight million shares of our common
stock, plus the repayment of approximately $1549million of outstanding Empi debt and $70million
in purchase costs. We funded the merger, which we refer to as the Empi acquisition, with proceeds
from the offering of $165million of senior subordinated notes, from borrowings under a new $180
million senior credit facility see Note 7 and from available cash. These proceeds and borrowings
were also used to repay substantially all of Encores and Empis existing debt and to pay all the
related fees and expenses of the Empi acquisition. The fair value of the Encore common stock issued of $351million was determined as $439 per share
based upon the average closing price of Encores common stock on the Nasdaq National Market for the
period from two days before to two days after the announcement of the Empi acquisition. During the first six months of 2005, the Empi purchase price was adjusted to reflect the resolution
of two contingencies. The first contingency related to an anticipated closing tax benefit generated
by the completion of the Empi acquisition, which resulted in a $60million payment to Empis
former stockholders and option holders. The second contingency related to completion of the audit
of Empis closing date balance sheet that resulted in a return to us of $291,000 of the original
acquisition consideration. In addition, we incurred an additional $249,000 in purchase costs. 65 Table of Contents As a result of these transactions, the total purchase price for the Empi acquisition has been
adjusted to $3757million. Under the purchase method of accounting, the total purchase price is
allocated to the acquired tangible and identifiable intangible assets and the assumed liabilities
of Empi based upon their estimated fair values as of the date of the merger. For certain of the
assets acquired inventory, fixed assets, intangible assets fair value was estimated based upon
third party appraisals. For the remaining assets and liabilities, book value was deemed to
approximate fair value due to the nature of the assets and liabilities.

Goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of tangible and
identifiable intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed, and is not tax deductible. The results of Empi have been included within the consolidated statement of operations since the
date of acquisition, October4, 2004. 13. ACQUISITION OF OTI On February22, 2005, we acquired substantially all of the assets of OTI, which included a line of
spinal implant products and several total knee and hip implant designs. The total purchase price
for the OTI assets of approximately $157million was comprised of approximately $145million
payable in cash to OTI and $12million in purchase costs. We borrowed $147million from our
existing line of credit to finance the OTI asset acquisition. The acquisition consideration is
subject to adjustment based upon the final balance sheet as of the closing date, which remains the
subject of a dispute between the former OTI shareholders and us. We do not anticipate the
resolution of the dispute will have a material impact on our financial position or results of
operations. Under the purchase method of accounting, the total purchase price for the OTI assets was allocated
to the acquired tangible and identifiable intangible assets and the assumed liabilities of OTI
based upon their estimated fair values as of the closing date. The following represents our
allocation of the aggregate purchase price for the OTI assets. We determined the fair value for
certain of the OTI assets we acquired based upon independent third party appraisals inventory,
fixed assets, intangible assets. For the remaining OTI assets and liabilities, book value was
deemed to approximate fair value due to the nature of the assets and liabilities. The following

We have included the results of OTI in our consolidated statement of operations since the date of
acquisition, February22, 2005. 14. DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS We make use of debt financing as a source of funds and are therefore exposed to interest rate
fluctuation in the normal course of our business. We operate internationally and are therefore
exposed to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations in the normal course of our business. As
part of our risk management strategy, we use derivative instruments to hedge portions of our
exposure. Before acquiring a derivative instrument to hedge a specific risk, potential natural
hedges are evaluated. Derivative instruments are only utilized to manage underlying exposures that
arise from our business operations and are not used for speculative purposes. Factors considered in
the decision to hedge an underlying market exposure include the materiality of the risk, the
volatility of the market, the duration of the hedge, and the availability, effectiveness and cost
of derivative instruments. Our $180million credit facility is subject to a floating interest rate. We manage the risk of
unfavorable movements in interest rates by hedging a portion of the outstanding loan balance.
Interest rate swap agreements were entered into in which we pay fixed rate interest on a
predetermined amount and receive floating rate interest in return. This reduces the effect of
rising interest rates, thereby making interest expense more predictable. As of December31, 2005,
we had two agreements in place, each for a notional amount of $25million, expiring in 2006 and
2007, respectively. Under these agreements we pay a fixed rate of 364% and receive a variable
rate equal to the current one month eurodollar rate. The fair value of our interest rate swap agreements recorded on the balance sheet as of December
31, 2005 was $761,000 and is recorded in other current and non-current assets. The fair value of
our swap agreements is recorded in other non-current liabilities at December31, 2004 at $269,000.
We believe our interest rate swaps are highly effective. Derivative net losses on our interest
rate swap agreements of $181,000 and $71,000, on a pre-tax basis, were included in interest expense
in fiscal year 2005 and 2004 respectively. If short-term interest rates were to remain at the
December31, 2005 levels, we estimate that $535,000 of pre-tax derivative gains deferred in
accumulated other comprehensive income will be reclassified into earnings within the next fiscal
year ending December31, 2006. Derivative gains and losses on cash flow hedges that qualify as
accounting hedges are reported as accumulated other comprehensive income net of tax, until such
time as they are reported along with the hedged item. By the nature of our international operations, we are exposed to fluctuation in foreign currency
rates. Our U.S. operations are subject to risk associated with international currency exchange
rates on purchases of inventory from a small number of suppliers. Our German subsidiary, whose
functional currency is the euro, is billed for certain inventory in U.S. dollars. We manage
potential negative effects of exchange rate fluctuations by occasionally entering into hedging
transactions in the form of forward exchange contracts, options or similar agreements. These
transactions historically have not qualified as accounting hedges, and accordingly, the gains and
losses from these derivatives are recorded in results of operations as they occur. At December31,
2005, we did not have any outstanding currency derivatives. At December31, 2004, we recorded
$59,000 of accumulated losses in other current liabilities related to our outstanding currency
derivatives. 67 Table of Contents 15. UNAUDITED QUARTERLY CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL DATA

Discontinued operations are included in net income and includes a $24million gain in the third
quarter of 2005. The three months ended December31, 2004 include the results of Empi, which was acquired on October
4, 2004. See Note 12 for additional information. 16. RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS During the first quarter of 2005, a portion of the total consideration we paid for the acquisition
of OTI was used to repay a $96,000 note payable due from OTI to Windy City, Inc. Windy City.
Joel Kanter, a member of our board of directors, is an officer and director of Windy City. In
connection with the acquisition, a finders fee obligation of OTI to Mr.Kanter in the amount of
$60,000 was also paid to Mr.Kanter at the closing of the OTI acquisition. On October4, 2004, we paid Galen Advisors LLC, an affiliate of one of our greater than 10%
stockholders, $1million as a consulting fee in connection with our acquisition of Empi. This
payment resulted from a consulting agreement with Galen Advisors LLC, which we entered into in
November2003. Under the terms of this agreement, Galen Advisors LLC assisted us in identifying,
negotiating and consummating strategic acquisitions. We agreed to pay a fee of $1million for
these services immediately following the closing, if any, of one or more merger or acquisition
transactions with a purchase price equal to or in excess of $25million in the aggregate. This
consulting agreement terminated upon the payment of this fee. The fee was recorded as a component
of the Empi acquisition costs. During the first quarter of 2004, in accordance with Section 16b of the Securities Exchange Act
of 1934, we received $288,000 from a greater than 10% stockholder and its affiliates, which
represented a short-swing profit under Section16 of the Exchange Act. The funds were earned
when shares of our stock were sold by this stockholder and its affiliates in our December2003
public offering, which was within six months of the date the stockholders received warrants to
acquire shares of our stock. The amounts received were recorded as an increase to additional
paid-in capital. 68 Table of Contents 17. DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS We account for our discontinued operations under the provisions of SFAS No144, Accounting for
the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets. Accordingly, we classified results of operations
and the related charges for discontinued operations as Income from discontinued operations, net of
tax in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Operations. We reclassified assets and
liabilities of the discontinued operations and reflected them on the accompanying Consolidated
Balance Sheets as Assets of discontinued operations and Liabilities of discontinued operations.
For comparative purposes, we restated all prior periods presented to reflect the reclassifications
on a consistent basis. On August8, 2005, we completed the sale of our orthopedic soft goods product line to dj
Orthopedics, LLC dj. The assets, which were previously included in our Orthopedic
Rehabilitation Division that were sold under the asset purchase and sale agreement included
bracing, splinting and patient safety products, for which we received a cash payment of $95
million. Under the terms of our current credit facility, we elected to make a $71million
principal payment using the net cash proceeds from the sale to dj of the pledged assets which
formerly constituted our orthopedic soft goods product line. We recorded a gain on the disposal of
discontinued operations of approximately $24million. The gain represented $93million of net
proceeds from the soft goods asset sale offset by i $49million book value of assets sold, ii
$400,000 of liabilities incurred in connection with the sale and iii $16million of income tax
expense. Discontinued operations are as follows in thousands

for a sixty-day period at agreed upon rates. As of December31, 2005, current assets are primarily
composed of accounts receivable and inventory, and current liabilities are primarily composed of
accounts payable related to inventory purchases. 18. COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES As of December31, 2005, we had entered into purchase commitments for inventory, capital
acquisitions and other services totaling approximately $248million in the ordinary course of
business. This amount includes our obligation to purchase $51million annually from Medireha,
which is 50% owned by us, through June30, 2007 under a distribution agreement granting us
exclusive rights to the distribution of products that Medireha manufactures. In October2004, we reached a settlement of an outstanding patent litigation matter. As part of
the settlement we entered into a product license agreement with the plaintiff and paid certain past
royalties involving a portion of our hip implant product line. The initial payment under the
product license agreement was $750,000, which included amounts related to the past royalties, as
well as settlement cost. We recorded the entire amount in selling, general and administrative
expenses during the third quarter of 2004. We were the subject of a Department of Commerce DOC investigation of Chattanoogas export
practices with respect to unlawfully trading with an embargoed country, and unlawfully preparing
export documentation. The DOC investigation commenced prior to our February2002 acquisition of
Chattanooga. We settled this matter with the DOC in August2005, with the payment of a $101,000
fine. This amount had been previously accrued as a liability for this matter on the Chattanooga
financial statements as of the date of the acquisition. 69 Table of Contents The following table summarizes our contractual obligations associated with our purchase obligations

The manufacturing and marketing of orthopedic medical products entails risk of product liability.
From time to time, we have been, and currently we are, subject to product liability claims and
litigation. In the future, we may again be subject to additional product liability claims, which
could have a negative impact on our business. We currently carry product liability insurance
subject to self-insurance deductible amounts. If a product liability claim or series of claims is
brought against us for uninsured liabilities or in excess of our insurance coverage, our business
could suffer materially and cause our stock price to fall. In addition, as a result of a product
liability claim, we may have to recall some of our products, which could result in significant
costs to us. 19. EMPLOYEE BENEFIT PLANS We have a qualified defined contribution plan, which allows for voluntary pre-tax contributions by
employees. We pay all general and administrative expenses of the plan and may make contributions
to the plan. We made matching contributions of approximately $12million, $698,000 and $389,000
to the plan in 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively, based on 50% of the first 6% of employee
contributions. 20. GUARANTOR / NON-GUARANTOR COMPANIES OF THE 93/4% SENIOR SUBORDINATED NOTES DUE 2012 Under the terms of our 93/4% senior subordinated notes due 2012, Encore Medical Corporation and our
U.S. subsidiaries guarantee the notes. Our foreign subsidiaries do not guarantee the notes. The
subsidiary issuer and each subsidiary guarantor is 100% owned by the parent company. All
guarantees are full and unconditional, and are also joint and several among the guarantor
companies. The indenture related to our notes imposes certain restrictions including, among other
things, limits on our ability and that of our subsidiaries to   
incur or guarantee additional indebtedness or issue preferred stock   
pay dividends or make other distributions   
repurchase our stock   
make investments   
sell or otherwise dispose of assets, including capital stock of subsidiaries   
create liens   
prepay, redeem or repurchase debt   
enter into agreements restricting our subsidiaries ability to pay dividends   
enter into transactions with affiliates; and   
consolidate, merge or sell all of our assets. 70 Table of Contents The following condensed consolidating schedules present condensed financial information of our
guarantors and our subsidiaries that are nonguarantors as of and for the periods presented below. ENCORE MEDICAL CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES Condensed Consolidating Balance Sheet

Consolidating financial statements prior to October4, 2004 do not provide additional
meaningful information to that which is presented in the consolidated financial statements. The
issuer Encore Medical IHC Inc. did not exist and the nonguarantor companies were not owned by
Encore prior to that date. As a result, we have omitted this information. 76 Table of Contents 21. SUBSEQUENT EVENTS On February24, 2006 we completed our acquisition of Compex Technologies, Inc. Compex. We
believe this acquisition creates a stronger company competing in the electrical stimulation
business giving Encore and Compex the ability to leverage their existing product lines,
intellectual property, research and development, engineering, sales and marketing, and patient
billing operations. In exchange for all of the outstanding common stock of Compex, we paid consideration of
approximately eighteen million shares of our common stock valued at approximately $900million,
based upon the average closing price of Encores common stock on the Nasdaq National Market for the
period from two days before to two days after the announcement of the Compex acquisition. In
addition we issued options to purchase approximately 23million shares of Encore common stock in
exchange for all of the outstanding options to purchase common stock of Compex. In connection with the transaction, we also incurred approximately $153million in debt, which was
primarily used to repay bank debt owed by Compex. In order to finance this repayment of Compex
debt, we increased our revolving line of credit from $30million to $50million. The acquisition of Compex will be accounted for as a purchase, with the results of Compex

Item5. Controls and Procedures Managements Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures We maintain disclosure controls and procedures that are designed to ensure that information
required to be disclosed in our Exchange Act reports is recorded, processed, summarized and
reported within the time periods specified in the SECs rules and forms, and that such information
is accumulated and communicated to management, including our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief
Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. As indicated in the certifications in Exhibit31 of this report, our Chief Executive Officer
and Chief Financial Officer, with the assistance of other members of our management, have evaluated
our disclosure controls and procedures as defined in the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 Rules
13a-15e and 15d-15e. Based upon the evaluation of our disclosure controls and procedures
required by Securities Exchange Act Rules13a-15b or 15d-15b, our Chief Executive Officer and
Chief Financial Officer have concluded that as of the end of the period covered by this report, our
disclosure controls and procedures were effective for the purpose of ensuring that material
information required to be in this annual report is made known to them by others on a timely basis. Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over
financial reporting. Our internal control system was designed to provide reasonable assurance to
the companys management and board of directors regarding the preparation and fair presentation of
published financial statements. All internal control systems, no matter how well designed, have inherent limitations.
Therefore, even those systems determined to be effective can provide only reasonable assurance with
respect to financial statement preparation and presentation. Encore management assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting
as of December31, 2005. In making this assessment, we used the criteria set forth by the
Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission COSOin Internal Control -
Integrated Framework. Based on our assessment we believe that, as of December31, 2005, our
internal control over financial reporting is effective based on those criteria. See our report on
internal control over financial reporting below. Encores independent registered public accounting firm has issued an audit report on our
assessment of our internal control over financial reporting. Their report appears on the following
page. Managements Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting Management of the Company is responsible for establishing and maintaining effective internal
control over financial reporting as defined in Rule13a-15f under the Securities Exchange Act of
1934. The Companys internal control over financial reporting is designed to provide reasonable
assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial
statements for external purposes in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the
United States of America. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent
or detect misstatements. Therefore, even those systems determined to be effective can provide only
reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement preparation and presentation. Management assessed the effectiveness of the Companys internal control over financial
reporting as of December31, 2005 using the criteria set forth in Internal ControlIntegrated
Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Based on
this assessment, management believes that, as of December31, 2005, the Companys internal control
over financial reporting was effective based on those criteria. Managements assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting as
of December31, 2005, has been audited by KPMG LLP, the independent registered public accounting
firm who also audited the Companys consolidated financial statements. KPMG LLPs attestation

Encore Medical Corporation We have audited managements assessment, included in the accompanying Managements Report on
Internal Control Over Financial Reporting, that Encore Medical Corporation maintained effective
internal control over financial reporting as of December31, 2005, based on criteria established in
Internal ControlIntegrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the
Treadway Commission COSO. Encore Medical Corporations management is responsible for maintaining
effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of
internal control over financial reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on
managements assessment and an opinion on the effectiveness of the Companys internal control over
financial reporting based on our audit. We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight
Board United States. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was
maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal
control over financial reporting, evaluating managements assessment, testing and evaluating the
design and operating effectiveness of internal control, and performing such other procedures as we
considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis
for our opinion. A companys internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable
assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial
statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A
companys internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that 1
pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the
transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; 2provide reasonable assurance that
transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance
with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company
are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company;
and 3provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized
acquisition, use, or disposition of the companys assets that could have a material effect on the
financial statements. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or
detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are
subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that
the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. In our opinion, managements assessment that Encore Medical Corporation maintained effective
internal control over financial reporting as of December31, 2005, is fairly stated, in all
material respects, based on criteria established in Internal ControlIntegrated Framework issued by
the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission COSO. Also, in our opinion,
Encore Medical Corporation maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over
financial reporting as of December31, 2005, based on criteria established in Internal
ControlIntegrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway
Commission COSO. We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight
Board United States, the consolidated balance sheets of Encore Medical Corporation and
subsidiaries as of December31, 2005 and 2004, and the related consolidated statements of
operations, changes in stockholders equity and comprehensive income, and cash flows for each of
the years in the three-year period ended December31, 2005, and our report dated March13, 2006
expressed an unqualified opinion on those consolidated financial statements. s/ KPMG LLP Austin, Texas
