GRIFFIN LAND NURSERIES,INC.      Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements      dollars in thousands, except per share data    
1.Summary of Significant Accounting Policies  Basis of Presentation  The accompanying consolidated financial statements of Griffin Land Nurseries,Inc. Griffin include the accounts of Griffin real estate
division Griffin Land and Griffin wholly-owned subsidiary, Imperial Nurseries,Inc. Imperial. All intercompany transactions have been eliminated. 
Griffin
accounts for its investments in Centaur Communications,Ltd. Centaur and real estate joint ventures under the equity method of accounting. Centaur reports on a
June30 fiscal year in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United Kingdom. However, Griffin reports its share of equity in Centaur earnings losses based upon
Griffin fiscal year. Griffin converts Centaur financial statements to accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America and translates balance sheet information at the
exchange rate as of the balance sheet date and uses the average exchange rates over the period to translate the statement of operations. Substantially all of Griffin investment in Centaur represents
the excess of the cost of Griffin investment over the book value of its equity in Centaur representing publishing rights and goodwill and, through fiscal 2002, was being amortized on a
straight-line basis over 30-40years, which commenced in 1985. Effective in fiscal 2003, Griffin no longer amortizes goodwill related to its investment in Centaur see
below, but continues to amortize publishing rights over 30years.  Restatement  In Centaur year ended June30, 2003, Centaur recorded a tax expense and a deferred tax liability of $883 that should have been previously provided as a
temporary difference in its fiscal 2002 financial statements. Under generally accepted accounting principles in the United Kingdom, Centaur was allowed to provide partial reserves for certain
temporary differences until Centaur 2002 fiscal year. This deferred tax provision recorded in Centaur 2003 fiscal year related to a transaction that took place in Centaur year ended
June30, 1996. Under accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, the full deferred tax provision should be reflected at the time it arises. Accordingly, the
adjustment impacts the 1996 fiscal year of Griffin previous parent company, Culbro Corporation Culbro prior to July3, 1997, when Griffin, including its investment in Centaur, was spun
off to Culbro shareholders. Centaur reported results for the twelve month period ended November30 are used by Griffin to record its share of Centaur earnings, however, in recording
Griffin equity share of Centaur earnings for the twelve months ended November30, 2003, Griffin excluded its $216 equity share of this 1996 expense and restated its investment in Centaur
and corresponding equity additional paid-in capital by $216 at the earliest balance sheet date reported.  Business Segments  Griffin is engaged in the landscape nursery and real estate businesses. Imperial, Griffin subsidiary in the landscape nursery segment, is engaged in growing
plants in containers which are sold principally to mass merchandisers, home centers, garden centers, wholesalers and landscape contractors. On January26, 2001, Imperial completed the sale of
its wholesale sales and service centers see Note2. Imperial remains in the landscape nursery business with its growing operations in Connecticut and northern Florida. 
Griffin
real estate segment, Griffin Land, builds, leases and manages commercial and industrial properties and develops residential subdivisions on its land in Connecticut and
Massachusetts. 
26  Fiscal Year  Griffin fiscal year ends on the Saturday nearest November30. Fiscal years 2003, 2002 and 2001 each contained 52 weeks and ended November29,
2003, November30, 2002 and December1, 2001, respectively.  Inventories  Griffin inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market using the average cost method. Nursery stock includes certain inventories which will not be sold
or used within one year. It is industry practice to include such inventories in current assets.  Stock-Based Compensation  Griffin accounts for stock options using the intrinsic value based method prescribed by Accounting Principles Board Opinion No25, Accounting for Stock
Issued to Employees, and complies with the disclosure provisions of SFAS No123 and SFAS No148, which require disclosing the pro forma effect on earnings and earnings per share of
the fair value method of accounting for stock-based compensation. Griffin amounts would have been the following pro forma amounts under the method prescribed by SFAS No123: For the Fiscal Years Ended Nov29,

2001 Net loss income, as reported 2,349 2,925 1,137 Total stock based employee compensation expense determined under fair value based method for all awards, net of tax effects 267 332 357 Net loss income, pro forma under SFAS No123 2,616 2,593 780 Adjusted net loss income for computation of diluted per share results, proforma under SFAS No123 2,659 2,310 757 Basic net loss income per common share, as reported 048 060 023 Basic net loss income per common share, pro forma under SFAS No123 054 053 016 Diluted net loss income per common share, as reported 049 053 022 Diluted net loss income per common share, pro forma under SFAS No123 055 046 015 Property and Equipment  Property and equipment are carried at cost. Depreciation is determined on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful asset lives for financial
reporting purposes and principally on accelerated methods for tax purposes. Repair and maintenance costs are expensed as incurred. 
27  Real Estate Held for Sale or Lease  Real estate held for sale or lease is carried at cost. Interest is capitalized during the construction period of major facilities. The capitalized interest is
recorded as part of the asset to which it relates and is amortized over the asset useful life. Depreciation is determined on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful asset lives
for financial reporting purposes and principally on accelerated methods for tax purposes. Repair and maintenance costs are expensed as incurred.  Impairment of Investments in Long-Lived Assets  Griffin periodically reviews long-lived assets to determine if there are indicators of impairment. When indicators of impairment are present, Griffin
evaluates the carrying value of the assets in relation to the operating performance and future undiscounted cash flows of the underlying assets. Griffin adjusts the net book value of the underlying
assets if the sum of the expected future cash flows is less than book value.  Revenue and Gain Recognition  In the landscape nursery business, sales and the related cost of sales are recognized upon shipment of products. Sales returns are not material. All amounts
billed to customers for shipping and handling are included in net sales and the costs of shipping and handling are included in cost of sales. 
In
the real estate business, revenue includes rental revenue from Griffin Land commercial and industrial properties and proceeds from the sales of real estate. Rental revenue is
accounted for in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards SFAS No13, Accounting for Leases. Gains on real estate sales are recognized in accordance with SFAS
No66, Accounting for Sales of Real Estate, based on the specific terms of each sale.  Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets  At the beginning of fiscal 2003, Griffin adopted SFAS No142 Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets. Under the provisions of SFAS No142, goodwill
is no longer amortized, but is subject to periodic tests for impairment based upon fair values. Griffin did not incur a charge for impairment upon adoption of SFAS No142. Accordingly, there
is no amortization of goodwill included in Griffin 
28 
results
from its equity investment in Centaur in fiscal 2003. The following reflects adjustments to the fiscal 2002 and fiscal 2001 results as if SFAS No142 had been adopted in those years: For the Fiscal Years Ended Nov29,
2003

2001 Net loss income, as reported 2,349 2,925 1,137 Add back: goodwill amortization related to equity investment 457 506 Adjusted net loss income 2,349 3,382 1,643 Reported basic net loss income per share 048 060 023 Adjusted basic net loss income per share 048 070 034 Reported diluted net loss income per share 049 053 022 Adjusted diluted net loss income per share 049 062 033 Griffin
other intangible assets consist principally of the value of above-market and below-market in-place leases and customer relationships with tenants recorded in
connection with Griffin acquisition in fiscal 2003 of a 70% interest in a joint venture that owned two office buildings. Griffin previously held the remaining 30% interest in these buildings.
Amortization of the value of above-market and below-market leases is determined on a straight-line basis over the lease terms. Amortization of the value of customer relationships with
tenants is determined on a straight-line basis over the lease terms and anticipated renewal periods. Other intangible assets are included in other assets on Griffin balance sheet.  Recent Accounting Pronouncements  In June2001, the FASB issued SFAS No143 Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations. This pronouncement addresses accounting and reporting for
obligations associated with the retirement of tangible long-lived assets and the associated asset retirement costs. SFAS No143 was effective for Griffin in fiscal 2003. This new
standard did not have an impact on Griffin fiscal 2003 financial statements. 
In
August2001, the FASB issued SFAS No144 Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets. This pronouncement retains the requirements of
SFAS No121 Accounting for the Impairment of Long-Lived Assets and for Long-Lived Assets to be Disposed of to recognize an impairment loss only if the carrying amount
of a long-lived asset is not recoverable from its undiscounted cash flow and measures an impairment loss as the difference between the carrying amount and fair value of the asset. This
pronouncement also addresses the accounting for long-lived assets to be disposed of other than by sale and long-lived assets to be disposed of by sale. SFAS No144 was
effective for Griffin in fiscal 2003. This new standard did not have an impact on Griffin fiscal 2003 financial statements. 
In
April2002, the FASB issued SFAS No145, Rescission of FASB Statements No4, 44, and 64, Amendment of FASB Statement No13, and Technical Corrections.
SFAS No145 requires gains and 
29  losses
from certain debt extinguishment as part of a risk management strategy not to be reported as extraordinary items. SFAS No145 was effective for Griffin in fiscal 2003. This new standard
did not have an impact on Griffin fiscal 2003 financial statements. 
In
June2002, the FASB issued SFAS No146, Accounting for Costs Associated with Exit or Disposal Activities. This new pronouncement addresses financial accounting and
reporting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities and requires that a liability for a cost associated with an exit or disposal activity be recognized when the liability is incurred. SFAS
No146 was effective for Griffin in fiscal 2003. This new standard did not have an impact on Griffin fiscal 2003 financial statements. In
November2002, the FASB issued FASB Interpretation No45, Guarantor Accounting and Disclosure Requirements for Guarantees, Including Indirect Guarantees of
Indebtedness of Others an interpretation of FASB Statement No5, Accounting for Contingencies, Fin No45. Fin No45 requires guarantors to recognize a liability for the
fair value of an obligation it assumes under a guarantee and requires certain disclosures related to guarantees. The provisions for initial recognition and measurement of guarantees under Fin
No45 apply on a prospective basis to guarantees issued or modified after December31, 2002. The disclosure requirements of Fin No45 were effective for Griffin in fiscal 2003.
The adoption of Fin No45 did not have an impact of Griffin financial statements. 
In
December2002, the FASB issued SFAS No148, Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation-Transition and Disclosure-an amendment of FASB Statement
No123. This Statement amends FASB Statement No123, Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation, to provide alternative methods of transition for a voluntary change to the fair value
based method of accounting for stock-based employee compensation, and requires enhanced disclosure of information on stock-based compensation in annual and interim financial statements. Management has
not changed its method of accounting for stock-based compensation, but has included the required enhanced disclosure. In
January2003, the FASB issued FASB Interpretation No46, Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities an interpretation of Accounting Research Bulletin No51,
Consolidated Financial Statements, Fin No46. Fin No46 requires existing unconsolidated variable interest entities to be included in the consolidated financial statements of a
business enterprise if the primary beneficiaries of the variable interest entities do not effectively disperse risk among all parties involved. The requirements of Fin No46 will be effective
for Griffin in fiscal 2004. The adoption of Fin No46 is not expected to have an impact on Griffin financial statements. In
April2003, the FASB issued SFAS No149, Amendment of Statement 133 on Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities. SFAS No149 is effective for derivative
contracts entered into or modified
after June30, 2003. Griffin does not currently have any derivative instruments. This new standard did not have an impact of Griffin financial statements. 
In
May2003, the FASB issued SFAS No150 Accounting for Certain Financial Instruments with Characteristics of both Liabilities and Equity. This new standard requires an
issuer to classify certain financial statements as liabilities or, in some instances, assets. SFAS No150 is effective for financial instruments entered into or modified after May31,
2003. This new standard did not have an impact on Griffin financial statements. 
30   Environmental Matters  Environmental expenditures are expensed or capitalized as appropriate, depending upon their future economic benefit. Expenditures that relate to an existing
condition caused by past operations, and do not have future economic benefit, are expensed. Expenditures that create future benefit or contribute to future revenue generation are capitalized.
Liabilities related to future remediation costs are recorded when environmental assessments and/or cleanups are probable, and the costs can be reasonably estimated. There were no liabilities related
to environmental assessments as of November29, 2003 and November30, 2002.  Fair Value of Financial Instruments  The amounts included in the financial statements for accounts receivable, accounts payable and accrued liabilities reflect their fair values because of the
short-term maturity of these instruments. The fair values of Griffin other financial instruments are discussed in Note5.  Earnings Per Share  Basic net income loss per common share is calculated by dividing net income loss by the average number of common shares outstanding during the year. The
calculation of diluted net income loss per common share includes adjusting Griffin net income loss to include the effect of stock options outstanding at Griffin equity investee, Centaur, and
adjusting outstanding shares, assuming conversion of all potentially dilutive Griffin stock options.  Reclassifications  Certain prior year balances have been reclassified to conform with the current year presentation.  Use of Estimates  The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that
affect the reported amount of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and revenue and expenses during the period reported.
Actual results could differ from those estimates. The more significant estimates include, among others, the impairment charge for Linguaphone recorded in fiscal 2001, the allowance for doubtful
accounts, the inventory reserves, deferred taxes, net realizable value of real estate held for sale or lease and the assumptions used in determining the accrual for postretirement benefits. 
2.Sale of Sales and Service Centers 
On January26, 2001, Imperial completed the sale of all of the assets of its seven wholesale sales and service centers the SSCs to Shemin
Nurseries,Inc. Shemin. Shemin also assumed certain liabilities related to the SSCs. The SSCs sold a wide variety of plant material and horticultural tools 
31  and
products to the landscape trade. A portion of the products sold by the SSCs were grown by Imperial farming operations. Imperial only continuing involvement in Shemin is an approximately 138%
ownership interest in Shemin parent company see below. A three year supply agreement pursuant to which Shemin was obligated to purchase Imperial grown product for the SSCs terminated in
January2004. The net book value of the assets sold and liabilities assumed by Shemin was $135million. Prior to the sale of the SSCs in fiscal 2001, the net sales of the SSCs were
$19million and the SSCs incurred an operating loss, before Imperial central overhead expenses, of $08million through the date of the sale. Imperial continues in the landscape
nursery business with its container growing operations in Connecticut and northern Florida. 
The
consideration received by Imperial on the sale of the SSCs included cash of $184million after expenses. Cash of $112million from the sale was used to repay all of
the amount then outstanding under Griffin revolving credit agreement. The remaining cash was used for general corporate purposes. In addition to the cash payment, Griffin received 20,570 shares of
common stock
representing approximately 138% of the outstanding common stock of Shemin Acquisition Corporation Acquisition, the parent company of Shemin. The common stock of Acquisition is valued at
$61million and is included in other assets on the accompanying balance sheet. As a result of Griffin retaining a common equity ownership interest in Acquisition, $15million of the
gain from the sale of the SSCs has been deferred, and is offset against the investment in Acquisition on Griffin balance sheet. Griffin accounts for its investment in Acquisition under the cost
method of accounting for investments. 
The
sale of the SSCs reflected the disposition of the following assets and liabilities by Imperial: Accounts receivable 1,407 Inventories 4,453 Other current assets 1,037 Fixed assets, net 7,393 Other assets 161 14,451 Accounts payable and accrued liabilities 719 Capital leases 271 Net assets disposed 13,461 The
following unaudited Pro Forma Condensed Consolidated Statement of Operations for the fiscal year ended December1, 2001 includes pro forma adjustments to reflect the sale of
the SSCs as if it had taken place at the beginning of the fiscal year presented. Such adjustments include the elimination of sales, cost of sales and direct operating expenses of the SSCs, the
elimination of salaries and benefits of employees terminated as a result of the sale of the SSCs, the inclusion of sales from Imperial growing operations to the SSCs acquired by Shemin, the effect
of the net cash proceeds on Griffin interest expense and interest income, and adjustment to Griffin income tax provision. 
32  In
the opinion of management, all adjustments necessary to fairly present this pro forma information have been made. The pro forma information does not purport to be indicative of the
results that would have been reported had this transaction actually occurred on the date specified, nor is it indicative of Griffin future results.

4.Income Taxes 
Griffin income tax benefit provision and deferred tax assets and liabilities in the accompanying financial statements have been calculated in accordance with
SFAS No109 Accounting for Income 
34  Taxes.
The income tax benefit provision for fiscal 2003, fiscal 2002 and fiscal 2001 are summarized as follows: For the Fiscal Years Ended Nov. 29,

release of an accrual for income tax liability in fiscal 2002 reflects the favorable settlement of tax examinations of earlier years. The tax examinations were made on tax returns
filed by Culbro, Griffin parent company prior to the distribution the Distribution of Griffin common stock to Culbro stockholders in 1997. The accrual for income taxes was assumed by Griffin
from Culbro at the time of the Distribution for unresolved tax examinations of earlier years. Under a Tax Sharing Agreement between Griffin and Culbro, Griffin remained liable after the Distribution
for tax assessments related to certain items included on Culbro consolidated income tax returns. The Tax Sharing Agreement provided, among other things, for the allocation between Culbro and Griffin
of federal, state, local and foreign tax liabilities for all periods that Griffin was a wholly-owned subsidiary of Culbro. With respect to the consolidated tax returns filed by Culbro, the Tax Sharing
Agreement provides that Griffin remained liable for any amounts that Culbro would have been required to pay with respect to any deficiencies assessed through the date that the common stock of Griffin
was distributed to Culbro shareholders, generally as if Griffin had filed separate tax returns. 
The
significant components of Griffin current deferred tax asset and noncurrent deferred tax asset liability are shown below. Griffin noncurrent deferred tax asset is included in
other assets on Griffin consolidated balance sheet as of November29, 2003.

November29, 2003, Griffin had United States federal net operating loss carryforwards of $21million which expire in 20years. State net operating loss
carryforwards of $51million range in expiration; $12million expires in one year, $06million expires in two years and $33million expires in nineteen years. A
valuation allowance was not provided against any deferred tax assets because management believes that it is more likely than not that the deferred tax assets will be realized, primarily from future
operations, the sale of appreciated assets and tax planning strategies. 
Although
realization of these deferred tax assets is not assured, Griffin assessed positive evidence including unrealized and unrecognized appreciation in net assets and tax planning
strategies, and negative evidence including Griffin losses in recent years, and concluded that it was more likely than not that all deferred tax assets will be realized. Realization is dependent on
generating sufficient future taxable income during periods in which temporary differences become deductible and prior to the expiration of net operating loss carryforwards. 5.Long-Term Debt

The
annual principal payment requirements under the terms of the mortgages for the years 2004 through 2008 are $527, $605, $632, $680, and $729, respectively. The aggregate book value of
land and buildings under the mortgages was $308million at November29, 2003. 
On
December17, 2002, Griffin completed a $975million nonrecourse mortgage of two office buildings. Proceeds of the mortgage were used to finance Griffin
$87million acquisition, completed on December6, 2002, of a 70% interest in those buildings. Griffin previously held the remaining 30% interest in those buildings. The mortgage has a
608% rate and a term of ten years, with payments based on a twenty-five year amortization period. 
On
February8, 2002, Griffin entered into a $194million revolving credit agreement, as amended the Credit Agreement with Fleet National Bank Fleet. The initial
borrowings under the Credit Agreement were used to repay the amount then outstanding $45million under Griffin bridge loan, to repay a mortgage of $04million on one of Griffin
commercial buildings and for certain expenses related to the Credit Agreement. The Credit Agreement is being used to finance working capital requirements at Griffin landscape nursery and real estate
businesses and for investment in Griffin real estate assets. Borrowings under the Credit Agreement may be, at Griffin option, on an overnight basis or for periods of one, two, three or six months.
Overnight borrowings bear interest at Fleet prime rate plus a margin of 05% per annum. Borrowings of one month and longer bear interest at the London Interbank Offered Rate LIBOR plus a margin
of 25% per annum. The amount outstanding at November29, 2003 under the Credit agreement had a weighted average interest rate of 363%. There are no compensating balance requirements, and
Griffin pays a commitment fee of 025% per annum on unused borrowing capacity. The Credit Agreement is collateralized by certain of Griffin real estate assets and includes financial covenants with
respect to Griffin fixed charge coverage as defined, net worth and leverage. 
On
September17, 2002, Griffin completed a $77million nonrecourse mortgage of two commercial properties. Proceeds of the mortgage were used to reduce the amount then
outstanding under the Credit Agreement. The mortgage has an interest rate of 70% and a term of fifteen years, with payments based on a twenty-five year amortization period. One of the
properties included in this mortgage was previously included as collateral under the Credit Agreement. As a result of releasing that property from the collateral of the Credit Agreement, the amount
available for borrowing under the Credit Agreement was reduced to $141million. On May22, 2003, the Credit Agreement was amended to provide for an increase in the commitment amount
from $141million to $205million as additional real estate assets were added to the collateral for the Credit Agreement. 
At
November29, 2003, Griffin was not in compliance with the fixed charge covenant of the Credit Agreement. On February23, 2004, Griffin and Fleet completed the Fourth
Amendment the Fourth Amendment to the Credit Agreement. The Fourth Amendment includes a waiver of the fixed charge coverage covenant as of November29, 2003, and requires Griffin to pledge
the accounts receivable and inventory of Imperial as additional collateral for the Credit Agreement. The Fourth Amendment also increased interest rates on overnight and LIBOR based borrowings under
the Credit Agreement by 05% each. Under the terms of the Fourth Amendment, Griffin is required to either acomplete the sale of Griffin investment in Centaur by May1, 2004 see
Note12 with the proceeds used to pay down outstanding indebtedness under the Credit Agreement, or braise a minimum of $18million in debt and equity financing by
June1, 2004. Accordingly, the amount outstanding under the Credit Agreement at November29, 2003 is included in current liabilities on Griffin balance sheet. As part of the
requirement to raise additional capital, Griffin President and Chief Executive Officer has committed to Fleet Bank to exercise stock options, which would generate $42million of proceeds to 
37  Griffin.
Completion of the sale of Centaur within the required time frame would negate the requirement of Griffin President and Chief Executive Officer to exercise stock options. 
At
November29, 2003 and November30, 2002, the fair value of Griffin mortgages was $323million and $239million, respectively. Fair value was based on
the present value of future cash flows discounted at estimated borrowing rates for comparable risks, maturities and collateral. Management believes that because of their variable interest rates, the
amounts included on Griffin balance sheet for the Credit Agreement at November29, 2003 and November30, 2002 reflect their fair values. 
Future
minimum lease payments under capital leases for transportation equipment and the present value of such payments as of November29, 2003 were: 2004 237 2005 104 2006 33 2007 8 2008 3 Total minimum lease payments 385 Less: amounts representing interest 25 Present value of minimum lease payments a 360 aIncludes
current portion of $176 at November29, 2003. At
November29, 2003 and November30, 2002, machinery and equipment included capital leases amounting to $257 and $305, respectively, which is net of accumulated
amortization of $399 and $398, respectively, at November29, 2003 and November30, 2002. Amortization expense relating to capital leases in fiscal 2003, fiscal 2002 and fiscal 2001 was
$147, $174 and $204, respectively. 
6.Retirement Benefits  Savings Plan  Griffin maintains the Griffin Land Nurseries,Inc. 401k Savings Plan the Griffin Savings Plan for its employees, a defined contribution plan
whereby Griffin matches 60% of each employee contribution, up to a maximum of 5% of base salary. Griffin contributions to the Griffin Savings Plan in fiscal 2003, fiscal 2002 and fiscal 2001 were
$155, $152 and $156, respectively.  Deferred Compensation Plan  Griffin liability under its non-qualified deferred compensation plan the Deferred Compensation Plan at November29, 2003 and
November30, 2002 was $430 and $243, respectively. These amounts are included in other liabilities. The expense for Griffin matching contributions to the Deferred Compensation Plan in fiscal
2003, fiscal 2002 and fiscal 2001 was $25, $20 and $27, respectively. The Deferred Compensation Plan is unfunded, with benefits to be paid from Griffin general assets.  Postretirement Benefits  Griffin maintains a postretirement benefits program which provides principally health and life insurance benefits to certain of its employees. The liability for
postretirement benefits is included in other noncurrent liabilities on the consolidated balance sheet. Because Griffin obligation for retiree medical 
38 
benefits
is fixed under the terms of Griffin postretirement benefits program, any increase in the medical cost trend would have no effect on the accumulated postretirement benefit obligation,
service cost or interest cost. The components of Griffin postretirement benefits expense are as follows: For the Fiscal Years Ended Nov. 29,

39   Griffin Stock Option Plan  The Griffin Land Nurseries,Inc. 1997 Stock Option Plan the Griffin Stock Option Plan, adopted in 1997 and subsequently amended, makes
available a total of 1,250,000 options to purchase shares of Griffin common stock. Options granted under the Griffin Stock Option Plan may be either incentive stock options or
non-qualified stock options issued at market value on the date approved by the Board of Directors of Griffin. None of the options outstanding at November29, 2003 may be exercised
as stock appreciation rights.

options outstanding under the Griffin Stock Option Plan were exerciseable with a weighted average price of $1229 per share.  Stock-Based Compensation  Griffin accounts for stock options under Accounting Principles Board Opinion No25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees, and has adopted the
disclosure provisions of SFAS No123 which require disclosing the pro forma effect on earnings and earnings per share of the fair value method of accounting for stock-based compensation. The
effect on net loss income and per share results had compensation cost been recognized based on the fair value of the options at the grant dates for awards under those plans consistent with SFAS
No123 using the Black-Scholes fair value method for option pricing is included in Note1 under Stock-Based Compensation. 
The
weighted average fair values of each option granted during fiscal 2003, fiscal 2002 and fiscal 2001, were $563, $715 and $482, respectively, estimated as of the date of grant
using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model. The following weighted average assumptions were used in the model to calculate the fair value of each option; expected volatility of approximately 47% in
fiscal 2003, 46% in fiscal 2002, and 35% in fiscal 2001; risk free interest rates in fiscal 2003, fiscal 2002 and fiscal 2001 of 243%, 477% and 500%, respectively; expected option term of
5years and no dividend yield for all options issued. 
8.Operating Leases 
Future minimum rental payments for the next five years under noncancelable leases as of November29, 2003 were: 2004 175 2005 169 2006 167 2007 165 2008 133 Later years Total minimum lease payments 809 Total
rental expense for all operating leases in fiscal 2003, fiscal 2002 and fiscal 2001 were $153, $157 and $182, respectively. 
41  As
lessor, Griffin Land real estate activities include the leasing of office and industrial space in Connecticut. Future minimum rentals to be received under noncancelable leases as of
November29, 2003 were: 2004 9,517 2005 8,805 2006 8,083 2007 6,343 2008 3,512 Later years 19,034 55,294 Total
rental revenue from all leases in fiscal 2003, fiscal 2002 and fiscal 2001 was $9,528, $6,557 and $5,402, respectively. 
9.Investments  Investment in Centaur  Griffin holds 54million shares of the 154million shares of Centaur common stock outstanding, or approximately 35%. For each of the three fiscal
years ended November29, 2003, Griffin equity share of Centaur results reflect Centaur results for the twelve month periods ended November30, 2003, November30, 2002, and
November30, 2001, respectively. Griffin retained earnings at November30, 2003 includes $56million of cumulative equity earnings recognized. The following table reflects
Centaur results for the twelve month periods ended November30, 2003, November30, 2002, and November30, 2001. Twelve Months Ended Nov. 30,

In
August, 2002 Centaur completed the sale of its Lawtel operation that provides on-line legal information. Griffin did not receive any cash from the sale as Centaur used the
proceeds to pay down debt. Griffin equity share of the gain was $84million, and is included in Griffin equity income from Centaur in the fiscal year ended November30, 2002. Lawtel
is accounted for as a discontinued operation in Centaur operating results presented above. Also
included in Griffin equity results from Centaur in the fiscal year ended November30, 2002 was a charge for goodwill impairment at Centaur of which Griffin equity share
of this charge was $50million. Centaur income tax benefit from continuing operations in the fiscal year ended November30, 2002 includes the effect of a reduction of a valuation
allowance on certain deferred tax assets related to prior years operating losses of a subsidiary of Centaur. Griffin equity share of this item was $07million. The income tax benefit
provision of Centaur reflects the nondeductability of certain expenses under tax laws in the United Kingdom. A
reconciliation of Centaur income to Griffin equity income loss as reflected on the statements of operations is as follows: For the Fiscal Years Ended Nov. 29,

In
Centaur year ended June30, 2003, Centaur recorded a tax expense and a deferred tax liability of $883 related to an error pertaining to its year ended
June30, 1996. Such expense was reflected in Centaur results for the twelve month period ended November30, 2003 as set forth above, which results are used by Griffin to record its
equity share of Centaur earnings. In recording its equity share of Centaur earnings for Griffin year ended November30, 2003, Griffin excluded its $216 equity share of this 1996 expense
and restated its investment in Centaur and corresponding equity additional paid in capital by $216 at the earliest balance sheet date reported see Note1. 
On
January15, 2004, Griffin and the other principal shareholders of Centaur reached a preliminary agreement providing for the sale of all of the outstanding equity interests in
Centaur. Consummation of the sale is subject to numerous contingencies see Note12.  Real Estate Joint Venture  On December6, 2002, Griffin acquired the remaining 70% interest in a joint venture for $87million. Griffin previously held a 30% interest in the
joint venture. Subsequent to the acquisition, Griffin investment in the joint venture was terminated. The book value of Griffin 30% ownership interest in the joint venture was $31million
at the time of the acquisition it is included in other assets at November30, 2002 and was reclassified, principally into real estate held for lease. Griffin accounted for its acquisition of
the remaining 70% interest in the real estate joint venture in accordance with SFAS No141 Business Combinations, which requires the fair value of the real estate acquired to be allocated to
the acquired tangible assets, consisting of land, building and tenant improvements, and identified intangible assets and liabilities, consisting of the value of above-market and below-market leases,
other value of in-place leases and value of tenant relationships, based in each case on their fair values. Griffin allocated the purchase price to the fair value of the tangible assets of
the acquired property which includes the land, building, and tenant improvements determined by valuing the property as if it were vacant. The as-if-vacant value was
allocated to land, building, and tenant improvements based on management determination of the relative fair values of these assets. Above-market and below-market in-place lease values
for owned properties were recorded based on the present value using an interest rate which reflects the risks associated with the leases acquired of the difference between ithe contractual
amounts to be paid pursuant to the in-place leases and iimanagement estimate of fair market lease rates for the corresponding in-place leases, measured over a
period equal to the remaining non-cancelable term of each lease. The capitalized above-market lease values will be amortized as a reduction of rental income over the remaining
non-cancelable terms of the respective leases. The capitalized below-market lease values will be amortized as an increase to rental income over the initial term and any
fixed-rate renewal periods in the respective leases. The aggregate value of other intangible assets acquired was based on the difference between ithe property valued with
existing in-place leases adjusted to market rental rates and iithe property valued as if vacant. Management estimates of value were made using methods similar to those used by
independent appraisers e.g., discounted cash flow analysis. Factors considered by management in its analysis include an estimate of carrying costs during hypothetical expected lease-up
periods considering current market conditions and costs to execute similar leases. The total amount of other intangible assets acquired were further allocated to customer relationship intangible
values based on management evaluation of the specific characteristics of each tenant lease and Griffin overall relationship with that respective tenant. Griffin relationships with the tenant,
growth prospects for 
44 
developing
new business with the tenant, the tenant credit quality and expectations of lease renewals including those existing under the terms of the lease agreement, were used in considering the
value of tenant relationships. At November29, 2003, intangible assets of $879, net of accumulated amortization, are included in other assets on Griffin balance sheet. 
10.Supplemental Financial Statement Information  Related Party Transactions  Prior to the July3, 1997 distribution of the common stock of Griffin to Culbro stockholders the Distribution, Griffin was a wholly-owned subsidiary of
Culbro. Prior to the Distribution, Griffin, as lessor, and General Cigar Co.,Inc. General Cigar, as lessee, entered into a lease for certain agricultural land in Connecticut and
Massachusetts the Agricultural Lease. At the time the Agricultural Lease was consummated, both Griffin and General Cigar were wholly-owned subsidiaries of Culbro. The Agricultural Lease is for
approximately 500 acres of arable land held by Griffin for possible development in the long term, but which is being used by General Cigar for growing Connecticut Shade wrapper tobacco. General
Cigar use of the land is limited to the cultivation of cigar wrapper tobacco. The Agricultural Lease has an initial term of ten years and provides for the extension of the lease for additional
periods thereafter. In addition, at Griffin option, the Agricultural Lease may be terminated with respect of up to 100 acres of such land annually upon one year prior notice. The rent payable by
General Cigar under the Agricultural Lease is approximately equal to the aggregate amount of all taxes and other assessments payable by Griffin attributable to the land leased. In fiscal 2003, fiscal
2002 and fiscal 2001 General Cigar made rental payments of $148, $147 and $144, respectively, to Griffin with respect to the Agricultural Lease. 
Also
prior to the Distribution in 1997, Griffin entered into a Services Agreement the Services Agreement with Culbro, and its successor, General Cigar Holdings,Inc. GC
Holdings. The Services Agreement was terminated with respect to all services provided by GC Holdings after one year, except for certain transportation services, with respect to which the Services
Agreement was amended and extended through March2002, at which time it was not renewed. In fiscal 2002 and fiscal 2001 Griffin paid $55 and $109, respectively, to GC Holdings under the
Services Agreement. As of November29, 2003, and November30, 2002 there were no amounts due GC Holdings from Griffin with respect to the Services Agreement. 
In
1997 subsequent to the Distribution, Griffin, as lessor, and General Cigar, as lessee, entered into a lease for approximately 40,000 square feet of office space in the Griffin Center
South office complex in Bloomfield, Connecticut the Commercial Lease. The Commercial Lease has an initial term of ten years and provides for the extension of the lease for additional annual
periods thereafter. Under the Commercial Lease, General Cigar made rental payments to Griffin in fiscal 2003, fiscal 2002 and fiscal 2001 of $504, $508 and $506, respectively. Management believes the
rent payable by General Cigar to Griffin under the Commercial Lease approximates market rates at the time the lease was entered into. 
45  Comprehensive Income  The statement of stockholders' equity for the years ended November29, 2003, November30, 2002, and December1, 2001 includes other
comprehensive income loss of $399, $375, and $61, respectively, relating to the effect of translation adjustments on Griffin equity investment in Centaur.  Inventories  Inventories consist of: Nov. 29,

48  12.Commitments and Contingencies 
As of November29, 2003, Griffin had committed purchase obligations of $37million, a portion of which will be reimbursed by the tenant, including
materials and services related to tenant improvements at one of Griffin Land buildings in connection with a ten year lease extension. Also in connection with that transaction, Griffin paid
$12million in fiscal 2003 as an inducement to the tenant to enter into the ten year lease extension. 
On
January15, 2004, Griffin and the other principal shareholders of Centaur executed a heads of agreement a preliminary agreement providing for the sale of all of their
outstanding equity interests in Centaur. Consummation of the sale is subject to numerous contingencies, including without limitation, the satisfactory completion of due diligence and the receipt of
sufficient financing by the buyer. The form of consideration to be received by Griffin in the transaction would be principally cash, but would include some securities of the buyer. Based on the terms
of the heads of agreement, Griffin gain on this transaction is expected to be in the range of in excess of $700 per share. The non-cash portion of this gain may require deferral.
Differences between the book and tax basis of the Centaur investment could result in a significant change to Griffin effective tax rate in the period in which the sale is consummated. There can be
no assurance that the transactions
contemplated by the heads of agreement will be consummated at all or consummated on the currently contemplated terms. Griffin
is involved, as a defendant, in various litigation matters arising in the ordinary course of business. In the opinion of management, based on the advice of legal counsel, the
ultimate liability, if any, with respect to these matters will not be material to Griffin financial position, results of operations or cash flows.

Report of Independent Auditors    
To
the Stockholders and Directors of
Griffin Land Nurseries,Inc. 
In
our opinion, the accompanying consolidated balance sheets and the related consolidated statements of operations, stockholders' equity and of cash flows present fairly, in all material
respects, the financial position of Griffin Land Nurseries,Inc. and its subsidiaries at November29, 2003 and November30, 2002 and the results of their operations and
their cash flows for each of the three fiscal years ended November29, 2003 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. These financial
statements are the responsibility of the management of Griffin Land Nurseries,Inc.; our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audits. We
conducted our audits of these statements in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in the United States of America, which require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable
assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial
statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, and evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a
reasonable basis for our opinion.

Item 5.CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 
Griffin maintains disclosure controls and procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in its Exchange Act reports is
recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the Securities and Exchange Commission rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to
Griffin management, including its Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. In designing and evaluating the
disclosure controls and procedures, management recognized that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired
control objectives, and management necessarily was required to apply its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible controls and procedures. Also, we have investments
in certain unconsolidated entities. As we do not control or manage these entities, our disclosure controls and procedures with respect to such entities are necessarily substantially more limited than
those we maintain with respect to our consolidated subsidiaries. In particular, we have no ability to independently evaluate Centaur internal controls over financial reporting, and our disclosure
controls and procedures with respect to Centaur consist of inquiries of management including the chief financial officer regarding the effectiveness of Centaur internal controls over financial
reporting and the effectiveness of its disclosure controls and procedures. 
As
required by SEC Rule13a-15b, Griffin carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of Griffin management, including Griffin
Chief Executive Officer and Griffin Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of Griffin disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the fiscal period
covered by this report. Based on the foregoing, Griffin Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that Griffin disclosure controls and procedures were effective at the
reasonable assurance level. 
There
has been no change in Griffin internal controls over financial reporting during Griffin most recent fiscal quarter that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to
materially affect, Griffin internal controls over financial reporting.
