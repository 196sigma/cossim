PIONEER NATURAL RESOURCES COMPANY
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006
NOTE A.
Organization and Nature of Operations
Pioneer Natural Resources Company Pioneer or the Company is a Delaware corporation whose common stock is listed and traded on the New York Stock Exchange. The Company is a large independent oil and gas exploration and production company with continuing operations in the United States, South Africa and Tunisia.
NOTE B.
Summary of Significant Accounting Policies
Principles of consolidation. The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its wholly-owned and majority-owned subsidiaries since their acquisition or formation. Statement of Financial Accounting Standards Board FASB Interpretation No. 46 revised December 2003 Consolidation of Variable
Interest Entities FIN46R requires that the Companys consolidated financial statements also include the accounts of variable interest entities VIEs in which Pioneer holds a variable interest that will absorb a majority of the entities expected losses, receive a majority of the entities expected residual returns, or both. In accordance therewith, the accompanying consolidated financial statements include the accounts of PNR
Holdings LLC as of and for the year ended December 31, 2007 see Oil and gas properties, below for additional information regarding PNR Holdings LLC. The Company proportionately consolidates less than 100 percent-owned affiliate partnerships, for which certain of its wholly-owned subsidiaries serve as general partners, involved in oil and gas producing activities in accordance with Emerging Issues Task Force EITF Abstract Issue No. 00-1,
Investor Balance Sheet and Income Statement Display under the Equity Method for Investments in Certain Partnerships and Other Ventures. The Company owns less than a 31 percent interest in the oil and gas partnerships that it proportionately consolidates. All material intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated.
Minority interests in consolidated subsidiaries. On May 6, 2008, Pioneer Southwest Energy Partners L.P. Pioneer Southwest, a subsidiary of the Company, completed its initial public offering, at a per-unit offering price of $1900, of 9,487,500 common units, representing a 316 percent limited partner interest in Pioneer
Southwest. Associated therewith, the Company recognized $1660 million of net proceeds from the issuance of Pioneer Southwest common units in net cash provided by financing activities in the accompanying consolidated statement of cash flows for the year ended December 31, 2008 and recognized a $1326 million noncash gain on the sale of Pioneer Southwest common units in the accompanying consolidated statement of stockholders equity for the year ended December 31, 2008. Pioneer
Southwest owns interests in certain oil and gas properties previously owned by the Company in the Spraberry field in the Permian Basin of West Texas. The Company owns a 01 percent general partner interest and a 683 percent limited partner interest in Pioneer Southwest. The financial position, results of operations, and cash flows of Pioneer Southwest are consolidated with those of the Company. The Company elected to account for gains on Pioneer Southwests issuance of common
units as equity transactions as permitted by Staff Accounting Bulletin SAB Topic 5H, Accounting for Sales of Stock by a Subsidiary.
In addition to Pioneer Southwest, the Company owns the majority interests in certain subsidiaries with operations in the United States and owned the majority interest in a subsidiary with operations in Nigeria, which was disposed of in 2007.

In accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards SFAS No. 144, Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets SFAS 144, the Company has reflected the results of operations of the above divestitures as discontinued operations, rather than as a component
of continuing operations. See Note V for additional information regarding discontinued operations.
Use of estimates in the preparation of financial statements. Preparation of the accompanying consolidated financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the
disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods. Depletion of oil and gas properties and impairment of goodwill and proved and unproved oil and gas properties, in part, is determined using estimates of proved and probable oil and gas reserves. There are numerous uncertainties inherent in the estimation of quantities of proved and probable reserves and in the
projection of future rates of production and the timing of development expenditures. Similarly, evaluations for impairment of proved and unproved oil and gas properties are subject to numerous uncertainties including, among others, estimates of future recoverable reserves; commodity price outlooks; foreign laws, restrictions and currency exchange rates; and export and excise taxes. Actual results could differ from the estimates and assumptions utilized.
Cash equivalents. Cash and cash equivalents include cash on hand and depository accounts held by banks.
Accounts and notes receivable. As of December 31, 2008 and 2007, the Company had accounts receivable trade, net of allowances for bad debts, of $2068 million and 2832 million, respectively, and notes receivable, net of allowances for bad debts, of $113 million and $177 million, respectively. The Companys accounts receivable
trade are primarily comprised of oil and gas sales receivable, joint operations receivables and other receivables for which the Company does not require collateral security. The Companys notes receivable are primarily comprised of notes collateralized by drilling rigs and long-lived assets.
As of December 31, 2008 and December 31, 2007, the Companys allowances for doubtful accounts totaled $324 million and $122 million, respectively. In accordance with SFAS No. 5, Accounting for Contingencies, the Company establishes allowances for bad debts equal to the estimable portions of accounts and notes receivables for which failure to collect is
considered probable. The Company estimates the portions of joint interest receivables for which failure to collect is probable based on percentages of joint interest receivables that are past due. The Company estimates the portions of other receivables for which failure to collect is probable based on the relevant facts and circumstances surrounding the receivable. Allowances for doubtful accounts are recorded as reductions to the carrying values of the receivables included in the
Companys consolidated balance sheets and as charges to other expense in the consolidated statements of operations in the accounting periods during which failure to collect an estimable portion is determined to be probable.

Investments. Investments in unaffiliated equity securities that have a readily determinable fair value are classified as trading securities if managements current intent is to hold them for the near term; otherwise, they are accounted for as available-for-sale securities. The Company reevaluates the
classification of investments in unaffiliated equity securities at each balance sheet date. The carrying value of trading securities and available-for-sale securities are adjusted to fair value as of each balance sheet date.

December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006
Unrealized holding gains are recognized for trading securities in interest and other income, and unrealized holding losses are recognized in other expense during the periods in which changes in fair value occur.
Unrealized holding gains and losses are recognized for available-for-sale securities as credits or charges to stockholders equity and other comprehensive income loss during the periods in which changes in fair value occur. Realized gains and losses on the divestiture of available-for-sale securities are determined using the average cost method. The Company had no
investments in available-for-sale securities as of December 31, 2008 or 2007.
Investments in unaffiliated equity securities that do not have a readily determinable fair value are measured at the lower of their original cost or the net realizable value of the investment. The Company had no significant equity security investments that did not have a readily determinable fair value as of December 31, 2008 or 2007.
Inventories. Inventories were comprised of $1587 million and $943 million of materials and supplies and $84 million and $33 million of commodities as of December 31, 2008 and 2007, respectively. The Companys materials and supplies inventory is primarily comprised of oil and gas drilling or repair items such as tubing, casing,
chemicals, operating supplies and ordinary maintenance materials and parts. The materials and supplies inventory is primarily acquired for use in future drilling operations or repair operations and is carried at the lower of cost or market, on a first-in, first-out cost basis. Market, in the context of inventory valuation, represents net realizable value, which is the amount that the Company is allowed to bill to the joint accounts under joint operating agreements to which the
Company is a party. Any valuation reserve allowances of materials and supplies inventory are recorded as reductions to the carrying values of the materials and supply inventories in the Companys consolidated balance sheets and as losses on disposition of assets in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations. As of December 31, 2008 and 2007, the Companys materials and supplies inventory was net of $47 million and $11 million, respectively, of valuation
reserve allowances. The Company estimates that approximately $902 million of its December 31, 2008 materials and supplies inventory will not be utilized during 2009 due to declines in budgeted drilling activities. Accordingly, those inventory values have been classified as other noncurrent assets in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2008.
Commodities inventories are carried at the lower of average cost or market, on a first-in, first-out basis. The Companys commodities inventories consist of oil and natural gas liquids NGLs held in storage. Any valuation allowances of commodities inventories are recorded as reductions to the carrying values of the commodities inventories included in the
Companys consolidated balance sheets and as charges to other expense in the consolidated statements of operations. As of December 31, 2008, the Companys commodities inventories were net of $159 thousand of valuation allowances.
Oil and gas properties. The Company utilizes the successful efforts method of accounting for its oil and gas properties. Under this method, all costs associated with productive wells and nonproductive development wells are capitalized while nonproductive exploration costs and geological and geophysical expenditures are expensed. The Company
capitalizes interest on expenditures for significant development projects, generally when the underlying project is sanctioned, until such projects are ready for their intended use. For large development projects requiring significant upfront development costs to support the drilling and production of a planned group of wells, the Company continues to capitalize interest on the portion of the development costs attributable to the planned wells yet to be drilled.
The Company does not carry the costs of drilling an exploratory well as an asset in its consolidated balance sheetsfollowing the completion of drilling unlessboth of the following conditions are met       
i
The well has found a sufficient quantity of reserves to justify its completion as a producing well.
ii
The Company is making sufficient progress assessing the reserves and the economic and operating viability of the project.
Due to the capital intensive nature and the geographical location of certain projects, it may take the Company longer than one year to evaluate the future potential of the exploration well and economics associated with making a determination on its commercial viability. In these instances, the projects feasibility is not contingent upon price improvements or advances in
technology, but rather the Companys ongoing efforts and expenditures related to

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006
accurately predicting the hydrocarbon recoverability based on well information, gaining access to other companies production, transportation or processing facilities and/or getting partner approval to drill additional appraisal wells. These activities are ongoing and being pursued constantly. Consequently, the Companys assessment of suspended exploratory well costs is continuous until a
decision can be made that the well has found proved reserves or is noncommercial and is charged to exploration and abandonments expense. See Note D for additional information regarding the Companys suspended exploratory well costs.
The Company owns interests in four natural gas processing plants and thirteen treating facilities. The Company operates two of the gas processing plants and twelve of the treating facilities. The Companys ownership interests in the natural gas processing plants and treating facilities is primarily to accommodate handling the Companys gas production and thus are
considered a component of the capital and operating costs of the respective fields that they service. To the extent that there is excess capacity at a plant or treating facility, the Company attempts to process third party gas volumes for a fee to keep the plant or treating facility at capacity. All revenues and expenses derived from third party gas volumes processed through the plants and treating facilities are reported as components of oil and gas production costs. Third party
revenues generated from the plant and treating facilities for the three years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006 were $394 million, $303 million and $286 million, respectively. Third party expenses attributable to the plants and treating facilities for the same respective periods were $144 million, $121 million and $84 million. The capitalized costs of the plants and treating facilities are included in proved oil and gas properties and are depleted using the
unit-of-production method along with the other capitalized costs of the field that they service.
Capitalized costs relating to proved properties are depleted using the unit-of-production method based on proved reserves. Costs of significant nonproducing properties, wells in the process of being drilled and development projects are excluded from depletion until such time as the related project is completed and proved reserves are established or, if unsuccessful, impairment is
determined.
Proceeds from the sales of individual properties and the capitalized costs of individual properties sold or abandoned are credited and charged, respectively, to accumulated depletion, depreciation and amortization. Generally, no gain or loss is recognized until the entire amortization base is sold. However, gain or loss is recognized from the sale of less than an entire
amortization base if the disposition is significant enough to materially impact the depletion rate of the remaining properties in the depletion base.
In accordance with SFAS No. 144, the Company reviews its long-lived assets to be held and used, including proved oil and gas properties accounted for under the successful efforts method of accounting, whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying value of those assets may not be recoverable. An impairment loss is indicated if the sum of the expected future cash flows
is less than the carrying amount of the assets. In this circumstance, the Company recognizes an impairment loss for the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds the estimated fair value of the asset. Estimates of the sum of expected future cash flows requires management to estimate future recoverable proved and risk-adjusted probable and possible reserves, forecasts of future commodity prices, production and capital costs anddiscount rates. Uncertainties about
these future cash flow variables cause impairment estimates to be inherently imprecise. See Note S for additional information regarding the Companys impairment assessments.
Unproved oil and gas properties are periodically assessed for impairment on a project-by-project basis. The impairment assessment is affected by the results of exploration activities, commodity price outlooks, planned future sales or expiration of all or a portion of such projects. If the quantity of potential reserves determined by such evaluations is not sufficient to fully
recover the cost invested in each project, the Company will recognize an impairment loss at that time.
During December 2007, PNR Holdings LLC completed acquisitions of proved and unproved oil and gas properties located in the Raton Basin in southeastern Colorado and the Barnett Shale play in North Texas for $3522 million. The Company caused PNR Holdings LLC to be formed pursuant to an agreement with a third party in anticipation of having the acquisitions treated as part of a
tax-deferred, like-kind-exchange with the anticipated sale of oil and gas properties to Pioneer Southwest, a subsidiary of the Company. As of December 31, 2007, the Company controlled PNR Holdings LLC pursuant to a management agreement the Management Agreement whereby Pioneer Natural Resources USA, Inc. PNR USA, a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company, provided operating and administrative management of all of PNR Holdings LLCs properties. PNR
Holdings LLC financed the acquisitions with borrowings under a credit agreement Holdings Credit Agreement entered into

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

with PNR USA. Under the terms of the Holdings Credit Agreement and Management Agreement, PNR Holdings LLC was a VIE in which PNR USA received substantially all of the entitys residual returns and absorbed substantially all of the entitys losses. PNR USAs loans under the Holdings Credit Agreement were secured by the property interests acquired by PNR Holdings LLC. General creditors
of PNR Holdings LLC may have lacked recourse as a result of PNR USAs secured debtor standing. As of December 31, 2007, PNR Holdings LLCs proved oil and gas properties had a net carrying value of $2603 million and unproved oil and gas properties with a carrying value of $915 million that were included in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2007. Outstanding PNR Holdings LLC borrowings of $3518 million as of December 31, 2007 under the
Holdings Credit Agreement were eliminated in consolidation against the associated loans from PNR USA. During 2008, PNR Holdings LLC was acquired by the Company, became a wholly-owned subsidiary and was liquidated.
Goodwill. During 2004, the Company recorded $3278 million of goodwill associated with a business combination. The goodwill was recorded to the Companys United States reporting unit. In accordance with EITF Abstract Issue No. 00-23, Issues Related to the Accounting for Stock Compensation under APB Opinion No. 25 and FASB
Interpretation No. 44, the Company has reduced goodwill by $172 million since the date of the business combination, primarily for tax benefits associated with the exercise of fully-vested stock options assumed in conjunction with the business combination. In accordance with SFAS No. 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets SFAS 142, goodwill is not amortized to earnings, but is assessed for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate
that impairment of the carrying value of goodwill is likely, but no less often than annually. If the carrying value of goodwill is determined to be impaired, it is reduced for the impaired value with a corresponding charge to pretax earnings in the period in which it is determined to be impaired. During the third quarter of 2008, the Company performed its annual assessment of impairment of the goodwill and determined that there was no impairment. However, during the second half of
2008, commodity prices and the market capitalization of the Company declined significantly, which the Company considered events that might indicate impairment to the carrying value of goodwill. As a result, the Company reassessed goodwill for impairment as of December 31, 2008, and determined that there was no impairment. See Note S for additional information regarding the Companys impairment assessments.
Other property, plant and equipment, net. Other property, plant and equipment is recorded at cost and primarily consists of items such as heavy equipment and well servicing rigs, furniture and fixtures and leasehold improvements. Depreciation is provided over the estimated useful life of the assets using the straight-line method. At December 31,
2008 and 2007 other property, plant and equipment was net of accumulated depreciation of $1906 million and $1666 million, respectively.
Asset retirement obligations. The Company accounts for asset retirement obligations in accordance with SFAS No. 143, Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations SFAS 143. SFAS 143 requires that the fair value of a liability for an asset retirement obligation be recognized in the period in which it is incurred if a
reasonable estimate of fair value can be made. Under the provisions of SFAS 143, asset retirement obligations are generally capitalized as part of the carrying value of the long-lived asset. Conditional asset retirement obligations meet the definition of liabilities and are recognized when incurred if their fair values can be reasonably estimated.
Asset retirement obligation expenditures are classified as cash used in operating activities in the accompanying consolidated statements of cash flows.
Derivatives and hedging. The Company follows the provisions of SFAS No. 133, Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities SFAS 133. SFAS 133 requires the accounting recognition of all derivative instruments as either assets or liabilities at fair value. Derivative instruments that are not hedges must
be adjusted to fair value through net income. Under the provisions of SFAS 133, the Company may designate a derivative instrument as hedging the exposure to changes in the fair value of an asset or a liability or an identified portion thereof that is attributable to a particular risk a fair value hedge or as hedging the exposure to variability in expected future cash flows that are attributable to a particular risk a cash flow hedge. Both at the
inception of a hedge and on an ongoing basis, a fair value hedge must be expected to be highly effective in achieving offsetting changes in fair value attributable to the hedged risk during the periods that a hedge is designated. Similarly, a cash flow hedge must be expected to be highly effective in achieving offsetting cash flows attributable to the hedged risk during the term of the hedge. The expectation of hedge effectiveness must be supported by matching the essential terms of
the hedged asset, liability or forecasted transaction to the derivative hedge contract or by effectiveness

assessments using statistical measurements. The Companys policy is to assess hedge effectiveness at the end of each calendar quarter.
Under the provisions of SFAS 133, changes in the fair value of derivative instruments that are fair value hedges are offset against changes in the fair value of the hedged assets, liabilities, or firm commitments through net income. Effective changes in the fair value of derivative instruments that are cash flow hedges are recognized in accumulated other comprehensive income
loss - net deferred hedge gains losses, net of tax AOCI - Hedging in the stockholders equity section of the Companys consolidated balance sheets until such time as the hedged items are recognized in net income. Ineffective portions of a derivative instruments change in fair value are immediately recognized in earnings.
Through November 2008, the Company had elected to designate the majority of its commodity derivative instruments as cash flow hedges. During December 2008, the Company began entering into commodity derivative contracts that were not designated as hedges under SFAS 133. The changes in the fair value of these instruments are being recognized as gains or losses in the earnings of the
period in which they occur. Effective January 31, 2009, the Company discontinued hedge accounting on all existing hedge contracts. Net deferred hedge gains deferred in AOCI Hedging associated with these contracts as of January 31, 2009 will be reclassified to earnings during the same periods in which the hedged transactions are recognized in the Companys earnings.
In accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board FASB Interpretation No. 39, Offsetting of Amounts Related to Certain Contracts FIN 39, the Company classifies the fair value amounts of derivative assets and liabilities executed under master netting arrangements as net derivative assets or net derivative liabilities, whichever
the case may be.
See Note J for a description of the specific types of derivative transactions in which the Company participates.
Environmental. The Companys environmental expenditures are expensed or capitalized depending on their future economic benefit. Expenditures that relate to an existing condition caused by past operations and that have no future economic benefits are expensed. Expenditures that extend the life of the related property or mitigate or prevent
future environmental contamination are capitalized. Liabilities are recorded when environmental assessment and/or remediation is probable and the costs can be reasonably estimated. Such liabilities are undiscounted unless the timing of cash payments for the liability is fixed or reliably determinable.
Treasury stock. Treasury stock purchases are recorded at cost. Upon reissuance, the cost of treasury shares held is reduced by the average purchase price per share of the aggregate treasury shares held.
Revenue recognition. The Company does not recognize revenues until they are realized or realizable and earned. Revenues are considered realized or realizable and earned when: i persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, ii delivery has occurred or services have been rendered, iii the sellers price to the buyer is fixed or
determinable and iv collectibility is reasonably assured.
The Company uses the entitlements method of accounting for oil, NGL and gas revenues. Sales proceeds in excess of the Companys entitlement are included in other liabilities and the Companys share of sales taken by others is included in other assets in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets.

Stock-based compensation. On January 1, 2006, the Company adopted SFAS No. 123 revised 2004, Share-Based Payment SFAS 123R to account for stock-based compensation. For equity-based compensation awards granted or modified subsequent to January 1, 2006, compensation expense, based on the fair
value on the date of grant, is being recognized in the Companys financial statements over the vesting period. The Company utilizes a the Black-Scholes option pricing model to measure the fair value of stock options, b the stock price on the date of grant for the fair value of restricted stock awards and c the Monte Carlo simulation method for the fair value of performance unit awards.
Additionally, under the provisions of SFAS 123R, deferred compensation recorded under Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees APB 25 related to equity-based awards was required to be eliminated against the appropriate equity accounts. As a result, upon adoption of SFAS 123R, the
Company eliminated $458 million of deferred compensation cost in stockholders equity and reduced a like amount of additional paid-in capital in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets.
For the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006, the Company recorded $340 million, $353 million and 321 million of compensation costs for all stock-based plans, respectively, including compensation costs of $422 thousand, $606 thousand and $669 thousand, respectively, associated with the Companys Employee Stock Purchase Plan the
ESPP, which is a compensatory plan under the provisions of SFAS 123R. The impact to the Companys net income of the year ended December 31, 2006 of adopting SFAS 123R was $16 million, or less than $02 per diluted share, including the $669 thousand of ESPP compensation expense recorded in that year.
Pursuant to the provisions of SFAS 123R, the Companys issued shares, as reflected in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets and consolidated statements of stockholders equity at December 31, 2008 and 2007, do not include 1,078,267 shares and 1,960,475 shares, respectively, of unvested voting shares awarded under stock-based compensation
plans.
Foreign currency translation. The U.S. dollar is the functional currency for all of the Companys current international operations. Accordingly, monetary assets and liabilities denominated in a foreign currency are remeasured to U.S. dollars at the exchange rate in effect at the end of each reporting period; revenues and costs and expenses
denominated in a foreign currency are remeasured at the average of the exchange rates that were in effect during the period in which the revenues and costs and expenses were recognized. The resulting gains or losses from remeasuring foreign currency denominated balances into U.S. dollars are recorded in other income or other expense, respectively. Nonmonetary assets and liabilities denominated in a foreign currency are remeasured at the historic exchange rates that were in effect
when the assets or liabilities were acquired or incurred.
Prior to their sale, the functional currency of the Companys Canadian operations was the Canadian dollar. The financial statements of the Companys Canadian subsidiaries were translated to U.S. dollars as follows: all assets and liabilities were translated using the exchange rate in effect at the end of each reporting period; revenues and costs and expenses were
translated using the average of the exchange rates that were in effect during the period in which the revenues and costs and expenses were recognized. The resulting gains or losses from translating Canadian dollar denominated balances were recorded in the accompanying consolidated statements of stockholders equity for the period through accumulated other comprehensive income loss - cumulative translation adjustment AOCI-CTA.

New accounting pronouncements. The following discussions provide information about new accounting pronouncements that were issued by FASB during 2008, 2007and 2006       
SFAS 157. In September 2006, the Financial Accounting Standards Board FASB issued SFAS No. 157, Fair Value Measurements SFAS 157. SFAS 157 defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value and enhances disclosures about fair value measures required under other accounting
pronouncements, but does not change existing guidance as to whether or not an instrument is carried at fair value. During February 2008, the FASB issued FASB Staff Position No. 157-2, FSP FAS 157-2 FSP FAS 157-2. FSP FAS 157-2 delayed the effective date of SFAS 157 for nonfinancial assets and nonfinancial liabilities until fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2008, except for items that are recognized or disclosed at fair value in the financial
statements on a recurring basis, but no less often than annually. On January 1, 2008, the Company adopted the provisions of SFAS 157 for financial assets and liabilities. See Note E for additional information regarding the Companys adoption of SFAS 157. The adoption of the provisions of SFAS 157 that were delayed by FSP FAS 157-2 is not expected to have a material effect on the financial condition or results of operations of the Company.
SFAS 159. In February 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 159, The Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities SFAS 159. SFAS 159 permits entities to measure many financial instruments and certain other items at fair value that are not currently required to be measured at fair value. The Company
adopted the provisions of SFAS 159 on January 1, 2008 and its implementation did not have a material effect on the financial condition or results of operations of the Company.
SFAS 141R. In December 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 141R, Business Combinations SFAS 141R. SFAS 141R replaces SFAS 141 and provides greater consistency in the accounting and financial reporting of business combinations. SFAS 141R requires the acquiring entity in a business combination to recognize all
assets acquired and liabilities assumed in the transaction and any noncontrolling interest in the acquired entity at the acquisition date, measured at their fair values as of the date that the acquirer achieves control over the business acquired. This includes the measurement of the acquirer shares issued in consideration for a business combination, the recognition of contingent consideration, the recognition of pre-acquisition contractual and certain non-contractual gain and loss
contingencies, the recognition of capitalized research and development costs and the recognition of changes in the acquirers income tax valuation allowance and deferred taxes. The provisions of SFAS 141R also require that restructuring costs resulting from the business combination that the acquirer expects but is not required to incur and costs incurred to effect the acquisition be recognized separate from the business combination. SFAS 141R is effective for fiscal years
and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning on or after December 15, 2008, and is to be applied prospectively as of the beginning of the fiscal year in which the statement is applied. SFAS 141R became effective for the Company on January 1, 2009. The implementation of SFAS 141R did not materially impact the financial condition or results of operations of the Company on the date of adoption.
SFAS 160. In December 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 160 Noncontrolling Interest in Consolidated Financial Statements, an amendment of ARB Statement No51 SFAS 160. SFAS 160 amends Accounting Research Bulletin ARB No. 51, Consolidated Financial Statements, to establish accounting
and reporting standards for the noncontrolling interest in a subsidiary and for the deconsolidation of a subsidiary. SFAS 160
84
PIONEER NATURAL RESOURCES COMPANY
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006
clarifies that a noncontrolling interest in a subsidiary, which is sometimes referred to as minority interest, is an ownership interest in the consolidated entity that should be reported as a component of equity in the consolidated financial statements. Among other requirements, SFAS160 requires consolidated net income to be reported at amounts that include the amounts attributable to both the
parent and the noncontrolling interest. It also requires disclosure of the amounts of consolidated net income attributable to the parent and to the noncontrolling interest on the face of the consolidated income statement. SFAS160 became effective for the Company on January1, 2009. Although it will not impact the Companys financial condition or results of operations, it will change the manner in which minority interests in subsidiaries net assets and net
income loss is presented in the Companys consolidated balance sheets and statements of operations.
SFAS 161. In March 2008, the FASB issued SFAS No. 161, Disclosures about Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities an amendment of FASB Statement No. 133 SFAS 161. SFAS 161 changes the disclosure requirements for derivative instruments and hedging activities by requiring entities to provide enhanced
disclosures about i how and why an entity uses derivative instruments, ii how derivative instruments and related hedged items are accounted for under SFAS 133, Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities and its related interpretations, and iii how derivative instruments and related hedged items affect an entitys financial position, financial performance, and cash flows. SFAS 161 became effective for the Company on January 1, 2009 and will
only impact future disclosures about the Companys derivative instruments and hedging activities.
SFAS 162. In May 2008, the FASB issued SFAS No. 162 The Hierarchy of Generally Accepted Accounting Principles SFAS 162. SFAS 162 identifies the sources of accounting principles and the framework for selecting the principles to be used in the preparation of financial statements presented in conformity with GAAP. SFAS

FSP APB 14-1. In May 2008, the FASB issued FASB Staff Position No. APB 14-1, Accounting for Convertible Debt Instruments That May Be Settled in Cash upon Conversion Including Partial Cash Settlement FSP APB 14-1. FSP APB 14-1 specifies that issuers of such instruments should separately account for the liability
and equity components in a manner that will reflect the entitys nonconvertible debt borrowing rate when interest cost is recognized in subsequent periods. FSP APB 14-1 is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2008. The adoption of FSP APB 14-1 will increase the annual interest expense that the Company recognizes on its $480 million of outstanding 2875% convertible senior notes due January 15, 2038 the 2875% Senior
Convertible Notes from an annual yield of approximately 2875 percent to an annual yield equivalent to a nonconvertible debt borrowing 675 percent on the date of issuance. The adoption of FSP APB 14-1 on January 1, 2009 will also result in the reclassification of the estimated issuance date fair value of the 2875% Senior Convertible Notes conversion privilege from long-term debt to shareholders equity in the Companys consolidated balance sheet. See Note W
for information regarding the impact of adopting FSP APB 14-1.
EITF 03-6-1. In June 2008, the FASB issued FASB Staff Position No. EITF 03-6-1 Determining Whether Instruments Granted in Share-Based Payment Transactions Are Participating Securities FSP EITF 03-6-1, which addresses whether instruments granted in share-based payment transactions are participating securities prior
to vesting and, therefore, need to be included in the net income allocation in computing basic net income per share under the two class method prescribed under SFAS 128, Earnings per Share. FSP 03-6-1 is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2008 and, to the extent applicable, must be applied retrospectively by adjusting all prior-period net income per share data to conform to the provisions of the standard. The
adoption of FSP EITF 03-6-1 is not expected to have a material effect on the Companys net income per share calculations.
SEC reserve ruling. In December2008, the SEC released Final Rule, Modernization of Oil and Gas Reporting the Reserve Ruling. The Reserve Ruling revises oil and gas reporting disclosures. The Reserve Ruling also permits the use of new technologies to determine proved reserves if those technologies have been
demonstrated empirically to lead to reliable conclusions about reserves volumes. The Reserve Ruling will also allow companies to disclose their probable and possible reserves to investors. In addition, the new disclosure requirements require companies to: i report the independence and qualifications of its reserves preparer or auditor; ii file reports when a third party is relied upon to prepare reserves estimates or conduct a reserves audit; and iii

The Reserve Ruling becomes effective for annual reports on Forms 10-K for fiscal years ending on or after December31, 2009. The Company is currently assessing the impact that adoption of the provisions of the Reserve Ruling will have on its financial position, results of
operations and disclosures.

During 2007, the Company drilled the Hansen #1A L1 well, a lateral sidetrack from an existing wellbore, to appraise the resource potential of the unit. The initial unstimulated production test results were
encouraging. As a result, the Company began permitting and facilities planning during 2008 to further evaluate the units resource potential. During 2009, the Company plans to continue with permitting, progress engineering studies and develop plans for a second well to be drilled in 2010 to further delineate the extent of the units resource potential.
NOTE E.
Disclosures About Fair Value Measurements
Effective January 1, 2008, the Company adopted the provisions of SFAS 157 for financial assets and liabilities measured at fair value. SFAS 157 retains the exchange price notion in the definition of fair value but clarifies that the exchange price is the price in an orderly transaction between market participants to sell an asset or transfer a liability in the principal or most
advantageous market in which the reporting company would transact for the asset or liability.
The SFAS 157 valuation framework is based upon inputs that market participants use in pricing an asset or liability, which are classified into two categories: observable inputs and unobservable inputs. Observable inputs represent market data obtained from independent sources, whereas unobservable inputs reflect a companys own market assumptions, which are used if observable
inputs are not reasonably available without undue cost and effort. These two types of inputs are further prioritized into the following fair value input hierarchy       
87
PIONEER NATURAL RESOURCES COMPANY
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006
Level 1 quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities in active markets.
Level 2 quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets; quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not active; inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the asset or liability e.g. interest rates; and inputs derived principally from or corroborated by observable market
data by correlation or other means.
Level 3 unobservable inputs for the asset or liability.
The fair value input hierarchy level to which an asset or liability measurement in its entirety falls is determined based on the lowest level input that is significant to the measurement in its entirety.
The following table presents the Companys financial assets and liabilities that are measured at fair value on a recurring basis as of December 31, 2008, for each of the fair value hierarchy levels

Cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, other current assets, accounts payable, interest payable and other current liabilities. The carrying amounts approximate fair value due to the short maturity of these instruments.
Trading securities and deferred compensation plan assets. The Companys trading securities represent equity securities that are actively traded on major exchanges and, to a lesser extent, trading securities that are not actively traded on major exchanges. The Companys deferred compensation plan assets represent investments in equity
and mutual fund securities that are actively traded on major exchanges plus unallocated contributions as of the measurement date. As of December 31, 2008, all significant inputs to these asset exchange values represented Level 1 independent active exchange market price inputs except inputs for trading securities that are not actively traded on major exchanges, which were provided by broker quotes representing Level 2 inputs.
Interest rate derivatives. The Companys interest rate derivative assets represent swap contracts for $400 million notional amount of debt, whereby the Company pays a fixed rate of interest and the counterparty receives a variable LIBOR-based rate. In accordance with FIN 39, the Company classifies derivative assets and liabilities in
accordance with master netting agreements with the derivative counterparties. The Companys derivative assets and liabilities are comprised of assets and liabilities due from derivative counterparties that are net derivative creditors or net derivative debtors of the Company as of December 31, 2008. Net derivative asset transfer values are determined, in part, by utilization of the derivative counterparties credit-adjusted risk-free rate curves and net derivative
liabilities are determined, in part, by utilization of the Companys credit-adjusted risk-free rate curve. The credit-adjusted risk-free rates are based on an independent market-quoted credit default swap rate curve for the Companys or the counterparties debt plus the United States Treasury Bill yield curve as of December 31, 2008. The net derivative asset values attributable to the Companys interest rate derivative contracts as of December 31, 2008 are
based on i the contracted notional amounts, ii forward active market-quoted LIBOR rate yield curves and iii the applicable credit-adjusted risk-free rate yield curve. The Companys interest rate derivative asset measurements represent Level 2 inputs in the hierarchy priority.
Commodity price derivatives. The Companys commodity price derivatives represent oil, NGL and gas swap and collar contracts. The Companys commodity price measurements for oil and gas derivative contracts represent Level 2 inputs in the hierarchy priority while NGL derivative contracts represent Level 3 inputs in the hierarchy
priority.
Oil derivatives. The Companys oil derivatives are swap and collar contracts for notional Bbls of oil at fixed in the case of swaps contracts or interval in the case of collar contracts NYMEX West Texas Intermediate WTI oil prices. The asset and liability values attributable to the Companys oil derivatives as of
December 31, 2008 are based on i the contracted notional volumes, ii independent active NYMEX futures price quotes for WTI oil, iii the applicable estimated credit-adjusted risk-free rate yield curve and iv the implied rate of volatility inherent in the collar contracts. The implied rates of volatility inherent in the Companys collar contracts were determined based on implied volatility factors provided by the derivative counterparties, adjusted for estimated
volatility skews. The volatility factors are not considered significant to the fair values of the collar contracts since intrinsic and time values are the principal components of the collar values. As of December 31, 2007, the fair value of oil derivatives were estimated from quotes provided by the counterparties to these derivative contracts.
NGL derivatives. The Companys NGL derivatives are swap contracts for notional blended Bbls of Mont Belvieu-posted-price NGLs. The asset and liability values attributable to the Companys NGL derivatives as of December 31, 2008 are based on i the contracted notional volumes, ii independent broker-supplied forward Mont
Belvieu-posted-price quotes and iii the applicable credit-adjusted risk-free rate yield curve. As of December 31, 2007, the fair value of NGL derivatives were estimated from quotes provided by the counterparties to these derivative contracts.
Gas derivatives. The Companys gas derivatives are swap contracts for notional MMBtus of gas contracted at various posted price indexes, including NYMEX Henry Hub HH swap contracts coupled with basis swap contracts that convert the HH price index point to other price indexes. The asset and liability values attributable to the
Companys gas derivatives as of December 31, 2008 are based on i the contracted notional volumes, ii independent active NYMEX futures price quotes for HH gas, iii averages of forward posted price quotes supplied by independent brokers who are active in buying and selling gas derivatives at the indexes other than HH and iv

the applicable credit-adjusted risk-free rate yield curve. As of December 31, 2007, the fair value of gas derivatives were estimated from quotes provided by the counterparties to these derivative contracts.
The Company corroborated independent broker-supplied forward price quotes by comparing price quote samples to alternate observable market data.
Foreign exchange rate derivatives. As of December 31, 2007, the fair value of foreign exchange rate derivatives were estimated from quotes provided by the counterparties to these derivative contracts.
Notes receivable. The fair value of the notes receivable approximates the carrying value at December 31, 2008 based on the adequacy of collateral security and interest yields. The current portion of the notes receivable, amounting to $62 million and $36 million as of December 31, 2008 and 2007, respectively, is included in other current
assets, net and the noncurrent portions of the notes receivable are included in other assets, net in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets.
Canadian escrow deposit account. The Canadian escrow deposit account was a deposit account denominated in Canadian dollars. The carrying value of this account was measured in U.S. dollars based on the Canadian dollar to U.S. dollar exchange rate of 9984 as of December 31, 2007. Consequently, the carrying value of the account approximated its
fair value as of December 31, 2007, and was included in other current assets, net in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2007.
Credit Facility. The fair value of the Companys credit facility as of December 31, 2008 is based on i contractual interest and fees, ii forward active market-quoted LIBOR rate yield curves and iii the applicable credit-adjusted risk-free rate yield curve. The Companys credit facility measurements represent Level 2 inputs in
the hierarchy priority.
As of December 31, 2007, the carrying amount of borrowings outstanding under the Companys credit facility approximated fair value because those instruments bore interest at variable market rates. The fair values of each of the senior note issuances were determined based on quoted market prices for each of the issues. See Note F for additional information regarding the
Companys long-term debt.
Concentrations of credit risk. As of December 31, 2008, the Companys primary concentrations of credit risks are the risks of collecting accounts receivable trade and notes receivable and the risk of counterparties failure to perform under derivative obligations. See Note B for information regarding the Companys
accounts receivable trade and notes receivable, including collateralization of notes receivable.
The Company has entered into International Swap Dealers Association Master Agreements ISDA Agreements with each of its derivative counterparties. The terms of the ISDA Agreements provide the Company and the counterparties with rights of set off upon the occurrence of defined acts of default by either the Company or a counterparty to a derivative, whereby the party
not in default may set off all derivative liabilities owed to the defaulting party against all derivative assets receivable from the defaulting party. See Note J for additional information regarding the Companys derivative activities.

Credit facility. During April 2007, the Company amended its prior credit agreement with an Amended and Restated 5-Year Revolving Credit Agreement the Credit Facility that matures in April 2012 unless extended in accordance with the terms of the Credit Facility. The Credit Facility provides for initial aggregate loan commitments
of $15 billion, which may be increased to a maximum aggregate amount of $20 billion if the lenders increase their loan commitments or if loan commitments of new financial institutions are added. As of December 31, 2008, the Company had $913 million of outstanding borrowings under the Credit Facility and had $46 million of undrawn letters of credit under the Credit Facility, leaving the Company with $541 million of unused borrowing capacity under the Credit Facility.
Borrowings under the Credit Facility may be in the form of revolving loans or swing line loans. Aggregate outstanding swing line loans may not exceed $150 million. Revolving loans bear interest, at the option of the Company, based on a a rate per annum equal to the higher of the prime rate announced from time to time by JPMorgan Chase Bank or the weighted average of the rates on
overnight Federal funds transactions with members of the Federal Reserve System during the last preceding business day plus 5 percent or b a base Eurodollar rate, substantially equal to LIBOR, plus a margin the Applicable Margin currently 75 percent that is determined by a reference grid based on the Companys debt rating. Swing line loans bear interest at a rate per annum equal to the ASK rate for Federal funds periodically published by the
Dow Jones Market Service plus the Applicable Margin. Letters of credit outstanding under the Credit Facility are subject to a per annum fee, representing the Applicable Margin plus 125 percent. The Company pays commitment fees on the undrawn amounts under the Credit Facility that are determined by reference to a grid based on the Companys debt rating 075 percent per annum at December 31, 2008.
The Credit Facility contains certain financial covenants, which include the maintenance of a ratio of total debt to book capitalization less intangible assets, accumulated other comprehensive income and certain noncash asset impairments, not to exceed 60 to 10. The covenants also include the maintenance of a ratio of the net present value of the Companys oil and gas
properties to total debt of at least 175 to 10 until the Company achieves an investment grade rating by Moodys Investors Service, Inc. or Standard Poors Ratings Group, Inc. The variables on which the calculation of net present value is based including assumed commodity prices and discount rates are subject to adjustment by the lenders and, therefore, the amount that the Company may borrow under the Credit Facility in the future could be reduced as a result of lower
oil, NGL or gas prices, among other items. The lenders may declare any outstanding obligations under the Credit Facility immediately due and payable upon the occurrence, and during the continuance of, an event of default, which includes a defined change in control of the Company. As of December 31, 2008, the Company was in compliance with all of its debt covenants.

The Pioneer Southwest Credit Facility contains certain financial covenants, including i the maintenance of a quarter end maximum leverage ratio of not more than 35 to 100, ii an interest coverage ratio representing a ratio of earnings before depreciation, depletion and amortization; impairment of long-lived assets; exploration expense; accretion of discount on asset
retirement obligations; interest expense; income taxes; gain or loss on the disposition of assets; noncash commodity hedge related activity; and noncash equity-based compensation to interest expense of not less than 25 to 10 and iii the maintenance of a ratio of the net present value of Pioneer Southwests projected future cash flows from its oil and gas assets to total debt of at least 175 to 10.
Because of the net present value covenant contained in the agreement, borrowings under the Pioneer Southwest Credit Facility are currently limited to approximately $200 million. The variables on which the calculation of net present value is based including assumed commodity prices and discount rates are subject to adjustment by the lenders. As a result, further
declines in commodity prices could reduce Pioneer Southwest borrowing capacity under the Pioneer Southwest Credit Facility. In addition, the Pioneer Southwest Credit Facility contains various covenants that limit, among other things, Pioneer Southwest ability to grant liens, incur additional indebtedness, engage in a merger, enter into transactions with affiliates, pay distributions or repurchase equity and sell its assets. If any default or event of default as
defined in the Pioneer Southwest Credit Facility were to occur, the Pioneer Southwest Credit Facility would prohibit Pioneer Southwest from making distributions to unitholders. Such events of default include, among others, nonpayment of principal or interest, violations of covenants, bankruptcy and material judgments and liabilities.

Postretirement Benefit Obligations
At December 31, 2008 and 2007, the Company had recorded $96 million and $105 million, respectively, of unfunded accumulated postretirement benefit obligations, the current and noncurrent portions of which are included in other current liabilities and other liabilities and minority interests, respectively, in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. These obligations are
comprised of five plans of which four relate to predecessor entities that the Company acquired in prior years. These plans had no assets as of December 31, 2008 or 2007. Other than the Companys retirement plan, the participants of these plans are not current employees of the Company.
At December 31, 2008, the accumulated postretirement benefit obligations pertaining to these plans were determined by independent actuaries for four plans representing $57 million of unfunded accumulated postretirement benefit obligations and by the Company for one plan representing $39 million of unfunded accumulated postretirement benefit obligations. Interest costs at an
annual rate of 622 percent of the periodic undiscounted accumulated postretirement benefit obligations were employed in the valuations of the benefit obligations. Certain of the aforementioned plans provide for medical and dental cost subsidies for plan participants. Annual medical cost escalation trends of ten percent were forecasted for 2009, declining to five percent in 2014 and thereafter, and annual dental cost escalation trends of seven percent were forecasted for 2009,
declining to five percent in 2012 and thereafter, were employed to estimate the accumulated postretirement benefit obligations associated with the medical and dental cost subsidies, respectively.

Legal actions. The Company is party to the legal actions that are described below. The Company is also party to other proceedings and claims incidental to its business. While many of these matters involve inherent uncertainty, the Company believes that the amount of the liability, if any, ultimately incurred with respect to
such other proceedings and claims will not have a material adverse effect on the Companys consolidated financial position as a whole or on its liquidity, capital resources or future annual results of operations. The Company will continue to evaluate its litigation on a quarter-by-quarter basis and will establish and adjust any litigation reserves as appropriate to reflect its assessment of the then current status of litigation.
MOSH Holding. On April 11, 2005, the Company and its principal United States subsidiary, Pioneer Natural Resources USA, Inc., were named as defendants in MOSH Holding, L.P. v Pioneer Natural Resources Company; Pioneer Natural Resources USA, Inc.; Woodside Energy USA Inc.; and JPMorgan Chase Bank,
N.A., JP Morgan as Trustee of the Mesa Offshore Trust the Trust, which is before the Judicial District Court of Harris County, Texas 334th Judicial District. Subsequently, Dagger-Spine Hedgehog Corporation Dagger-Spine and a group of approximately fifty other unitholders Unitholder Group each filed a Petition in Intervention in the lawsuit to assert the same claims against the defendants. The
Unitholder Group subsequently voluntarily non-suited leaving only Dagger-Spine and MOSH Holding, L.P. as Plaintiffs/Interveners in this lawsuit collectively MOSH Holding L.P. and Dagger-Spine are referred to as Plaintiffs. Plaintiffs are unit holders in the Trust, which was created in 1982 as a partner in the general partnership that holds an overriding royalty interest in certain oil and gas leases offshore Louisiana and Texas the Partnership. The
Company owns the managing general partner interest in the Partnership. Plaintiffs allege that the Company, together with Woodside Energy USA Inc. Woodside, concealed the value of the royalty interest and worked to terminate the Mesa Offshore Trust MOT prematurely and to capture for itself and Woodside profits that belong to MOT. Plaintiffs also allege breaches of fiduciary duty, misapplication of trust property, common law fraud, gross negligence,
and breach of the conveyance agreement for the overriding royalty interest. Plaintiffs also allege that the Company did not act as a prudent operator regarding certain activities undertaken with respect to a producing well and that the Company should have undertaken to drill additional wells for the benefit of the Partnership. The relief sought by the Plaintiffs includes monetary and punitive damages and certain equitable relief, including an accounting of expenses, a setting aside
of the farmout between the Company and Woodside, and a temporary and permanent injunction.
In July 2007, the Company filed a motion for summary judgment challenging Plaintiffs standing to prosecute the case and seeking dismissal. The Company also filed a motion for summary judgment challenging the substantive merits of Plaintiffs claims and seeking dismissal.
In July 2008, the trial court denied the Companys two summary judgment motions. The Company subsequently filed an application for a writ of mandamus as well as request for a stay of the trial proceedings with the court of appeals seeking a reversal of the trial courts refusal to dismiss the lawsuit based upon Plaintiffs lack of standing. That
application and stay motion were denied by the court of appeals and subsequently by the Texas Supreme Court. Trial on the merits of the lawsuit is scheduled for April 13, 2009.
On October 10, 2008, the Company unconditionally offered without compensation its complete interest, including its working interest, in the Brazos Block A-39 tract to Plaintiffs and to the Trustee on behalf of all the unit holders. Plaintiffs rejected the Companys tender, while the Trustee, by letter dated January 13, 2009, has instructed the Company
to sell by public auction the Companys complete interest in the Brazos Block A-39 tract together with the all of the Partnerships interests in the Brazos Block A-39 and the other active Trust property, West Delta Block 61. The Company has engaged The Oil and Gas Clearinghouse to carry out the sale via a public auction that is scheduled to take place on March 18, 2009.
The Company believes the claims made by the Plaintiffs in the MOSH Holding lawsuit are without merit and intends to defend the lawsuit vigorously. The Company cannot predict whether the outcome of this proceeding will be adverse to the Company and if so, whether such an outcome will materially impact the Companys liquidity, financial position or future
results of operations.
Colorado Notice of Violation. On May 13, 2008, the Company was served with a Notice of Violation/Cease and Desist Order by the State of Colorado Department of Public Health and Environmental Water Quality Control Division. The Notice alleges violations of stormwater discharge permits in the Companys Raton Basin and Lay Creek

defenses to the allegations. The Company does not believe that the outcome of this proceeding will materially impact the Companys liquidity, financial position or future results of operations.
SemGroup accounts receivable. The Company is a creditor in the bankruptcy of SemGroup, L.P. and certain of its subsidiaries collectively, SemGroup, which filed petitions for reorganization under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code on July 22, 2008 in the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the District of Delaware.
SemGroup purchased condensate from the Company and, at the time of the bankruptcy filings, was indebted to the Company for approximately $296 million. Subsequent to the bankruptcy filings, SemGroup, by contractual right, continued to purchase condensate from the Company until the end of July 2008, at which time the Company suspended condensate sales to SemGroup. During August 2008, SemGroup paid the Company approximately $53 million, representing amounts due for post-petition
purchases. As of December 31, 2008, the Company had approximately $296 million of delinquent receivables from SemGroup, representing pre-petition claims.
The Company believes that it is probable that the collection of the pre-petition claims will not occur for a protracted period of time and that some of its claims may be uncollectible. Consequently, the Company recorded a bad debt expense of approximately $196 million during the third quarter 2008, which reduced the carrying value of the claims to
approximately $100 million.
SemGroups reorganization effort is still in its early stages and determination of the exact amount of uncollectible claims is not presently determinable. It is reasonably possible that the Company will not collect the claims or that collected amounts will be less than $100 million. If those circumstances occur, the Company would recognize additional
bad debt expense to further reduce the carrying value of its claims. The Company believes that any losses relating to its failure to collect its SemGroup claims would not have a material adverse effect on the Companys consolidated financial position as a whole or on its liquidity, capital resources or future results of operations.
The condensate supplied to SemGroup was produced from Pioneers West Panhandle gas field and processed at Pioneers Fain plant in the Texas Panhandle. During August 2008, the Company began selling its condensate to alternate purchasers. The Company has not experienced any disruption in its West Panhandle operations and sales as a result of these
actions.
Obligations following divestitures. In April 2006, the Company provided the purchaser of its Argentine assets certain indemnifications. The Company remains responsible for certain contingent liabilities related to such indemnifications, subject to defined limitations. The Company does not believe that these obligations, which primarily pertain
to matters of litigation, environmental contingencies, royalty obligations and income taxes, are probable of having a material impact on its liquidity, financial position or future results of operations.
The Company has also retained certain liabilities and indemnified buyers for certain matters in connection with other divestitures, including the sale in 2007 of its Canadian assets.
Drilling commitments. The Company periodically enters into contractual arrangements under which the Company is committed to expend funds to drill wells in the future. The Company also enters into agreements to secure drilling rig services, which require the Company to make future minimum payments to the rig operators. The Company records
drilling commitments in the periods in which well capital is expended or rig services are provided.

The Raton Basin transportation commitments averaged approximately 226 million cubic feet MMcf of
gross gas volumes per day during 2008, including fuel commitments, and will average approximately 219 MMcf per day of gross gas volume during 2009, decreasing to approximately 204 MMcf per day per day during 2010, 182 MMcf per day during 2011, 122 MMcf per day during 2012, 102 MMcf per day during 2013 and 35 MMcf per day during 2014, the year of termination. Certain of these commitments were extended during the first quarter 2009.
The Uinta Basin transportation commitments commenced during June 2007 and averaged approximately 8 MMcf of gross gas volumes per day during 2008, including fuel commitments, and will average approximately 13 MMcf per day during 2009, and 15 MMcf per day thereafter. The Uinta Basin transportation commitments terminate during 2012, but may be extended for a period of up to three

NOTE J.
Derivative Financial Instruments
The Company uses financial derivative contracts to manage exposures to commodity price, interest rate and foreign currency fluctuations. The Company generally does not enter into derivative financial instruments for speculative or trading purposes. The Company also may enter physical delivery contracts to effectively provide commodity price protection. Because these contracts are
not expected to be net cash settled, they are considered to be normal sales contracts and not derivatives. Therefore, physical delivery contracts are not accounted for as derivative financial instruments in the financial statements.
All derivatives are recorded on the balance sheet at estimated fair value. Fair value is determined in accordance with SFAS 157 and is generally determined based on the credit-adjusted present value difference between the fixed contract price and the underlying market price at the determination date. Changes in the fair value of effective cash flow hedges are recorded as a
component of AOCI - Hedging, which is later transferred to earnings when the hedged transaction is recognized in earnings. Changes in the fair value of derivatives that are not designated as hedges, as well as the ineffective portion of changes in the fair value of hedge derivatives, are recorded in the earnings of the period of change. The ineffective portion is calculated as the difference between the change in fair value of the derivative and the estimated change in cash flows
from the item hedged.

Effective January 31, 2009, the Company discontinued hedge accounting on all existing hedge contracts. Net gains and losses deferred in AOCI Hedging associated with these contracts as of January 31, 2009 will be reclassified to earnings over the periods the original contracts impact earnings.
Fair value hedges. The Company monitors the debt capital markets and interest rate trends to identify opportunities to enter into and terminate interest rate derivative contracts, with the objective of reducing the Companys costs of capital. As of December 31, 2008 and December 31, 2007, the Company was not a party to any fair value
hedges.
Cash flow hedges. The Company utilizes commodity swap and collar contracts to i reduce the effect of price volatility on the commodities the Company produces and sells, ii support the Companys annual capital budgeting and expenditure plans and iii reduce commodity price risk associated with certain capital projects. As of December
31, 2008, all of the Companys open commodity hedges were designated as hedges of United States forecasted sales. The Company also, from time to time, utilizes interest rate contracts to reduce the effect of interest rate volatility on the Companys indebtedness and forward currency exchange agreements to reduce the effect of exchange rate volatility.
Non-hedge commodity derivatives. The Company utilizes non-hedge derivative contracts to mitigate price risk associated with certain of its production.
Oil prices. All material physical sales contracts governing the Companys oil production have been tied directly or indirectly to the New York Mercantile Exchange NYMEX prices.

Excludes hedge gains losses of $281 million and $12 million attributable to discontinued operations for the year ended December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively.
Interest rate. During January 2008, the Company entered into interest rate swap contracts and designated the contracts as cash flow hedges of the forecasted interest rate risk associated with a portion of the Companys Credit Facility indebtedness. The interest rate swap contracts are variable-for-fixed-rate swaps on $400 million notional amount
of debt at a weighted average fixed annual rate of 287 percent, excluding any applicable margins. The interest rate swaps had an effective start date of February 2008, with $200 million terminating during February 2010 and $200 million during February 2011. The Company did not record any ineffectiveness in connection with the interest rate swap contracts.
Hedge ineffectiveness. The Company recognized ineffectiveness amounts related to i hedged volumes that exceeded revised forecasts of production volumes due to delays in the start up of production in certain fields and ii reduced correlations between the indexes of the financial hedge
derivatives and the indexes of the hedged forecasted production for certain fields. Ineffectiveness can be associated with closed contracts i.e. realized or can be associated with open positions i.e. unrealized. During the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006, the Company recognized net hedge ineffectiveness income loss from continuing operations of $500 thousand, $21 million and $18 million, respectively.
AOCI - Hedging. As of December 31, 2008 and 2007, AOCI - Hedging represented net deferred gains losses of $1335 and $2283 million, respectively. The AOCI - Hedging balance as of December 31, 2008 was comprised of $1135 million of net deferred hedge gains on the effective portions of open cash flow hedges, $1004 million of net deferred
gains on terminated cash flow hedges including $25 million of net deferred losses on terminated cash flow interest rate hedges and $804 million of associated net deferred tax provisions. The AOCI - Hedging balance as of December 31, 2007 was comprised of $2464 million of net deferred losses on the effective portions of open cash flow hedges, $1147 million of net deferred losses on terminated cash flow hedges including $31 million of net deferred losses on terminated cash
flow interest rate hedges and $1328 million of associated net deferred tax benefits. The increase in AOCI Hedging gains during the year ended December 31, 2008 was primarily attributable to the decrease in future commodity prices relative to the commodity prices stipulated in the hedge contracts and the reclassification of net deferred hedge losses to net income as derivatives matured by their terms. The increase in AOCI - Hedging losses during the year ended December 31,
2007 was primarily attributable to increases in future commodity prices relative to the commodity prices stipulated in the hedge contracts, partially offset by the reclassification of net deferred hedge losses to net income as derivatives matured by their terms. The net deferred gains associated with open cash flow hedges remain subject to market price fluctuations until the positions are either settled under the terms of the hedge contracts or terminated prior to settlement. The
net deferred gains on terminated cash flow hedges are fixed.
During the year ending December 31, 2009, based on current estimates of future commodity prices, the Company expects to reclassify approximately $656 million of net deferred gains associated with open commodity hedges and $599 million of net deferred gains on terminated commodity hedges from AOCI - Hedging to oil and

gas revenues. The Company also expects to reclassify approximately $223 million of net deferred income tax provisions associated with commodity hedges during the year ending December 31, 2009 from AOCI - Hedging to income tax expense.
Terminated commodity hedges. At times, the Company terminates open commodity hedge positions when the underlying commodity prices reach a point that the Company believes will be the high or low price of the commodity prior to the scheduled settlement of the open commodity position. This allows the Company to maximize gains or minimize losses
associated with the open hedge positions. At the time of termination of the hedges, the amounts recorded in AOCI - Hedging are maintained and amortized to earnings over the periods the production was scheduled to occur.
The following table sets forth, as of December 31, 2008, the scheduled amortization of net deferred gains and losses on terminated commodity hedges that will be recognized as increases and decreases to the Companys future oil and gas revenues

Non-hedge derivatives. During December 2008, the Company entered into commodity derivative contracts that were not designated as hedges under SFAS 133. The Company recognized a loss of $106 million associated with the change in value of these non-hedge derivative instruments, which amount is included in other expense in the accompanying
consolidated statement of operations for 2008.
During December 2007, the Company entered into foreign exchange rate swaps of Canadian dollars CND for U.S. dollars USD. The foreign exchange rate swaps were economic hedges of a CND-denominated escrow account balance that was funded during November 2007 associated with the sale of Canadian assets see Note V for additional information regarding the
sale of the Companys Canadian assets; however, uncertainty regarding the matching of cash flow timing between the foreign exchange rate swaps and the liquidation of the CND-denominated escrow account caused the Company not to designate the foreign exchange rate swaps as hedges. The foreign exchange rate swaps matured during May 2008 and were for a notional amount of approximately $1310 million USD. The Company recognized a mark-to-market loss of $15 million associated with
these derivatives during 2007 and realized a 2008 cash gain of $18 million during 2008, which amounts are included in discontinued operations in the accompanying consolidated statement of operations.
NOTE K.
Major Customers and Derivative Counterparties
Sales to major customers. The Companys share of oil and gas production is sold to various purchasers who must be prequalified under the Companys credit risk policies and procedures. The Company records allowances for doubtful accounts based on the agings of accounts receivables and the financial condition of its purchasers and,
depending on facts and circumstances, may require purchasers to provide collateral or otherwise secure their accounts. The Company is of the opinion that the loss of any one purchaser would not have an adverse effect on the ability of the Company to sell its oil and gas production.

The change in the 2008 estimate is primarily due to lower year-end prices for oil, NGL and gas being used to calculate proved reserves at December 31, 2008, which had the effect of shortening the economic life of many wells; thus increasing the present value of future retirement obligations. For the years ended December 31,2007 and 2006, the
increases include$660 million and $750 million, respectively, in reclamation and abandonment estimate revisions for the East Cameron facilities that were destroyed by Hurricane Rita and is reflected in hurricane activity, net in the consolidated statements of operations.
The Company records the current and noncurrent portions of asset retirement obligations in other current liabilities and other liabilities and minority interests, respectively, in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. The current portion of the Companys asset retirement obligations totaled $299 million and $869 million as of December 31, 2008 and 2007,

Income Taxes
The Company accounts for income taxes in accordance with the provisions of SFAS No. 109, Accounting for Income Taxes SFAS 109. The Company and its eligible subsidiaries file a consolidated United States federal income tax return. Certain subsidiaries are not eligible to be included in the consolidated United States federal income tax return and
separate provisions for income taxes have been determined for these entities or groups of entities. The tax returns and the amount of taxable income or loss are subject to examination by United States federal, state, local and foreign taxing authorities. Current and estimated tax payments net of refunds of $703 million, $295 million and $1531 million were made during the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively.
SFAS 109 requires that the Company continually assess both positive and negative evidence to determine whether it is more likely than not that deferred tax assets can be realized prior to their expiration. Pioneer monitors Company-specific, oil and gas industry and worldwide economic factors and assesses the likelihood that the Companys net operating loss carryforwards

local and foreign tax jurisdictions will be utilized prior to their expiration. As of December 31, 2008 and 2007, the Companys valuation allowances relating primarily to foreign tax jurisdictions were $375 million and $248 million, respectively.
The Company adopted the provisions of FASB Interpretation No. 48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes FIN 48 on January 1, 2007. In conjunction with the implementation of FIN 48, the Company analyzed its filing positions for open tax years in all of the United States federal, state and foreign jurisdictions where it has material tax attributes
and is required to file income tax returns. Upon adoption, the Company believed that its income tax filing positions and deductions would be substantially sustained on audit and did not anticipate any significant adjustments. Consequently, the Companys adoption of FIN 48 did not have a material impact on the Company. As of December 31, 2008, the Company did not have a liability for unrecognized tax benefits that, if recognized, would affect the Companys effective tax
rate and no significant unrecognized tax benefits are anticipated in 2009.
In connection with the adoption of FIN 48, the Company established a policy to account for interest charges with respect to income taxes as interest expense and any penalties, with respect to income taxes, as other expense in the consolidated statement of operations.
The Company files income tax returns in the U.S. federal jurisdiction, and various state and foreign jurisdictions. With few exceptions, the Company believes that it is no longer subject to examinations by tax authorities for years before 2003. In January 2009, the Internal Revenue Service IRS began a limited examination of the Companys 2006 U.S. federal
income tax return. In addition, the Companys 2004 and 2005 state income tax returns in Colorado are currently under audit. As of December 31, 2008, there are no proposed adjustments or uncertain positions in any jurisdiction that would have a significant affect on the Companys future results of operations or financial position. The Companys earliest open years in its key jurisdictions are as follows

Pursuant to Accounting Principles Board APB Opinion No. 23 Accounting for Income Taxes Special Areas, the Company historically treated the undistributed earnings in South Africa as permanently reinvested and did not provide for a U.S. tax on such earnings. During the second quarter of 2007, the Company made the determination that it no longer
had identifiable plans to reinvest these earnings in South Africa and accordingly began recording deferred tax expense. For the years ended December 31, 2008 and 2007, the Company recorded $158 million and $189 million, respectively, of U.S. income taxes for the results of operations of its South African subsidiaries.

NOTE Q.
Income Per Share From Continuing Operations
Basic income per share from continuing operations is computed by dividing income from continuing operations by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding for the period. The computation of diluted income per share from continuing operations reflects the potential dilution that could occur if securities or other contracts to issue common stock that are dilutive to
income from continuing operations were exercised or converted into common stock or resulted in the issuance of common stock that would then share in the earnings of the Company.

Impairment of Assets
The Company reviews its assets for impairment, including intangible assets, oil and gas properties and other long-lived assets, whenever events or circumstances indicate that their carrying values may not be recoverable. During the years ended December 31, 2008 and 2007, the Company recognized aggregate charges for the impairment of oil and gas properties of $1043 million and
$262 million, respectively.

PIONEER NATURAL RESOURCES COMPANY
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006
United States impairment. During the second half of 2008, declines in commodity prices led to the impairment of $171 million of net assets in the Companys Mississippi area and $1300 million of net assets in the Companys Uinta/Piceance area. In addition, the decline in commodity prices also provided an indication that the United
States reporting units $3106 million of goodwill may have been impaired as of December 31, 2008.
Goodwill assessments. In accordance with SFAS 142, the Company assesses its goodwill for impairment annually on July 1, and on July 1, 2008, the Companys assessment of goodwill indicated that it was not impaired. As a result of declines in commodity prices and a significant decline in the Companys market capitalization during the second
half of 2008, the Company reassessed whether the fair value of its net assets supported the carrying value of the Companys goodwill at its United States reporting unit. The Companys reassessment indicated that its goodwill was not impaired as of December 31, 2008.
The Companys assessments of goodwill for impairment include estimates of the fair value of its United States reporting unit and comparisons of those fair value estimates with the United States reporting units carrying value. The Companys estimates of the fair value of its United States reporting unit entailed estimating the fair values of the reporting
units assets and liabilities. The primary component of those assets and liabilities is comprised of the reporting units oil and gas properties, whose estimated values were based on the estimated discounted future net cash flows expected to be recovered from the properties. The Companys primary assumptions in preparing the estimated discounted future net cash flows expected to be recovered from the properties are based on i proved reserves and risk-adjusted
probable reserves, ii managements price outlook, including assumptions as to inflation of costs and expenses, iii the Companys weighted average cost of capital and iv future income tax expense attributable to the net cash flows.
Due to the significant decline in the Companys market capitalization at the end of 2008, the Company expanded its assessment of goodwill impairment to consider the fair value of the United States reporting unit as determined using both the previously described discounted future net cash flow approach and a market approach. The Company assessed market capitalization over the
30-day and 60-day periods prior to December 31, 2008 and performed sensitivity valuations of the United States reporting units net assets based on varying valuation combinations of future discounted cash flow assumptions including assessing future cash flows from proved properties only, market capitalization, control premiums, price inflation assumptions and discount rate assumptions. Those assessments indicated that the United States goodwill was not impaired as of
December 31, 2008. However, the continuation of commodity price declines during the first quarter of 2009 provides an indication that goodwill may be at risk of future impairment. The Company will continue to assess its goodwill for impairment and such assessments may be affected by i additional United States reserve adjustments, both positive and negative, ii results of drilling activities, iii changes in managements outlook on commodity prices and costs and expenses,
iv changes in the Companys market capitalization, v changes in the Companys weighted average cost of capital and vi changes in income taxes.
Oil and gas properties assessments. During the second half of 2008, the downward adjustments to proved reserves associated with declines in commodity prices and well performance led to the impairment of $171 million of net assets in the Companys Mississippi area and $1300 million of net assets in the Companys Uinta/Piceance area. The
Companys estimates of the undiscounted future cash flows attributed to the assets indicated that their carrying amounts were not expected to be recovered. Consequently, the Company recorded a $145 million noncash charge during the fourth quarter of 2008 to reduce the carrying value of the Mississippi area oil and gas properties and an $898 million noncash charge during the third quarter of 2008 to reduce the carrying value of the Uinta/Piceance area oil and gas properties.
The impairment charges reduced the oil and gas properties carrying values to their estimated fair values, represented by the estimated discounted future cash flows attributable to the assets.
The Companys primary assumptions of the estimated future cash flows attributable to oil and gas properties are based on i proved reserves and risk-adjusted probable and possible reserves and ii managements commodity price outlook. It is reasonably possible that the Companys estimate of undiscounted future cash flows attributable to oil and gas properties,
including the Uinta/Piceance area that has a December 31, 2008 carrying value of approximately $450 million, may change in the future resulting in the need for additional charges to reduce the carrying amount of the Companys oil and gas properties. The primary factors that may affect future cash flows are i additional reserve adjustments, both positive and negative, ii results of future drilling activities, iii changes in
119
PIONEER NATURAL RESOURCES COMPANY
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006
managements outlook on commodity prices and iv increases or decreases in production and capital costs associated with these assets.
During the second quarter of 2007, the Company recorded a $57 million noncash impairment provision to reduce the carrying values of certain proved oil and gas properties located in Louisiana. The impairment provision was determined in accordance with SFAS 144, and reduced the carrying values of the assets to their estimated fair value.
Nigerian impairment. In 2007, the Company withdrew from the production sharing contract relating to Block 320 and related agreements. As a part of this process, the Company disposed of its shares in a Nigeria subsidiary to an unaffiliated third party. In connection with the Companys withdrawal from Block 320 and the disposition of its
shares in the Nigerian subsidiary, the Company recorded a $102 million noncash impairment charge during 2007.
Equatorial Guinea impairment. During the fourth quarter of 2007, the Company recorded a noncash charge of $103 million to write off the Companys remaining basis in Block H in Equatorial Guinea. The charge was recorded in connection with an arbitration that was active among the parties participating in the Block H prospect.
South African assets. During the fourth quarter of 2008, the decline in commodity prices indicated that approximately $2372 million of net assets in the Companys South African South Coast Gas project may have been partially impaired. The Companys estimate, as of December 31, 2008, of undiscounted future cash flows attributed to
the South Coast Gas project assets indicated that their carrying amounts are expected to be recovered.
The Companys primary assumptions of the estimated future cash flows attributable to the South Coast Gas project are based on i proved reserves and risk-adjusted probable reserves and ii managements commodity price outlook. Probable reserves attributable to the South Coast Gas project represent reserve recoveries during a period over which the gas-to-liquids
GTL production facility, through which the projects production is transported to consuming markets, may become uneconomic without additional throughput from third-party projects that are presently considered likely of extending its economic life and allowing probable reserve recoveries. It is reasonably possible that the Companys estimate of undiscounted future cash flows attributable to South Coast Gas projects assets may change in the future
resulting in an impairment charge to reduce the assets carrying amount. The primary factors that may affect future cash flows are i additional reserve adjustments, both positive and negative, ii results of third-party projects, iii changes in managements outlook on commodity prices, iv increases or decreases in production and capital costs associated with these assets and projects and v future gas consumption and sales agreements in South Africa.
NOTE T.
Volumetric Production Payments
During 2005, the Company sold 278 MMBOE of proved reserves by means of three VPP agreements for net proceeds of $8926 million, including the assignment of the Companys obligations under certain derivative hedge agreements. Proceeds from the VPPs were initially used to reduce outstanding indebtedness. The first VPP sold 58 Bcf of gas volumes over an
expected five-year term that began in February 2005. The second VPP sold 108 million barrels MMBbls of oil volumes over an expected seven-year term that began in January 2006. The third VPP sold 60 Bcf of gas volumes over an expected 32-month term that began in May 2005 and 62 MMBbls of oil volumes over an expected five-year term that began in January 2006.
The Companys VPPs represent limited-term overriding royalty interests in oil and gas reserves that: i entitle the purchaser to receive production volumes over a period of time from specific lease interests; ii are free and clear of all associated future production costs and capital expenditures; iii are nonrecourse to the Company i.e., the
purchasers only recourse is to the reserves acquired; iv transfer title to the purchaser; and v allow the Company to retain the remaining reserves after the VPPs volumetric quantities have been delivered.
Under SFAS No. 19, Financial Accounting and Reporting by Oil and Gas Producing Companies, a VPP is considered a sale of proved reserves. As a result, the Company i removed the proved reserves associated with the VPPs; ii recognized the VPP proceeds as deferred revenue which are being amortized on a unit-of-production basis to oil and gas
revenues over the terms of the VPPs; iii retained responsibility for 100 percent of the production costs and capital costs related to VPP interests; and iv no longer recognizes production associated with the VPP volumes.

Insurance Claims
Hurricanes Katrina and Rita. During August and September 2005, the Company sustained damages as a result of Hurricanes Katrina and Rita at various facilities in the Gulf of Mexico. Other than the East Cameron facility discussed further below, the damages to the facilities were covered by physical damage insurance.
The Company filed a business interruption claim with its insurance provider related to its Devils Tower field resulting from its inability to sell production as a result of damages to third-party facilities. During 2006, the Company settled its business interruption claim with its insurance provider for $185 million, which is included in income from
discontinued operations in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations.
As a result of Hurricane Rita in September 2005, the Companys East Cameron facility, located in the Gulf of Mexico shelf, was destroyed. The Company currently estimates that it will expend approximately $22 million of additional capital to complete the reclamation and abandonment of the East Cameron facility. The operations to reclaim and abandon the East Cameron facilities
began in January 2007. The original estimate to reclaim and abandon the East Cameron facility was based upon an analysis prepared by a third party engineering firm and an estimate by the Company for portions of the remaining work that was not covered by the third-party analysis. During 2008, 2007 and 2006, the Company recorded obligation charges for changes in estimates to reclaim and abandon the East Cameron facility of $90 million, $660 million and $750 million, respectively,
which amounts are included in hurricane activity, net in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations.
The $22 million estimate of expenditures necessary to complete the reclamation and abandonment of the East Cameron facilities contains a number of assumptions that could cause the ultimate cost to be higher or lower as there are many uncertainties when working offshore and underwater with damaged equipment. The Company currently believes the project will be completed during 2010
and the remaining expenditures could range from $22 million to $37 million. Currently, no better estimate within the range can be determined. Thus the Company has recorded the estimated provision of $22 million as of December 31, 2008. Since January 2007, the Company has expended approximately $1631 million to reclaim and abandon the East Cameron facility.
121
PIONEER NATURAL RESOURCES COMPANY
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006
The Company filed a claim with its insurance providers regarding the loss at East Cameron. Under the Companys insurance policies, the East Cameron facility had the following coverages: i $14 million of scheduled property value for the platform, ii $4 million of scheduled business interruption insurance after a deductible waiting period,
iii $100 million of well restoration and safety, in total, for all assets per occurrence and iv $400 million for debris removal coverage for all assets per occurrence.
In December 2005, the Company received the $14 million of scheduled property value for the East Cameron assets and recognized a gain of $97 million associated therewith. The Company received the $4 million of business interruption recoveries in 2006, which is reflected in interest and other income in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations. During the fourth
quarter of 2006, the Company recorded estimated insurance recoveries of $43 million, which is reflected in hurricane activity, net in the accompanying consolidated statement of operations for the year ended December 31, 2006. The estimated insurance recoveries are included in other assets in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets in the amounts of $35 million and $43 million as of December 31, 2008 and 2007, respectively, and are related to the estimated costs for the debris
removal portion of the claim filed with the insurance providers. The Company believes that it is probable that it will be successful in asserting coverage under the debris removal part of its insurance coverage. During 2007, the Company received $5 million from one of its insurance providers related to debris removal, which is reflected in hurricane activity, net in the consolidated statement of operations for the year ended December 31, 2008. At present, no recoveries have been
reflected related to certain costs associated with plugging and abandonment and the well restoration and safety coverages, as the Company is working to resolve coverage issues regarding coverage under this section of the insurance policies. In the third quarter of 2007, the Company commenced legal actions against its insurance carriers regarding policy coverage issues, primarily related to debris removal, certain costs associated with plugging and abandonment, and the well
restoration and safety coverages. The Company continues to expect that a substantial portion of the East Cameron facility loss will be recoverable from insurance.

Subsequent Events - Unaudited
FSP APB 14-1. Effective January 1, 2009, the Company adopted the provisions of FSP APB 14-1. In accordance therewith, the Company applied the provisions of FSP APB 14-1 on a retrospective basis. The initial adoption of FSP APB 14-1 is expected to decrease the carrying value of the Companys 2875% Senior Convertible Notes by approximately
$81 million, increase shareholders equity by approximately $51 million and increase deferred tax liabilities by approximately $30 million. The retrospective application of the provisions of FSP APB 14-1 includes an increase in the Companys annual interest expense of approximately $14 million over amounts recognized prior to the adoption of FSP APB 14-1.
Derivative activities. Effective February 1, 2009, the Company discontinued hedge accounting on all existing commodity derivative instruments, and from that date forward will account for derivative instruments using the mark-to-market accounting method. Therefore, the Company will recognize all future changes in the fair values of its derivative
contracts as gains and losses in the earnings of the period in which they occur.

UNAUDITED SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION
December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006
Results of Operations
Information about the Companys results of operations for oil and gas producing activities by geographic operating segment is presented in Note R of the accompanying Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.
Reserve Quantity Information
The estimates of the Companys proved reserves as of December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006, which were located in the United States, Canada, South Africa and Tunisia, were based on evaluations prepared by the Companys engineers and audited by independent petroleum engineers with respect to the Companys major properties and prepared by the Companys engineers
with respect to all other properties. Reserves were estimated in accordance with guidelines established by the United States Securities and Exchange Commission and the FASB, which require that reserve estimates be prepared under existing economic and operating conditions with no provision for price and cost escalations except by contractual arrangements. The Company reports all reserves held under production sharing arrangements and concessions utilizing the economic
interest method, which excludes the host countrys share of proved reserves. Estimated quantities for production sharing arrangements reported under the economic interest method are subject to fluctuations in the commodity prices of and recoverable operating expenses and capital costs. If costs remain stable, reserve quantities attributable to recovery of costs will change inversely to changes in commodity prices. The reserve estimates as of December 31,
2008, 2007 and 2006 utilized respective oil prices of $4300, $9545 and $6054 per Bbl reflecting adjustments for oil quality, respective NGL prices of $2007, $5613 and $2982 per Bbl, and respective gas prices of $463, $612 and $513 per Mcf reflecting adjustments for Btu content, gas processing and shrinkage.
Proved reserve quantity estimates are subject to numerous uncertainties inherent in the estimation of quantities of proved reserves and in the projection of future rates of production and the timing of development expenditures. The accuracy of such estimates is a function of the quality of available data and of engineering and geological interpretation and judgment. Results of
subsequent drilling, testing and production may cause either upward or downward revision of previous estimates. Further, the volumes considered to be commercially recoverable fluctuate with changes in prices and operating costs. The Company emphasizes that proved reserve estimates are inherently imprecise and that estimates of new discoveries are more imprecise than those of currently producing oil and gas properties. Accordingly, these estimates are expected to change as additional
information becomes available in the future.
The following table provides a rollforward of total proved reserves by geographic area and in total for the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006, as well as proved developed reserves by geographic area and in total as of the beginning and end of each respective year. Oil and NGL volumes are expressed in MBbls, gas volumes are expressed in MMcf and total volumes are
expressed in thousands of barrels of oil equivalent MBOE.

Standardized Measure of Discounted Future Net Cash Flows
The standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows is computed by applying year-end commodity prices with consideration of price changes only to the extent provided by contractual arrangements to the estimated future production of proved reserves less estimated future expenditures based on year-end costs to be incurred in developing and producing the proved reserves,
discounted using a rate of ten percent per year to reflect the estimated timing of the future cash flows. Future income taxes are calculated by comparing undiscounted future cash flows to the tax basis of oil and gas properties plus available carryforwards and credits and applying the current tax rates to the difference. The discounted future cash flow estimates do not include the effects of the Companys commodity derivative contracts. Utilizing December 31, 2008, commodity
prices held constant over each derivative contracts term, the net present value of the Companys derivative contracts, less associated estimated income taxes and discounted at ten percent, was an asset of approximately $2998 million at December 31, 2008.
Discounted future cash flow estimates like those shown below are not intended to represent estimates of the fair value of oil and gas properties. Estimates of fair value should also consider probableand possible reserves, anticipated future commodity prices, interest rates, changes in development and production costs and risks associated with future production. Because of
these and other considerations, any estimate of fair value is necessarily subjective and imprecise.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC
ACCOUNTING FIRM
The Board of Directors and Stockholders of
Pioneer Natural Resources Company       
We have audited Pioneer Natural Resources Companys internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2008, based on criteria established in Internal ControlIntegrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission the COSO criteria. Pioneer Natural Resources Companys management is responsible for
maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying Managements Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Companys internal control over financial reporting based on our audit.
We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board United States. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal
control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.
A companys internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A companys internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and
procedures that 1 pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; 2 provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and
directors of the company; and 3 provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the companys assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
In our opinion, Pioneer Natural Resources Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2008, based on the COSO criteria.
We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board United States, the consolidated balance sheets of Pioneer Natural Resources Company as of December 31, 2008 and 2007 and the related consolidated statements of operations, stockholders equity, cash flows and comprehensive income for each of the three years in the period
ended December 31, 2008, and our report dated February 24, 2009 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.
