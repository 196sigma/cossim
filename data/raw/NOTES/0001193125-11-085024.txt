Results of Operations The following table sets forth, for the periods presented, selected statements of operations data as a percentage of total revenue: YearEndedDecember31 2010 2009 2008 Revenue Service revenue 778 921 924 Software revenue 130 13 15 Process royalties 26 Reimbursable expenses 66 66 61 Total revenue 1000 1000 1000 Cost of revenue Project and personnel costs 482 603 537 Software costs 90 10 12 Reimbursable expenses 66 66 61 Total cost of revenue 638 679 610 Gross profit 362 321 390 Operating expenses Selling, general and administrative 342 368 315 Depreciation and amortization 45 53 51 Impairment charges 659 Total operating expenses 387 421 1025 Operating loss 25 100 635 Other income, net 02 07 Loss before taxes 25 98 628 Tax provision benefit 242 21 10 Net loss 267 77 638 Results for the Year Ended December31, 2010 Compared to Results for the Year Ended December31, 2009
Revenue. Total revenue increased by $385 million, or 768%, to $885 million for the year ended December31,
2010 from $501 million for the year ended December31, 2009. Of the $385 million increase in 2010 total revenue, service revenue, excluding software, royalty and reimbursable expense revenue, increased by $227 million, or 493%, to $688
million, as compared to service revenue of $461 million in 2009. The primary driver of the current year increase in
comparative service revenue is the result of the additive effects of the December31, 2009 acquisition of Fullscope, Inc. Fullscope the Fullscope Acquisition and the May17, 2010 acquisition of Meridian
Consulting International Meridian the Meridian Acquisition, which are collectively referred to elsewhere herein as The Acquired Companies. Service revenues attributable to The Acquired Companies were not
recorded during the year ended December31, 2009, due to the timing of the respective acquisitions. Additionally, service revenue generated by our Core Service Offerings has increased due to current year improvement in bid and proposal activity
and the intended cross selling synergies resulting from the combination of our technology and management service offerings with Fullscopes ERP-related service offerings. Service revenue related to our Core Service Offerings increased by $30
million, or 65% during the current year. 
-37- Table of Contents
During the year ended December31, 2010, we have seen a noticeable increase in bid and
proposal activity, which has translated into new customer engagements driving our comparative increase in year-over-year service revenue attributable to our Core Service Offerings. Specific to the year-over-year increase in our Core Service
Offerings, during 2010 we successfully capitalized on cross selling opportunities that called for the integration of our Core Service Offerings with Fullscopes ERP-related service offerings and experienced an anticipated service revenue lift
in our EPM-related service offerings. Utilization, which is the rate at which we are able to generate revenue from our
consultants, improved to 756% for the year ended December31, 2010 compared to 655% during the year ended December31, 2009. We typically target utilization in a range from 78%-82%.This objective is influenced by a variety of
factors, including customer demand for IT spending and general economic circumstances.The improvement in our current year billable consultant utilization rate is attributable to the cumulative effects of the Fullscope Acquisition and the
current year growth in our Core Service Offerings service revenue. Annualized service revenue per billable consultant, as
adjusted for utilization, was $324 thousand during the year ended December31, 2010, compared to service revenue per billable consultant of $348 thousand during the comparative 2009 annual period. The change in this operating metric is
primarily attributable to the current year increase in Fullscope contractor headcount. Software revenue, on an annual basis,
has traditionally represented less than 5% of our total revenue and has primarily been attributable to our EPM offering. During the year ended December31, 2010, software revenue totaled $115 million, or 130% of total revenue. The
year-over-year increase in software revenue is directly related to the acquisition of Fullscope, which now represents substantially all of our software sales. We anticipate that software revenue will continue to represent in excess of 5% of annual
revenues in future years. Our historical gross margins related to software revenue have generally been much lower than those
achieved on our consulting services. Fullscopes software revenue, which represents the majority of our current year and anticipated go-forward software revenue, has historically been sold at a higher margin than our EPM-related software.
Because software revenue has become a larger percentage of our total revenue, periodic fluctuations in the amount of software revenue recognized by the Company may have a material impact upon our gross margins. 
During 2010, we recognized $46 million in service and royalty revenue from Fullscopes business process contract. This contract
entails providing services upon which the earnout agreement associated with the Fullscope Acquisition is based. As per the terms of the earnout agreement, the service and royalty revenue generated by the business process contract is scheduled to end
on June30, 2011. The Company currently anticipates that no revenues will be generated by the business process contract after the end of the second quarter of 2011. Generally, we are reimbursed for our out-of-pocket expenses incurred in connection with our customers consulting projects.Reimbursed expense revenue increased approximately $26 million in
2010, to approximately $59 million, as compared to $33 million in 2009. The aggregate amount of reimbursed expenses will fluctuate from year-to-year depending on the location of our customers, the general fluctuation of travel costs, such as
airfare and the number of our projects that require travel. In 2010, we entered into service arrangements with 103 new
customers. Comparatively, in 2009, we secured engagements with 63 new customers. The total number of customers the Company served during 2010 totaled 391, as compared to 249 customers during 2009. This year-over-year change is in large part the
cumulative effect of the customers added in connection with the Fullscope Acquisition combined with the traction we are seeing in our Core Service Offerings. 
-38- Table of Contents
Cost of Revenue. Cost of revenue primarily consists of project personnel costs
principally related to salaries, payroll taxes, employee benefits and travel expenses for personnel dedicated to customer projects. These costs represent the most significant expense we incur in providing our services. In total, cost of revenue
increased by $225 million, or 662%, to $565 million in 2010, as compared to $340 million in 2009. The comparative 2010
periodic year-over-year increase in reported cost of revenue, on an absolute dollar basis, is directly attributable to the overall increase in billable consultant headcount, which includes an increase in the number of contractors we have utilized.
During 2010, we increased our billable consultant headcount in connection with the Fullscope Acquisition, the Meridian Acquisition and an increase in billable consultants including contractors necessary to support current year growth in
Fullscopes Service Offerings. On a year-over-year basis, the Companys total number of billable consultants has
increased by 88, to 268 billable consultants at the end of 2010, as compared to 180 billable consultants at the end of 2009. The Fullscope Acquisition increased our billable consultant headcount by 62 full-time billable resources, while the
acquisition of Meridian added an additional 6 billable resources. Excluding the increase in headcount directly associated with the acquisitions, additional headcount increases were primarily associated with our consultant needs necessary to support
the growth in Fullscopes ERP-related service offering and in connection with the current year growth in our Core Service Offerings. During 2010, we leveraged the use of contractors primarily to support our Fullscope service delivery needs. Contractor expense totaled $41 million and $11 million during 2010 and 2009, respectively.
During the third and fourth quarter of 2010, we proactively focused upon reducing the number of contractors utilized by the Company as a means to improve gross margin, without simultaneously sacrificing service revenue growth. We reduced sequential
quarterly contractor expense in both the third and fourth quarters of 2010 and anticipate that we will be able to continue to lessen our reliance upon contractors and accordingly reduce contractor expense in future quarters. 
Project and personnel costs represented 482% and 603% of total revenue during the years ended December31, 2010 and 2009,
respectively. The periodic change, as a percentage of total revenue, is primarily related to the comparative revenue growth and the associated improvement in our billable consultant utilization rate. Improvement in the comparative 2010 and 2009
periods is also reflective of a reduction in salary and wages in the Companys Core Service Offerings as a result of the headcount reductions enacted by the Company in 2009. 
Software costs amounted to $80 million during the year ended December31, 2010. The increase in the comparative 2010 software
costs, as described under Revenue above, is due primarily to the Fullscope Acquisition. Software costs are expected to fluctuate depending on our customers demand for software. 
Reimbursable expenses increased by $26 million in 2010, to $59 million, as compared to $33 million in 2009. The 2010 increase is
largely attributable to the incremental effects of the Fullscope Acquisition. Reimbursable expenses, as a percentage of total revenue, remained consistent at 66% in 2010 and 2009. 
Gross Profit. Gross profit in 2010 increased by $160 million, or 992%, to $321 million, as compared to $161 million in 2009.
Gross profit, as a percentage of total revenue which we generally refer to as gross margin improved to 362%, as compared to 321% in 2009. The year-over-year improvement in gross margin is directly related to the comparative improvement in our billable consultant utilization rate, offset by an increase in contractor salaries necessary to
support the growth in Fullscopes ERP-related service offerings and fringe benefit-related expenses. Gross margins for the year ended December31, 2009 were unfavorably impacted as a result of a decrease in billable consultant utilization
rates and severance costs associated with the Companys proactive reduction of billable headcount due to the loss of service revenue associated with our larger, legacy accounts. 
-39- Table of Contents
Additionally, gross profit is benefited by $23 million of royalty revenue in 2010 related
to the Fullscope business process contract, which is the contract subject to the earnout agreement entered into in connection with the Fullscope Acquisition. The earnout period, and the related royalty revenue, is scheduled to end on June30,
2011. Historically, the Company has targeted and operated at utilization rates ranging between 78% and 82%. Our 2010
utilization rate was 756%, an increase from 2009 utilization rate of 655%, but still below our historical and targeted utilization ranges. Billable consultant headcount reductions initiated by the Company during 2009 were made with the intention
of reducing excess capacity and improving consultant utilization. These reductions in 2009 allowed the Company to proactively manage headcount-related expenses for 2010, directly resulting in the increased utilization rate and reported improvement
in comparative gross margin. Selling, General and Administrative Expense SGA. SGA expenses
increased 644% to $303 million, as compared to SGA expenses of $184 million in 2009. The comparative periodic increases in SGA expenses during the year ended December31, 2010 is reflective of the incremental impact upon SGA
expenses associated with the Fullscope Acquisition, the Meridian Acquisition, a $950 thousand non-routine charge related to a potential pre-acquisition sales and use tax exposure associated with the Fullscope Embezzlement Issue and an increase in
core SGA expenses as a result of the current year growth in our Core Service Offerings. SGA expenses, as a percentage of total revenue was 342% and 368% in 2010 and 2009, respectively. 
The year-over-year increase in core SGA expenses was driven by comparative increases in sales-related salaries and wages including
commission expense, bonus expense recorded in connection with the Companys 2010 performance-based bonus programs, increased professional services expenses related to acquisition costs and legal and forensic accounting expenses resulting from
the Fullscope Embezzlement Issue and recruiting expenses incurred in connection with the increase in our billable consultant headcount. The Company did not incur a significant amount of bonus expense in the year ended December31, 2009 due to
the Companys overall financial performance. During the year ended December31, 2010, the Company recognized $451 thousand in acquisition-related expenses and $11 million in net expenses related to the Fullscope Embezzlement Issue.
During the fourth quarter, in connection with our review of the impact of the discovered embezzlement activity upon
Fullscopes historical financial statements, the Company recorded a $950 thousand liability associated with potential pre-acquisition sales and use tax obligations. The potential sales and use tax-related liability was created by the methods
employed to conceal the discovered fraudulent activity. While the Company has accounted for this liability as a period expense, we believe that any amounts actually paid to resolve this issue will be recoverable from an existing, fully funded escrow
account which was established in connection with our acquisition of Fullscope. Future amounts recovered, if any, will be recorded by the Company in the period in which the amounts are determined to be probable of recovery from escrow. 
We anticipate that we may continue to incur additional expenses associated with the Fullscope Embezzlement Issue as we intend to
aggressively pursue recovery through all possible avenues, including a claim against the escrow account established in connection with the Fullscope Acquisition and reimbursement under insurance policies. We believe that we may be able to recover
some, if not all, of the expenses we incur in addressing this situation. Amounts recovered and/or reimbursed, if any, in connection with this matter will be recorded in the period during which amounts are determined to be probable of recovery from
escrow. Depreciation and Amortization Expense. Depreciation and amortization expense increased by $13 million, or
493%, to $40 million, as compared to $27 million in 2009. The current year change is primarily related to intangible assets associated with the Fullscope and Meridian acquisitions. Amortization expense increased to $31 million in 2010, as
compared to $18 million in 2009. Operating Loss. The Companys comparative operating loss improved by $28
million, to $22 million, as compared to $50 million in 2009. The current year improvement in operating loss is attributable to the overall 
-40- Table of Contents
increase in comparative service revenue and software revenue and the associated gross margins. The improvement in total gross margin during the current year was offset by the incremental
increases in SGA expenses and amortization expense, each of which is described above. Other Income, Net. Other
income totaled $34 thousand during 2010, as compared to $122 thousand in 2009. Other income in 2010 represents the net amount of earned interest income and foreign currency translations. Other income in 2009 consists primarily of interest income.
The current year decrease in interest income recognized by the Company is attributable to reduced principal balances and average yields on our investments throughout 2010, as compared to those achieved throughout 2009. 
Income Tax Provision Benefit. We recorded a provision benefit for income taxes of $214 million and $10 million for the
years ended December31, 2010 and 2009, respectively. Our 2010 and 2009 periodic income tax provision benefit amounts were derived based upon an effective income tax rate, inclusive of both federal and state income taxes, of 04% in and
402%, respectively. Additionally, our reported periodic income tax provision benefit includes expense benefit amounts attributable to foreign income taxes, changes in deferred tax assets and liabilities and their related valuation allowance,
uncertain tax positions and interest and penalties. We have net deferred tax assets that have arisen primarily as a result of
timing differences, net operating loss carryforwards and tax credits. Our ability to realize a deferred tax asset is based on our ability to generate sufficient future taxable income. As is our practice, we assess, on a routine periodic basis, the
estimated future realizability of the gross carrying value of our net deferred tax assets on a more likely than not basis. Our periodic assessments take into consideration both positive evidence future profitability projections for example and
negative evidence recent and historical financial performance for example as it relates to evaluating the future recoverability of our deferred tax assets. During the third quarter of 2010, in connection with our periodic review of the carrying value of our net deferred tax assets, we recorded a non-cash charge of $219 million in connection with an increase
to the previously established valuation allowance recorded against the gross carrying value of our net deferred tax assets. Subsequent to this adjustment, the recorded valuation allowance represents a full valuation reserve against the total gross
carrying value of our net deferred tax assets. The establishment of a full valuation allowance against the gross carrying
value of our net deferred tax assets does not prohibit or limit the Companys ability to realize a tax benefit in future periods. All existing deferred tax assets, net operating loss carryforwards and credits will be fully available to reduce
certain future federal and state income tax obligations. The Company considers scheduled reversals of deferred tax
liabilities, projected future taxable income, ongoing tax planning strategies and other matters, including the period over which our deferred tax assets will be recoverable, in assessing the need for and the amount of the valuation allowance. In the
event that actual results differ from these estimates, or we adjust these estimates in the future periods, further adjustments to our valuation allowance may be recorded, which could materially impact our financial position and net income loss in
the period of the adjustment. The current year income tax-related changes impacting our reported income tax expense are more
fully described elsewhere herein, including Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Income Taxes and Valuation of Deferred Tax Assets and Item 8 
Financial Statements and Supplementary Data Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements Note 8 Income Taxes. Net Loss. Net loss increased $198 million, to $236 million, as compared to $38 million in 2009. The current year change in reported net loss is a direct result of the full valuation
allowance of deferred tax assets offset by the increase in revenue and gross profit. Each of these items is described in further detail above.

Results for the Year Ended December31, 2009 Compared to Results for the Year Ended
December31, 2008 On December31, 2009, the Company announced its acquisition of Fullscope, Inc. The
Fullscope Acquisition was completed after the close of business on December31, 2009, the last day of our fiscal year. Accordingly, our 2009 results and the following discussion related to our comparative 2009 operating results and cash flows
do not include any contributions related to the Fullscope Acquisition. Fullscopes operating results will become part of Edgewaters operating results beginning on January1, 2010. 
Revenue. Total revenue decreased by $237 million, or 321%, to $501 million for the year ended December31, 2009 from $737
million for the year ended December31, 2008. Of the $237 million decrease in 2009 total revenue, service revenue, excluding software and reimbursable expense revenue, decreased by $220 million, or 323%, to $461 million, as compared to
service revenue of $681 million in 2008. The 2009 decline in total revenue and service revenue is reflective of the combined
effect of current economic conditions and external IT spending trends, which have lead to 1 a decrease in service revenue attributable to certain of our historically larger accounts within our technology service offerings; 2 the absence of
follow-on service revenue following the successful completion of projects during 2008 and 2009 that we have not been able to fully replace due to external IT spending trends; and 3 a slower than anticipated cyclical recovery in our EPM-related
service offerings during the last nine months of 2009. Our EPM-related offerings tend to have a slower first quarter followed by stronger subsequent quarters. We believe that in the current economic landscape, companies have reduced capital budgets
and have been hesitant to initiate new or additional phases of projects. As a result, these conditions have had an adverse impact on our ability to generate recurring service revenue in 2009, as compared to service revenue generated in 2008.
The comparative year-over-year fluctuations in our service revenue are largely attributable to changes in our customers
buying habits specific to our classic technology consulting service offerings and our long-term technology maintenance engagements.Traditionally, our classic technology consulting offerings have centered upon long-term system designs and
builds. With the current macroeconomic environment, customer cutbacks in classic IT services have drastically reduced these opportunities in terms of size, scope and timing.This is reflected in our classic IT consulting engagements becoming
more concentrated in our newer, shorter-term, specialized projects around a core product set. The loss of classic technology consulting engagements is the primary driver of our revenue decline in the comparative 2009 and 2008 full-year
periods.In advance of, and during, this macroeconomic decline, we have taken proactive measures to match the dramatic shift in our revenue mix. We have expanded our service offerings and capabilities, implemented training initiatives and
initiated cost and staff reduction initiatives targeted at aligning our operating expenses with our anticipated service revenues. Due to the pullback in classic IT spending, our EPM-related offerings became the major portion of service revenues during 2009.Historically, EPM engagements were naturally smaller in size and had
shorter project cycles than our historic classic technology consulting projects.During 2009, offerings in classic IT tended to be smaller in nature akin to EPM, which we believe, reflects a combination of the prevailing economic conditions,
as well as the shift to new technology and packaging of new offerings. Our EPM business remains strong, despitechallenging economic conditions during 2009. Toward the end of 2009, we have observed that engagement sizes appear to be increasing.
We believe this may be reflective of increased confidence in the economy and increasing acceptance of our offerings across the board.We have not seen the same secular and economic shifts that are affecting our classic IT consulting
engagements, impacting our EPM-related services, nor the recently acquired Fullscope operations. While we cannot estimate when the current economic conditions that are negatively impacting our business will reverse, we believe that we have
stabilized the Company and are positioned to capitalize on opportunities as conditions improve. The full impact of the Fullscope Acquisition will be felt in 2010 and should positively impact our service as well as our total service revenue.
Utilization, which is the rate at which we are able to generate revenue from our consultants, amounted to 655% in 2009
compared to 735% in 2008.We typically target utilization in a range from 78%-82%.This 
-42- Table of Contents
objective is influenced by a variety of factors, including customer demand for IT spending and general economic circumstances.Our 2009 utilization rate is below the historical target
range.The drop in our utilization rate below our target rate during 2009 is attributable to the factors described above. To offset this decline in utilization, the Company proactively managed billable consultant headcount to anticipated
revenue. By the end of the fourth quarter of 2009, utilization rates had stabilized and in fact, had begun to rise. 
Annualized service revenue per billable consultant, as adjusted for utilization, was $348 thousand during 2009, compared to $340 thousand
in 2008.This metric reflects the shift in our revenue to a greater mix of high-end EPM consulting services, which services have higher consultant billing rates than our other offerings and remains a solid measure of our performance in a tough
environment. Software revenue, which has been directly attributable to our EPM offering, decreased by $468 thousand, to $664
thousand in 2009, as compared to $11 million in 2008. Software sales have not historically been a primary driver of our revenue and are at times generated through the sale of our EPM-related service offerings. Software revenue represented 13% and
15% of our total revenue in 2009 and 2008, respectively. Our historical gross margins related to software revenue have generally been much lower than those achieved on our consulting services. Fullscopes software revenue, which will represent
the majority of our anticipated software revenue in 2010, has historically been sold at a higher margin than our EPM-related software. We believe that our future gross margins on software revenue will increase above our historically achieved margins
as a result of the Fullscope Acquisition. Generally, we are reimbursed for our out-of-pocket expenses incurred in connection
with our customers consulting projects.Reimbursed expense revenue decreased approximately $12 million in 2009, to approximately $33 million, as compared to $45 million in 2008. The aggregate amount of reimbursed expenses will
fluctuate from year-to-year depending on the location of our customers, the general fluctuation of travel costs, such as airfare, and the number of our projects that require travel. 
In 2009, we entered into service arrangements with 63 new customers. Comparatively, in 2008, we secured engagements with 83 new
customers. The total number of customers the Company served during 2009 totaled 249, as compared to 308 customers during 2008. This year-over-year change is a result of a general slowdown in IT spending for new projects, delays in proposal decisions
for IT service project commitments due to a challenging economic climate and a shift in our revenue mix towards a greater concentration of EPM-related consulting engagements. While Fullscope did not contribute to our service revenue during 2009, it
provided services to approximately 80 customers during the year. Cost of Revenue. Cost of revenue primarily consists
of project personnel costs principally related to salaries, payroll taxes, employee benefits and travel expenses for personnel dedicated to customer projects. These costs represent the most significant expense we incur in providing our services. In
total, cost of revenue decreased by $110 million, or 244%, to $340 million in 2009, as compared to $450 million in 2008. The 2009 decrease in cost of revenue is primarily attributable to comparative year-over-year fluctuations in billable
consultant resources. On a year-over-year basis, the Companys total number of billable consultants decreased by 61, to
180 billable consultants at the end of 2009, which excludes any increases in billable consultants attributable to the Fullscope Acquisition, as compared to 241 billable consultants at the end of 2008. The year-over-year decrease in billable
consultant headcount is a result of current year attrition and a targeted reduction in connection with the decrease in legacy-related projects and service revenue. Billable consultant reductions made in conjunction with the decrease in legacy
account revenue were initiated by the Company as cost cutting measures targeted at aligning Company resources with demand for our services. As a result of the December31, 2009 Fullscope Acquisition, we entered 2010 with a combined total of 242
billable consultant resources. It should be noted that 15 of these billable consultants will be fully dedicated to Fullscopes business process contracts with Microsoft, which are the contracts that are the basis for the services that the
earnout agreement associated with the Fullscope 
-43- Table of Contents
Acquisition is based. See Item 8 Financial Statements and Supplementary Data Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements Note 4 Business Combinations
included elsewhere herein. As a percentage of total revenue, total cost of revenue was 679% and 610% in 2009 and 2008,
respectively. A significant portion of our cost of revenue is attributable to project and personnel costs. Project and personnel costs represented 603% and 537% of total revenue during 2009 and 2008, respectively. The 2009 year-over-year
increases, as a percentage of total revenue, are attributable to both the comparative full year changes in total revenue and the lower utilization rate for our billable consultants during the current year. Our utilization rates during 2009 have been
negatively impacted by excess capacity in connection with the revenue and sales trends described above under Revenue. Software costs amounted to $496 thousand and $861 thousand during 2009 and 2008, respectively. Software costs are expected to fluctuate between quarters depending on our customers demand for EPM-related
software. Reimbursable expenses, which increased as a percent of revenue, to 66% in 2009, as compared to 61% in 2008, were
primarily due to the Companys increased travel-related expenses incurred during the comparative years. Gross
Profit. Gross profit decreased by $127 million, or 441%, to $161 million, as compared to $288 million in 2008. Gross profit, as a percentage of total revenue which we generally refer to as gross margin decreased to 321%, as compared to
390% in 2008. The comparative fluctuation in gross profit is a direct result of the current year decline in revenue, which
was partially offset by the current year reductions in billable consultant resources. The 2009 decline in gross margin is primarily attributable to the current year change in billable consultant utilization rates and pricing pressure as a result of
increased competition. The Companys billable consultant utilization rate was 655% in 2009, as compared to 735% in 2008. The year-over-year variation is a direct result of an increase in excess capacity resulting from the reduction in legacy
account service revenues and current economic conditions. Each of the current year factors impacting current year gross profit and gross margin are described in further detail above under Revenue and Cost of
Revenue. Historically, the Company has targeted and operated at utilization rates ranging between 78% and 82%. Our 2009
utilization rate was 655%, below our historical and targeted utilization ranges. The billable consultant headcount reductions initiated by the Company during 2009, were made with the intention of reducing excess capacity and improving consultant
utilization. However, no assurances can be given that the efficiency measures implemented by the Company will generate the intended results. Selling, General and Administrative Expense SGA. SGA expenses decreased 207% to $184 million, as compared to SGA expenses of $232 million in 2008. The comparative
improvement, on a dollar basis, in SGA expenses during 2009 is the combined result of ipersonnel reductions initiated in the latter part of 2008, which have served to reduce operations-related salary expense; iireduced 2009
commissions and bonus expense as a result of the decrease in comparative 2009 operating performance; and iiia reduction in other SGA expenses such as travel, training, marketing, recruiting and occupancy expenses resulting from the
Companys cost cutting initiatives to better align its operating cost base with its revenues. SGA expense, as a
percentage of revenue, was 368% for the year ended December31, 2009, as compared to 315% for the year ended December31, 2008. The Company continuously monitors its SGA costs, with the goal of achieving greater economies of scale
over the long term. The increase in the 2009 SGA expenses, as a percentage of revenue, was due to the year-over-year decline in revenue and the timing of our cost reduction initiatives. 
Depreciation and Amortization Expense. Depreciation and amortization expense decreased by $11 million, or 286%, to $27 million,
as compared to $38 million in 2008. The 2009 change was primarily related to

reduced amortization expense and, to a lesser extent, a reduction in 2009 depreciation expense. Amortization expense decreased by $938 thousand, or 344%, to $18 million in 2009, as compared to
$27 million in 2008. The 2009 change is a combination of the 2008 Impairment Charges and certain other identified intangible assets associated with acquisitions consummated prior to 2009 becoming fully amortized during the current year. 
Impairment of Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets. In 2008, the Company, as a result of the 2008 Impairment Charges, recorded
$486 million in impairment charges against the carrying value of its goodwill and other intangible assets. In 2009, in connection with the Annual Impairment Test, the Company performed its annual review for impairment. Based upon the valuation
approaches described above, the Company determined that the current carrying value of its goodwill assets has not been impaired. Operating Loss. The Companys comparative operating loss improved by $418 million in 2009, to $50 million, as compared to $468 million in 2008. The improvement in operating loss in 2009 was
primarily attributable to the absence of the 2008 Impairment Charges and to a lesser extent, the other comparative year-over-year changes discussed above. Other Income, Net. We earned net interest income of $122 thousand, as compared to net interest income of $503 thousand in 2008. The 2009 change in interest income was attributable to reduced
average yields on our investments throughout 2009, as compared to those achieved throughout 2008. Average maturity and yield rates on marketable security instruments as of December31, 2009 were 106 days and 05%, respectively, as compared to
168 days and 23% in 2008, respectively. Income Tax Benefit Provision. The Company recorded a tax benefit of $10
million for the year ended December31, 2009, as compared to a tax provision of $07 million in 2008. The Companys effective income tax rate, prior to the consideration of changes in the valuation allowance applied against our deferred
tax assets and other items impacting our income tax provision, was 215% and 15% in 2009 and 2008, respectively. The reported income tax benefit provision amounts in both 2009 and 2008 are impacted by changes in our deferred tax assets and, in
the case of 2008 activity, related to changes in our deferred tax asset valuation allowance. Items impacting our 2009 income
tax benefit included provisions for foreign income taxes and changes in carrying value of our deferred tax assets. During 2009, we decreased the carrying value of deferred tax assets attributable to timing differences, in connection with a decrease
in the effective income tax rates. Our comparative effective income tax rate, reflective of both federal and state income taxes, decreased as a result of the reduction in our consolidated state income tax rate. This rate change is reflective of our
modification in filing positions in certain states, which enabled us to achieve a lower, consolidated state income tax rate. As a result of this decrease in our consolidated effective income tax rate, we decreased the carrying value of our deferred
tax attributes, and accordingly increased income tax expense, by $929 thousand. The significant changes impacting our
reported 2008 income tax provision related to the establishment of deferred tax assets in connection with the 2008 Impairment Charges and a $96 million increase to the valuation allowance provided against the deferred tax assets. Each of these
items are more fully described elsewhere herein, including Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Goodwill, Other Intangible Assets and Impairment of Long-Lived
Assets and Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Income Taxes and Valuation of Deferred Tax Assets. 
Net Loss. Net loss in 2009 increased $432 million, or 918%, to $38 million, as compared to $470 million in 2008. The
current year improvement in reported net loss is a direct result of the absence, in 2009, of the 2008 Impairment Charges. To a lesser extent, 2009 net loss is also impacted by the decline in comparative service revenue, lower billable consultant
utilization rate and associated gross margin, the reduction in comparative SGA expenses and the tax benefit recorded by the Company. Each of these items is explained in further detail above.

Liquidity and Capital Resources 
The following table summarizes our cash flow activities for the periods indicated: Year Ended December31 2010 2009 2008 In Thousands Cash flows provided by used in Operating activities 698 243 7,742 Investing activities 4,098 7,123 2,556 Financing activities 222 363 4,301 Discontinued operating activities 8 Effects of exchange rates 4 Total cash provided used during the year 5,014 7,729 5,989 As of December31, 2010, we had cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities of $109 million, a
$18 million decrease from the December31, 2009 balance of $127 million. Working capital, which is defined as current assets less current liabilities, decreased $858 thousand, to $142 million, as of December31, 2010, as compared to
$150 million as of December31, 2009. The comparative decrease in our cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities balance has been materially impacted by cash outflows related to the liabilities assumed in connection with the Fullscope
Acquisition, which included $18 million in federal and state income taxes, $13 million in accrued wages, bonuses and commissions and $30 million in accounts payable specifically related to Fullscopes fiscal 2009 re-sales of Microsoft
Dynamics AX-related software the Fullscope Payments. Additionally, the Company had cash outflows associated with the Meridian Acquisition, broad-based payments made under Edgewaters 2009 performance-based bonus plan, annual
renewals of insurance premiums and capital lease obligations. These cash outlays have been offset by proceeds from the collection of outstanding accounts receivable balances, refunds of federal and foreign income taxes and issuances under the
Companys employee stock purchase plan. Included in the Fullscope Payments was a $16 million payment associated with
Fullscopes 2009 federal income tax obligation. Fullscope became a part of Edgewaters consolidated tax group for fiscal 2010, which will enable Fullscope to eliminate cash payments related to near-term federal income tax obligations
through the utilization of Edgewaters existing federal net operating loss carryforwards. Our primary historical sources
of funds have been from operations and the proceeds from equity offerings, as well as sales of businesses in fiscal years 2000 and 2001. Our principal historical uses of cash have been to fund working capital requirements, capital expenditures and
acquisitions. We generally pay our employees bi-weekly for their services, while receiving payments from customers 30 to 60 days from the date of the invoice. Net cash provided by operating activities was $698 thousand in 2010, as compared to net cash used in operating activities of $243 thousand in 2009. The primary components impacting our operating cash
flow during 2010 included an increase in accrued payroll and related liabilities of $12 million, which was primarily a result of 2010 accruals related to the Companys 2010 performance-based bonus and commission plans. Additionally the Company
reported non-cash charges of $210 million in connection with the 2010 change in deferred tax assets, which was in large part driven by the $219 million impairment charge recorded by the Company during the third quarter of 2010, $40 million in
depreciation and amortization expense and $10 million in share-based compensation expense. The inflows were offset by outflows associated with a reported net loss of $236 million, a $22 million decrease in accounts payable and accrued expenses
and a $14 million increase in accounts receivable. Net cash used in operating activities was $243 thousand in 2009. The
primary components impacting our operating cash flow during 2009 included cash outflows associated with a reported net loss of $38 million, a net 
-46- Table of Contents
decrease of $13 million in accrued payroll and related wage accruals primarily associated with a decrease in current year bonuses to be paid in connection with the Companys 2009
Performance-Based Bonus Plans, a $10 million decrease in accounts payable and accrued expenses and an increase of $819 thousand in prepaid expenses and other current assets as a result of overpayments of federal, state and foreign income taxes.
These cash outflows were partially offset by positive cash flows from a $29 million decrease in accounts receivable plus non-cash charges such as depreciation and amortization, share-based compensation and amortization of marketable securities
premiums totaling $40 million. Net cash provided by operating activities was $77 million in 2008. Significant changes in
operating accounts included a $40 million decrease in accounts receivable, depreciation and amortization of $38 million and 2008 income from continuing operations of $16 million, adjusted to exclude the effects of the non-cash 2008 Impairment
Charges. The cash flow provided by the above items was partially offset by a $05 million decrease in accounts payable and accrued expenses, a decrease of $20 million in accrued bonuses in connection with a decrease in current year bonuses to be
paid in connection with the Companys 2008 Performance-Based Bonus Plans and a $29 million decrease in accrued payroll and related liabilities. For the year ended December31, 2010, net cash provided by investing activities was $41 million. Comparatively, cash flow used by investing activities was $71 million in 2009 and cash flow
provided by investing activities was $26 million in 2008. Current year net sources of cash related to $69 million in redemptions of marketable securities partially offset by $16 million in payments related to the Meridian acquisition and $14
million related to the Fullscope acquisition. All capital expenditures are discretionary as the Company currently has no
long-term commitments for capital expenditures. For the year ended December31, 2009, we used $71 million in cash
associated with investing activities. Net uses of cash related to $109 million in net cash paid in connection with our December31, 2009 acquisition of Fullscope, Inc. and $140 thousand in contingent earnout consideration paid to Lynx in
connection with their completion of a second and final earnout period. These outflows were partially offset by $40 million in net redemptions of marketable securities. Net cash provided by investing activities was $26 million in 2008. 2010 inflows of cash related to $41 million in current year net redemptions of marketable securities. These inflows were offset by $12
million in contingent earnout consideration payments made in connection with the 2007 Acquisitions and $03 million of capital expenditures. Net cash provided by used in financing activities was $222 thousand, $363 thousand, and $43 million in 2010, 2009, and 2008, respectively. Components of cash provided by financing activities during
2010 included $441 thousand received from our employees related to our Employee Stock Purchase Plan, which was partially offset by $220 thousand in capital lease payments. Components of cash used in financing activities during 2009 included $579
thousand related to repurchases of the Companys common stock and $215 thousand in payment made under capital lease obligations. These outflows were offset by $431 in cash received from our employees related to our Employee Stock Purchase Plan.
Cash used in financing activities during 2008 was primarily attributable to repurchases of the Companys common stock, which totaled $51 million. These purchases were offset by net proceeds from our Employee Stock Purchase Plan and exercises
of stock options. As a result of the above, our combined cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities decreased
increased by $50 million, $77 million, and $60 million in 2010, 2009, and 2008, respectively. The aggregate of our cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities was $109 million, $127 million and $246 million as of December31, 2010,
2009, and 2008, respectively. We have entered into various contingent earnout agreements in connection with the acquisitions
we have completed. Earnout periods, related performance measurements and the value of the contingent earnout 
-47- Table of Contents
consideration to be earned are specific to each acquisition. Contingent earnout consideration paid by the Company has historically been paid in either cash or a combination of cash and stock.
During 2009, Lynx completed its second and final earnout period. As a result, the Company accrued and paid $140 thousand in
contingent earnout consideration, in cash, to Lynx. The contingent earnout consideration paid by the Company was reported as an increase to goodwill in the Companys consolidated balance sheet. 
On December31, 2009, and May17, 2010, the Company acquired all of the outstanding stock of Fullscope, Inc and substantially
all of the assets of Meridian Consulting International, respectively. As provided for under the related purchase agreements, Fullscopes and Meridians stockholders are eligible to receive additional contingent consideration based upon
performance-based thresholds, which will be determined, periodically, over an eighteen-month period for Fullscope and a 36-month period for Meridian from the date of acquisition. In accordance with ASC Subtopic 805-30-25, the Company increased
total purchase price consideration by approximately $24 million, which represented our initial fair value estimate of the contingent consideration to be paid to the former stockholders of Fullscope and Meridian, respectively. See Item 8
Financial Statements and Supplementary Data Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements Note 4 Business Combinations. We believe that our current cash balances and cash flows from operations will be sufficient to fund our short-term operating and liquidity requirements, for at least the next twelve months, and the
long-term operating and liquidity requirements for our existing operations. We periodically reassess the adequacy of our liquidity position, taking into consideration current and anticipated operating cash flow, anticipated capital expenditures,
business combinations, possible stockholder distributions and public or private offerings of debt or equity securities. The pace at which we will either generate or consume cash will be dependent upon future operations and the level of demand for
our services on an ongoing basis. See Item 1 Business, Potential Future Strategies, Transactions and Changes. Off
Balance Sheet Arrangements, Contractual Obligations and Contingent Liabilities and Commitments We lease office space under
noncancellable operating lease arrangements through 2016. Rent expense was approximately $19 million, $17 million and $19 million for the years ended December31, 2010, 2009, and 2008, respectively. 
We have lease financing arrangements the Capital Lease Arrangements with a bank related to certain property and equipment,
as further described in Item 8 Financial Statements and Supplementary Data Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements Note 6 Property and Equipment included elsewhere herein. Payments under the Capital Lease
Arrangements are to be made over a period of 48 to 60 months and have a blended interest rate of 603%per annum on the outstanding principal balances. As of December31, 2010 and 2009, our outstanding obligations under the Capital Lease
Arrangements totaled $200 thousand and $420 thousand, respectively. During the year ended December31, 2010, 2009 and 2008, the Company made payments of principal and interest totaling $215 thousand, $251 thousand and $251 thousand,
respectively under the Capital Lease Arrangements.

QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK Our primary financial instruments include investments in money market funds, short-term municipal bonds, commercial paper and U.S. government securities that are sensitive to market risks and interest
rates. The investment portfolio is used to preserve our capital until it is required to fund operations, strategic acquisitions or distributions to stockholders. None of our market-risk sensitive instruments are held for trading purposes. We did not
purchase derivative financial instruments in 2010 or 2009. Should interest rates on the Companys investments fluctuate by 10% the impact would not be material to the financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. 
For the last three years, the impact of inflation and changing prices has not been material on revenues or income from continuing
operations.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM
To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of Edgewater Technology, Inc. Wakefield, Massachusetts: We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance
sheets of Edgewater Technology, Inc. and subsidiaries the Company as of December31, 2010 and 2009, and the related consolidated statements of operations, stockholders equity, and cash flows for each of the three years in
the period ended December31, 2010. These financial statements are the responsibility of the Companys management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audits. 
We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board United States. Those
standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. The Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its
internal control over financial reporting. Our audits included consideration of internal control over financial reporting as a basis for designing audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an
opinion on the effectiveness of the Companys internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. An audit also includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the
financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
In our opinion, such consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of
Edgewater Technology, Inc. and subsidiaries as of December31, 2010 and 2009, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December31, 2010, in conformity with accounting
principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Deloitte Touche LLP

SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES: The accompanying consolidated financial statements reflect the application of certain significant accounting policies as described in this note and elsewhere in the accompanying consolidated financial
statements and notes. Basis of Presentation The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Edgewater and its wholly-owned subsidiaries. All intercompany transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. 
The Company considers events or transactions that occur after the balance sheet date but before the financial statements are issued to
provide additional evidence relative to certain estimates or to identify matters that require additional disclosure.The Company did not identify any recognizable events during this period. 
Use of Estimates Our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. These accounting principles require management to make
certain estimates, judgments and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amount of revenues and expenses during
the reporting period. These estimates, judgments and assumptions used in preparing the accompanying consolidated financial statements are based upon managements evaluation of the relevant facts and circumstances as of the date of the
consolidated financial statements. Although the Company regularly assesses these estimates, judgments and assumptions used in preparing these consolidated financial statements, actual results could differ from those estimates. Changes in estimates
are recorded in the period in which they become known. Cash and Cash Equivalents 
Cash and cash equivalent balances consist of deposits, investments in money market funds and repurchase agreements with large U.S.
commercial banks. All highly liquid investments with remaining maturities of three months or less at the date of purchase are considered cash equivalents. The Companys cash equivalents consisted of $41 million and $12 thousand in money market
funds as of December31, 2010 and 2009, respectively. Restricted Cash 
In connection with Edgewaters December31, 2009 acquisition of Fullscope, Inc. Fullscopethe
Fullscope Acquisition, Fullscope, at the closing date of the acquisition, had $702 thousand of restricted cash. The restricted cash represented an escrow deposit made in connection with Fullscopes sale of certain intellectual
property in June 2009 and was released in June 2010. As provided for under the Agreement and Plan of Merger

SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES Continued: 
and Reorganization between Edgewater and Fullscope, the restricted cash was released from escrow during 2010 and deposited into a Fullscope Acquisition-related escrow account. Edgewaters
acquisition of Fullscope is described in further detail in Note 4 of the notes to consolidated financial statements. Marketable
Securities Marketable securities are classified as available-for-sale securities, which are recorded at fair
market value with unrealized gains and losses recorded as part of accumulated and other comprehensive income, which is separate component of stockholders equity, until such gains and losses are realized. Marketable securities consist of
marketable instruments, which include but are not limited to government obligations, including agencies, government sponsored entities and commercial paper. All marketable securities have original maturities greater than three months, but less than
one year, at the date of purchase. The fair value of these securities is based upon quoted prices for identical or similar assets. If a decline in the fair value is considered other-than-temporary, based on available evidence, the unrealized loss is
transferred from other comprehensive income loss to the consolidated statements of operations. Realized gains or losses are determined on the specific identification method and are included in interest income in the consolidated statements of
operations. Property and Equipment Property and equipment are stated at cost, net of accumulated depreciation and amortization. Property and equipment are depreciated on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of the assets,
which range from three to ten years. Equipment held under capital leases is amortized utilizing the straight-line method over the lesser of the estimated useful life of the asset or the term of the lease. See Note 6 and Note 14 of the notes to
consolidated financial statements. Additions that extend the lives of the assets are capitalized, while repairs and maintenance costs are expensed as incurred. Product Development Costs Capitalization of product
development costs begins upon the establishment of technological feasibility, as defined under Financial Accounting Standards Board FASB Accounting Standards Codification ASC Topic 985-20, Costs of Software to be
Sold, Leased, or Marketed ASC Topic 985. Amortization of capitalized computer software development costs, which is recorded as component of cost of revenue, is provided on a product-by-product basis using the straight-line
method, beginning upon commercial release of the product, and continuing over the remaining estimated economic life of the product, not to exceed three years. At each balance sheet date, we evaluate the unamortized capitalized software costs for
potential impairment by comparing to the net realizable value of the products. The Company capitalized a total of $112 thousand in product development costs during the year ended December31, 2010. These costs represent the entire amount of
capitalized product development costs included in the Companys consolidated balance sheet as of December31, 2010 under the caption Intangible assets, net. No computer software development costs were capitalized as of
December31, 2009.No amortization expense has been recorded during the year ended December31, 2010, as no products with capitalized costs have reached commercial release as of December31, 2010. 
Impairment of Long-Lived Assets We evaluate our long-lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of such assets may not be recoverable. Impairment is generally assessed by a
comparison of 
-57- Table of Contents EDGEWATER TECHNOLOGY, INC. 
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS-Continued  2.
SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES Continued: 
cash flows expected to be generated by an asset to its carrying value, with the exception that goodwill impairment is assessed by use of a fair value model see Note 7 of the notes to
consolidated financial statements. If such assets are considered to be impaired, the impairment to be recognized is measured by the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds its fair value. 
Goodwill and Intangible Assets Goodwill has an indefinite useful life and is not amortized, but is evaluated for impairment annually the Annual Impairment Test or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that
the carrying value may not be recoverable. We record intangible assets at historical cost. Our intangible assets consist primarily of non-compete arrangements, customer relationships and trade names and trademarks. We amortize our intangible assets
that have finite lives using either the straight-line method or based on estimated future cash flows to approximate the pattern in which the economic benefit of the asset will be utilized. Amortization is recorded over the estimated useful lives
ranging from 15 to 75 years and is further described in Notes 4 and 7. Goodwill is tested for impairment annually at the
reporting unit level utilizing the fair value methodology. Our annual measurement date is December2. Factors the Company considers important that could trigger an interim review for impairment include, but are not limited to, the
following:  Significant under-performance relative to historical or projected future operating results;  Significant changes in the manner of its use of acquired assets or the strategy for its overall business;  Significant negative industry or economic trends;  Significant decline in its stock price for a sustained period; and  Its market capitalization relative to net book value. Goodwill is evaluated for impairment using a two-step process. The first step is to compare the fair value of the reporting unit to the carrying amount of the reporting unit the First Step.
If the carrying amount exceeds the fair value, a second step must be followed to calculate potential impairment the Second Step. Otherwise, if the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds the carrying amount, the goodwill is not
considered to be impaired as of the measurement date. In its review of the carrying value of the goodwill, the Company determines fair values for the reporting unit using the Income Approach, or more specifically the Discounted Cash Flow Method, and
the Market Approach, utilizing both the Guideline Company Method and the Comparable Transactions Method. These valuation methods require management to project revenues, operating expenses, working capital investment, capital spending and cash flows
for the reporting unit over a multi-year period, as well as determine the weighted average cost of capital to be used as a discount rate. 
Revenue Recognition Our Company recognizes revenue primarily through the provision of consulting services and the resale of third-party, off the shelf software and maintenance. 
We recognize revenue by providing consulting services under written service contracts with our customers. The service contracts we enter
into generally fall into three specific categories: time and materials, fixed-price and fixed-fee. Time and materials-based contracts represented 935%, 927% and 967% of service revenue for the years ended December31, 2010, 2009 and 2008,
respectively. Revenue related to our service offerings is recognized as the services are performed and amounts are earned.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS-Continued  2.
SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES Continued: 
When a customer enters into a time and materials, fixed-price or a periodic fixed-fee
contract, we recognize revenue in accordance with our evaluation of the deliverables in each contract. If the deliverables represent separate units of accounting, we then measure and allocate the consideration from the arrangement to the separate
units, based on reliable evidence of fair value for each deliverable. The revenue under time and materials contracts is
recognized as services are rendered and performed at contractually agreed upon rates. Revenue pursuant to fixed-price contracts is recognized under the proportional performance method of accounting. Fixed-price contracts represented 42%, 47% and
10% of service revenue for the years ended December31, 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively. Over the course of a fixed-price contract, we routinely evaluate whether revenue and profitability should be recognized in the current period. We
estimate the proportional performance on our fixed-price contracts on a monthly basis utilizing hours incurred to date as a percentage of total estimated hours to complete the project. If we do not have a sufficient basis to measure progress toward
completion, revenue is recognized upon completion of performance, subject to any warranty provisions or other project management assessments as to the status of work performed. This method is used because reasonably dependable estimates of costs and
revenue earned can be made, based on historical experience and milestones identified in any particular contract. We also
perform services on a periodic fixed-fee basis under infrastructure service contracts, which include monthly hosting and support services. Fixed-fee contracts represented 23%, 26% and 23% of service revenues for the years ended December31,
2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively. Revenue under periodic fixed-fee contracts is recognized ratably over the contract period, as outlined within the respective contract. In the event additional services are required, above the minimum retained or
contracted amount, then such services are billed on a time and materials basis. Typically, the Company provides warranty
services on its fixed-price contracts related to providing customers with the ability to have any design flaws remedied and/or have our Company fix routine defects. The warranty services, as outlined in the respective
contracts, are provided for a specific period of time after a project is complete. The Company values the warranty services based upon historical labor hours incurred for similar services at standard billing rates. Revenue related to the warranty
provisions within our fixed-price contracts is recognized as the services are performed or the revenue is earned. The warranty period is typically short term or for a 30-60 day period after the project is complete. 
If our initial estimates of the resources required or the scope of work to be performed on a fixed-price contract are inaccurate, or we
do not manage the project properly within the planned time period; a provision for estimated losses on uncompleted projects is made. Any known or probable losses on projects are charged to operations in the period in which such losses are
determined. A formal project review process takes place quarterly, although most projects are evaluated on an ongoing basis. Management reviews the estimated total direct costs on each contract to determine if the estimated amounts are accurate, and
estimates are adjusted as needed in the period revised estimates are made. No losses were recognized on fixed-price contracts during the years ended December31, 2010, 2009 or 2008. 
Client prepayments, even if nonrefundable, are deferred classified as a liability and recognized over future periods as services are
performed. As of December31, 2010 and 2009, the Company has recorded a deferred liability of approximately $418 thousand and $809 thousand, respectively, which is included in the financial statement caption of deferred revenue and other
liabilities related to customer prepayments.

SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES Continued: 
Software revenue represents the resale of certain third-party off-the-shelf software and
maintenance and is recorded on a gross basis provided we act as a principal in the transaction, whereby we have credit risk and we set the price to the end user. In the event we do not meet the requirements to be considered a principal in the
software sale transaction and act as an agent, software revenue will be recorded on a net basis. Revenue from software resale arrangements represented 130%, 13% and 15% of total revenue for the years ended December31, 2010, 2009 and 2008,
respectively. The majority of the software sold by the Company is delivered electronically. For software that is delivered
electronically, we consider delivery to have occurred when the customer either atakes possession of the software via a download that is, when the customer takes possession of the electronic data on its hardware, or bhas been
provided with access codes that allow the customer to take immediate possession of the software on its hardware pursuant to an agreement or purchase order for the software. The Company enters into multiple element arrangements which typically include software, post-contract support or maintenance, and consulting services. Consistent with the software described above,
maintenance that is in the form of a pass through transaction, is recognized upon delivery of the software, as all related warranty and maintenance is performed by the primary software vendor and not the Company. Maintenance fee revenue for the
Companys software products, which is inconsequential in all years presented, is recognized ratably over the term of the arrangements, which are generally for a one-year period. The Company has established vendor specific objective evidence
VSOE with respect to the services provided, based on the price charged when the services are sold separately. The Company has established VSOE for maintenance based upon the stated renewal rate method. 
We consider amounts to be earned once evidence of an arrangement has been obtained, services are delivered, fees are fixed or
determinable and collectability is reasonably assured. We establish billing terms at the time at which the project deliverables and milestones are agreed. Our standard payment terms are 30 days from invoice date. Out-of-pocket reimbursable expenses
charged to customers are reflected as revenue. We receive royalty revenue in connection with the sale of Microsoft Dynamics
AX-related discrete and process manufacturing modules the Software Modules developed by Fullscope, which were subsequently sold to Microsoft in June 2009. Royalty revenues earned are determined as a percentage of net receipts from the
periodic sale of license keys and enhancements related to the Software Modules sold by Microsoft. Royalties are recognized as earned in accordance with the contract terms when royalties from licensees can be reasonably estimated and collectability
is reasonably assured. Allowance for Doubtful Accounts 
The Company maintains an allowance for doubtful accounts related to its accounts receivable that have been deemed to have a high risk of
collectability. Management reviews its accounts receivable balances on a monthly basis to determine if any receivables are potentially uncollectible. Management further analyzes historical collection trends and changes in its customer payment
patterns, customer concentration and credit worthiness when evaluating the adequacy of its allowance for doubtful accounts. The Company includes any accounts receivable balances that are deemed to be potentially uncollectible, along with a general
reserve, in its overall allowance for doubtful accounts. Based on the information available, management believes the allowance for doubtful accounts is adequate, however future write-offs could exceed the recorded allowance.

Cost of Services 
Our cost of services are comprised primarily of project personnel costs, including direct salaries, payroll taxes, employee benefits and
travel expenses for personnel dedicated to customer projects. These costs represent the most significant expense we incur in providing our services. Other Income, Net The following table represents the
components of other income, net:  Year EndedDecember31 2010 2009 2008 In Thousands Interest income 32 192 554 Interest expense 15 70 51 Gain on foreign exchange 17 Other income, net 34 122 503 Provision for Taxes In determining our current income tax provision, we assess temporary differences resulting from different treatments of items for tax and accounting purposes. These differences result in deferred tax
assets and liabilities, which are recorded in our consolidated balance sheets. We evaluate the realizability of our deferred tax assets and assess the need for a valuation allowance on an ongoing basis. In evaluating our deferred tax assets, we
consider whether it is more likely than not that the deferred income tax assets will be realized. The ultimate realization of our deferred tax assets depends upon generating sufficient future taxable income during the periods in which our temporary
differences either become deductible or expire. This assessment requires significant judgment. Any future changes in the
valuation allowance could result in additional income tax expense benefit and reduce or increase stockholders equity, and such changes could have a significant impact upon our earnings in the future. 
Income tax reserves are based on a determination of whether and how much of a tax benefit taken by the Company in its tax filings or
positions is more likely than not realized based on the technical merits of the tax position. Potential interest and penalties associated with such uncertain tax position is recorded as a component of the income tax provision.

Earnings Per Share 
Basic earnings per share reflect the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding during each period. Diluted earnings per share
reflect the impact, when dilutive, of the exercise of options using the treasury stock method. Following is a reconciliation of the shares used in computing basic and diluted earnings per share for the fiscal years ended December31, 2010,
2009, and 2008:  Year Ended December31 2010 2009 2008 In Thousands Shares used in computing basic earnings per share 12,195 12,067 12,861 Effect of dilutive share-based awards determined using the treasury stock method Stock options Restricted stock subject to vesting Shares used in computing diluted earnings per share 12,195 12,067 12,861 Stock options which the exercise price exceeds the average market price have an anti-dilutive effect on
earnings per share, and accordingly, are excluded from the diluted computations of earnings per share in each of the periods presented. Had such shares been included, the presented number of shares for the diluted computation would have increased by
approximately 15million, 42million and 29million in the years ended December31, 2010, 2009, and 2008, respectively. Options to purchase 34thousand, 12thousand and 206thousand shares of common stock that
were outstanding during the year ended December31, 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively, were not included in the computation of diluted net loss per share due to the reported periodic loss. Similarly, 9thousand shares of restricted stock
that were outstanding during the year ended December31, 2008 were not included in the computation of diluted net loss per share due to the reported periodic loss. No shares of restricted stock were included in the computation of diluted net
loss per share due to the reported periodic loss during the years ended December31, 2010, 2009 and 2008. Fair Value of Financial
Instruments Edgewaters financial instruments include cash and cash equivalents, restricted cash,
marketable securities, accounts receivable and accounts payable. The carrying values of cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable and accounts payable approximate their fair value due to the relatively short-term nature of the accounts.
Concentrations of Credit Risk Financial instruments that potentially subject the Company to significant concentration of market or credit risk consist principally of cash equivalent instruments, marketable securities and accounts
receivable. The Company places its cash balances with reputable financial institutions and investments are generally limited to 10% in any one financial instrument. Trade receivables potentially subject the Company to credit risk. The Company
extends credit to its customers based upon an evaluation of the customers financial condition and credit history and generally does not require collateral. The Company has historically incurred minimal credit losses.

The following table discloses individual customers with receivable balances in excess of
10% of the Companys accounts receivable at December 31, 2010 and 2009. December31 2010 2009 Accounts receivable Customer A 109
% For the years ended
December31, 2010, 2009, and 2008, no customer represented more that 10% of the Companys total service revenue. For the years ended December31, 2010, 2009, and 2008, our five largest customers represented 153%, 204%, and 262% of
our service revenue in the aggregate, respectively. Comprehensive Loss Income 
Comprehensive loss income consists of periodic currency translation adjustments and net unrealized gains losses on our
available-for-sale marketable securities. Share-Based Compensation 
We recognize as compensation expense the total fair value of share-based awards, over the requisite employee service period generally the
vesting period of the grant. We have used the Black-Scholes option-pricing model to compute the estimated fair value of stock option grants on the date of the award. The Black-Scholes option pricing model includes assumptions regarding dividend
yields, expected volatility, expected option term and risk-free interest rates. We estimate expected volatility based upon historical volatility. The risk-free interest rate is based on the U.S.Treasury yield curve in effect at the time of
grant. Restricted stock awards are valued at the price of our common stock on the date of the award. The assumptions used in
computing the fair value of share-based awards reflect our best estimates, but involve uncertainties relating to market and other conditions, many of which are outside of our control. As a result, if other assumptions or estimates had been used, the
share-based compensation expense that was recorded for the years ended December31, 2010, 2009, and 2008 could have been materially different. Furthermore, if different assumptions are used in future periods, share-based compensation expense
could be materially impacted in the future. Foreign Currency Translation 
The financial statements for Edgewaters non-U.S. operations use the local currency as the functional currency and are translated to
U.S. dollars. For assets and liabilities, the year-end rate is used. For revenues, expenses, gains and losses, the average rate for the period is used. Unrealized currency adjustments in our financial statements are accumulated in equity as a
component of accumulated other comprehensive income loss. Realized net gains losses on foreign currency transactions are immaterial and are reflected in earnings. Edgewaters non-U.S. operations are directly related to the Fullscope Acquisition and the May17, 2010 acquisition of Meridian Consulting International Meridianthe
Meridian Acquisition, which are more fully described in Note 4 of the notes to consolidated financial statements. Segment

FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS: 
We utilize the following valuation hierarchy for disclosure of the inputs to valuation used to measure fair value. This hierarchy
prioritizes the inputs into three broad levels as follows:  Level 1 inputs are quoted prices unadjusted in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.  Level 2 inputs are quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets or inputs that are observable for the asset or liability, either
directly or indirectly through market corroboration, for substantially the full term of the financial instrument.  Level 3 inputs are unobservable inputs based on our own assumptions used to measure assets and liabilities at fair value. 
A financial asset or liabilitys classification within the hierarchy is determined based on the lowest level input that is
significant to the fair value measurement. As of December31, 2010 and December31, 2009, the Companys only
financial assets and liabilities required to be measured on a recurring basis were its money market funds, marketable securities and the accrued contingent earnout consideration payable in connection with the Fullscope Acquisition and the Meridian
Acquisition, which are more fully described in Note 4. During 2009, we changed the classification of our marketable
securities from held-to-maturity to available-for-sale. Prior to this change, our marketable securities were reported at amortized cost. We changed the classification of our marketable securities as a result of our selling certain securities prior
to their maturity. The proceeds from the sale were used in connection with the funding of our acquisition of Fullscope, which is described in more detail in Note 4. At the time we changed our classification, our marketable securities had a fair
value of $68 million and we recognized an unrealized gain of $6 thousand at the time of transfer. As of December31,
2009, our marketable securities are classified as available-for-sale securities, which are recorded at fair value and consist of marketable instruments. The Company held no marketable securities as of December31, 2010.

BUSINESS COMBINATIONS: 
Acquisition of Meridian Consulting International:On May17, 2010, the Company acquired
substantially all of the assets and liabilities of Meridian, pursuant to the terms of an Asset Purchase Agreement the Meridian Acquisition. Headquartered in Chicago, Illinois, Meridian is a specialty solution provider of Oracles
Hyperion Strategic Finance product which encompasses strategic planning and forecasting, scenario modeling and mergers and acquisitions analysis. Meridian has delivered its services to organizations across various vertical markets including Energy,
Higher Education, Retail and Healthcare. The acquisition of Meridian continues the investment in our Enterprise Performance Management EPMrelated service offerings and aligns with our product-centric service offering model. The
addition of Meridians HSF capabilities strategically positions Edgewater as the only domestic company with the capability to provide the full suite of Oracles EPM service offerings. 
The Company has estimated total fair value of the purchase price consideration to be $28 million. The initial cash consideration paid at
close was $16 million. The cash paid at closing consisted of the $175 million purchase price less $164 thousand attributable to a net working capital adjustment. The initial cash consideration paid by the Company was increased by $12 million,
representing our adjusted fair value estimate of additional contingent earnout consideration that may be earned by the former stockholders of Meridian, which is described in more detail below. In addition to the above payments, the Company has
incurred approximately $392 thousand in direct transaction costs, which has been expensed as incurred.

BUSINESS COMBINATIONS Continued: 
An earnout agreement was entered into in connection with the Meridian Acquisition under
which the former Meridian stockholders are eligible to receive additional contingent consideration. Contingent earnout consideration to be paid, if any, to the former Meridian stockholders will be based upon the achievement of certain performance
measures over three consecutive twelve-month earnout periods, concluding on May17, 2013. We have recognized $100 thousand of expense, reported as a part of our selling, general and administrative expenses relating to the current fair value
assessment of the contingent earnout consideration payable to Meridians former stockholders. The maximum amount of contingent earnout consideration that can be earned by the former stockholders of Meridian is capped at $27 million.
Effective December31, 2010, the Meridian Measurement Period is complete. Subsequent adjustments to the original fair
value estimates will be reported as a periodic operating expense. The Company allocated the purchase price between assets,
liabilities and identified intangible assets based upon their estimated fair value.

Fullscope, Inc.In December2009, the Company acquired all the outstanding stock of Fullscope for approximately $151 million cash paid at closing increased by $12 million representing the fair value estimate of
additional contingent earnout consideration which may be earned by the former Fullscope stockholders. The Fullscope Acquisition provides Edgewater with ERP integration and related consulting service capabilities, discrete and process manufacturing
expertise and extends the reach of the Companys strategic data and analytics offerings into the upper middle market. An
earnout agreement was entered into in connection with the Fullscope Acquisition under which the former Fullscope stockholders are eligible to receive additional contingent consideration. Contingent earnout consideration to be paid, if any, to the
former Fullscope stockholders will be based upon the generation of positive, after-tax income, which will be determined, periodically, over an eighteen-month period from the date of acquisition and concluding on June30, 2011. The Company has

$713 thousand. The increase is attributable to the final true-up of excess net working capital delivered by Fullscope at the closing of the transaction; and  The Company has retrospectively adjusted the financial information for the year ended December31, 2009 for revisions of our purchase price
allocation in connection with the Fullscope acquisition. The adjustment related to a true-up of previously estimated income tax amounts in connection with the filing of Fullscopes 2009 federal and state tax returns. The adjustments resulted in
decreases to goodwill and accrued expenses of $157 thousand. The Company has presented the above purchase
price accounting-related adjustments in its consolidated balance sheets as if they had occurred as of December31, 2009.  5.
ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE: 
Included in accounts receivable are unbilled amounts totaling approximately $29 million and $18 million at December31, 2010 and
2009, respectively, which relate to services performed during the year and billed in the subsequent year. The Company maintains allowances for potential losses which management believes are adequate to absorb any probable losses to be incurred in

GOODWILL AND INTANGIBLE ASSETS Continued: 
Significant changes impacting the carrying value of goodwill during the year ended
December31, 2010 and 2009 included the following:  The Company increased the gross carrying value of goodwill by $21 million during the year ended December31, 2010 in connection with the Meridian
Acquisition. The Meridian Acquisition and the related fair value allocation of purchase price between assets, liabilities, intangible assets and goodwill is described further detail in Note 4.  The Company increased the gross carrying value of goodwill by $98 million during the year ended December31, 2009 in connection with the
Fullscope Acquisition. The Fullscope Acquisition and the related fair value allocation of purchase price between assets, liabilities, intangible assets and goodwill is described further detail in Note 4.  In September 2009, Lynx completed its second and final earnout period. Accordingly, the Company accrued and paid $140 thousand in contingent earnout
consideration to Lynx directly related to the completion of the second and final earnout period. The contingent earnout consideration, which was paid in cash during the fourth quarter of 2009, was recorded as an increase in goodwill in the
Companys consolidated balance sheet during the third quarter of 2009. As of December31, 2010,
the net carrying amount of intangible assets consists of amounts related to business combination transactions consummated by the Company from 2007 to 2010. These transactions include the Meridian, Fullscope, Vertical Pitch, Lynx, and Alecian
acquisitions. The Fullscope, Vertical Pitch, Lynx and Alecian transactions were completed prior to 2010 and are discussed in greater detail in the Companys previously filed reports with the SEC. 
Following the second quarter of 2008, as a result of the economic environment impacting our business and results and an overall decline
in billable consultant utilization coupled with a material decline of the Companys stock price since December of 2007, the Company determined that it had an impairment triggering event that would require an interim impairment evaluation of the
carrying value of its goodwill and intangible assets. Based upon the results of the impairment procedures performed, the Company recognized impairment charges of $235 million and $12 million related to goodwill and other intangible assets,
respectively during the second quarter of 2008. During the third quarter of 2008, the Company reviewed both its market
capitalization, as compared to book value of equity, and operating results, as compared to forecasts and projections, and did not identify the existence of a triggering event which would require a formal review of the carrying value of the goodwill
and intangible assets. Subsequently, on December2, 2008, in connection with the Companys annual review for
impairment the Annual Impairment Review, we determined that the carrying value of the Companys single reporting unit exceeded the estimated fair value of the reporting unit. As a result, we determined that the carrying value of
the Companys goodwill and intangible assets had become further impaired. The Annual Impairment Review procedures performed by the Company resulted in the recognition of additional 2008 impairment charges of $236 million and $02 million
during the fourth quarter of 2008 related to goodwill and other intangible assets, respectively.

included the following: Net Operating Loss Carryforwards and Credits:As of December31,
2010, we have tax effected net operating loss carryforwards for federal income tax purposes of approximately $236 million and alternative minimum, workers opportunity and foreign tax credits of approximately $21 million, which expire at
various intervals through 2030. However, $209 million of the Companys federal net operating loss carryforwards and $10 million of workers opportunity tax credits are set to expire in 2020. In addition, the Company has various tax effected
net operating loss carryforwards for state income tax purposes of approximately $15 million, which expire at various intervals through 2029. The Internal Revenue Code contains provisions that limit the amount of net operating loss and tax credit
carryforwards available to be used in any given year in the event of certain circumstances, including significant changes in ownership

interests. These limitations may result in the expiration of our historical net operating loss carryforwards and tax credits prior to their utilization. 
Acquired Intangible AssetsThe 2008 Impairment Charges generated an increase of $119 million in the gross
carrying value of the Companys deferred tax assets. The increase was directly related to the recognition of the future deductible temporary timing differences associated with the impairment of the tax deductible goodwill and intangible assets.
Additionally, the 2008 Impairment Charges also served to place the Company into a historical three-year cumulative loss position. As is our practice, the Company assessed the recoverability of our deferred tax assets on a more likely than not basis.
The review primarily centered upon the carrying value and future recoverability of the Companys federal net operating loss carryforwards and credits, a majority of which were set to expire on December31, 2020, and a consideration of
certain other alternative minimum and foreign tax credits. Fullscope Acquisition-Related Deferred Tax
Attributes:As discussed in Note 4, on December31, 2009, the Company acquired the outstanding stock of Fullscope, Inc. In connection with the Fullscope Acquisition, the Company assumed Fullscopes deferred tax
attributes as of the date of the acquisition. In connection with our initial fair value assessments of assets, liabilities, intangible assets and goodwill, the Company reviewed the carrying value of the acquired deferred tax attributes. Each of our
initial fair value assessments related to the Fullscope Acquisition were subject to subsequent adjustment as the Company obtained additional information the Fullscope Measurement Period. The Fullscope Measurement Period was completed
during the third quarter of 2010. The Company, in connection with the completion of the measurement period process, recognized gross deferred tax assets of $65 million. A significant portion of the deferred tax attributes assumed in connection with the acquisition are related to Fullscopes federal net operating loss carryforwards. Prior to the acquisition, the
federal net operating loss carryforwards were subject to Internal Revenue Code Section382 Limitations Section 382 Limitations. As a result of our acquisition, the future use of Fullscopes federal net operating loss
carryforwards will be subject to further Section382 Limitations. The Company, as part of its purchase accounting, applied a full valuation allowance against the gross carrying value of Fullscopes net operating loss carryforwards and the
other net deferred tax attributes due to uncertainty with respect to our ability to realize a future tax benefit related to these attributes. Additionally, in connection with the Fullscope Acquisition, the Company recorded a $18 million deferred tax liability, which served to reduce the carrying value of the Companys net deferred tax
assets as of December31, 2009. The Fullscope Acquisition was a stock purchase, and accordingly, the Company does not have a tax basis in the identified intangible assets recorded as part of the Fullscope Acquisition. The establishment of the
deferred tax liability resulted in an increase to the Companys goodwill asset. Annual changes to the deferred tax
valuation allowance are as follows:  Year Ended December31 2010 2009 2008 In Thousands Balance, beginning of year 17,492 11,021 4,579 Additions 21,881 9,890 Allowance reversals 269 Write-offs 3,179 Fullscope Acquisition 6,471 Balance, end of year 39,373 17,492 11,021

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS-Continued  8.
INCOME TAXES Continued: 
We have net deferred tax assets that have arisen primarily as a result of timing
differences, net operating loss carryforwards and tax credits. Our ability to realize a deferred tax asset is based on our ability to generate sufficient future taxable income within the applicable carryforward period and subject to any applicable
limitations. We assess, on a routine periodic basis, the estimated future realizability of the gross carrying value of our deferred tax assets on a more likely than not basis. Our periodic assessments take into consideration both positive evidence
future profitability projections for example and negative evidence recent and historical financial performance for example as it relates to evaluating the future recoverability of our deferred tax assets. 
During the third quarter of 2010, in connection with such a review, we recorded a non-cash charge of $219 million in connection with an
increase to the previously established valuation allowance recorded against the gross carrying value of our deferred tax assets. Subsequent to this adjustment, the recorded valuation allowance represents a full valuation reserve against the total
gross carrying value of our net deferred tax assets. Significant management judgment is required in determining our provision
for income taxes, our deferred tax assets and liabilities and any valuation allowance recorded against the deferred tax assets. The Companys historical financial performance and to a lesser extent, forecasts and projections were key
measurements utilized in our review. As of December31, 2009 and through the period ended June30, 2010 the Company recorded an income tax benefit. At those times management determined that the recovery of the deferred tax assets were
considered more likely than not, primarily due to positive evidence in the form of historical earnings adjusted for items of a non-recurring nature that would not be indicative of our future operations and projected taxable income. However, as a
result of operating loss in the current quarter ended September30, 2010, our assessment of our adjusted and cumulative loss positions, and uncertainty as to the timing of profitability in future periods, we recorded a full valuation allowance
against our deferred tax assets during the quarter ended September30, 2010 as we determined that it was not more than likely that the Company would be able to fully realize future economic benefit from its deferred tax assets. 
The establishment of a full valuation allowance against the gross carrying value of our net deferred tax assets does not prohibit or
limit the Companys ability to realize a tax benefit in future periods. All existing deferred tax assets, net operating loss carryforwards and credits will be fully available to reduce certain future federal and state income tax obligations.
During 2009, the Company weighed both positive projections and acquisition of Fullscope and negative recent financial
results evidence in assessing the recoverability of our deferred tax assets. Our judgment in assessing the evidence was that the negative and positive evidence were effectively offset and our valuation allowance levels were appropriate. 
During 2008, the Company recorded adjustments to its valuation allowance including a $99 million increase in the valuation allowance in
connection with managements estimate of the future realizability of federal net operating loss carryforwards and certain tax credits and a write-off of $32 million related to a 1999 foreign tax credit FTC.

EMPLOYEE BENEFIT PLANS: 
The Company has a 401k tax deferred savings plan that is available to all employees who satisfy certain minimum hour requirements each
year the Plan. The Company matches 30% of each participants annual contribution under the Plan, up to 6% of each participants annual base salary. Contributions by the Company to the plan were approximately $411 thousand 357 thousand and $437 thousand in each of the years ended December31, 2010, 2009, and 2008.  10.
EMPLOYEE SHARE-BASED COMPENSATION PLANS: Overview We recognize as compensation expense the total fair value of
share-based awards, over the requisite employee service period generally the vesting period of the grant. We have used the Black-Scholes option-pricing model to compute the estimated fair value of share-based awards on the date of grant. The
Black-Scholes option pricing model includes assumptions regarding dividend yields, expected volatility, expected option term and risk-free interest rates. We estimate expected volatility based upon a combination of historical and implied volatility.
The risk-free interest rate is based on the U.S.treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant. Share-Based
Compensation Plans The Company has four share-based compensation plans which are described below; the Amended and Restated
1996 Stock Option Plan 1996 Plan, the Amended and Restated 2000 Stock Option Plan 2000 Plan, the 2003 Equity Incentive Plan 2003 Plan, and the 2008 Omnibus Incentive Plan 2008 Plan,
collectively the Equity Plans. Specifics related to each plan are as follows: 1996 Plan: Grants for shares
under the 1996 Plan were limited to 15% of our Companys outstanding common stock. The only grants outstanding under the 1996 Plan are non-qualified stock option grants, with total qualified stock option grants under the 1996 Plan limited to
650,000 shares of the Companys common

stock. No grants of qualified stock options were ever issued under the 1996 Plan. The 1996 Plan expired on June30, 2006; thus, no further grants will be awarded after June30, 2006,
but options awarded prior to that date remain outstanding subject to the terms of the 1996 Plan and any related option agreements. 2000 Plan: The 2000 Plan provides for grants of non-qualified stock options of our Companys common stock. The 2000 Plan is limited to grants covering up to 40million shares of our
Companys common stock. 2003 Plan: The 2003 Plan provides for grants of non-qualified stock options and awards of
restricted shares of our Companys common stock. The 2003 Plan is limited to stock option grants and restricted stock awards covering up to 500,000 shares of our Companys common stock. 
2008 Plan: The 2008 Plan provides for a broad range of awards, including non-qualified stock options and awards of restricted
shares of our Companys common stock. The 2008 Plan authorizes the issuance of 15million shares of our Companys common stock plus certain authorized awards or shares under other Company share-based compensation plans to the extent
the awards or shares are not utilized or forfeited. The 2008 Plan became effective on June11, 2008. As of
December31, 2010, there are 577,285, 18,950 and 907,182 shares available for future grant under the 2000 Plan, 2003 Plan and 2008 Plan, respectively. No shares were available for issuance under the 1996 Plan, as it expired on June30,
2006. Option Plans Excluding Restricted Share Awards 
The Companys Equity Plans authorize the granting of qualified and non-qualified stock options to officers, employees and certain
persons who are not employees on the date of grant, including certain non-employee members of the Board of Directors. All such options are for shares of the Companys common stock. 
The Equity Plans provide that the exercise price of the stock options will be determined based upon the fair market value of the
Companys common stock on the NASDAQ Global Market System as of the date of grant. Options granted to officers and employees generally vest in three, four or five year periods, dependent upon the plan or award, and expire on the seventh
anniversary of the grant date. Annual options granted to non-employee members of the Companys Board of Directors generally vest in equal quarterly increments and expire on the fifth anniversary of the grant date, and option grants issued upon
their initial election to the Companys Board of Directors vest in equal one-third increments as of the date of grant and the first and second anniversary of the date of grant. 
During the year ended December31, 2010, the Company granted 578,287 stock options excluding issuances of restricted share awards
issued under either the 2000 Plan or the 2008 Plan, principally as part of a long term incentive program and in connection with the Companys Board of Director compensation program. The fair value of each option award is estimated on the date
of grant using the Black-Scholes option pricing model utilizing the assumptions noted in the following table. Expected volatility is based upon historical volatility of the Companys common stock. The expected life period of time the award
will be outstanding was estimated using the historical exercise behavior of the Companys employees. The risk-free interest rate is based on the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant. The Company applied an estimated
forfeiture rate of 265% to the calculated fair value of each option. The applied forfeiture rate utilized by the Company was based upon the historical forfeiture experience of the Equity Plans.

Restricted share awards are made at prices determined by the Compensation Committee of the Companys Board of Directors the Compensation Committee and are compensatory in
nature. Employees granted restricted share awards are required to provide consideration for the shares at the share price set by the Compensation Committee, which historically has equaled the par value per share the Companys common stock
$001 per share. Shares of restricted stock generally vest over a five-year period, during which time the Company has the right to repurchase any unvested shares at the amount paid if the relationship between the employee and the Company ceases.
As of December31, 2010, 55,470 restricted share awards were subject to repurchase by the Company under the restricted stock agreements. The Company records compensation expense related to restricted share awards on a straight-line basis over
the vesting term of the award. During the year ended December31, 2010, the Company issued 30,000 restricted share

EMPLOYEE SHARE-BASED COMPENSATION PLANS Continued: 
The ESPP Plans offer eligible employees the option to purchase the Companys Common

months. The amount each employee can purchase is limited to the lesser of i10% of an employees annual base salary or ii$25,000 of stock value on an annual basis. The ESPP is designed to qualify for certain tax benefits for
employees under section 423 of the Internal Revenue Code. During the year ended December31, 2010, 2009, and 2008, the
Company issued 199,144, 179,901 and 143,949 shares, respectively, to employees under the ESPP Plans. The fair value of each
ESPP offering was estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option pricing model that uses the weighted-average assumptions noted in the following table. The risk-free interest rate is based on the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect at
the time of grant. Expected volatility was based on historical volatility.  YearEndingDecember31 2010 2009 2008 Expected volatility 327 745 394 Expected dividend yield Expected life in years 025 025 025 Risk-free interest rate 01 01 18

CAPITAL STOCK: Common and Preferred
Stock  The Companys stockholders had authorized 480million shares of common stock available for
issuance as of December31, 2010 and 2009, and had 20million shares of preferred stock available for issuance as of December31, 2010 and 2009. Stockholder Rights Plan  The Company had a stockholder rights plan,
commonly referred to as a poison pill, intended to discourage an attempt to obtain control by means of a tender offer, merger, proxy contest or otherwise. Under the plan, our Board of Directors could have issued preferred stock in one or
more series without stockholder action. If a person acquired 20% or more of our outstanding shares of common stock, except for certain institutional stockholders, who may acquire up to 25% of our outstanding shares of common stock, then rights under
this plan would have been triggered, which would have significantly diluted the voting rights of any such acquiring person. The Companys stockholder rights plan expired in August 2010. No preferred stock was issued under the stockholder rights
plan. Certain provisions of the General Corporation Law of Delaware may also discourage someone from acquiring or merging
with us. Stock Repurchase Program  In December 2007, our Board of Directors the Board authorized a stock repurchase program for up to $50 million of common stock on the open market or through privately negotiated
transactions from time-to-time through December31, 2008 the Stock Repurchase Program. In September 2008, the Board authorized both an increase to and an extension of the Stock Repurchase Program. The Board increased the maximum
dollar value of shares to be purchased under the Stock Repurchase Program by $35 million, to a total of $85 million and extended the period during which purchases could be made from December31, 2008 to September24, 2009 the
Repurchase Period. On September23, 2009 and September24, 2010, the Board authorized extensions of the Repurchase Period to September23, 2010 and September23, 2011, respectively, while maintaining the Stock
Repurchase Programs cumulative maximum dollar repurchase limitation. The timing and amount of the purchases will be
based upon market conditions, securities law considerations and other factors. The Stock Repurchase Program does not obligate the Company to acquire a specific number of shares in any period and may be modified, suspended, extended or discontinued
at any time, without prior notice. The Company has repurchased a total of 1,548,449 shares of common stock since the
inception of the Stock Repurchase Program at an aggregate purchase price of $57 million.  12.

COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES: Commitments. We have lease financing arrangements the Capital Lease Arrangements with a bank related to certain property and equipment, as further described in Note 6. Payments under
the Capital Lease Arrangements are to be made over a period of 48 to 60 months and have a blended interest rate of 603%per annum on the outstanding principal balances. As of December31, 2010 and 2009, our outstanding obligations under
the Capital Lease Arrangements totaled $200 thousand, $420 thousand, respectively. During the year ended December31, 2010, 2009 and 2008, the Company made payments of principal and interest totaling $215 thousand, $251 thousand and $251
thousand, respectively, under the Capital Lease Arrangements. We lease office space and certain equipment under capital and
operating leases that expire at various times through 2016. Annual future minimum lease payments required under capital leases, together with the present value of such payments, and future minimum lease payments required under operating leases that
have initial or remaining non-cancelable lease terms in excess of one year as of December31, 2010, were as follows:  Year Ending December31 CapitalLeases OperatingLeases In Thousands 2011 158 1,588 2012 53 1,349 2013 1,258 2014 1,331 2015 1,331 Thereafter 998 211 7,855 Less amounts representing interest 11 200 Rent payments under operating leases were $16 million, $17 million, and $19 million for the
years ended December31, 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively. Contingencies. We are sometimes a party to litigation
incidental to our business. We believe that these routine legal proceedings will not have a material adverse effect on our financial position. We maintain insurance in amounts with coverages and deductibles that we believe are reasonable. However,
there can be no assurance that such coverages will continue to be available on reasonable terms or will be available in sufficient amounts to cover possible claims that may arise in the future, or that our insurers will not disclaim coverage as to
any future claim. The successful assertion of one or more claims against the Company that exceed available insurance coverages or changes in the Companys insurance policies, including premium increases or the imposition of a large deductible
or co-insurance requirements, would have a material adverse effect on the Companys business, results of operations and financial condition. The Company had approximately $361 thousand and $282 thousand of unrecognized tax benefits, penalties and interest expense related to uncertain tax positions as of December31, 2010 and 2009,
respectively. During the fourth quarter of 2010, in connection with our review of the impact of the discovered embezzlement
activity upon Fullscopes historical financial statements, the Company recorded a $950 thousand liability associated with potential pre-acquisition sales and use tax obligations. The potential sales and use tax-related liability was created by
the methods employed by a former employee of Fullscope to conceal the

fraudulent activity. The Company believes that this amount is recoverable from an existing escrow account established at the time of the acquisition as it qualifies as an undisclosed liability at
the time of our acquisition of Fullscope. The Company has accounted for this pre-acquisition liability as a period expense. Any amounts actually paid to settle this liability may be recoverable from an existing, fully funded escrow account which was
established in connection with our acquisition of Fullscope. Future amounts recovered, if any, will be recorded by the Company in the period in which they are determined to be probable of recovery from escrow. 14.
