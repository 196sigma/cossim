NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS NOTE 1 SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS ADFlex Solutions, Inc. the Company is a worldwide
provider of flexible circuit interconnect solutions to original equipment
manufacturers in the electronics industry. The Company offers customized
flexible circuit applications and services from initial design, development and
prototype to fabrication, assembly and test on a global basis. The Company
targets high-volume markets where miniaturization, form and weight are driving
factors and flexible circuits are an enabling technology. Applications for
flexible circuits currently addressed by the Company include notebook computers,
portable communication devices such as cellular telephones and pagers, data
storage devices such as hard disk drives, tape drives and arrays, and high-end
consumer electronics products such as compact disk players. The Company serves
customers located in North America, Europe and Southeast Asia.
BASIS OF PRESENTATION
The accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared on the
basis that the Company will continue as a going concern. The Company has failed
to meet certain provisions of its credit agreement in February 1999 and expects
to fail to meet another covenant at March 31, 1999. These conditions raise
substantial doubt about the Company ability to continue as a going concern.
The accompanying 1998 consolidated financial statements do not include any
adjustments to reflect the possible future effects on the recoverability and
classification of assets or the amounts and classification of liabilities that
may result from the outcome of this uncertainty.
Management is currently negotiating with funding sources to provide additional
capital to the Company. In addition, management of the Company has met with the
lenders in an attempt to restructure the credit facility, or otherwise
satisfactorily resolve the existing defaults. It is not possible, however, to
predict at this time the success of management efforts. No assurance can be
given that the outcome of the Company negotiating efforts with the lenders
will not adversely affect the Company business, financial condition, results
of operations and cash flows.
PRINCIPLES OF CONSOLIDATION The accompanying consolidated financial statements
include the accounts of the Company and its subsidiaries. All intercompany
accounts and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.
On August 27, 1996, the Company announced the establishment of a joint venture
with Hana Microelectronics Hana, a diversified electronics manufacturer
headquartered in Thailand, to produce and test advanced chip-on-flex and surface
mount technology assemblies. The venture, ADFlex Thailand Limited ATL, was 80%
owned by the Company. On September 26, 1997, the Company acquired the 20%
interest held by Hana See Note 3. Hana 20% interest in ATL earnings
through September 26, 1997 have been reflected as Minority interest in earnings
of consolidated joint venture on the Company Consolidated Statements of
Operations.
FISCAL YEAR The Company fiscal year consists of 52 or 53 weeks ending on the
Sunday closest to the last day of December each year. Fiscal year 1998 contained
52 weeks and ended December 27, 1998. Fiscal years 1997 and 1996 contained 52
weeks each and ended on December 28 and December 29, respectively. Activity from
the end of the reporting period to December 31 is immaterial for 1997 and 1996.
FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSLATION The Company uses the United States Dollar as its
functional currency for its subsidiaries in Mexico, England and Thailand.
Remeasurement gains and losses, resulting from the process of remeasuring the
financial statements of these foreign subsidiaries into U.S. Dollars, are
included in operations. To date, the effect on income of remeasurement gains and
losses has been immaterial.
FOREIGN EXCHANGE INSTRUMENTS The Company enters into short-term forward foreign
currency exchange contracts in the regular course of business to manage its
exposure against foreign currency fluctuations, primarily relating to
nonfunctional currency monetary assets and liabilities. The forward exchange
contracts generally require the                     33
34
Company to exchange U.S. Dollars for foreign currencies at maturity, at rates
agreed to at inception of the contracts. The gains or losses on hedges of
transaction exposure are included in income in the period in which the exchange
rates change. The gains and losses on unhedged foreign currency transactions are
included in income. At December 27, 1998, there were no open forward foreign
currency exchange contracts.
CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS Cash and cash equivalents include demand deposits,
money market accounts and repurchase agreements since they represent highly
liquid investments with maturities of three months or less when purchased.
CONCENTRATION OF CREDIT RISK Financial instruments, which potentially subject
the Company to concentration of credit risk, consist principally of trade
receivables. A majority of the Company trade receivables are derived from
sales in various geographic areas to large companies within the electronics
industry.
The Company has adopted credit policies and standards to accommodate the
electronics industry growth and inherent risk. The Company performs ongoing
credit evaluations of its customers' financial condition but generally does not
require collateral, such as letters of credit or security agreements.
INVENTORIES Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market. Cost is
computed on a currently adjusted standard basis which approximates actual cost
on a first-in, first-out basis.
PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT Property, plant and equipment are stated at cost
less accumulated depreciation and amortization. Depreciation and amortization is
computed for financial reporting purposes using the straight-line method over
the estimated useful lives of the assets which range from three to 25 years. The
Company uses accelerated methods for computing depreciation for tax purposes.
INTANGIBLE ASSETS In connection with the acquisition of Hana 20% interest in
ATL in September 1997, the Company recorded goodwill which is being amortized
over its estimated useful life of five years.
The recoverability of intangible assets attributable to the Company
acquisitions is analyzed periodically based on actual and projected levels of
profitability and cash flows of the operations acquired on an undiscounted
basis. Based on its most recent analysis, the Company believes that no material
impairment of intangible assets exists at December 27, 1998.
REVENUE RECOGNITION Sales are recognized upon shipment. The Company warrants its
products to be free of defects and repairs customer shipments as required. The
Company records a provision for the estimated cost of repairing returns at the
time of shipment.
FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS Cash and cash equivalents, accounts
receivable, borrowings under the Company line of credit, notes payable,
accounts payable, accrued liabilities and capitalized leases are carried at
amounts that reasonably approximate their fair values. The Company long-term
debt bears interest at a variable interest rate which approximates current
market interest rates; therefore, the Company believes that long-term debt
approximates its fair value. The fair value of short-term foreign exchange
contracts is based on exchange rates at the end of the fiscal year.
IMPAIRMENT OF LONG-LIVED ASSETS The Company reviews long-lived assets and
certain identifiable intangibles to be held and used or disposed of for
impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the
carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. The Company recognized a
charge in 1996 in connection with the restructuring of its U.K. operations see
Note 2.
USE OF ESTIMATES The preparation of financial statements in conformity with
generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates
and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and
accompanying notes. Actual results could differ from those estimates.
RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT Research and development costs are expensed as
incurred.                    34
35
INCOME TAXES Income taxes are provided using the liability method based upon the
provisions of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards SFAS No. 109,
Accounting for Income Taxes.
STOCK BASED COMPENSATION The Company grants stock options for a fixed number of
shares to employees with an exercise price equal to the fair value of the shares
at the date of grant. The Company accounts for employee stock option grants in
accordance with APB Opinion 25 APB 25, Accounting for Stock Issued to
Employees, and accordingly, recognizes no compensation expense for stock option
grants.
IMPACT OF RECENTLY ISSUED ACCOUNTING STANDARDS In March 1998, the American
Institute of Certified Public Accountants issued Statement of Position SOP
98-1, Accounting for the Costs of Computer Software Developed for or Obtained
for Internal-Use, which requires the capitalization of certain costs incurred in
connection with developing or obtaining computer software. The Company elected
to adopt SOP 98-1 effective January 1, 1998 in connection with the purchase of a
manufacturing cost control system. Capitalized costs of $54 million are being
amortized on a straight-line basis over a period of five years after completion
of the project in October 1998.
NET INCOME LOSS PER SHARE In February, 1997, the Financial Accounting
Standards Board FASB issued SFAS No. 128, Earnings per Share. SFAS No. 128
replaced the calculation of primary and fully diluted earnings per share with
basic and diluted earnings per share. Unlike primary earnings per share, basic
earnings per share excludes any dilutive effects of options, warrants and
convertible securities. Diluted earnings per share is very similar to the
previously reported fully diluted earnings per share. All earnings per share
amounts for all periods have been presented, and where appropriate, restated to
conform to the SFAS No. 128 requirements. The difference in common equivalent
shares used in the computation of basic and diluted earnings per share is
primarily due to the inclusion of stock options in the dilutive computations,
unless they were anti-dilutive.
COMPREHENSIVE INCOME In June 1997, the FASB issued SFAS No. 130, Reporting
Comprehensive Income, which establishes standards for reporting and displaying
comprehensive income components in a full set of general-purpose financial
statements. Comprehensive income includes certain non-owner changes in equity
that are currently excluded from net income for certain companies. Because the
Company historically has not experienced transactions which would be included in
comprehensive income, adoption of SFAS 130 did not have a material effect on the
consolidated financial position or results of operations or cash flows of the
Company.
SEGMENT REPORTING In June 1997, the FASB issued SFAS No. 131, Disclosures about
Segments of an Enterprise and Related Information, which revises disclosure
requirements about operating segments and establishes standards for related
disclosures about products and services, geographic areas and major customers.
SFAS No. 131 requires that public business enterprises report financial and
descriptive information about their reportable operating segments. The Company
operates in one business segment which is the manufacture and sale of flexible
circuit interconnect solutions. Financial information is summarized by
geographic area see Note 15.
PRIOR PERIOD RECLASSIFICATION Certain prior period amounts have been
reclassified to conform to the current presentation.
NOTE 2 ADFLEX U.K.
On September 29, 1996, the Company Board of Directors approved a plan
to restructure, over the next twelve months, the Company assembly operation in
the U.K., and during that time period, transfer production from the U.K. to the
Company manufacturing facility in Thailand. Accordingly, the Company recorded
the following: $135 million write-off of intangible assets, $88 million
write-down of property, plant and equipment, $25 million in lease termination
charges and $44 million in employee termination costs for 507 direct labor,
technical and administrative employees. As of December 31, 1996, $03 million of
the employee termination charges related to 13 employees had been paid and
charged against the liability. As of December 31, 1997, production has ceased at
the U.K. facility. During the year ended December 31, 1997, the Company paid and
charged to the liability $55 million related to termination costs for 124
employees and lease termination costs. In addition, the Company reallocated $08
million of the reserve for employee and lease termination costs to be used                     35
36
for additional write-down of property, plant and equipment. During the year
ended December 27, 1998, the Company paid and charged to the liability $02
million related to termination costs for 3 employees and lease termination
costs. The remaining accrual for employee termination costs is approximately
$01 million and the Company believes it is adequate to cover the remaining
liabilities. Total revenue and total operating loss related to this operation
for the year ended December 27, 1998 was $25 million and $20 million,
respectively. Total revenue and operating loss related to this operation for the
year ended December 31, 1997 was $384 million and $05 million, respectively.
Subsequent to the restructuring, the Company maintains a technology development
center and a sales and service organization in the U.K. to support its European
customers.
NOTE 3 ADFLEX THAILAND
In an effort to increase its global sourcing opportunities and to
decrease its operating costs, the Company established a joint venture, ATL,
located in Lamphun, Thailand with Hana in August 1996. On September 26, 1997,
the Company increased its ownership in ATL from 80% to 100% through the purchase
of Hana 20% equity interest. Under the terms of the Equity Purchase Agreement,
the Company paid $05 million at closing and issued a note in the principal
amount of $10 million and agreed to pay $13 million at various dates through
December 31, 1998 in connection with the acquisition of Hana 20% interest in
ATL. The Company remitted $22 million during the year ended December 27, 1998.
Funding for this payment came from the Company line of credit. At December 27,
1998, $01 million was outstanding under the note. Goodwill related to the
excess purchase price over fair value of the net tangible assets acquired of
$19 million, net of accumulated amortization of $05 million at December 27,
1998, is being amortized on a straight-line basis over five years.
NOTE 4 SPECIAL CHARGES
During the year ended December 27, 1998, the Company implemented new
cost and productivity improvement measures designed to address current adverse
industry trends such as intense price competition from Asian suppliers and
decreased demand by certain customers supplying the personal computer markets -
in particular the hard disk drive HDD segment. These actions included the
consolidation of administrative functions, a 27% reduction in staffing, the
closing of two manufacturing plants in Mexico and the transfer of selected
manufacturing programs from Mexico to Thailand. As a result, the Company
incurred a special charge of approximately $16 million: $10 million related to
the workforce reduction and $06 million related to employee severance and
termination costs associated with the closing of the two plants in Mexico.
During the year ended December 27, 1998, the Company paid and charged to the
liability $06 million related to employee severance and lease termination costs
and $05 million related to workforce reduction involving 97 employees at its
Chandler facility, 5 employees at its U.K. facility and 77 employees at its
Mexico facility. The remaining accrual related to workforce reduction is
approximately $05 million and the Company believes it is adequate to cover the
remaining liabilities.

NOTE 8 LINE OF CREDIT AND LONG-TERM DEBT
On June 5, 1997, the Company entered into a new credit facility
arranged by BancBoston Securities, Inc., which included a number of banks as
lenders. The credit facility consisted of a $200 million, three-year revolving
line of credit and a $250 million, five-year term loan. Under the terms of the
credit facility, any outstanding balance bears interest at BankBoston,
prime interest rate or LIBOR plus an applicable margin ranging from 15% to
225% based on the Company achieving certain financial objectives at the end of
each quarter. At December 31, 1997, $250 million was outstanding under the term
loan and $70 million was outstanding under the revolving line of credit. The
weighted average interest rate at December 31, 1997 for the revolving line of
credit was 85%.
In February 1998, the Company amended its existing credit facility to
more adequately meet its working capital requirements by increasing the existing
revolving line of credit from $200 million to $250 million. In addition, the
existing $250 million term loan was replaced with a $350 million term loan. In
July 1998, the Company reevaluated its financial needs and determined that
credit facility commitments of a $200 million revolving line of credit and a
$300 million term loan were sufficient to meet its liquidity requirements.
Accordingly, the Company canceled $100 million of existing credit facility
commitments, $50 million relating to the revolving line of credit and $50
million relating to the term loan.
On October 30, 1998, the Company amended its existing credit facility
to revise certain financial covenants, reduce the term loan by $100 million and
revise the debt amortization schedule. Upon closing of the third amendment, the
$300 million term loan was reduced by $50 million to $250 million from
borrowings from the Company revolving line of credit. The amendment required a
$50 million principal payment no later than January 20, 1999 which was timely
remitted, plus four equal principal payments of $08 million each quarter
beginning with the quarter ending December 31, 1998 through the quarter ending
September 30, 1999, increasing to twelve equal principal payments of $13
million each quarter thereafter with the last payment due December 31,                     37
38
2002. Borrowing under the line of credit is limited to 80% of the aggregate
value of all eligible domestic accounts receivable plus 70% of the aggregate
value of all eligible foreign accounts receivable. Under the terms of the credit
facility, any outstanding balance bears interest at a Base Rate which is defined
as BankBoston N.A. prime rate plus 050% or LIBOR plus an applicable margin
ranging from 150% to 225%, based on the Company achieving certain financial
objectives at the end of each quarter. The credit facility is secured by all
assets of the Company and a pledge by the Company of 66 2/3% of the stock of its
subsidiaries. Under the third amendment to the credit agreement, the Company is
required to meet certain minimum revenue and profitability covenants, maintain
certain financial ratios and meet certain net worth and indebtedness tests for
which the Company was in compliance at December 27, 1998. The amended credit
facility prohibits the payment of dividends. In connection with the third
amendment, the Company issued to its lenders a warrant to purchase an aggregate
of 50,000 shares of Common Stock at an exercise price of $500 per share. The
warrant vested on March 14, 1999 subject to certain conditions and terminates
if not sooner exercised on December 29, 2002. The Company also granted to the
lenders certain customary demand and piggyback registration rights in connection
with the warrant. At December 27, 1998, $246 million was outstanding under the
term loan and $130 million was outstanding under the revolving line of credit.
The weighted average interest rate at December 27, 1998 for the revolving line
of credit was 86%.
During February 1999, the Company failed to meet certain financial
covenants of the credit agreement discussed above and expects to fail to meet
another covenant at March 31, 1999. The lenders have rights to exercise certain
remedies under the agreement but have not chosen to do so to date. In accordance
with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 78, Classification of
Obligations That Are Callable by the Creditor, the Company has classified all of
the outstanding balance under the credit agreement as a current liability.
Management of the Company has met with the lenders in an attempt to restructure
the credit facility, or otherwise satisfactorily resolve the defaults. It is not
possible, however, to predict at this time the success of management efforts.
No assurance can be given that the outcome of the Company negotiating efforts
with the lenders will not adversely affect the Company business, financial
condition, results of operations and cash flows.

NOTE 10 COMMON STOCK AND EQUITY
PREFERRED STOCK The Company certificate of incorporation authorizes the
issuance of 10 million shares of preferred stock, at $01 par value,
undesignated as to powers, preferences, rights, limitations or restrictions. As
of December 27, 1998, no shares of preferred stock have been issued.
COMMON STOCK The number of shares of Common Stock reserved for future issuance
at December 27, 1998, was as follows  
Employee and director stock options outstanding                               896,122
Reserved for future grants under the 1994 Stock Incentive Plan                        7,615
1994 director stock options outstanding                                   36,000
Reserved for issuance under the Employee Stock Purchase Plan                        172,982
1998 outstanding warrants, exercisable March 14, 1999                            50,000
- 
Total reserved for future issuance                                    1,162,719
-  In conjunction with the ADFlex U.K. acquisition, the Company issued 1,242,347
shares of restricted Common Stock. The holder agreed not to sell or otherwise
dispose of the shares for a two year period, which ended in January 1998.
In October 1998, in connection with the third amendment to the credit facility
see Note 8, the Company issued to its lenders a warrant to purchase an
aggregate of 50,000 shares of Common Stock at an exercise price of $500 per
share. The warrant vested on March 14, 1999 subject to certain conditions and
terminates if not sooner exercised on December 29, 2002. The Company also
granted to the lenders certain customary demand and piggyback registration
rights in connection with the warrant.
STOCK OPTION PLANS The Company has elected to follow APB No. 25, Accounting for
Stock Issued to Employees, in accounting for its employee stock options because,
as discussed below, the alternative fair value accounting provided for under
SFAS No. 123, Accounting and Disclosure of Stock-Based Compensation, requires
the use of option valuation models that were not developed for use in valuing
employee stock options. Under APB 25, because the exercise price of the
Company employee stock options equals the market price of the underlying stock
on the date of grant, no compensation expense is recognized.
Under the Company 1993 Equity Incentive Plan 1993 Plan adopted June 29,
1993, qualified employees received options to purchase 599,000 shares of Common
Stock. The options granted under this Plan were to vest over approximately four
years, but automatically vested at the time of the Company initial public
offering on September 27, 1994. The remaining shares available for grant under
the 1993 Plan have been eliminated.
Under the 1994 Stock Incentive Plan 1994 Plan, qualified employees may receive
options to purchase the Company common stock. The number of shares of Common
Stock available for issuance in any year under the Plan is equal to 3% of the
outstanding shares of Common Stock each January 1 during the term of the Plan.
In 1998, 263,054 shares were reserved for issuance. As part of the same
amendment, the stockholders approved an automatic grant to eligible non-employee
directors of an option to acquire 12,000 shares of Common Stock upon such
directors' initial election to the Company Board of Directors and 3,000 shares
of Common Stock each year thereafter. Options granted to employees to date under
the 1994 Plan vest over a four year period from either the date of grant or one
year from the date of grant, and automatic options granted to directors vest
over a three year period from the date of grant.
On July 2, 1997, the Company canceled 92,250 options held by certain employees
issued under the 1994 Plan with an exercise price per share of $2725 and
granted 92,250 options with an exercise price per share of $1488 to the same
employees. The new options started a new vesting schedule over a four-year
period from the new date of grant. On June 22, 1998, the Company canceled
336,500 outstanding options granted on June 3, 1997, October 1, 1997 and April
7, 1998 with an original exercise price of $1550, $22063 and $17063 per
share, respectively and approved the regrant and replacement of these options
with new options at an exercise price per share of $850, the fair market value
of the Company Common Stock on the date of the Company determination. The
new options vest over a four-year period from the new date of grant.
Pro forma information regarding net income and earnings per share is required by
SFAS No. 123, and has been                     39
40
determined as if the Company had accounted for its employee stock options under
the fair value method of that Statement. The fair value for these options was
estimated at the date of grant using a Black-Scholes pricing model with the
following weighted-average assumptions for 1998: risk-free interest rates of
442%, dividend yields of 0%, volatility factor of the expected market price of
the Company Common Stock of 871 and a weighted-average expected life of the
option of 5 years. The assumptions used in 1997 were: risk-free interest rates
of 524%, dividend yields of 0%, volatility factor of the expected market price
of the Company Common Stock of 644 and a weighted-average expected life of
the option of 5 years. The assumptions used in 1996 were: risk-free interest
rates of 628%, dividend yields of 0%, volatility factor of the expected market
price of the Company Common Stock of 684 and a weighted-average expected life
of the option of 5 years.
The Black-Scholes option valuation model was developed for use in estimating the
fair value of traded options which have no vesting restrictions and are fully
transferable. In addition, option valuation models require the input of highly
subjective assumptions including the expected stock price volatility. Because
the Company employee stock options have characteristics significantly
different from those of traded options, and because changes in the subjective
input assumptions can materially affect the fair value estimate, in management
opinion, the existing models do not necessarily provide a reliable single
measure of the fair value of the Company employee stock options.
For purposes of pro forma disclosures, the estimated fair value of the options
is amortized to expense over the options' vesting period. The Company pro
forma information follows in thousands, except per share amounts                                          Years ended

EMPLOYEE STOCK PURCHASE PLAN On June 2, 1994, the Company adopted and the
stockholders approved the 1994 Employee Stock Purchase Plan the Purchase Plan
and the Company reserved 200,000 shares of Common Stock for sale to employees.
The Purchase Plan became effective upon the Company initial public offering.
On April 22, 1997, the Company adopted and the stockholders approved an

shares purchasable upon exercise of the right will not be redeemable. Each
Preferred Share will be entitled to an aggregate dividend of 100 times the
dividend declared per share of Common Stock. Preferred shares will have 100
votes.                    41

Management has concluded that no valuation allowance is required based on its
assessment that future levels of taxable income will, more likely than not, be
sufficient to realize the tax benefits.
At December 27, 1998, the Company has a federal and state net operating loss of
$95 million and $40 million, respectively, which are available for carryover
to future periods. The federal net operating loss begins expiring in the year
2019 while the state net operating loss begins expiring in 2003. In addition,
the Company has $04 million of alternative minimum tax credit carryovers at
December 27, 1998 which do not expire.
The Internal Revenue Service IRS has concluded a field audit of the Company
income tax returns for the tax year 1993. In connection with this audit, the IRS
issued a 90-day letter in January 1998 proposing adjustments to the Company
income and tax credits for the year, which would result in an additional
assessment of $16 million, excluding interest. The major proposed adjustment,
which relates to the allocation of the purchase price of assets obtained from
Rogers Corporation Rogers pursuant to acquisition agreements between the
Company and Rogers, would extend the period over which the tax benefit for the
purchase price would be recovered. The Company and the IRS have reached a
tentative agreement to settle all outstanding issues relating to this audit. The
terms of the agreement would require a payment of approximately $06 million,
excluding interest, most of which will be recoverable by amending subsequent
years' tax returns. The Company believes that the current tax provision is
adequate to cover the estimated liability and the final disposition of these
matters will not have a material adverse effect on the Company business,
financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.
Pre-tax income loss from foreign operations was $18 million, $32 million and
$388 million for the years ended December 27, 1998 and December 31, 1997 and
1996, respectively. The residual United States tax liability for unremitted
foreign earnings is immaterial.     NOTE 14 COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES
LEASE COMMITMENTS The Company leases its facilities and equipment under capital
and operating leases which expire at various dates through January 15, 2008. As
of December 27, 1998, the future minimum lease commitments under these leases

respectively. At December 27, 1998 and December 31, 1997, the Company had
capitalized $08 million and $07 million, respectively, related to assets
acquired under capitalized lease agreements in the accompanying balance sheet.
ENVIRONMENTAL REMEDIATION CONTINGENCY The nature of the Company business
exposes the Company to potential environmental remediation liabilities arising
from the manufacture, use and disposal of hazardous materials used to
manufacture flex interconnect products. Management believes that any cost
associated with maintaining the Company compliance with current environmental
remediation laws will not have a material adverse effect on the Company
financial statements.
MEXICAN UNION RELATIONS At December 27, 1998, 1,990 of the Company employees
located in Mexico were represented by a labor union and covered by a collective
bargaining agreement expiring December 31, 1999 that is subject to revision
annually under Mexican labor laws. The Company has not experienced any
employee                    43
44
related work stoppage and believes that its relationship with its union and
other employees is good, but there can be no assurance that the Company will be
able to successfully negotiate with the labor union in the future.

REPORT OF ERNST & YOUNG LLP, INDEPENDENT AUDITORS     The Stockholders and Board of Directors of ADFlex Solutions, Inc.
We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of ADFlex
Solutions, Inc. the Company at December 27, 1998 and December 31, 1997, and
the related consolidated statements of operations, equity and cash flows for
each of the three years in the period ended December 27, 1998. These financial
statements are the responsibility of the Company management. Our
responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on
our audits.
We conducted our audits in accordance with generally accepted auditing
standards. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material
misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting
the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes
assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by
management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.
We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements of the Company referred to
above present fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated financial
position of ADFlex Solutions, Inc. at December 27, 1998 and December 31, 1997,
and the consolidated results of its operations and its cash flows for each of
the three years in the period ended December 31, 1997, in conformity with
generally accepted accounting principles.
The accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared on the
basis that the Company will continue as a going concern. The Company has failed
to meet certain provisions of its credit agreement in February 1999 and expects
to fail to meet another covenant at March 31, 1999. These conditions raise
substantial doubt about the Company ability to continue as a going concern.
The accompanying 1998 consolidated financial statements do not include any
adjustments to reflect the possible future effects on the recoverability and
classification of assets or the amounts and classification of liabilities that
may result from the outcome of this uncertainty.
