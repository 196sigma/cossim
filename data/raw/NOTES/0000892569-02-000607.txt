operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in
the period ended December31, 2001, in conformity with
accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of
America. In addition, in our opinion, the financial statement
schedule listed in the accompanying index presents fairly, in
all material respects, the information set forth therein when
read in conjunction with the related consolidated financial
statements. These financial statements and financial statement
schedule are the responsibility of the Companys
management; our responsibility is to express an opinion on these
financial statements and financial statement schedule based on
our audits. We conducted our audits of these statements in
accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in the
United States of America, which require that we plan and perform
the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the

includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the
amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing
the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by
management, and evaluating the overall financial statement
presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable
basis for the opinion. PRICEWATERHOUSECOOPERS LLP Orange County, California February27, 2002 36 Table of Contents ICN PHARMACEUTICALS, INC. CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS December31, 2001 and 2000 In thousands, except per share

STATEMENTS December31, 2001 1.Organization
and Background ICN Pharmaceuticals, Inc. and Subsidiaries the
Company was formed in November 1994, as a result of
the merger of ICN Pharmaceuticals, Inc.,
SPIPharmaceuticals, Inc., Viratek, Inc. and
ICNBiomedicals, Inc. Biomedicals, in a
transaction accounted for using the purchase method of
accounting the Merger. The Company is a global
research based pharmaceutical company that develops,
manufactures, distributes and sells pharmaceutical, research and
diagnostic products. The Company currently is in the process of
implementing a restructuring plan to split its business into
three separate publicly traded companies: Ribapharm Inc.
comprised of the Companys royalty stream from ribavirin
and the Companys U.S.research and development
operations Ribapharm, ICN International AG
comprised of the Companys operations in Western Europe,
Eastern Europe and AAA ICN International and ICN
Americas comprised of the Companys operations in North
America, Latin America and the biomedicals business ICN
Americas. 2.Summary of
Significant Accounting Policies Principles of Consolidation:
The accompanying consolidated
financial statements include the accounts of the Company and all
of its majority-owned subsidiaries. Investments in 20% through
50% owned affiliated companies are included under the equity
method where the Company exercises significant influence over
operating and financial affairs. Investments in less than 20%
owned companies or investments in 20%-50% owned companies where
the Company does not exercise significant influence over
operating and financial affairs are recorded at the lower of
cost or fair value. The accompanying consolidated financial
statements reflect the elimination of all significant
intercompany account balances and transactions. Cash and Cash Equivalents:
Cash equivalents include repurchase
agreements, certificates of deposit, money market funds and
municipal debt securities which have maturities of three months
or less. For purposes of the consolidated statements of cash
flows, the Company considers highly-liquid investments with a
maturity of three months or less at the time of purchase to be
cash equivalents. The carrying amount of these assets
approximates fair value due to the short-term maturity of these
instruments. At December31, 2001 and 2000, cash
equivalents totaled $188,967,000 and $119,861,000, respectively. Marketable Securities:
The Company classifies its investments
as available for sale. Changes in market values are reflected as
unrealized gains and losses, calculated on the specific
identification method, in accumulated other comprehensive income. Allowance for Doubtful Accounts:
The Company evaluates the
collectibility of its receivables at least quarterly, based upon
various factors including the financial condition and payment
history of major customers, an overall review of collections
experience on other accounts and economic factors or events
expected to affect the Companys future collections
experience. Inventories:
Inventories, which include material,
direct labor and factory overhead, are stated at the lower of
cost or market. Cost is determined on a first-in, first-out
FIFO basis. The Company evaluates the carrying
value of its inventories at least quarterly, taking into account
such factors as historical and anticipated future sales compared
with quantities on hand, the price the Company expects to obtain
for its products in their respective markets compared with
historical cost and the remaining shelf life of goods on hand. Property, Plant and Equipment:
Property, plant and equipment are
stated at cost. The Company primarily uses the straight-line
method for depreciating property, plant and equipment over their
estimated useful lives. Buildings and related improvements are
depreciated from 7-50years, machinery and
equipment from 3-30years, furniture and
fixtures from 3-15years and leasehold
improvements and capital leases are amortized over their useful
lives, limited to the life of the related lease. 41 Table of Contents ICN PHARMACEUTICALS, INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTSContinued The Company follows the policy of capitalizing
expenditures that materially increase the lives of the related
assets and charges maintenance and repairs to expense. Upon sale
or retirement, the costs and related accumulated depreciation or
amortization are eliminated from the respective accounts and the
resulting gain or loss is included in income. Goodwill and Intangibles:
The difference between the purchase
price and the fair value of net assets acquired at the date of
acquisition is included in the accompanying consolidated balance
sheets as goodwill and intangibles. Intangible assets also
include acquired product rights. Goodwill and intangibles
amortization periods range from 5to 20years
depending upon the nature of the business or product acquired.
The Company periodically evaluates the carrying value of
goodwill and intangibles including the related amortization
periods. In evaluating goodwill, the Company determines whether
there has been an impairment and the amount thereof, if any, by
comparing the undiscounted future operating income of the
acquired business with the carrying value of the goodwill. In
evaluating acquired product rights and other intangible assets,
the Company determines whether there has been impairment by
comparing the anticipated undiscounted future operating income
of the product line with its carrying value. If the undiscounted
operating income is less than the carrying value, the amount of
the impairment, if any, will be determined by comparing the
carrying value of each intangible asset with its fair value.
Fair value is generally based on a discounted cash flows
analysis. Based on its review, the Company does not believe that
any impairment of its goodwill and intangibles has occurred. As of December31, 2001 and 2000, goodwill
and intangibles included the following Amortization 2001 2000 Periods In thousands Goodwill 68,997 74,032 5-20 years Acquired product rights 488,632 450,167 10-18 years Other intangible assets 9,133 9,918 10-18 years 566,762 534,117 Accumulated amortization 120,476 97,027 446,286 437,090 In July 2001, the Financial Accounting Standards
Board FASB issued Statement of Financial
Accounting Standards SFAS No141,
Business Combinations, and SFAS No142, Goodwill
and Other Intangible Assets. SFAS No141 requires that
the purchase method of accounting be used for all business
combinations initiated after June30, 2001. Under SFAS
No142 goodwill will no longer be amortized but will be
subject to annual impairment tests in accordance with the
statement. Other intangible assets will continue to be amortized
over their useful lives. Application of the non-amortization
provisions of SFAS No142 for goodwill is expected to
result in an increase in operating income of approximately
$3,400,000 in 2002. At December31, 2001, the Company had
goodwill, net of amortization of approximately $45,739,000.
Pursuant to SFAS No142, the Company will test its
goodwill for impairment upon adoption and, if impairment is
indicated, record such impairment as a cumulative effect of
change in accounting principle. The Company is currently
evaluating the effect that the adoption may have on its
consolidated results of operation and financial position. Revenue Recognition:
Revenues and related cost of product
sales are recorded at the time of shipment or as services are
performed, provided that collection of the revenue is reasonably
assured. The Company earns royalty revenue as a result of the
sale of product rights and technologies to third parties.
Royalty revenue is earned at the time the products subject to
the royalty are sold by the third party. 42 Table of Contents ICN PHARMACEUTICALS, INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTSContinued Barter Transactions:
The Company periodically engages in
barter transactions, primarily in Russia, related to the sale of
its products in exchange for raw materials, other finished goods
and costs of services incurred in the conduct of its operations.
The Company accounts for these transactions in accordance with
APB No29 Accounting for Nonmonetary
Transactions, whereby the cost of the assets or service
acquired is based upon the fair value of the asset surrendered
or received whichever is more clearly evident. For each of the
periods ended December31, 2001, 2000 and 1999, the
Companys Russian subsidiaries recorded approximately
$4,000,000, $3,000,000 and $8,000,000, respectively, in revenue
related to barter transactions. Foreign Currency Translation:
The assets and liabilities of the
Companys foreign operations, except those in highly
inflationary economies, are translated at end of period exchange
rates. Revenues and expenses are translated at the average
exchange rates prevailing during the period. The effects of
unrealized exchange rate fluctuations on translating foreign
currency assets and liabilities into U.S. dollars are
accumulated in stockholders equity. The monetary assets
and liabilities of foreign subsidiaries in highly inflationary
economies are remeasured into U.S.dollars at end of period
exchange rates and non-monetary assets and liabilities at
historical exchange rates. In accordance with SFAS No52,
Foreign Currency Translation, the Company has included in
earnings all foreign exchange gains and losses arising from
foreign currency transactions and the effects of foreign
exchange rate fluctuations on subsidiaries operating in highly
inflationary economies. Recorded losses from foreign exchange
transactions amounted to $2,211,000, $3,062,000 and $5,085,000
for 2001, 2000 and 1999, respectively. Recorded losses from
foreign exchange translation amounted to $1,621,000, $3,525,000
and $6,738,000 for 2001, 2000 and 1999, respectively. Income Taxes: Income
taxes are calculated in accordance with SFAS No109,
Accounting for Income Taxes. SFAS No109 is an
asset and liability approach that requires the recognition of
deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax
consequence of events that have been recognized in the
Companys financial statements or tax returns. A valuation
allowance is established, when necessary, to reduce deferred tax
assets to the amount expected to be realized. In estimating
future tax consequences, SFAS No109 generally considers
all expected future events other than an enactment of changes in
tax laws or rates. Use of Estimates:
The preparation of financial
statements in conformity with accounting principles generally
accepted in the United States of America requires management to
make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts
of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets
and liabilities at the dates of the financial statements and the
reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting
periods. Actual results could differ from those estimates. Comprehensive Income:
The Company has adopted the provisions
of SFAS No130, Reporting Comprehensive Income.
Comprehensive income represents foreign currency translation
adjustments is presented as a component of accumulated
comprehensive income. The component of other comprehensive income has
not been recorded net of any tax provision or benefit as the
Company does not expect to realize any significant tax benefit
or expense from this item. Per Share Information:
Basic earnings per share is computed
by dividing income available to common stockholders by the
weighted-average number of shares outstanding. In computing
diluted earnings per share, the weighted-average number of
shares outstanding is adjusted to reflect the effect of
potentially dilutive securities including options, warrants, and
convertible debt or preferred stock, and income available to
common stockholders is adjusted to reflect any changes in income
or loss that would result from the issuance of the dilutive
common shares. The Companys Board of Directors declared a
quarterly cash distribution of $075 per share for each fiscal
quarter of 2001. During 2000, the Companys Board of
Directors declared a quarterly cash distribution of $00725 per
share for each fiscal quarter. During 1999, the Companys
Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash distribution of
$007 per share for each fiscal quarter. 43 Table of Contents ICN PHARMACEUTICALS, INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTSContinued Stock-Based Compensation:
The Company has adopted the disclosure
only provisions of SFAS No123 for stock options issued to
employees. Compensation cost for stock-based compensation issued
to employees has been measured using the intrinsic value method
provided by Accounting Principles Board Opinion No25. Reclassifications:
Certain prior year items have been
reclassified to conform with the current year presentation, with
no effect on previously reported net income or
stockholders equity. New Accounting Pronouncement:
In August 2001, the FASB issued SFAS
No144, Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of
Long-Lived Assets. SFAS No. 144, which addresses financial
accounting and reporting for the impairment of long-lived assets
and for long-lived assets to be disposed of, supercedes SFAS
No121 and is effective for fiscal years beginning after
December15, 2001. While the Company is currently
evaluating the impact the adoption of SFAS No144 will
have on its results of operations and financial position, it
does not expect such impact to be material. 3.Acquisitions On August17, 2001, the Company acquired
certain assets from an Argentine company, for a total cost of
23,774,000 Argentine pesos, of which $8,440,000 was paid in cash
and the balance as a note payable $9,584,000 as of
December31, 2001. The note is payable through February
2003 and accrues interest at 6% per annum. The acquisition was
accounted for as a purchase and is not material to the financial
position or results of operations of the Company. On January1, 2001, the Company acquired
certain assets from Medical Alliance, Inc., a provider of office
based surgical services, for $14,445,000 in cash. The
acquisition was accounted for as a purchase and is not material
to the financial position or results of operations of the
Company. During 2001, the Company acquired an additional
51% interest in a subsidiary in Hungary for $823,000 in cash,
which increased the Companys ownership to 964%. On July1, 2000, the Company acquired 100%
ownership of the Swiss pharmaceuticals company Solco Basel AG
for $30,368,000, of which $25,156,000 was paid in cash
$4,026,000 of cash was received as part of the Solco assets
and the balance in 125,000 shares of the Companys common
stock. Goodwill of $2,821,000 was recorded in connection with
the acquisition and is being amortized over a 20year
estimated useful life. Under the terms of the Companys
agreement with the sellers, the Company has guaranteed a per
share price initially at CHF64 $3856 as of
December31, 2001, increasing at a rate of 4% per annum
through June30, 2002. If the holders of the shares sell
any of the shares prior to June30, 2002, the Company is
entitled to one-half of any proceeds realized in excess of the
guaranteed price. If the market price of the Companys
common stock is below the guaranteed price at the end of the
guarantee period, the Company will be required to satisfy the
aggregate guarantee amount by payment in cash. As of
December31, 2001 the aggregate guaranteed value of the
shares held by the sellers exceeds the market value by
approximately $1,080,000. This acquisition was accounted for as
a purchase and is not material to the financial position or
results of operations of the Company. Product
Acquisitions In 2001 and
2000, the Company acquired the rights to certain products for
the total consideration of $26,177,000 and $9,383,000,
respectively. None of the above product acquisitions are
material to the financial position or results of operations of
the Company. 4.Related Party
Transactions In June 1996, the Company made a short-term loan
to Mr.Milan Panic, the Chairman and CEO, in the amount of
$3,500,000 for personal legal obligations. During August 1996,
this amount was repaid to the Company. In connection with this
transaction, the Company guaranteed $3,600,000 of demand debt of
the Chairman with a third party bank, which is renewable by the
Chairman annually until repaid. In addition to 44 Table of Contents ICN PHARMACEUTICALS, INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTSContinued the guarantee, the Company deposited $3,600,000
with this bank as collateral to the Chairmans debt, which
will remain in place until such time as the Chairman repays his
obligation to the bank. This deposit is recorded as a long-term
asset on the consolidated balance sheet. The Company is not
aware of the time frame in which the Chairman expects to repay
this obligation. Interest paid by the Company on behalf of the
Chairman was charged to the Chairman as compensation expense and
amounted to $150,755, $160,916 and $163,166 for the years ended
December31, 2001, 2000 and 1999. The Company recognized
interest income on the bank deposit of $109,511, $124,330 and
$126,097 for the years ended December31, 2001, 2000 and
1999. The Chairman has provided collateral to the Companys
guarantee in the form of a right to the proceeds of the exercise
of options to acquire 150,000 shares with an exercise price of
$1517 and the rights to a $4,000,000 life insurance policy
provided by the Company. In the event of any default on the debt
to the bank, the Company has recourse that is limited to the
collateral described above. Both the transaction and the
sufficiency of the collateral for the guarantee were approved by
the Board of Directors. In January 2001, the Company made a loan to
Mr.Adam Jerney, Chief Operating Officer and President of
the Company, of $1,197,864 as part of a program adopted by the
Board of Directors of the Company to encourage directors and
officers of the Company to exercise stock options the
Stock Option Program. As of December31, 2001 318,329 was outstanding under the loan, which is collateralized
by 41,427 shares of the Companys common stock and is due
in January 2003. In April 2001, the Company made a loan to
Mr.Milan Panic, Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive
Officer of the Company, of $2,731,519 as part of the Stock
Option Program. The loan is collateralized by 286,879 shares of
the Companys Common Stock and is due in April 2004. These
loans bear interest at a rate of 561% per annum in the case of
Mr.Jerney and 463% per annum in the case of
Mr.Panic, compounded annually. Interest is payable
annually. These loans are non-recourse with respect to principal
and full recourse to the obligor with respect to interest. As of
December31, 2001, the loans are included in the
accompanying consolidated balance sheet as a reduction of
stockholders equity. In January 2002, Mr.Milan Panic exchanged
197,409 stock options with an exercise price of $1799 and
169,578 stock options with an exercise price of $2624 for
99,291 shares of the Companys common stock valued at
approximately $3,000,000. The Company will record this amount as
compensation expense in the first quarter of 2002. The Company
made a short-term loan to Mr.Milan Panic in connection
with the exchange of options of $1,335,833. The loan is due
January18, 2003 and bears interest at a rate of 28% per
annum payable annually. 5.Concentrations
of Credit Risk The Company is exposed to concentrations of
credit risk related to its cash deposits and marketable
securities. The Company places its cash and cash equivalents
with respected financial institutions. The Companys cash
and cash equivalents and restricted cash include $191,000,000
and $120,000,000, at December31, 2001 and 2000,
respectively, held in time deposits, money market funds, and
municipal debt securities through approximately ten major
financial institutions. The Company is also exposed to credit
risk on its accounts receivable balances in Russia as a result
of the current economic situation. The Russian accounts
receivable balances at December31, 2001 and 2000 are
$15,167,000 and $15,414,000, which is net of the allowances for
doubtful accounts of $4,520,000 and $10,276,000, respectively. 45 Table of Contents ICN PHARMACEUTICALS, INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL

acquired approximately $226,000,000 of net operating loss
carryforwards NOLs. Included in the total acquired
NOLs were $191,000,000 of domestic NOLs and $35,000,000 of
foreign NOLs. Internal Revenue Service Code Section382
imposes an annual limitation on the availability of domestic
NOLs that can be used to reduce taxable income after certain
substantial ownership changes of a corporation. At December31, 2001, the Company has
domestic and foreign NOLs of approximately $106,764,000 and
$11,823,000, respectively, and a capital loss carryforward of
$72,736,000. The Companys NOLs begin to expire in the year
2007 and the majority of capital loss carryforward expires in
the year 2008. In 2001 and 2000, the valuation allowance
primarily relates to foreign net operating losses, primarily in
Hungary, and a $12,548,000 tax benefit from the exercise of
stock options included in the NOL carryforward. Ultimate
realization of the deferred tax assets is dependent upon the
Company generating sufficient taxable income prior to expiration
of the loss carryforwards. Although realization is not assured,
management believes it is more likely than not that the net
deferred tax assets will be realized. The amount of the deferred
tax assets considered realizable, however, could be reduced in
the future if estimates of future taxable income during the
carryforward period are reduced. 47 Table of Contents ICN PHARMACEUTICALS, INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL

relief that benefits pharmaceutical companies. Under this
relief, approximately 75% of the income generated in Russia
related to the manufacture and sale of prescription medicines is
exempt from taxation. This reduces the statutory rate to
approximately 8%. Effective January1, 2002, changes in the
tax laws repealed the exemption that benefited pharmaceutical
companies. The statutory rate will increase to 24% in 2002. In 2000, the provision for income taxes includes
deferred tax benefits of $16,284,000 resulting from the
recognition of certain deferred tax assets through the reduction
of the valuation allowance, primarily related to the capital
loss carryforward. The Company has announced its intention to
reorganize into three separately held public companies which
management expects will result in a net capital gain allowing
utilization of the capital loss carryforward. The realization of
the capital loss is dependent upon the Company generating
sufficient capital gains prior to the expiration of the capital
loss carryforwards. The Company is aware of audits being conducted by
various tax authorities. At this time the Company does not feel
that they will result in material adjustments. During 2001, no U.S. income or foreign
withholding taxes were provided on the undistributed earnings of
the Companys foreign subsidiaries with the exception of
the Companys Panamanian subsidiary, Alpha Pharmaceuticals,
since management intends to reinvest those undistributed
earnings in the foreign operations. Included in consolidated
retained earnings at December31, 2001, is approximately
$292,000,000 of accumulated earnings of foreign operations that
would be subject to U.S. income or foreign withholding taxes, if
and when repatriated. 48 Table of Contents ICN PHARMACEUTICALS, INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL

STATEMENTSContinued The 83/4% Senior Notes are general
unsecured obligations of the Company which rank pari passu in
right of payment with all other unsecured senior indebtedness,

the Company will be required to offer to repurchase the
83/4% Senior Notes at a purchase price equal to 101% of
the principal amount thereof, plus accrued interest thereon to
the date of repurchase. Interest on the 83/4% Senior Notes
is payable semi-annually. The indentures governing the

restrict the incurrence of additional indebtedness, the payment
of dividends and other restricted payments, the creation of
certain liens, the sale of assets, or the Companys ability
to consolidate or merge with another entity, subject to
qualifications and exceptions. On February21, 2002, the

Plan: In 1998, the Companys
Board of Directors authorized two stock repurchase programs. The
first repurchase program authorized the Company to repurchase up
to $10,000,000 of its outstanding common stock. The second
authorized the Company to initiate a long-term repurchase
program that allows the Company to repurchase up to 3,000,000
shares of its common stock. In executing the repurchase
programs, the Company is limited by certain covenants contained
in the indenture relating to the Companys 83/4%
Senior Notes. In the indenture, the Company is permitted to
repurchase up to $10,000,000 of its common stock under the first
program; however, repurchases under the second program will only
be permitted as the Company generates cumulative net income, as
provided for in the indenture. In 1998, the Company repurchased
an aggregate of 200,000 shares of its common stock for
$4,450,000. In March 1999, the Company repurchased additional
shares of 223,967 of its common stock for $5,550,000, completing
its first stock repurchase program. In December 1999, the
Company repurchased additional shares of 390,200 of its common
stock for $9,754,000, initiating the second stock repurchase
program. No shares were repurchased in 2001 and 2000. During 1999, the Company sold certain put options
to an independent third party; the proceeds were used to
purchase call options from the same party in a private placement
transaction not requiring any net cash outlay at the time. The
put options and the corresponding call options expired from
August 2000 through December 2000. The Company, at its option,
could make a physical settlement, a cash settlement, or a net
share settlement of its positions under the put options and the
call options. The Company received 46,014 shares of its common
stock and paid $20,000 in cash to settle its positions under the
put options and the call options. Stockholder Rights
Plan: The Company has adopted a
Stockholder Rights Plan to protect stockholders rights in
the event of a proposed or actual acquisition of 15% or more of
the outstanding shares of the Companys common stock. As
part of this plan, each share of the Companys common stock
carries a right to purchase one one-hundredth 1/100 of a share
of SeriesA Preferred Stock the Rights, par
value $001 per share, of the Company at a price of $125 per one
one-hundredth of a share, subject to adjustment, which becomes
exercisable only upon the occurrence of certain events. The
Rights are subject to redemption at the option of the Board of
Directors at a price of $001 per right until the occurrence of
certain events. The Rights expire on November1, 2004. Long-term Incentive
Plan: The Company has a long-term
incentive plan, which provides for the issuance of shares of the
Companys common stock to senior executives. Shares issued
under the long-term incentive plan are restricted and vest over
a four-year period. In 2001, 2000 and 1999, no shares were
issued under the plan. In 1998, approximately 319,000 shares of
the Companys common stock having a value of $10,466,000
were issued under this plan. Compensation expense for the value
of the common shares issued is being recognized over the vesting
period and is credited to additional capital. During 2001, 2000
and 1999, the Company recorded an other non-cash charge relating
to the compensation expense of $2,333,000, $2,333,000 54 Table of Contents ICN PHARMACEUTICALS, INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTSContinued and $2,737,000, respectively. The amount expected
to be recognized in 2002, assuming that all current participants
in the long-term incentive plan remain in the plan through the
vesting period, is $195,000. Contingently Issuable
Shares: Effective October1,
1998, the Company issued 2,883,871 shares of its common stock to
F.Hoffmann-La Roche Roche as part of the
consideration for the rights to four pharmaceutical products.
Under the terms of the agreement with Roche, the Company
guaranteed to Roche a per share price initially at $3100,
increasing at a rate of 6% per annum through December31,
2000. On February28, 2001, the Company issued 92,975
shares of its common stock valued at approximately $2,723,000 in
settlement of the guarantee. Other: During 1999,
the Company sold 2,041,498 shares of its common stock to
Schering-Plough for $42,000,000. The sale was pursuant to the
terms of a Stock Purchase Agreement made between the Company and
Schering-Plough in 1995. See Note15. 11.Commitments

The SEC Complaint concerns public disclosures made by the
Company with respect to the status and disposition of the
Companys 1994 New Drug Application for ribavirin as a
monotherapy treatment for chronic hepatitisC the
NDA. The FDA did not approve this new drug
application. The SEC Complaint seeks injunctive relief,
unspecified civil penalties, and an order barring Mr.Panic
from acting as an officer or director of any publicly-traded
company. A pre-trial schedule has been set which requires the
end of discovery by August1, 2002, and the commencement of
trial on May6, 2003. The Company and the SEC appeared
before a settlement judge, for the purpose of settlement
negotiations. Pending completion of these negotiations, the
courts have stayed discovery for 90days. There can be no
assurance that the SEC litigation will be settled by mutual
agreement or what the amount of any settlement may ultimately
be. In the event a settlement is not reached, the Company will
vigorously defend any litigation. On December17, 2001, the Company pled
guilty in the United States District Court for the Central
District of California to a single felony count for securities
fraud for omitting to disclose until February17, 1995, the
existence and content of a letter received from the FDA in late
1994 regarding the unapprovable status of the Companys
1994 NDA for ribavirin as a monotherapy treatment for chronic
hepatitis C. This guilty plea was entered pursuant to a plea
agreement with the United States Attorney for the Central
District of California to settle a six-year investigation. The
Company paid a fine of $5,600,000 and became subject to a
three-year term of probation. The plea agreement provides that
the Office will not further prosecute the Company and will not
bring any further criminal charges against the Company or any
individuals, except one non-officer employee of the Company,
relating to any matters that have been the subject of the
investigation and will close its investigation of these matters. The conditions of the probation require the
Company to create a compliance program to ensure no future
violations of the federal securities laws and to pre-clear with
the FDA any public communication by the Company concerning any
matter subject to FDA regulation. The terms of the compliance
program include the 55 Table of Contents ICN PHARMACEUTICALS, INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTSContinued Company retaining an expert to review its
procedures for public communications regarding FDA matters and
to develop written procedures for these communications. The
compliance program also requires preparation of an annual report
by the expert on the Companys compliance with the written
procedures and annual certification by the Companys
management that the Company is complying with the experts
recommendations. In connection with the Grand Jury investigation
and SEC litigation, the Company recorded a reserve in the fourth
quarter of 2000 of $9,250,000 to cover the potential combined
settlement liability and all other related costs. The $5,600,000
fine paid by the Company has been charged against the reserve. On or about February9, 1999, the Company
commenced an action in the United States District Court for the
District of Columbia against the Republic of Serbia, the State
Health Fund of Serbia, and the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia
seeking damages in the amount of at least $500million and
declaratory relief arising out of the unlawful taking of the
Companys majority ownership interest in ICN Yugoslavia. On
or about March9, 1999, the State Health Fund of Serbia
commenced an arbitration against the Company by filing a Request
for Arbitration with the International Chamber of Commerce
International Court of Arbitration in Paris, seeking unspecified
injunctive relief and unquantified damages based upon alleged
breaches by the Company of the November 1990 Foundation
Agreement which led to the foundation of ICN Yugoslavia. On April27, 1999, the Company filed its
answer and counterclaims against the State Health Fund of
Serbia. At the same time, the Company also filed a Request for
Arbitration with the ICC International Court of Arbitration
against the Republic of Serbia and the Federal Republic of
Yugoslavia. This request seeks declaratory relief and damages
arising out of the unlawful taking of the Companys
majority ownership interest in ICN Yugoslavia and the State
Health Fund of Serbias failure to pay for goods sold and
delivered. Thereafter, the action in the United States District
Court for the District of Columbia was dismissed without
prejudice pending the outcome of the ICC arbitration
proceedings. On February23, 2001, the arbitration panel
issued decisions that the State Health Fund of Serbia is a
proper party to the ICC arbitration, that the issue of
jurisdiction over the Republic of Serbia in the ICC arbitration
will be joined to the merits of the case, and that there is no
jurisdiction over the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia in the ICC
arbitration. The Company intends to prosecute vigorously its
claims against the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, the Republic
of Serbia, and the State Health Fund of Serbia, and to defend
against the State Health Fund of Serbias claims against
the Company. An evidentiary hearing before the arbitration panel
is scheduled for July 2002. The Company is a party to a legal matter at one
of its distribution companies in Russia. The matter involves a
claim relating to non-payment under a contract entered into in
January 1995, prior to the Companys acquisition of this
Russian distribution company. The claimant is seeking to recover
$6,200,000 in damages, plus expenses. Due to the complex and
changing legal environment in Russia, the Company can not
estimate the range or amount of possible loss, if any, that may
be incurred. The Company intends to vigorously defend this
matter, however, an adverse decision could have a material
effect on the results of operations of the Company. The Company is a party to other pending lawsuits
or subject to a number of threatened lawsuits. While the
ultimate outcome of pending and threatened lawsuits cannot be
predicted with certainty, and an unfavorable outcome could have
a negative impact on the Company, at this time in the opinion of
management, the ultimate resolution of these matters will not
have a material effect on the Companys consolidated
financial position, results of operations or liquidity. Product Liability
Insurance: The Company is currently
self-insured with respect to product liability claims and could
be exposed to possible claims for personal injury resulting from
allegedly defective products. While to date no material adverse
claim for personal injury resulting from allegedly defective
products has been successfully maintained against the Company, a
substantial claim, if successful, could have a negative impact
on the results of operations and cash flows of the Company. 56 Table of Contents ICN PHARMACEUTICALS, INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTSContinued Benefits Plans: The
Company has a defined contribution plan that provides all U.S.
employees the opportunity to defer a portion of their
compensation for payout at a subsequent date. The Company can
voluntarily make matching contributions on behalf of
participating and eligible employees. The Companys expense
related to such defined contribution plan was not material in
2001, 2000 and 1999. Other: Milan Panic,
the Companys Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive
Officer, is employed under a contract expiring December31,
2002 that provides for, among other things, certain health and
retirement benefits. The contract is automatically extended at
the end of each term for successive one year periods unless
either the Company or Mr.Panic terminates the contract
upon six months prior written notice. Mr.Panic, at his
option, may provide consulting services upon his retirement and
will be entitled, when serving as a consultant, to participate
in the Companys medical and dental plans. The consulting
fee shall not at any time exceed the annual compensation as
adjusted, paid to Mr.Panic. Upon Mr.Panics
retirement, the consulting fee shall not be subject to further
cost-of-living adjustments. The Company has employment agreements with eleven
other key executives which contain change in control
benefits. Upon a change in control of the Company as
defined in the contract, the employee shall receive severance
benefits equal to three times salary or for the chairman five
times salary and other benefits. As of December31, 2001,
the Companys obligation, assuming a change in control had
occurred would be $28,681,000 for all employment contracts. 12.Business
Segments and Geographic Data The Company is a global, research-based
pharmaceutical company that develops, manufactures, distributes
and sells pharmaceutical, research and diagnostic products. The
Company is organized and operates in the Pharmaceuticals group
and the Biomedicals group. The Pharmaceuticals group produces
and markets a variety of pharmaceutical products worldwide and
derives royalty revenues from sales of certain of its products
by a third party under a license agreement. The Biomedicals
group markets research products and related services,
immunodiagnostic reagents and instrumentation, and provides
radiation monitoring services. In 2001, the principal markets for the
Companys pharmaceutical products were North America,
Western Europe including Poland, Hungary and the Czech
Republic, Russia and Latin America, which represented
approximately 20%, 24%, 12% and 15%, respectively, of the
Companys revenues for the year. Approximately 62%, 64 and 64% of the Companys revenues for the years ended
December31, 2001, 2000 and 1999, respectively, were
generated from operations outside the United States. The
Companys foreign operations are subject to certain risks
inherent in conducting business abroad, including possible
nationalization or expropriation, price and exchange controls,
limitations on foreign participation in local enterprises,
health-care regulation, and other restrictive governmental
actions. Changes in the relative values of currencies take
place from time to time and may materially affect the
Companys results of operations. Their effects on the
Companys future operations are not predictable. The
Company does not currently provide any hedges on its foreign
currency exposure and, in certain countries in which the Company
operates, no effective hedging programs are available. In 1998, the Company adopted SFAS No131,
Disclosures about Segments of an Enterprise and Related
Information, which requires reporting certain financial
information according to the management approach.
This approach requires reporting information regarding operating
segments on the basis used internally by management to evaluate
segment performance. SFAS No131 also requires disclosures
about products and services, geographic areas and major
customers. 57 Table of Contents ICN PHARMACEUTICALS, INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTSContinued The Company is organized into business units on
the basis of geographic region. In applying SFAS No131,
these business units have been aggregated into seven reportable
segments based on similar long-term economic characteristics.
The accounting policies of the segments are the same as those
described in Note2. The Company evaluates segment
performance based on income from operations, which excludes
intersegment sales as well as interest income and expense and
foreign exchange gains and losses. The Company allocates
amortization on the product rights acquired from Roche and SKB
among the segments where the related revenues are reported; the
unamortized cost of such acquired product rights is included in
assets of the North America Pharmaceuticals segment. The tables below present information about
reported segments and geographic data for the years ended

Yugoslavia On February6, 1999, the government of the
Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, acting through the Federal
Ministry of Health and/or the Ministry of Health of Serbia,
seized control of the Companys 75% owned subsidiary, ICN
Yugoslavia. This action, based on a decision by the Ministry for
Economic and Property Transformation that was reached on
November26, 1998, effectively reduced the Companys
equity ownership of ICN Yugoslavia from 75% to 35%. The Ministry
of Economic and Property Transformation decision was based on
the unilaterally imposed recalculation of the Companys
original capital contribution to ICN Yugoslavia. Subsequent to
the seizure, the Commercial Court of Belgrade issued an order
stating that a change in control had occurred. These actions
were taken, contrary to Yugoslavian law, without any
notification to or representation by the Company. As a result,
the Company had and continues to have no effective control over
the operating and financial affairs of ICN Yugoslavia.
Accordingly, the Company deconsolidated the financial statements
of ICN Yugoslavia as of November26, 1998 and reduced the
carrying value of the Companys investment in ICN
Yugoslavia to its fair value, estimated to be zero. The Company
did not recognize any income or expense related to its
investment in Yugoslavia in 2001, 2000 and 1999. 14.ICN
Russia The Companys Russian operations generated
12%, 13%, and 12% of the Companys total revenues for the
years 2001, 2000 and 1999, respectively. While the Russian economy continues to show
improvement since the financial crisis that began in 1998, the
economy continues to experience difficulties. In 1998, the ruble
fell sharply from a rate of 63 rubles to $1 to a rate of 275
rubles to $1 by the end of 1999. To date, the ruble continues to
fluctuate, there is continued volatility in the debt and equity
markets, hyperinflation persists, confidence in the banking
sector has yet to be restored and there continues to be general
lack of liquidity in the economy. In addition, laws and
regulations affecting businesses operating within Russia
continue to evolve. Russias return to economic stability
is dependent to a large extent on the effectiveness of the
measures taken by the government, decisions of international
lending organizations, and other actions, including regulatory
and political developments, which are beyond the Companys
control. 60 Table of Contents ICN PHARMACEUTICALS, INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTSContinued At December31, 2001, the ruble exchange
rate was 301 rubles to $1 as compared with the rate of 282
rubles to $1 and 275 rubles to $1 as of December31, 2000
and 1999, respectively. As a result of the change in the ruble
exchange rate, the Company recorded translation and exchange
losses of $1,621,000, $3,525,000 and $6,738,000, related to its
Russian operations during 2001, 2000 and 1999, respectively. As
of December31, 2001, ICN Russia had a net monetary asset
position of approximately $13,919,000, which is subject to
foreign exchange loss as further declines in the value of the
ruble in relation to the dollar occur. Due to the fluctuation in
the ruble exchange rate, the ultimate amount of any future
translation and exchange loss the Company may incur cannot
presently be determined and such loss may have a negative impact
on the Companys results of operations. The Companys
management continues to manage its net monetary exposure. The Companys collections on accounts
receivable in Russia have been adversely affected by the Russian
economic situation. Prior to the August 1998 devaluation of the
ruble, the Company had a favorable experience with the
collection of receivables from its customers in the region.
Subsequently, the Company has taken additional steps to ensure
the creditworthiness of its customers and the collectibility of
accounts receivable by tightening its credit policies in the
region. These steps include a shortening of credit periods,
suspension of sales to customers with past-due balances and
discounts for cash sales. The Company believes that the economic and
political environment in Russia has affected the pharmaceutical
industry in the region. Many Russian companies, including many
of the Companys customers, continue to experience
liquidity problems as monetary policy has limited the money
supply, and Russian companies often lack access to an effective
banking system. As a result, many Russian companies have limited
ability to pay their debts, which has led to a number of
business failures in the region. In addition, the devaluation
has reduced the purchasing power of Russian companies and
consumers, thus increasing pressure on the Company and other
producers to limit price increases in hard currency terms. 15.Agreement
with Schering-Plough Corporation On July28, 1995, the Company entered into
an Exclusive License and Supply Agreement the License
Agreement and a Stock Purchase Agreement the
Agreement with Schering-Plough Corporation
Schering-Plough. Under the License Agreement,
Schering-Plough licensed all oral forms of ribavirin for the
treatment of chronic hepatitis C HCV in
combination with Schering-Ploughs interferon alpha-2b. The
License Agreement provided the Company an initial non-refundable
payment and future royalty payments to the Company from sales of
ribavirin by Schering-Plough, including certain minimum royalty
rates. As part of the initial License Agreement, the Company
retained the right to co-market ribavirin capsules in the
European Union under its trademark Virazole. In addition,
Schering-Plough was obligated to purchase up to $42,000,000 in
common stock of the Company upon the achievement of certain
regulatory milestones. Under the Agreement, Schering-Plough is
responsible for all clinical developments worldwide. In 1998,
the Company sold to Schering-Plough its right to co-market oral
ribavirin for the treatment of HCV in the European Union, in
exchange for increased royalty rates on sales of ribavirin
worldwide. In addition, the Company received a one-time payment
of $16,500,000 from Schering-Plough in consideration for the
sale to Schering-Plough of the additional marketing rights in
the European Union, in settlement of past royalties, and as
reimbursement for expenses incurred by the Company in
preparation for the launch of ribavirin capsules in the European
Union. Schering-Plough has informed the Company that it
believes that royalties paid under the License Agreement should
not include royalties on products distributed as part of an
indigent patient marketing program. If Schering-Plough were to
apply the proposed adjustment retroactively since the inception
of the License Agreement, the adjustment to royalty revenue
would be approximately $15,000,000. Further, if Schering-Plough
were to successfully apply the proposed adjustment to future
royalties payments, royalties earned could be reduced in the
same proportion as the historical adjustment. In its second
quarter royalty payment due on August30, 2001,
Schering-Plough withheld $11,628,000 related to royalties on
indigent 61 Table of Contents ICN PHARMACEUTICALS, INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTSContinued patient sales that were paid to the Company prior
to the fourth quarter of 2000. Accordingly, $14,628,000 is
currently due from Schering-Plough related to royalties recorded
as revenue on indigent patient sales. As of December31,
2001, no reserve has been established for this receivable as
management believes collectibility is reasonably assured.
Effective for the second quarter of 2001, the Company no longer
recognizes revenue on products distributed as part of the
indigent marketing program. The Company has filed an arbitration
claim to prevent Schering-Plough from adjusting its royalty
payments to the Company. In November 2000, the Company entered into an
agreement that provides Schering-Plough with certain rights to
license various products the Company may develop. Under the
terms of the strategic agreement, Schering-Plough has the option
to exclusively license on a worldwide basis up to three
compounds that the Company may develop for the treatment of
hepatitis C on terms specified in the agreement. The option does
not apply to Levovirin or Viramidine. The option is
exercisable as to a particular compound at any time prior to the
start of Phase II clinical studies for that compound. Once it
exercises the option with respect to a compound, Schering-Plough
is required to take over all developmental costs and
responsibility for regulatory approval for that compound. Under the terms of the agreement, the Company
also granted Schering-Plough the right of first/last refusal to
license compounds relating to the treatment of infectious
diseases other than hepatitis C or cancer or other oncology
indications as well as the right of first/last refusal with
respect to Levovirin and Viramidine collectively,
the Refusal Rights. Under the terms of the Refusal
Rights, if the Company intends to offer a license or other
rights with respect to any of these compounds to a third party,
the Company is required to notify Schering-Plough. At
Schering-Ploughs request, the Company is required to
negotiate in good faith with Schering-Plough on an exclusive
basis the terms of a mutually acceptable exclusive worldwide
license or other form of agreement on commercial terms to be
mutually agreed upon. If the Company cannot reach an agreement
with Schering-Plough, the Company is permitted to negotiate a
license agreement or other arrangement with a third party. Prior
to entering into any final arrangement with the third party, the
Company is required to offer substantially similar terms to
Schering-Plough, which terms Schering-Plough has the right to
match. If Schering-Plough does not exercise its option
or Refusal Rights as to a particular compound, the Company may
continue to develop that compound or license that compound to
other third parties. The agreement with Schering-Plough will
terminate the later of 12years from the date of the
agreement or the termination of the 1995 license agreement with
Schering-Plough. The agreement was entered into as part of the
resolution of claims asserted by Schering-Plough against the
Company, including claims regarding the Companys alleged
improper hiring of former Schering-Plough research and
development personnel and claims that the Company was not
permitted to conduct hepatitis C research. In June 2001, the Company licensed
Levovirin to Roche. The Companys agreement with
Schering-Plough granted Scering-Plough Refusal Rights for
Levovirin. Although the Company believes it has complied
with the Refusal Rights, Schering-Plough may allege that the
Company has not complied with the Refusal Rights to
Levovirin. In February and December 1999, Schering-Plough
purchased 1,141,498 and 900,000 shares of the Companys
common stock for $27,000,000 and $15,000,000, respectively,
pursuant to the Stock Purchase Agreement entered into in
connection with the License Agreement. 16.Supplemental
Cash Flow Disclosures In 1999, the Company recorded an other non-cash
charge of $1,000,000 related to the abandonment of unproductive
assets. 62 Table of Contents ICN PHARMACEUTICALS, INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL

Events On March11, 2002, the Company entered into
an agreement to acquire Circe Biomedical, Inc., a development
stage company, for $26,000,000, of which $6,000,000 will be paid
in cash and the balance in shares of the Companys common
stock. The transaction is subject to approval under the
Hart-Scott-Rodino Anti-trust Improvements Act of 1976.
Additionally, the Company will pay milestone payments and
royalties if a product is successfully developed. In connection
with this purchase the Company estimates that approximately
$12,000,000 will be allocated to in-process research and
development because the technological feasibility of the product
under development has not been established and no future
alternative uses exist. The final purchase price allocation will
be completed once a detailed evaluation of the fair market value
of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed has been
