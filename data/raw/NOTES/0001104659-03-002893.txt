23 Report
of Independent Accountants To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of Simpson Manufacturing
Co., Inc. In our opinion, the accompanying consolidated financial statements
listed in the index on page 23 of this Form 10-K present fairly, in all
material respects, the financial position of Simpson Manufacturing Co., Inc.
the Company and its subsidiaries at December 31, 2002 and 2001, and the
results of their operations and
their cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31,
2002, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United
States of America. In addition, in our opinion, the financial statement
schedule listed in the accompanying index presents fairly, in all material
respects, the information set forth therein when read in conjunction with the
related consolidated financial statements. These financial statements and the
financial statement schedule are the responsibility of the Companys
management; our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial
statements and the financial statement schedule based on our audits. We conducted our audits of these
financial statements in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted
in the United States of America which require that we plan and perform the
audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are
free of material misstatement. An
audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and
disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles
used and significant estimates made by management, and evaluating the overall
financial statement presentation. We
believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. As discussed in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements, the
Company changed its method of valuing inventories from the last-in, first-out
method to the first-in, first-out method effective January 1, 2001.

Notes to
Consolidated Financial Statements 1. Operations and
Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Nature
of Operations Simpson Manufacturing Co., Inc., through its subsidiaries Simpson
Strong-Tie Company Inc. Simpson Strong-Tie and Simpson Dura-Vent Company,
Inc. and its other subsidiaries collectively, the Company, designs,
engineers and manufactures wood-to-wood, wood-to-concrete, wood-to-masonry
connectors and pre-fabricated shearwalls and venting systems for gas and wood
burning appliances and markets its products to the residential construction,
light industrial and commercial construction, remodeling and do-it-yourself
markets. Simpson Strong-Tie also offers a line of adhesives, mechanical anchors
and powder actuated tools for concrete, masonry and steel. The Company operates exclusively in the building products industry. The
Companys products are sold primarily throughout the United States of America.
Revenues have some geographic market concentration on the West Coast. A portion
of the Companys business is therefore dependent upon economic activity within
this region and market. Use of Estimates The preparation of financial statements in conformity
with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States requires
management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts
of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities
at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues
and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from
those estimates. Revenue Recognition The Company recognizes revenue as title to products is transferred to
customers or services are rendered, net of applicable provision for discounts,
returns and allowances. Principles
of Consolidation The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Simpson
Manufacturing Co., Inc. and its subsidiaries. Investments in less than 50%
owned affiliates are accounted for using the equity method. All significant
intercompany transactions have been eliminated. Cash
Equivalents The Company considers all highly liquid investments with an original
maturity of three months or less to be cash equivalents. Investments The Companys investments in debt securities are classified as
available-for-sale investments and are recorded at fair value. The cost of
securities sold is based on the specific identification method. Unrealized
gains and losses are reported as a separate component of stockholders equity.
The Company also has a minority investment in a privately held company. These
kinds of investments are generally carried at cost and are classified as
long-term investments. The Company periodically reviews its investments for impairment. If the
carrying value of an investment exceeds its fair value and the decline in fair
value is determined to be other-than-temporary, the Company writes down the
value of the investment to its fair value. The Company generally believes an
other-than-temporary decline occurs when the fair value of an investment is
below the carrying value for two full consecutive quarters. 29 Inventory
Valuation Inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market.
Effective January 1, 2001, the Company changed its method of valuing
inventories from the last-in, first-out LIFO method to the first-in,
first-out FIFO method. The Company believes that the new method is
preferable because the FIFO method more effectively allocates fixed overhead
costs in times of increased production and, therefore more closely matches
current costs and revenues. In addition, the adoption of the FIFO method will
enhance the comparability of the Companys financial statements by changing to
the predominant method used in its industry and conforms all of the Companys
inventories to the same accounting method. The Company has applied this change
retroactively by restating its financial statements as required by Accounting
Principles Board No. 20, Accounting Changes, which has resulted in an
increase in previously reported retained earnings of $89,836 as of December 31,
2000. The effect on net income of the change in accounting principle was an
increase of $1,020,640 for the year ended December 31, 2000. Property,
Plant and Equipment Property, plant and equipment is carried at cost. Major renewals and
betterments are capitalized; maintenance and repairs are expensed on a current
basis. When assets are sold or retired, their costs and accumulated
depreciation are removed from the accounts; the resulting gains or losses are
reflected in the consolidated statements of operations. Depreciation
and Amortization Depreciation of property, plant and equipment is provided for using
accelerated methods over the following estimated useful lives 
Factory machinery and equipment
5 to 10 years
Automobiles, trucks and other equipment
3 to 10 years
Office equipment
3 to 8 years
Buildings and site improvements
20 to 45 years
Leasehold improvements are amortized using the straightline
method over the shorter of the expected life or the remaining term of the
lease. Amortization of intangible assets is computed using the straight-line
method over the estimated useful lives of the asset. Product
Research and Development Costs Product research and development costs, which are included in cost of
sales, were charged against income as incurred and approximated $3,659,000 2,747,000 and $2,226,000 in 2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively. Tooling
Costs Tool and die costs are included in product costs in the year incurred. Income
Taxes Income taxes are calculated using an asset and liability approach. The
provision for income taxes includes federal and state taxes currently payable
and deferred taxes, due to temporary differences between the financial
statement and tax bases of assets and liabilities. In addition, future tax
benefits are recognized to the extent that realization of such benefits is more
likely than not. Foreign
Currency Translation The local currency is the functional currency of the Companys
operations in Europe and Canada. Assets and liabilities denominated in foreign
currencies are translated using the exchange rate on the balance sheet date.
Revenues and expenses are translated using average exchange rates prevailing
during the year. The translation adjustment resulting from this process is
shown separately as a component of stockholders equity. Foreign currency
transaction gains or losses are included in the determination of net income. Common
Stock Subject to the rights of holders of any Preferred Stock that may be
issued in the future, holders of Common Stock are entitled to receive such
dividends, if any, as may be declared from time to time by the Board of
Directors the Board out of legally available funds and in the event of
liquidation, dissolution or winding-up of the Company, to share ratably in all
assets available for distribution. The holders of Common Stock have no
preemptive or conversion rights. Subject to the rights of any Preferred Stock
that may be issued in the future, the holders of Common Stock are 30 entitled to one vote per share on any matter submitted to a vote of the
stockholders, except that, subject to compliance with pre-meeting notice and
other conditions pursuant to the Companys Bylaws, stockholders may cumulate
their votes in an election of directors, and each stockholder may give one
candidate a number of votes equal to the number of directors to be elected
multiplied by the number of shares held by such stockholder or may distribute
such stockholders votes on the same principle among as many candidates as such
stockholder thinks fit. There are no redemption or sinking fund provisions
applicable to the Common Stock. In 1999, the Company declared a dividend distribution of one Right to
purchase SeriesA Participating Preferred Stock per share of Common Stock.
The Rights will be exercisable, unless redeemed earlier by the Company, if a
person or group acquires, or obtains the right to acquire, 15% or more of the
outstanding shares of Common Stock or commences a tender or exchange offer that
would result in it acquiring 15% or more of the outstanding shares of Common
Stock, either event occurring without the prior consent of the Company. The
amount of SeriesA Participating Preferred Stock that the holder of a
Right is entitled to receive and the purchase price payable on exercise of a
Right are both subject to adjustment. Any person or group that acquires 15% or
more of the outstanding shares of Common Stock without the prior consent of the
Company would not be entitled to this purchase. Any stockholder who holds 25%
or more of the Companys Common Stock on the date of the Rights distribution
would not be treated as having acquired 15% or more of the outstanding shares
unless such stockholders ownership is increased to more than 40% of the
outstanding shares. The Rights will expire on July 29, 2009, or they may be redeemed by the
Company at onecent per Right prior to that date. The Rights do not have
voting or dividend rights and, until they become exercisable, have no dilutive
effect on the earnings of the Company. One million shares of the Companys
Preferred Stock have been designated SeriesA Participating Preferred
Stock and reserved for issuance on exercise of the Rights. No event during 2002
made the Rights exercisable. Preferred
Stock The Board has the authority to issue the authorized and unissued
Preferred Stock in one or more series with such designations, rights and
preferences as may be determined from time to time by the Board. Accordingly,
the Board is empowered, without stockholder approval, to issue Preferred Stock
with dividend, liquidation, conversion, voting or other rights that could
adversely affect the voting power or other rights of the holders of the
Companys Common Stock. Stock
Split In August 2002, the Company completed a 2-for-1 split of its common
stock. All of the share and per share numbers have been adjusted to reflect the
stock split. Net
Income per Common Share Basic net income per common share is computed based upon the weighted
average number of common shares outstanding. Common equivalent shares, using
the treasury stock method, are included in the diluted pershare
calculations for all periods when the effect of their inclusion is dilutive. The following is a reconciliation of basic earnings per share EPS

31 Comprehensive Income Comprehensive income, which is included in the consolidated statement
of stockholders equity, is defined as net income plus other comprehensive
income. Other comprehensive income includes changes in foreign currency translation
adjustments recorded directly into stockholders equity and changes in net
unrealized gains on available-for-sale investments. Concentration
of Credit Risk Financial instruments which potentially subject the Company to
concentrations of credit risk consist of cash in banks, short-term investments
in U.S. Treasury instruments and trade accounts receivable. The Company
maintains its cash in demand deposit and money market accounts held primarily
by four banks. Accounting for Stock-based Compensation The Company maintains two stock option plans under which the Company
may grant incentive stock options and non-qualified stock options to employees,
consultants and non-employee directors. Stock options have been granted with
exercise prices at or above the fair market value on the date of grant. Options
vest and expire according to terms established at the grant date. Statement of Financial Accounting Standards SFAS No123,
Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation, encourages, but does not require,
companies to record compensation cost for stock-based employee compensation
plans based on the fair value of options granted. The Company has chosen to
account for stock based compensation using the intrinsic value method
prescribed in Accounting Principles Board APB Opinion No25,
Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees, and related interpretations.
Accordingly, because the grant price equals the market price on the date of
grant for options issued by the Company, no compensation expense is recognized
for stock options issued to employees. In December 2002, the Financial Accounting Standards Board FASB
issued SFAS No148, Accounting for Stock Based Compensation Transition
and Disclosure, which amends SFAS No123. SFAS No148 requires
more prominent and frequent disclosures about the effects of stock-based
compensation, which the Company has elected to early adopt for the year ended
December 31, 2002. Had compensation cost for the Companys stock options been recognized
based upon the estimated fair value on the grant date under the fair value
methodology prescribed by SFAS No123 see Note 13, as amended by SFAS
No148, the Companys net income and earnings per share would have been
as follows

The assumptions used to calculate the fair value of options granted are
evaluated and revised, as necessary, to reflect market conditions and the
Companys experience. In 2003, the Company will apply SFAS Statement No. 148
and SFAS Statement No. 123, and will recognize an expense for the estimated
fair value of the stock options awarded. The Company believes that the effect
on its net income in 2003 will be a charge of approximately $910,000. Adoption
of Statements of Financial Accounting Standards In July 2001, the
FASB issued SFAS Statement No. 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets
which requires that goodwill and certain other intangible assets having
indefinite lives no longer be amortized to earnings, but instead be subject to
periodic testing for impairment. Intangible assets determined to have
definitive lives will continue to be amortized over their useful lives. SFAS
Statement No. 142 is effective for the Companys fiscal year 32 beginning January
1, 2002. Goodwill and intangible assets acquired after June 30, 2001, however,
are subject immediately to the non-amortization and amortization provisions of
this Statement. The following table presents the effect of SFAS Statement No.

2. Acquisitions In January 2001, Simpson Strong-Tie International, Inc. SSTI, a
subsidiary of the Company, acquired 100% of the shares of BMF Bygningsbeslag
A/S BMF of Denmark for approximately $136 million in cash. BMF
manufactures and distributes connector products in northern and central Europe.
In August 2001, the German subsidiary of BMF purchased the remaining 51% stake
in Bulldog-Simpson GmbH Bulldog for approximately $06 million in cash. In July 2000, Simpson Strong-Tie purchased the assets of Anchor Tiedown
Systems, Inc. ATS. ATS manufactures and distributes a product line used to
anchor multi-story buildings with a threaded rod hold down system. The purchase
price was approximately $46 million in cash. In December 2000, Simpson
Strong-Tie purchased the assets of Masterset Fastening Systems, Inc.
Masterset for approximately $23 million in cash plus an earnout of up to
$03 million. Masterset sells a system of specially designed powder actuated
fasteners and installation tools. Results of operations for the entities acquired in 2001 and 2000,
accounted for under the purchase method of accounting, for periods prior to the
acquisition were not material to the Company on either an individual or
aggregate basis, and accordingly, pro forma results of operations have not been
presented. 3. Trade Accounts

still in use in the Companys operations. 6. Investments The Company has a 30% investment in Keymark Enterprises, LLC
Keymark, for which it accounts using the equity method. The Company
believes that the carrying value of its investment in Keymark exceeds its fair
value and therefore has written down the value of its investment to zero. The
Companys equity in the earnings or losses of this investment or its initial
49% investment in Bulldog see Note 2 has not been material in any of the
three years in the period ended December31, 2002. 34 Available-For-Sale

The revolving lines of credit are guaranteed by the Company and its
subsidiaries. At December 31, 2002, the Company had four outstanding standby
letters of credit. Two of these letters of credit, in the aggregate amount of
$2,132,038, were used to support the Companys self-insured workers
compensation insurance requirements. The other two, in the amounts of $753,833
and $262,550 were used, respectively, to guarantee performance on the Companys
leased facility in the UK and on public improvement costs associated with the
construction of the Companys facilities in Stockton, California. These letters
of credit mature in September 2003 and November 2003. 9. Commitments and
Contingencies Leases Certain properties occupied by the Company are leased. The leases
expire at various dates through 2012 and generally require the Company to
assume the obligations for insurance, property taxes, and maintenance of the
facilities. 36 Some of the properties were leased from partnerships formed by certain
current and former Company stockholders, directors, officers and employees.
Rental expenses under these related party leases were as follows

In June 2001, the Company purchased the property that was subject to
the lease with Simpson Investment Company for approximately $17 million See
Note 12. Rental expense for 2002, 2001 and 2000 with respect to all other
leased property was approximately $4,091,000, $3,790,000 and $2,658,000,
respectively. At December 31, 2002, minimum rental commitments under all
noncancelable leases are as follows

Some of these minimum rental commitments that involve the related
parties described above contain renewal options and provide for periodic rental
adjustments based on changes in the consumer price index or current market
rental rates. The nominal term of SSTIs lease in the United Kingdom is 25 years but
includes an option to terminate without penalty in either the fifteenth or
twentieth year upon one year written notice by SSTI. Future minimum rental
payments associated with the first 15 years of this lease are included in
minimum rental commitments in the table above. Environmental The Companys policy with regard to environmental liabilities is to
accrue for future environmental assessments and remediation costs as they are
discovered and become estimable. At two of the Companys operating facilities, evidence of contamination
resulting from activities of prior occupants was discovered. The Company took
certain remedial actions at one facility in 1990 and continues to monitor the
condition of this property. The Company does not believe that any further
action will be required. The Company has been informed by the lessor of the
other facility, Vicksburg Investors, that appropriate remedial action has been
taken. The Company does not believe that either of these matters will have a
material adverse effect on its financial condition, cash flows or results of
operations. Litigation From time to time, the Company is involved in
litigation that it considers to be in the normal course of its business. No
such litigation within the last five years resulted in any material loss. The
Company is not engaged in any legal proceedings as of the date hereof, which
the Company expects individually or in the aggregate to have a material adverse
effect on the Companys financial condition, cash flows or results of
operations. 37 10. Income Taxes The provision for income taxes consists of the following

No valuation allowance has been recorded for deferred tax assets for
the years ended December31, 2002, 2001 and 2000, due to the Companys
taxable income in 2002 and prior years. 38 11. Retirement Plans The Company has six retirement plans covering substantially all
salaried employees and nonunion hourly employees. Two of the plans, covering
U.S. employees, provide for annual contributions in amounts that the Board of
Directors may authorize, subject to certain limitations, but in no event more
than the amounts permitted under the Internal Revenue Code as deductible
expense. The other four plans, covering the Companys European and Canadian
employees, require the Company to make contributions ranging from 3% to 15% of
the employees compensation. The total cost for these retirement plans for the
years ended December31, 2002, 2001 and 2000, was approximately
$5,197,000, $4,769,000 and $4,009,000, respectively. The Company also contributes to various industry-wide, union-sponsored
defined benefit pension funds for union, hourly employees. Payments to these
funds aggregated approximately $1,524,000, $1,077,000 and $1,149,000 for the
years ended December31, 2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively. 12. Related Party
Transactions The Company paid $550,472 and $800,000 in 2002 and 2001, respectively,
to Keymark, of which it has a 30% ownership interest. The payments were related
to the development of specified features in the Keymark software as well as for
expenses related to marketing the software. In 2001, the Company purchased the property that was subject to the
lease with Simpson Investment Company for approximately $17 million See Note
9. Refer to Note 9 regarding related party transactions involving Company
leases. 13. Stock Bonus and
Stock Option Plans The Company applies APB Opinion 25, Accounting for Stock Issued to
Employees, and related interpretations in accounting for its stock option
plans. Accordingly, no compensation cost has been recognized for its
non-qualified stock option plan as stock options granted under this plan have
an exercise price equal to 100% of the market price on the date of grant. If
the compensation cost for this plan had been determined based on the fair value
at the grant dates for awards consistent with the method of SFAS No. 123, the
pro forma effect on the Companys net income and earnings per share in 2002,
2001 and 2000 would have been

The fair value of each option granted was estimated on the date of
grant using the Black-Sholes option-pricing model with the following
assumptions for 2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively: risk-free interest rate of
401%, 446% and 486% for 2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively; no dividend yield
for all years; expected lives of 62 years for options committed to be granted
for 2002 and 62 years and 63 years for options granted for 2001 and 2000,
respectively; and volatility of 292% for 2002, 298% for 2001 and 297% for
2000. The weighted average fair value per share of options granted during 2002,
2001 and 2000 was $1234, $1118 and $1089, respectively. 39 The Company currently has two stock option plans. One is principally
for the Companys employees and the other is for the Companys independent
directors. Participants are granted options only if the company-wide and/or
profit center operating goals, established by the Compensation Committee of the
Board of Directors at the beginning of the year, are met. In 2002, the Company
met most of the operating goals established for both of its stock option plans
and has committed to grant options to purchase 503,500 shares. During 2001 and
2000, the Company met some of the operating goals established for one of its
stock option plans, and accordingly, granted options to purchase 19,000 and
14,000 shares for 2001 and 2000, respectively. These options have an exercise
price range of $3290 to $3619 per share for 2002, an exercise price of $2865
for 2001 and an exercise price of $2550 per share for 2000. The following table summarizes the Companys stock option activity for

The tax benefit to the Company from the exercise
of stock options, a reduction of the Companys income tax payable, was
$1,800,785, $3,012,659 and $1,054,238 for 2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively. The Company also maintains a Stock Bonus Plan whereby, for each ten
years of continuous employment with the Company, each employee who does not
participate in one of the Companys stock option plans receives up to 200 shares
of common stock. In 2002, 2001 and 2000,
the Company committed to issue 8,800, 5,000 and 5,400 shares, respectively,
which resulted in compensation charges of $505,187, $254,611 and $210,359,
respectively. These employees are also compensated for the income taxes payable
as a result of the stock bonuses. The shares are issued in the year following
the year in which they are earned. Starting in 2003, the Company will apply SFAS Statement No. 148 and SFAS Statement No. 123, and will
recognize an expense for the estimated fair value of the stock options awarded.
In accordance with SFAS No. 123 40 the expense will be recorded over the vesting period of the option
commencing in the year in which the option is granted rather than during the
year in which they were earned. Accordingly, there will be a difference in the
amount expensed and the pro forma expense disclosure under SFAS Statement No.
123. 14. Segment Information The Company is organized into two primary segments. The segments are
defined by types of products manufactured, marketed and distributed to the
Companys customers. The two product segments are construction connector
products and venting products. These segments are differentiated in several
ways, including the types of materials used, the production processes, the
distribution channels used and the applications in which the products are used.
Transactions between the two segments were immaterial for each of the years
presented. The following table illustrates certain measurements used by management
to assess the performance of the segments described above as of December 31,
2002, 2001 and 2000, or for the years then ended
