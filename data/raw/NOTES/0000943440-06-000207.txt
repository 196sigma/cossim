PetMed Express, Inc. and Subsidiaries
We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of
PetMed Express, Inc. and Subsidiaries the Company as of March
31, 2006 and 2005, and the related consolidated statements of
income, changes in shareholders' equity and cash flows for each
of the three years in the period ended March 31, 2006. These
consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the
Company management. Our responsibility is to express an
opinion on these consolidated financial statements based on our
audits.
We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the
Public Company Accounting Oversight Board United States. Those
standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are
free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a
test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in
the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the
accounting principles used and significant estimates made by
management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement
presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable
basis for our opinion.
In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to
above present fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated
financial position of PetMed Express, Inc. and Subsidiaries as of
March 31, 2006 and 2005, and the results of their operations and
their cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended
March 31, 2006, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted
accounting principles.
We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the
Public Company Accounting Oversight Board United States, the
effectiveness of the Company internal control over financial
reporting as of March 31, 2006, based on criteria established in
Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of
Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission COSO, and
our report dated May 11, 2006 expressed an unqualified opinion
thereon. s/ Goldstein Golub Kessler LLP

1 Summary of Significant Accounting Policies
Organization
PetMed Express, Inc. and subsidiaries, d/b/a 1-800-PetMeds,
the Company is a leading nationwide pet pharmacy. The
Company markets and sells prescription and non-prescription
pet medications and other health products for dogs, cats
and horses direct to the consumer.
The Company markets its products through national
television, on-line and direct mail/print advertising
campaigns, which aim to increase the recognition of the
1-800-PetMeds brand name, increase traffic on its website
at www1800petmeds.com, acquire new customers, and maximize
repeat purchases. The majority of all of the Company
sales are to residents in the United States. The Company
executive offices are located in Pompano Beach, Florida.
The Company fiscal year end is March 31. References
herein to fiscal 2006, 2005, or 2004 refer to the Company
fiscal years ended March 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004,
respectively.
Principles of Consolidation
The consolidated financial statements include the accounts
of the Company and its two wholly owned subsidiaries. All
significant intercompany transactions have been eliminated
in consolidation.
Revenue Recognition
The Company generates revenue by selling pet medication
products primarily to retail consumers and minimally to
wholesale customers. The Company policy is to recognize
revenue from product sales upon shipment, when the rights
of ownership and risk of loss have passed to the consumer.
Outbound shipping and handling fees are included in sales
and are billed upon shipment. Shipping expenses are
included in cost of sales.
The majority of the Company sales are paid by credit
cards and the Company usually receives the cash settlement
in two to three banking days. Credit card sales minimize
the accounts receivable balances relative to sales. The
Company maintains an allowance for doubtful accounts for
losses that the Company estimates will arise from the
customers' inability to make required payments, arising
from either credit card charge-backs or insufficient funds
checks. The Company determines its estimates of the
uncollectibility of accounts receivable by analyzing
historical bad debts and current economic trends. At March
31, 2006 and 2005 the allowance for doubtful accounts was
approximately $23,000 and $37,000, respectively.
Cash and Cash Equivalents
The Company considers all highly liquid investments with
maturity of three months or less when purchased to be cash
equivalents. Cash and cash equivalents at March 31, 2006
and 2005, consist of the Company cash accounts, overnight
repurchase agreements, and short-term investments with a
maturity of three months or less. The carrying amount of
cash equivalents approximates fair value. The Company
maintains its cash in bank deposit accounts which, at
times, may exceed federally insured limits. The Company
has not experienced any losses in such accounts.
Use of Estimates
The preparation of consolidated financial statements in
conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in
the United States of America requires management to make
estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts
of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent
assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated
financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues
and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results
could differ from those estimates.                27      NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
1 Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Continued
Inventories
Inventories consist of prescription and non-prescription
pet medications and pet supplies that are available for
sale and are priced at the lower of cost or market value
using a weighted average cost method. The Company writes
down its inventory for estimated obsolescence. The
inventory reserve was approximately $306,000 and $228,000
at March 31, 2006 and 2005, respectively.
Property and Equipment
Property and equipment are stated at cost and depreciated
using the straight-line method over the estimated useful
lives of the assets. The furniture, fixtures, equipment
and computer software are depreciated over periods ranging
from three to seven years. Leasehold improvements and
assets under capital lease agreements are amortized over
the shorter of the underlying lease agreement or the useful
life of the asset.
Long-lived Assets
Long-lived assets are reviewed for impairment whenever
events or changes in circumstances indicate that the
carrying amount may not be recoverable. Recoverability of
assets is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount
of the asset to net future cash flows expected to be
generated from the asset.
Intangible Asset
The intangible asset consists of a toll-free telephone
number. In accordance with the Statement of Financial
Accounting Standards SFAS No. 142, Goodwill and Other
Intangible Assets, the intangible asset is not being
amortized, and is subject to an annual review for
impairment.
Advertising
The Company advertising expenses consists primarily of
television advertising, internet marketing, and direct
mail/print advertising. Television costs are expensed as
the advertisements are televised. Internet costs are
expensed in the month incurred and direct mail/print
advertising costs are expensed when the related catalog and
postcards are produced, distributed or superseded.
Fair Value of Financial Instruments
The carrying amounts of the Company cash and cash
equivalents, accounts receivable and accounts payable
approximate fair value due to the short-term nature of
these instruments. The carrying amount of the loan payable
approximated fair value as their interest rates
approximated current market rates.
Comprehensive Income
The Company applies SFAS No. 130, Reporting Comprehensive
Income, which requires that all items that are recognized
under accounting standards as components of comprehensive
income be reported in a financial statement that is
displayed with the same prominence as other financial
statements. The items of other comprehensive income that
are typically required to be displayed are foreign currency
items, minimum pension liability adjustments and unrealized
gains and losses on certain investments in debt and equity
securities. There were no items of other comprehensive
income for any periods presented herein.
Income Taxes
The Company accounts for income taxes under the provisions
of SFAS No. 109, Accounting for Income Taxes, which
generally requires recognition of deferred tax assets and
liabilities for the expected future tax benefits or
consequences of events that have been included in the
consolidated financial statements or tax returns. Under
this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are
determined based on differences between the financial
reporting carrying values and the tax bases of assets and
liabilities, and are measured by applying enacted tax rates
and laws for the taxable years in which those differences
are expected to reverse.                28      NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation
The Company accounts for employee stock options using the
intrinsic value method as prescribed by Accounting
Principles Board Opinion APB No. 25, Accounting for
Stock Issued to Employees. The Company follows the
disclosure provisions of SFAS No. 123, Accounting for
Stock-Based Compensation, for employee stock options. Had
the Company determined employee compensation cost based on
the fair value at the grant date for its stock options
under SFAS No. 123, the Company net income would have

Recent Accounting Pronouncements
In December 2004, the Financial Accounting Standards Board
issued SFAS No. 123R, Share Based Payment, which is a
revision of SFAS No. 123. This Statement supersedes APB
No. 25, which is the basis for the Company current policy
on accounting for stock-based compensation.  SFAS No. 123R
will require companies to recognize as an expense in the
Statement of Income the grant-date fair value of stock
options and other equity-based compensation issued to
employees. SFAS No. 123R is effective for the Company as
of April 1, 2006, the beginning of the quarter ending June
30, 2006. Under the methods of adoption allowed by the
standard, awards that are granted, modified, or settled
after the date of adoption should be measured and accounted
for in accordance with SFAS No. 123R. The fair value of
unvested equity-classified awards that were granted prior
to the effective date should be measured in accordance with
SFAS No. 123 and recognized as compensation expense in the
Statement of Income.
Previously reported amounts may be restated for all periods
presented or adopted at the beginning of the fiscal year to
reflect the SFAS No. 123R amounts in the Statement of
Income. Pro forma disclosures about the fair value method
and the impact on net income and net income per common
share appear in the above table. The Company is evaluating
the requirements of SFAS No. 123R and expects that the
adoption of SFAS No. 123R may have a material impact on its
consolidated statements of income and earnings per share,
similar to the current pro forma disclosures under FAS 123
as per above.
The Company does not believe that any other recently
issued, but not yet effective, accounting standard, if
currently adopted, will have a material effect on the
Company consolidated financial position, results of
operations or cash flows.                29      NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

Scholes option-pricing model, as prescribed by SFAS No.
123, with the following weighted-average assumptions:
dividend yield 00 percent; risk-free interest rates of
600 percent; expected lives of 3-5 years, and expected
volatility of 91 percent. As of March 31, 2005 all of the
3,000,000 warrants issued on November 22, 2000 were
exercised.                33      NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
8 Net Income Per Share
In accordance with the provisions of SFAS No. 128,
Earnings Per Share, basic net income per share is
computed by dividing net income available to common
shareholders by the weighted average number of common
shares outstanding during the period. Diluted net income
per share includes the dilutive effect of potential stock
issuances, calculated using the treasury stock method.
Outstanding stock options, warrants, and convertible
preferred shares issued by the Company represent the only
dilutive effect reflected in diluted weighted average
shares outstanding. The following is a reconciliation of
the numerators and denominators of the basic and diluted
net income per share computations for the periods
presented                            Year Ended March 31,
2006     2005     2004

Diluted                  $   050  $   034  $   025
At March 31, 2006, all common stock options were included
in the diluted net income per share computation as their
exercise prices were less than the average market price of
the common shares for the period. At March 31, 2005 and
2004, 485,500 and 305,000 common stock options,
respectively, with a weighted average exercise price of
$969 and $1016, respectively, were excluded from the
diluted net income per share computation as their exercise
prices were greater than the average market price of the
common shares for the period, therefore the effect would
have been anti-dilutive.

Legal Matters
The Company is a defendant in a lawsuit, filed in August
2002, in Texas state district court seeking injunctive and
monetary relief styled Texas State Board of Pharmacy and
State Board of Veterinary Medical Examiners v. PetMed
Express, Inc. Cause No.GN-202514, in the 201st Judicial
District Court, Travis County, Texas. The Company in its
initial pleading denied the allegations contained therein.
The Company is vigorously defending, is confident of its
compliance with the applicable law, and finds wrong-on-the-
facts the vast majority of the allegations contained in the
Plaintiffs' supporting documentation attached to the
lawsuit. We are currently negotiating a settlement of the
matter, although there can be no assurances that the
negotiations will be successful. Thus, at this stage it is
difficult to assess the outcome or estimate any potential
loss in the event of an adverse outcome.
On January 19, 2006, PetMed Express, Inc. was added as a
defendant in the matter of Yali Golan v. Marc Puleo former
President and current Chairman of the Board of Directors of
the Company, filed in the Circuit Court of the Eleventh
Judicial Circuit in and for Miami-Dade County, Florida
which had originally been filed solely against Dr. Puleo in
March 2003. This action is based upon allegations by the
plaintiff that Dr. Puleo individually entered into a
written agreement with the plaintiff the purported
General Agreement, of which the plaintiff has not
produced an original document which in pertinent part
granted plaintiff 50% of any salary, stock or stock options
received by Dr. Puleo from the Company for so long as the
Company remains in business. The plaintiff now alleges that
the Company past and continuing failure to disclose the
purported General Agreement in filings with the SEC has
caused the plaintiff to suffer damages. The plaintiff is
seeking a judgment against the Company for specific
performance and unspecified damages, pre- and post-judgment
interest, court fees and such other relief as the court
deems appropriate. The Company believes that, based on
information currently available to it, the claims being
asserted against it are factually and legally without
merit, and the Company intends to vigorously defend against
such claims.
Routine Proceedings
The Company is a party to routine litigation and
administrative complaints incidental to its business.
Management does not believe that the resolution of any or
all of such routine litigation and administrative
complaints is likely to have a material adverse effect on
the Company financial condition or results of operations.
The Company has settled complaints that had been filed with
various states' pharmacy boards in the past. There can be
no assurances made that other states will not attempt to
take similar actions against the Company in the future.
Legal costs related to the above matters are expensed as
incurred.
Employment Agreements
On March 16, 2001, the Company entered into an employment
agreement with its Chief Executive Officer CEO,
Menderes Akdag Mr. Akdag. Under the terms of this
three-year agreement the Company paid the CEO an annual
salary of $150,000 for the first six months of the
agreement, and thereafter his annual salary was increased
to $200,000. The Company also granted the CEO options to
purchase 750,000 shares of its common stock under the
Company 1998 Stock Option Plan at an exercise price of
$32 per share, which vested at the rate of 187,500 options
on each of March 16, 2001, 2002, 2003 and 2004.
On March 16, 2004, the Company amended the CEO existing
employment agreement. The amendments are as follows: the
term of the agreement was for three years, commencing on
March 16, 2004; Mr. Akdag salary was increased to
$250,000 per year throughout the term of the agreement, and
Mr. Akdag was granted 250,000 incentive stock options under
the Company 1998 Stock Option Plan at an exercise price
of $1064 per share, which vest at the rate of 83,333
options on each of March 16, 2005 and 2006, and 83,334

integrity of the Consolidated Financial Statements appearing in
our Annual Report on Form 10-K. The financial statements were
prepared in conformity with generally accepted accounting
principles appropriate in the circumstances and, accordingly,
include certain amounts based on our best judgments and
estimates. Financial information in the Annual report of Form
10-K is consistent with that in the financial statements.
Management of the Company is responsible for establishing and
maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting,
as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15f under the Securities
Exchange Act of 1934 Exchange Act. The Company internal
control over financial reporting is designed to provide
reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial
reporting and the preparation of the Consolidated Financial
Statements. Our internal control over financial reporting is
supported by a team of consultants and appropriate reviews by
management, written policies and guidelines, careful selection
and training of qualified personnel and a written Corporate Code
of Business Conduct and Ethics adopted by our Company Board of
Directors, applicable to all Company Directors and all officers
and employees of our Company and subsidiaries.
Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over
financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements and
even when determined to be effective, can only provide reasonable
assurance with respect to financial statement preparation and
presentation. Also, projections of any evaluation of
effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that
controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions,
or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures
may deteriorate.
The Audit Committee Committee of our Company Board of
Directors, comprised solely of Directors who are independent in
accordance with the requirements of the Nasdaq National Market
listing standards, the Exchange Act and the Company Corporate
Governance Guidelines, meets with the independent auditors and
management periodically to discuss internal control over
financial reporting and auditing and financial reporting matters.
The Committee reviews with the independent auditors the scope and
results of the audit effort. The Committee also meets
periodically with the independent auditors without management
present to ensure that the independent auditors have free access
to the Committee. Our Audit Committee Report can be found in
the Company 2006 Proxy Statement.
Management assessed the effectiveness of the Company internal
control over financial reporting as of March 31, 2006. In making
this assessment, management used the criteria set forth by the
Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission
COSO in Internal Control - Integrated Framework. Based on our
assessment, management believes that the Company maintained
effective internal control over financial reporting as of March
31, 2006 The Company independent auditors, Goldstein Golub Kessler LLP,

May 11, 2006                38  REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM
ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING The Board of Directors and Stockholders
PetMed Express, Inc. We have audited management assessment, included in the
accompanying Management Report on Internal Control over
Financial Reporting, that PetMed Express, Inc. maintained
effective internal control over financial reporting as of March
31, 2006, based on criteria established in Internal Control-
Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring
Organizations of the Treadway Commission COSO. PetMed Express,
Inc. management is responsible for maintaining effective
internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment
of the effectiveness of internal control over financial
reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on
management assessment and an opinion on the effectiveness of
the company internal control over financial reporting based on
our audit.
We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the
Public Company Accounting Oversight Board United States. Those
standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control
over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.
Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control
over financial reporting, evaluating management assessment,
testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of
internal control, and performing such other procedures as we
considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our
audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.
A company internal control over financial reporting is a
process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the
reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of
financial statements for external purposes in accordance with
generally accepted accounting principles. A company internal
control over financial reporting includes those policies and
procedures that 1 pertain to the maintenance of records that,
in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the
transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; 2
provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as
necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in
accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and
that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only
in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of
the company; and 3 provide reasonable assurance regarding
prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use,
or disposition of the company assets that could have a material
effect on the financial statements.
Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over
financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.
Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future
periods are subject to the risk that controls may become
inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree
of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
In our opinion, management assessment that PetMed Express, Inc.
maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as
of March 31, 2006 is fairly stated, in all material respects,
based on criteria established in Internal Control-Integrated
Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of
the Treadway Commission COSO. Also in our opinion, PetMed
Express, Inc. maintained, in all material respects, effective
internal control over financial reporting as of March 31, 2006,
based on criteria established in Internal Control-Integrated
Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of
the Treadway Commission COSO.
We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the
Public Company Accounting Oversight Board United States, the
March 31, 2006 consolidated financial statements of PetMed
Express, Inc. and our report dated May 11, 2006 expressed an
unqualified opinion on those financial statements. s/ Goldstein Golub Kessler LLP
