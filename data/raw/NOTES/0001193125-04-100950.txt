REPORT OF INDEPENDENT AUDITORS  The Board of
Directors and Shareholders Keystone Automotive Industries, Inc.  We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Keystone Automotive Industries, Inc. and subsidiaries as of March 26, 2004 and March 28,
2003, and the related consolidated statements of operations, shareholders equity, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended March 26, 2004. Our audits also included the financial statement schedule listed in the index at
d. These financial statements and schedule are the responsibility of the Companys management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements and schedule based on our audits.  We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public
Company Accounting Oversight Board United States. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a
test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial
statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.  In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated financial position of Keystone Automotive Industries, Inc. at March 26, 2004 and March 28, 2003 and
the consolidated results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended March 26, 2004, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. Also, in our opinion the related financial statement
schedule, when considered in relation to the basic financial statements taken as a whole, presents fairly, in all material respects the information set forth therein.  As discussed in Note 1, Keystone Automotive Industries, Inc. changed its method of accounting for goodwill and other
intangible assets effective March 31, 2001.  /s/ERNST YOUNG LLP  Los Angeles, California June 3, 2004

KEYSTONE AUTOMOTIVE INDUSTRIES, INC.  NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  March 26, 2004  1.SUMMARY OF
SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES  Principles of
Consolidation  The accompanying consolidated financial
statements include the accounts of Keystone Automotive Industries, Inc. Keystone and its wholly owned subsidiaries. Significant subsidiaries included in the consolidated financial statements include Keystone Automotive Industries MN,
Inc. formerly North Star Plating Co., Keystone Automotive Industries FL, Inc. formerly Inteuro Parts Distributors, Inc. and Keystone Automotive Industries Resources, Inc. formerly Republic Automotive Parts, Inc. collectively with Keystone,
the Company. All significant intercompany transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.  Business Information  The Company operates in one business segment. The principal business of the Company is the distribution of collision replacement parts for automobiles and
light trucks to collision repair shops through a network of distribution centers located within the United States, eight in Canada and one in Mexico.  The Companys product offerings, comprised of more than 19,000 stock keeping units, may be divided into four primary categories: i the
Companys core business continues to be automotive body parts which consist primarily of fenders, hoods, headlight and taillight assemblies, radiators, condensers and grilles, ii the Company distributes new and remanufactured plastic bumper
covers and steel bumpers manufactured by multiple domestic and foreign manufacturers, iii the Company distributes paint and other materials used in repairing a damaged vehicle primarily to repair shops and iv the Company distributes wheels and
related products.  Fiscal Year  The Company uses a 52/53 week fiscal year. The Companys fiscal year
ends on the last Friday of March. The fiscal years ended March 26, 2004, March 28, 2003 and March 29, 2002 each included 52 weeks, respectively. The fiscal year ending March 25, 2005 is a 53 week year.  Accounting Estimates  The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting
principles generally accepted in the United States requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial
statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from these estimates.  Concentrations of Risk  Accounts receivable subject the Company to a potential concentration of credit risk. Substantially all of the Companys customers are in the auto
body repair business, none representing more than 1% of sales. The Company performs periodic credit evaluations of its customers financial condition and generally does not require collateral. Receivables are generally due within 30 days.
Credit losses have consistently been within managements expectations.  During each of 2004 and 2003, the Company imported 38% of its products directly or indirectly from the Far East. 
31 Table of Contents KEYSTONE AUTOMOTIVE INDUSTRIES, INC.  NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTSContinued
Fair Values of Financial Instruments  Fair values of cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, accounts
payable, credit facility and other short-term obligations approximate cost due to the short period of time to maturity.  Cash Equivalents  The Company considers all highly liquid instruments with an original maturity of three months or less when purchased to be cash equivalents. Cash and cash
equivalents are held by major financial institutions.  Inventories  The Companys inventories
consist primarily of automotive aftermarket collision replacement parts, paint and related items. Inventories are stated at the lower of cost first-in, first-out method or market.  Long-Lived Assets  The Company reviews the recoverability of its long-lived assets as required by Statement of Financial Accounting Standards SFAS No. 144,
Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets, whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of such assets may not be recoverable. The estimated future cash flows are based upon, among other things,
assumptions about expected future operating performance, and may differ from actual cash flows. Long-lived assets evaluated for impairment are grouped with other assets to the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are largely independent of
the cash flows of other groups of assets and liabilities. If the sum of the projected undiscounted cash flows excluding interest is less than the carrying value of the assets, the assets will be written down to the estimated fair value in the
period in which the determination is made. The Company has determined that no impairment of long-lived assets exists as of March 26, 2004.  Depreciation and Amortization  The Company uses the straight-line method for calculating depreciation and amortization of property, plant, and equipment over the following estimated
useful lives:  Buildings
20 years
Machinery and equipment
512 years
Furniture and fixtures
57 years
Auto and truck
35 years
Leasehold improvements
Term of lease or life of the asset, whichever is shorter
Goodwill and Other
Intangibles  In July 2001, the Financial Accounting
Standards Board FASB issued SFAS No. 141, Business Combinations. SFAS No. 141 supersedes Accounting Principle Board Opinion APB No. 16 Business Combinations and SFAS No. 38 Accounting for Preacquisition
Contingencies of Purchased Enterprises. SFAS No. 141 requires all business combinations initiated after June 30, 2001 to be accounted for using the purchase method. The Company implemented SFAS No. 141 on March 31, 2001. This statement did not
have a material effect on the Companys consolidated financial position or results of operations. 
32 Table of Contents KEYSTONE AUTOMOTIVE INDUSTRIES, INC.  NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTSContinued
The Company elected to early adopt the provisions of SFAS No. 142, Goodwill and Other
Intangible Assets, which supersedes AFB No. 17. SFAS No. 142 applies to goodwill and intangible assets acquired after June 30, 2001, as well as goodwill and intangible assets previously acquired. Under this statement, goodwill as well as
certain other intangible assets, determined to have an infinite life, will no longer be amortized. These assets will be reviewed for impairment on a periodic basis. The Company early adopted SFAS No. 142 effective March 31, 2001. Consequently, all
goodwill on the Companys balance sheet from that date forward is no longer subject to amortization. Other intangibles, consisting of covenants not to compete with finite lives, will continue to be amortized over the term of the respective
covenant. Pursuant to SFAS No. 142, the Company performed a transitional assessment of impairment of goodwill and other intangibles by applying a fair-value-based test and determined that the Companys goodwill was impaired.  Subsequent to the adoption of SFAS No. 142, goodwill, representing the excess
of the purchase price over the fair values of the net assets of acquired entities, is not amortized, but is subject to an annual impairment review as provided in SFAS No. 142. Other intangibles are comprised of covenants not to compete. Covenants
not to compete are amortized using the straight-line method over the terms of the agreements, generally 35 years.  Revenue Recognition  The Company recognizes revenue upon concluding that all of the fundamental criteria for product revenue recognition have been met. Such criteria are
usually met at the time title passes to the customer, typically at the time of delivery or shipment. The costs related to shipping and handling fees are included in selling and distribution expenses. The Company provides its customers the right to
return products that are damaged or defective. The effect of these programs is estimated and current period sales and costs of sales are reduced accordingly.  Stock-Based Compensation  The Company elected to continue to account for stock-based compensation plans using the intrinsic value-based method of accounting prescribed by APB No.
25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees, and related interpretations. Under the provisions of APB No. 25, compensation expense is measured at the grant date for the difference between the fair value of the stock and the exercise
price. The Company has not granted stock options at less than the fair value of the stock at the date of grant.  New Accounting Standards  In April 2003, the FASB issued SFAS No. 149, Amendment of Statement 133 on Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities, which amends and
clarifies financial accounting and reporting derivative instruments, including certain derivative instruments embedded in other contracts and for hedging activities under SFAS No. 133, Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging
Activities. This statement is effective for contracts entered into or modified and for hedging relationships designated after June 30, 2003. The adoption of this statement did not have a material impact on its operating results or financial
position of the Company.  In June 2002, the FASB issued SFAS
No. 146, Accounting for Costs Associated with Exit or Disposal Activities, which addresses issues regarding the recognition, measurement and reporting of costs associated with exit and disposal activities, including restructuring
activities. This statement requires that costs associated with exit or disposal activities be recognized when they are incurred rather than at the date of commitment to an exit or disposal plan. The implementation of this Standard did not have a
material effect on the Company. 
33 Table of Contents KEYSTONE AUTOMOTIVE INDUSTRIES, INC.  NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTSContinued
In November 2002, the FASB issued Interpretation No. 45 FIN 45, Guarantors Accounting and
Disclosure Requirements for Guarantees, Including Indirect Guarantees of Indebtedness of Others. FIN 45 clarifies the requirements of SFAS No. 5, Accounting for Contingencies, relating to a guarantors accounting for, and disclosure of, the
issuance of certain types of guarantees. For certain guarantees issued after December 31, 2002, FIN 45 requires a guarantor to recognize, upon issuance of a guarantee, a liability for the fair value of the obligations it assumes under the guarantee.
Guarantees issued prior to January 1, 2003, are not subject to liability recognition, but are subject to expanded disclosure requirements. The adoption of this Interpretation did not have a material impact on the Companys consolidated
financial position or statement of operations.  In August 2001,
the FASB issued SFAS No. 143, Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations which is effective for fiscal years beginning after June 15, 2002, SFAS No. 143 requires legal obligations associated with the retirement of long-lives assets to be
recognized at their fair value at the time the obligations are incurred. Upon initial recognition of a liability, that cost should be capitalized as part of the related long-lived asset and allocated to expense over the estimated useful life of the
asset. SFAS No. 143 was adopted by the Company on March 29, 2003 and did not have a material impact on the Companys financial position or results of operations.  In January 2003, the FASB issued Interpretation No. 46 FIN 46, Consolidation of Variable Interest
Entities. FIN 46 clarifies the application of Accounting Research Bulletin No., 51 and applied immediately to any variable interest entities created after January 31, 2003 and to variable interest entities in which an interest is obtained after
that date. FIN 46 became effective immediately for variable interest entities formed after January 31, 2003 became effective in the third quarter of 2003 for any variable interest entities formed prior to February 1, 2003. This interpretation
required variable interest entities to be consolidated if the equity investment at risk is not sufficient to permit an entity to finance its activities without support from other parties or the equity investors lack specific characteristics. FIN 46
was adopted by the Company on September 30, 2003 and did not have a material impact on the Companys financial position or results of operations.  In May 2003, the FASB issued SFAS No. 150, Accounting for Certain Financial Instruments with Characteristics of both Liabilities and Equity, effective for
financial instruments entered into or modified after May 31, 2003, and otherwise is effective at the beginning of the first interim period beginning after June 15, 2003. SFAS No. 150 was adopted by the Company on June 15, 2003 and did not have a
material impact on the Companys financial position or results of operations.  In December 2003 the FASB issued SFAS No. 132 Revised, Employers Disclosure about Pensions and Other Postretirement Benefits. SFAS No. 132 Revised retained disclosure requirements of the original SFAS
No. 132 and requires additional disclosures relating to assets, obligations, cash flows and net periodic benefit cost. SFAS No. 132 Revised is effective for fiscal years ending after December 15, 2003, except that certain disclosures are effective
for fiscal years ending after June 15, 2004. Interim period disclosures are effective for interim periods beginning after December 15, 2003. The adoption of the disclosure provisions of SFAS No. 132 Revised did not have a material impact on the
Companys financial position or results of operations.  2.ACQUISITIONS  During
fiscal 2004, the Company acquired certain assets of the following businesses: Landmark Auto Parts, a distributor of aftermarket collision replacement parts in Newport News, Virginia in May 2003; U.S. Crash Parts, a distributor of aftermarket
collision parts in Lexington, Kentucky in June 2003; Kansas Bumper/MOKAN, a distributor of aftermarket collision replacement parts in Kansas City, Lawrence, Topeka, Manhattan, Wichita and Liberal, Kansas in September 2003; and Sams Nu-Chrome
Bumper, a distributor of bumpers in New Orleans, Louisiana in December 2003. In addition, the Company acquired all of the outstanding capital stock of 
34 Table of Contents KEYSTONE AUTOMOTIVE INDUSTRIES, INC.  NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTSContinued
two Canadian distributors of aftermarket collision replacement parts. The Company acquired MultiPro in August 2003, with locations in Drummondville,
Montreal, Quebec, Ottawa and Sherbrooke, Canada and Quinte in January 2004, with locations in Trenton, Toronto, Ottawa and Montreal, Canada. The Company acquired these companies for approximately $159 million in cash, net of cash received. All of
these acquisitions were accounted for under the purchase method of accounting and accordingly the assets and liabilities of the acquired entities have been recorded at their estimated fair value at the dates of acquisition. The excess of purchase
price over the estimated fair values of the assets acquired was approximately $68 million and has been recorded as goodwill. The consolidated financial statements include the results of operations for each business for all periods subsequent to the
applicable purchase date. The results for fiscal 2004 and 2003, assuming that these acquisitions had been made at the beginning of fiscal 2003, would not have been materially different from the results presented.  During fiscal 2003, the Company acquired certain assets of the following
businesses: Perfect Cooling Industries, Inc., a distributor of aftermarket radiators and condensers with operations in Carson, California, Chicago, Illinois, Norcross, Georgia and Bensalem Township, Pennsylvania in April 2002; Arizona Plating, a
bumper recycling facility in Phoenix, Arizona in April 2002; and Advance Plating, a distributor of aftermarket collision replacement parts in Republic, Missouri in January 2003. The Company acquired these three companies for approximately $67
million in cash, net of cash received. All of these acquisitions were accounted for under the purchase method of accounting and accordingly the assets and liabilities of the acquired entities have been recorded at their estimated fair value at the
dates of acquisition. The excess of purchase price over the estimated fair values of the assets acquired was approximately $09 million and has been recorded as goodwill. The consolidated financial statements include the results of operations for
each business for all periods subsequent to the applicable purchase date. The results for fiscal 2003 and 2002, assuming that these acquisitions had been made at the beginning of fiscal 2002, would not have been materially different from the results
presented.  During fiscal 2002, the Company acquired certain
assets of the following businesses: After Crash, Inc., a distributor of aftermarket collision replacement parts in Baton Rouge, Louisiana in July 2001; I.W.C. International, Inc., a distributor of aftermarket wheel covers and center caps for
automobiles and light trucks, with operations in Tampa, Florida, Hanover, Massachusetts, Haltom City, Texas, Hayward, California and Quincy, Illinois in January 2002; and Indiana Distributors incorporated, a distributor of aftermarket collision
replacement parts in Elkhart, Indiana in January 2002. In addition, the Company acquired all of the outstanding capital stock of P-G Products, Inc., a distributor of aftermarket collision replacement parts in Cincinnati, Ohio in January 2002. The
Company acquired these four companies for approximately $68 million cash, net of cash received. All of these acquisitions were accounted for under the purchase method of accounting, and accordingly the assets and liabilities of the acquired
entities have been recorded at their estimated fair values at the dates of acquisition. The excess of purchase price over the estimated fair values of the assets acquired was approximately $18 million and has been recorded as goodwill. The
consolidated financial statements include the results of operations for each business for all periods subsequent to the applicable purchase date. The results for fiscal 2002 and 2001, assuming that these acquisitions had been made at the beginning
of fiscal 2001, would not be materially different from the results presented.  3.GOODWILL AND OTHER INTANGIBLES  Amortization expense for other intangibles for the years ended March 26, 2004, March 28, 2003 and March 29, 2002 was $525,000, $483,000 and $484,000.  The carrying amount of goodwill as of March 26, 2004 and March 28, 2003 was $97 million and 30 million, respectively.
35 Table of Contents KEYSTONE AUTOMOTIVE INDUSTRIES, INC.  NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTSContinued
4.FINANCING ARRANGEMENTS  The Company maintains a revolving line of credit with a commercial lender
that provides a $40,000,000 secured credit facility and the balance is due on June 1, 2005. Initial advances under the revolving line of credit are made with interest at the lenders prime rate 400% at March 26, 2004. The Company has
converted a portion of the advances to LIBOR plus 100% 22% and 21% at March 26, 2004. At March 26, 2004, $100million was outstanding under the line of credit. In December 2003, the Company caused the commercial lender to renew a letter
of credit in the amount of $43 million and in March 2004 issue another letter of credit in the amount of $31 million to secure certain obligations to its primary insurers, which reduces the amount available under the credit facility. The
availability under the line of credit at March 26, 2004 was $226 million. The loan agreement is subject to certain restrictive covenants and requires that the Company maintain certain financial ratios. The Company was not in compliance with all
covenants as of March 26, 2004, but had obtained a waiver from its commercial lender prior to the filing of this Annual Report.  5.SHAREHOLDERS EQUITY  The Company maintains a stock repurchase plan as authorized by the Board of Directors, which at March26, 2004, authorized the purchase of up to $41
million of its common stock at such times and at such prices as the President and Chief Financial Officer deemed appropriate. Repurchased shares were redeemed and treated as authorized but unissued shares. Since the inception of the plan, the
Company has repurchased approximately 35 million shares for approximately $458 million, an average of $1301 per share. No shares were repurchased during fiscal 2004 or fiscal 2003.  In February 2000, the Company issued 100,000 warrants to purchase the Companys stock at an exercise price of $650 to
a vendor. The warrants are exercisable starting in February 2001 through 2005, or through the date of dissolution of the agreement. Using the intrinsic value method, the Company recorded the warrants in equity at $236,000 and amortized the expense

6.EARNINGS PER SHARE  The Company calculates basic and diluted earnings per share as required by SFAS No. 128, Earnings Per Share.
Basic earnings per share excludes any dilutive effects of options, warrants and convertible securities. Diluted earnings per share is calculated including the dilutive effects of warrants, options, and convertible securities, if any. The income from
continuing operations is used as the numerator to determine whether potential common shares are dilutive or antidilutive. The following table sets forth the computation of basic and diluted earnings per share:  Year ended March26,2004

into. Rent expense for related party lease agreements, included in the total rent expense, amounted to $1,155,000, $956,000 and $956,000 for the fiscal years 2004, 2003 and 2002 respectively, exclusive of the Companys obligation for property

9.INCOME TAXES  The liability method is used in accounting for income taxes. Under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are
determined based on differences between the financial reporting and tax basis of assets and liabilities. The provision for income taxes reflects the taxes to be paid for the period and the change during the period in the deferred tax assets and
liabilities.  Significant components of the Companys
deferred tax liabilities and assets are as follows:  March26,2004 March28,2003 in thousands Deferred tax assets Inventories 2,701 3,256 Intangibles 5,544 6,276 Excess of tax basis over book basis of property and equipment 40 Accrued expenses 2,522 3,271 Other, net 510 525 Total deferred tax assets 11,277 13,368 Valuation allowance 378 384 10,899 12,984 Deferred tax liabilities Prepaid expenses 677 422 Excess of book basis over tax basis of property and equipment 376 Total deferred tax liabilities 1,053 422 Net deferred tax assets 9,846 12,562  The Company recorded a

provisions of SFAS No. 87, Employers Accounting for Pensions, at March 26, 2004 the Company recorded a minimum pension liability representing the excess of the accumulated benefit obligation over the fair value of the plan assets. The
balance of the liability of $1,495,000 was reported in accumulated comprehensive income loss, net of applicable deferred income taxes of $583,000.  In determining the actuarial present value of projected benefit obligations at March 26, 2004 and March 28, 2003, a discount rate of 575% and 600 respectively, was used. There are no future compensation increases due to the suspension of benefit accruals. The expected long-term annual rate of return on assets was 8% for the year ended March 26, 2004 and March 28, 2003.  The Company maintains a 401k plan, as amended, that covers substantially
all of its employees. Employees who have completed more than one year of service are eligible and may contribute from 1% to 50% of their base pay. The Company matches 50% of the first 6% of employee contributions. Employee contributions

The Company adopted SFAS No. 148, Accounting for Stock-Based CompensationTransition and
Disclosure, which amends SFAS No. 123, Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation, SFAS No. 148 which provides alternative methods of transition for a voluntary change to the fair value based method of accounting for stock-based employee
compensation. In addition, SFAS No. 148 amends the disclosure requirement of SFAS No. 123 to require more prominent and more frequent disclosures in financial statements of the effects of stock-based compensation. If the Company had elected to
recognize compensation cost based on the fair value of the options granted at the grant rate as prescribed by SFAS No. 148, net income loss and earnings loss per share would have been reduced to the pro forma amounts shown below:  March26,2004 March28,2003 March 29,2002 In thousands, except per share amounts Pro forma Net income lossas reported 17,722 14,747 22,033 Add: Stock Based Compensation 64 Less: Fair value stock-based compensation 553 780 687 Net income losspro forma 17,233 13,967 22,720 Net income loss per shareas reported Basic 118 101 152 Diluted 116 99 148 Net income loss per sharepro forma Basic 115 95 157 Diluted 113 93 153  The effects of

13.NON-RECURRING EXPENSES  In fiscal 2002, the enterprise software provider informed the Company that
it was ceasing all development for the software package licensed by the Company. As a result, the Company determined that it could not proceed with the Company-wide installation and booked a pre-tax charge of $68 million to write-off the previously
capitalized software development costs. With this charge, the Company has written-off its investment in this software package.  14.QUARTERLY RESULTS OF OPERATIONS UNAUDITED  The following is a summary of the quarterly results of operations for the years ended March 26, 2004 and March 28, 2003:  Quarter Ended June 27

CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES  The Company maintains disclosure controls and procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in the Companys
Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, Exchange Act reports is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SECs rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and
communicated to the Companys management, including its Chief Executive Office and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. In designing and evaluating the disclosure controls and
procedures, management recognized that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives and management necessarily was required to apply its
judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible controls and procedures.  As required by Exchange Act Rule 13a-15b, the Company carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of the Companys management, including the Companys Chief Executive
Officer and Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of the Companys disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by this Report. Based on the foregoing, the Companys Chief
Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that the Companys disclosure controls and procedures were effective at the reasonable assurance level.  There has been no change in the Companys internal controls over financial reporting during the Companys fourth
quarter of the year ended March 26, 2004 that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, the Companys internal controls over financial reporting.  However, the Company is currently evaluating its internal controls preparatory to complying with the requirements of Section
404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 and the rules and regulations adopted by the Securities and Exchange Commission thereunder. While management has confidence in its current internal controls as expressed above, it is anticipated that changes in
these controls will result from the Companys compliance efforts.
