ITEM 8. FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA
REPORT OF MANAGEMENT
Management is responsible for the information and representations contained
in Conectiv consolidated financial statements. Our consolidated financial
statements have been prepared in conformity with accounting principles gener-
ally accepted in the United States, based upon currently available facts and
circumstances and management best estimates and judgments of the expected
effects of events and transactions.
Conectiv and its subsidiary companies maintain a system of internal controls
designed to provide reasonable, but not absolute, assurance of the reliability
of the financial records and the protection of assets. The internal control
system is supported by written administrative policies, a program of internal
audits, and procedures to assure the selection and training of qualified
personnel.
PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, independent accountants, are engaged to audit
the financial statements and express their opinion thereon. Their audits are
conducted in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in the
United States which include a review of selected internal controls to deter-
mine the nature, timing, and extent of audit tests to be applied.
The Audit Committee of the Board of Directors, composed of outside directors
only, meets with management, internal auditors, and independent accountants to
review accounting, auditing, and financial reporting matters. The independent
accountants are appointed by the Board of Directors on recommendation of the
Audit Committee, subject to stockholder approval. s/ Howard E. Cosgrove         /s/ John C. van Roden        Howard E. Cosgrove           John C. van Roden

To the Board of Directors
Conectiv
Wilmington, Delaware
In our opinion, the accompanying consolidated financial statements listed in
the accompanying index appearing under Item 14a1 on page IV-I present
fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Conectiv and sub-
sidiary companies at December 31, 1999 and 1998, and the results of their op-
erations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended
December 31, 1999 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted
in the United States. In addition, in our opinion, the financial statement
schedules listed in the accompanying index appearing under Item 14a2 on
pages IV-I to IV-6 present fairly, in all material respects, the information
set forth therein when read in conjunction with the related consolidated fi-
nancial statements. These financial statements and financial statement sched-
ules are the responsibility of Conectiv management; our responsibility is to
express an opinion on these financial statements and financial statement
schedules based on our audits. We conducted our audits of these statements in
accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in the United States,
which require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assur-
ance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement.
An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts
and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting princi-
ples used and significant estimates made by management, and evaluating the
overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a
reasonable basis for the opinion expressed above. s/ PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
NOTE 1. SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
Nature of Business
As discussed in Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, effective
March 1, 1998, Delmarva Power & Light Company DPL and Atlantic Energy, Inc.
Atlantic consummated a series of merger transactions the Merger by which
DPL and Atlantic City Electric Company ACE became wholly-owned subsidiaries
of Conectiv. Conectiv is a registered holding company under the Public Utility
Holding Company Act of 1935 PUHCA.
As used in this document, references to Conectiv may mean the activities of
one or more subsidiary companies.
DPL and ACE are public utilities which supply and deliver electricity to
their customers. As discussed below, DPL also supplies and delivers natural
gas to its customers. DPL and ACE supply electricity to customers with power
purchased from other suppliers and electricity generated by their power
plants. The transition to market pricing and terms of service for supplying
electricity to customers in the regulated service areas of DPL and ACE began
in 1999. DPL and ACE also supply electricity in markets which are not subject
to price regulation. DPL and ACE deliver electricity within their service
areas to approximately 955,000 customers through their respective transmission
and distribution systems and also supply electricity to most of their elec-
tricity delivery customers. DPL regulated electric service area is located
on the Delmarva Peninsula Delaware and portions of Maryland and Virginia and
ACE regulated service area is located in the southern one-third of New Jer-
sey. On a combined basis, DPL and ACE regulated electric service areas en-
compass about 8,700 square miles and have a population of approximately 20
million.
DPL provides regulated gas service supply and/or delivery to approximately
107,300 customers located in a service territory that covers about 275 square
miles with a population of approximately 05 million in northern Delaware. DPL
also sells gas off-system and in markets which are not subject to price regu-
lation.
In December 1999, DPL and ACE filed an application with the Federal Energy
Regulatory Commission FERC for approval of the transfer to other Conectiv
subsidiaries of the electric generating plants remaining after the sale of
certain electric generating plants as discussed in Note 13 to the Consoli-
dated Financial Statements. Through this planned divestiture, the principal
businesses of DPL and ACE would be the transmission and distribution of ener-
gy, as envisioned by legislation enacted during 1999 which restructured the
electric utility industry in the service areas of DPL and ACE. The production
of electricity would be conducted by the subsidiaries receiving the trans-
ferred electric generating units. See Note 9 to the Consolidated Financial
Statements for information concerning restructuring of the electric utility
industry.
Other services, which are not subject to price regulation, are provided
primarily by Conectiv nonutility subsidiaries and, to a lesser extent, by
DPL and ACE. The principal businesses of Conectiv nonutility subsidiaries'
which are included in revenues from Other services are as follows: heating,
ventilation, and air conditioning HVAC construction and services; telecommu-
nications, including local and long-distance phone services; construction and
operation of thermal energy systems; power plant operations; leveraged leases;
and sales of petroleum products. Revenues from marketing non-regulated elec-
tricity and gas are included in Electric revenues and Gas revenues, re-
spectively. Earnings from investments in energy-related technology growth com-
panies which are accounted for on the equity method are included in Other in-
come.
Regulation of Utility Operations
Certain aspects of Conectiv utility businesses are subject to regulation
by the Delaware and Maryland Public Service Commissions DPSC and MPSC, re-
spectively, the New Jersey Board of Public Utilities
II-33 NJBPU, the Virginia State Corporation Commission VSCC, and the FERC. Re-
tail gas sales are subject to regulation by the DPSC. Excluding off-system
sales not subject to price regulation, the percentage of electric and gas
utility operating revenues regulated by each regulatory commission for the
year ended December 31, 1999, was as follows: NJBPU, 463%; DPSC, 363%; MPSC,
132%; VSCC, 13%; and FERC, 29%.
The electric delivery businesses of DPL and ACE and the retail gas business
of DPL are subject to the requirements of Statement of Financial Accounting
Standards SFAS No. 71, Accounting for the Effects of Certain Types of Regu-
lation SFAS No. 71. As discussed below, prior to the third quarter of 1999,
the electricity supply businesses of DPL and ACE were subject to the require-
ments of SFAS No. 71. Regulatory commissions occasionally provide for future
recovery from customers of current period expenses. When this happens, the ex-
penses are deferred as regulatory assets and subsequently recognized in the
Consolidated Statements of Income during the period the expenses are recovered
from customers. Similarly, regulatory liabilities may also be created due to
the economic impact of regulatory commissions' actions.
In the latter half of 1999, as discussed in Note 9 to the Consolidated Fi-
nancial Statements, the NJBPU issued a Summary Order to ACE, and the DPSC and
MPSC issued orders to DPL, concerning restructuring the electricity supply
businesses of ACE and DPL, respectively. These orders were issued pursuant to
the New Jersey, Delaware, and Maryland electric restructuring legislation en-
acted earlier in 1999. Based on these orders, ACE and DPL determined that the
requirements of SFAS No. 71 no longer applied to their electricity supply
businesses in the third quarter of 1999. As a result, ACE and DPL discontinued
applying SFAS No. 71 to their electricity supply businesses and applied the
requirements of SFAS No. 101, Regulated Enterprises--Accounting for the Dis-
continuation of Application of FASB Statement No. 71 SFAS No. 101 and
Emerging Issues Task Force EITF Issue No. 97-4, Deregulation of the Pricing
of Electricity--Issues Related to the Application of FASB Statements No. 71
and No. 101 EITF 97-4. For information concerning the extraordinary charge
to earnings which resulted from applying the requirements of SFAS No. 101 and
EITF 97-4, refer to Note 6 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.
Refer to Note 15 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for information
about regulatory assets arising from the financial effects of rate regulation.
Financial Statement Presentation
The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Conectiv and
its majority-owned subsidiaries. All significant intercompany accounts and
transactions are eliminated in consolidation.
Ownership interests of 20% or more in entities not controlled by Conectiv
are accounted for on the equity method of accounting. Investments in entities
accounted for on the equity method are included in Other investments on the
Consolidated Balance Sheets. Earnings from equity method investees are in-
cluded in Other income in the Consolidated Statements of Income. Ownership
interests of less than 20% in other entities are accounted for on the cost
method of accounting.
Certain reclassifications of prior period data have been made to conform
with the current presentation.
Use of Estimates
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally ac-
cepted accounting principles requires management to make certain estimates and
assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and
disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial
statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the re-
porting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates and assump-
tions.
II-34 Revenue Recognition
DPL and ACE accrue revenues for electric and gas service rendered from the
last meter reading to the month-end which has not yet been billed to custom-
ers. Similarly, revenues from Other services are recognized when services
are performed or products are delivered.
Energy Supply Costs
Under energy adjustment clauses prior to deregulation of electricity sup-
ply, regulated electric customer rates were subject to adjustment for differ-
ences between energy costs incurred in supplying regulated customers and
amounts billed to customers for recovery of such costs. As a result, the
amount recognized in the Consolidated Statements of Income for energy costs
incurred in supplying electricity to regulated customers was adjusted to match
the amounts billed to ACE and DPL regulated customers. An asset was re-
corded for under-collections from customers and a liability was recorded for
over-collections from customers. Effective August 1, 1999 for ACE, and October
1, 1999 for DPL, the accounting for energy costs associated with supplying
electricity changed as discussed below.
The DPSC and MPSC electric restructuring orders discussed in Note 9 to the
Consolidated Financial Statements did not provide a rate adjustment mechanism
for any under-recovery or over-recovery of energy costs after the start of
customer choice October 1, 1999 in Delaware and July 1, 2000 in Maryland.
Thus, effective October 1, 1999 for DPL Delaware electricity supply business
July 1, 2000 for DPL Maryland electricity supply business, the practice of
deferring the difference between the amount collected in revenues for energy
costs and the amount of actual energy costs incurred was ended. As a result,
differences between DPL energy revenues and expenses will affect earnings
and earnings volatility may increase.
As discussed under Shopping Credits and Basic Generation Service in Note 9
to the Consolidated Financial Statements, the electric restructuring order is-
sued by the NJBPU to ACE provides for recovery through customer rates of en-
ergy and other costs of supplying customers who do not choose an alternative
electricity supplier. Effective August 1, 1999, in recognition of these cost-
based, rate-recovery mechanisms, ACE adjusts revenues from customer billings
to the amount of the related costs incurred, including an allowed return on
electric generating plants.
The amount recognized in the Consolidated Statement of Income for the cost
of gas purchased to supply DPL regulated gas customers is adjusted to cus-
tomer billings for such costs since customer rates are periodically adjusted
to reflect amounts actually paid by DPL for purchased gas.
Nuclear Fuel
The ownership interests of DPL and ACE in nuclear fuel at the Peach Bottom
Atomic Power Station Peach Bottom and the Salem Nuclear Generating Station
Salem, and ACE ownership interest in nuclear fuel at the Hope Creek Nu-
clear Generating Station Hope Creek, are financed through contracts ac-
counted for as capital leases. Nuclear fuel costs, including a provision for
the future disposal of spent nuclear fuel, are charged to fuel expense on a
unit-of-production basis.
Energy Trading and Risk Management Activities
In June 1999, the Financial Accounting Standards Board FASB issued SFAS
No. 137, Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities--Defer-
ral of the Effective Date of FASB Statement No. 133, which delays the re-
quired implementation date for SFAS No. 133, Accounting for Derivative In-
struments and Hedging Activities, until all fiscal quarters of all fiscal
years beginning after June 15, 2000. Reporting entities may elect to adopt
SFAS No. 133 prior to the required implementation date. SFAS No. 133 estab-
lishes accounting and reporting standards for derivative instruments and for
hedging activities. Conectiv has not yet adopted SFAS No. 133 and currently
cannot determine the effect that SFAS No. 133 will have on its financial
statements.
II-35  On January 1, 1999, Conectiv adopted the EITF consensus EITF 98-10, Ac-
counting for Contracts Involved in Energy Trading and Risk Management Activi-
ties under which contracts including derivative financial instruments en-
tered into in connection with energy trading activities are marked to market,
with gains and losses unrealized and realized included in earnings. Imple-
mentation of EITF 98-10 did not have a material impact on net income. In 1997
and 1998 prior to implementation of EITF 98-10, certain energy trading
transactions were accounted for with hedge accounting, as discussed below.
Conectiv uses futures, options and swap agreements to hedge firm commitments
or anticipated transactions of energy commodities and also creates net open
energy commodity positions. Under hedge accounting, a derivative, at its in-
ception and on an ongoing basis, is expected to substantially offset adverse
price movements in the firm commitment or anticipated transaction that it is
hedging. Gains and losses related to qualifying hedges are deferred and are
recognized in operating results when the underlying transaction occurs. If,
subsequent to being hedged, underlying transactions are no longer likely to
occur or the hedge is no longer effective, the gains or losses on the related
derivatives are recognized currently in operating results. Gains and losses
from hedges of the cost of energy sold are reflected within the Consolidated
Statements of Income as Electric fuel and purchased power or Gas pur-
chased, as appropriate for the hedged transaction. Gains and losses on hedges
of the selling price of generated electricity are recognized in revenues.
Premiums paid for options are included as current assets in the consolidated
balance sheet until they are exercised or expire. Margin requirements for
futures contracts are also recorded as current assets. Under hedge accounting,
unrealized gains and losses on all futures contracts are deferred on the con-
solidated balance sheet as either current assets or deferred credits.
The cash flows from derivatives are included in the cash flows from opera-
tions section of the cash flow statement.
Depreciation Expense
The annual provision for depreciation on utility property is computed on the
straight-line basis using composite rates by classes of depreciable property.
Accumulated depreciation is charged with the cost of depreciable property re-
tired, including removal costs less salvage and other recoveries. The rela-
tionship of the annual provision for depreciation for financial accounting
purposes to average depreciable property was 35% for 1999, 38% for 1998, and
37% for 1997. Depreciation expense includes a provision for Conectiv share
of the estimated cost of decommissioning nuclear power plant reactors based on
amounts billed to customers for such costs. Refer to Note 14 to the Consoli-
dated Financial Statements for additional information on nuclear
decommissioning.
Nonutility property is generally depreciated on a straight-line basis over
the useful lives of the assets.
Income Taxes
The consolidated financial statements include two categories of income tax-
es--current and deferred. Current income taxes represent the amounts of tax
expected to be reported on Conectiv federal and state income tax returns.
Deferred income taxes are discussed below.
Deferred income tax assets and liabilities represent the tax effects of tem-
porary differences between the financial statement and tax bases of existing
assets and liabilities and are measured using presently enacted tax rates. The
portion of Conectiv deferred tax liability applicable to the utility opera-
tions of DPL and ACE that has not been recovered from utility customers repre-
sents income taxes recoverable in the future and is shown on the Consolidated
Balance Sheets as Deferred recoverable income taxes. Deferred recoverable
income taxes decreased to $939 million as of December 31, 1999, from $1844
million as of December 31, 1998, primarily due to deregulation of the elec-
tricity supply businesses of DPL and ACE in 1999.                   II-36  Deferred income tax expense generally represents the net change during the
reporting period in the net deferred tax liability and deferred recoverable
income taxes.
Investment tax credits from utility plant purchased in prior years are re-
ported on the Consolidated Balance Sheets as Deferred investment tax cred-
its. These investment tax credits are being amortized to income over the use-
ful lives of the related utility plant. Investment tax credits associated with
leveraged leases are being amortized over the lives of the related leases dur-
ing the periods in which the net investment is positive.
Deferred Debt Refinancing Costs
Prior to the third quarter of 1999, the costs of refinancing debt of the
utility businesses of DPL and ACE were deferred and amortized over the period
during which the costs are recovered in rates, which is generally the life of
the new debt. In the third quarter of 1999, the deferred costs associated with
previously refinanced debt attributed to the electric generation businesses of
DPL and ACE were written-off and charged to earnings, net of anticipated rate
recovery. Any costs incurred in the future for refinancing debt attributed to
the electric generation business for which rate recovery is not provided will
be accounted for in accordance with SFAS No. 4, Reporting Gains and Losses
from Extinguishment of Debt, which requires such costs to be expensed.
License Fees
License fees represent the unamortized balance of amounts previously paid by
the predecessor to Conectiv Thermal Systems, Inc. a Conectiv subsidiary for
the right to operate heating and cooling systems of certain hotel casinos in
Atlantic City, New Jersey, over a 20-year period. These fees are classified as
License Fees on the balance sheet and are being amortized over 20 years.
Interest Expense
The amortization of debt discount, premium, and expense, including deferred
refinancing expenses associated with the regulated electric and gas transmis-
sion and distribution businesses, is included in interest expense.
Utility Plant
As discussed in Note 6 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, utility
plant which became impaired as a result of deregulation of the electric util-
ity industry is stated at fair value. The estimated fair values were based on
amounts included in agreements for the sale of certain electric generating
plants of DPL and ACE, as discussed in Note 13 to the Consolidated Financial
Statements. Utility plant which is not impaired is stated at original cost.
Utility plant is generally subject to a first mortgage lien.
Allowance for Funds Used During Construction
Allowance for Funds Used During Construction AFUDC is included in the cost
of regulated transmission and distribution utility plant and represents the
cost of borrowed and equity funds used to finance construction. In the Consol-
idated Statements of Income, the borrowed funds component of AFUDC is reported
as a reduction of interest expense and the equity funds component of AFUDC is
reported as other income. AFUDC was capitalized on utility plant construction
at the rates of 86% in 1999, 88% in 1998, and 75% in 1997.
Effective in the third quarter of 1999, the cost of financing the construc-
tion of electric generation plant is capitalized in accordance with SFAS No.
34, Capitalization of Interest Cost.
II-37 Stock-based Employee Compensation
Refer to Note 16 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for Conectiv ac-
counting policy on stock-based employee compensation.
Cash Equivalents
In the consolidated financial statements, Conectiv considers highly liquid
marketable securities and debt instruments purchased with a maturity of three
months or less to be cash equivalents.
Goodwill
Conectiv amortizes goodwill arising from business acquisitions over the
shorter of the estimated useful life or 40 years.
Leveraged Leases
Conectiv investment in leveraged leases includes the aggregate of rentals
receivable net of principal and interest on nonrecourse indebtedness and es-
timated residual values of the leased equipment less unearned and deferred in-
come including investment tax credits. Unearned and deferred income is rec-
ognized at a level rate of return during the periods in which the net invest-
ment is positive. Refer to Note 22 to the Consolidated Financial Statements
for additional information on leveraged leases.
Funds Held By Trustee
Funds held by trustee are stated at fair market value and primarily include
deposits in Conectiv external nuclear decommissioning trusts and unexpended,
restricted, tax-exempt bond proceeds. Changes in the fair market value of the
trust funds are also reflected in the accrued liability for nuclear
decommissioning which is included in accumulated depreciation.
Earnings Per Share
Earnings per share has been computed in accordance with SFAS No. 128, Earn-
ings Per Share. Under SFAS No. 128, basic earnings per share are computed
based on earnings applicable to common stock divided by the weighted average
number of common shares outstanding for the period. Diluted earnings per share
are computed based on earnings applicable to common stock divided by the
weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding during the pe-
riod after giving effect to securities considered to be dilutive common stock
equivalents. The effect of dilutive common stock equivalents was not signifi-
cant, and thus, for 1999, 1998, and 1997, Conectiv basic and diluted earn-
ings per share were the same amounts.

Effective January 1, 1998, New Jersey eliminated the Gross Receipts and
Franchise Tax paid by electric, natural gas and telecommunication public util-
ities. Utilities were subject to the state corporate business tax beginning
in 1998. In addition, the state existing sales and use tax was expanded to
include retail sales of electricity and gas. A transitional energy facility
assessment tax TEFA is being applied for a limited time to electric and nat-
ural gas utilities and is being phased out over a five-year period which began
January 1, 1999. When fully implemented, this will reduce ACE effective
state tax rate from 13% to approximately 7%. Savings from these changes in New
Jersey tax law will be passed through to ACE customers.
NOTE 4. MERGER
On March 1, 1998, DPL and ACE became wholly-owned subsidiaries of Conectiv.
Before the Merger, Atlantic owned ACE, an electric utility serving the south-
ern one-third of New Jersey, and nonutility subsidiaries. As a result of the
Merger, Atlantic ceased to exist, and Conectiv owns directly or indirectly
ACE, DPL, and the nonutility subsidiaries formerly held separately by Atlantic
and DPL. Conectiv is a registered holding company under the Public Utility
Holding Company Act of 1935 PUHCA.
In accordance with the terms of the Merger, DPL common stockholders received
one share of Conectiv common stock in exchange for each share of DPL common
stock, and Atlantic common stockholders received 075 of one share of Conectiv
common stock and 0125 of one share of Conectiv Class A common stock in ex-
change for each share of Atlantic common stock. Atlantic stockholders and DPL
stockholders received 39,363,672 and 61,832,699 shares of Conectiv common
stock, respectively. Atlantic stockholders received 6,560,612 shares of
Conectiv Class A common stock. See Note 17 to the Consolidated Financial
Statements for information concerning Conectiv Class A common stock and the
apportionment of earnings between Conectiv Class A common stock and Conectiv
common stock.
The Merger was accounted for under the purchase method of accounting, with
DPL as the acquirer. In connection with the Merger, $2890 million of goodwill
was recorded, which is being amortized over 40 years. The results of opera-
tions for ACE and the formerly Atlantic-owned nonutility subsidiaries from
March 1, 1998 and thereafter are included in the Consolidated Statements of
Income. The amount of goodwill from the Merger
II-40 amortized to expense was $71 million, or $008 per common share, in 1999, and
$62 million, or $007 per common share, in 1998.
NOTE 5. SPECIAL CHARGES
Conectiv operating results for 1999 include Special charges of $1056
million before taxes $716 million after taxes, which were recorded in the
third quarter. The special charges decreased 1999 earnings per Conectiv common
share by $075 and earnings per Conectiv Class A common share by $030. The
items included in the 1999 special charges are discussed below.
a Declines in the estimated residual values of the airplanes and cargo
container-ships leased by certain Conectiv subsidiaries to third par-
ties under leveraged leases resulted in a write-down of the investments
in leveraged leases by $437 million before taxes $267 million after
taxes.
b Approximately $109 million before taxes $65 million after taxes was
accrued for 160 planned employee separations 80 of which have oc-
curred expected within the next year in conjunction with a cost reduc-
tion and productivity program.
c Lower actual operating cash flows than initially expected when certain
HVAC businesses were acquired caused the net book value of the HVAC
businesses to be impaired, based on SFAS No. 121, Accounting for the
Impairment of Long-Lived Assets and for Long-Lived Assets To Be Dis-
posed Of SFAS No. 121. SFAS No. 121 requires that goodwill associ-
ated with impaired assets purchased in a business combination be elimi-
nated before reducing the carrying amounts of the other long-lived as-
sets of the purchased business. As a result, the goodwill associated
with the HVAC businesses was written-down by $356 million before taxes
$291 million after taxes.
d Charges for additional costs related to the Merger, impairments of cer-
tain other assets, and other items were $154 million before taxes
$93 million after taxes.
Conectiv operating results for 1998 include Special charges of $277
million before taxes $168 million after taxes, or $018 per Conectiv common
share for the cost of DPL employee separations associated with the Merger-re-
lated workforce reduction and other Merger-related costs. The $277 million
pre-tax charge includes a net $455 million gain from curtailments and settle-
ments of pension and other postretirement benefits. The 1998 employee separa-
tion, relocation, and other Merger-related costs for Atlantic and its former
subsidiaries of $808 million before taxes, or $483 million after taxes, were
capitalized as costs of the Merger.
NOTE 6. EXTRAORDINARY ITEM
As discussed in Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, as a result
of electric utility restructuring orders, DPL and ACE discontinued applying
SFAS No. 71 to their electricity supply businesses in the third quarter of
1999 and applied the requirements of SFAS No. 101 and EITF 97-4. Pursuant to
the requirements of SFAS No. 101 and EITF 97-4, DPL and ACE recorded extraor-
dinary charges which, on a consolidated basis, reduced earnings by $3117 mil-
lion, after $1883 million of income taxes. The portion of the extraordinary
charge related to impaired assets was determined in accordance with SFAS No.
121. The extraordinary charge primarily resulted from impaired electric gener-
ating plants and certain other assets, uneconomic energy contracts, and other
effects of deregulation requiring loss recognition. The impairment amount for
electric generating plants was determined based on expected proceeds under
agreements for the sale of the electric generating plants, which are discussed
in Note 13 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. The extraordinary charge
was decreased by the regulatory asset established for the amount of stranded
costs expected to be recovered through regulated electricity delivery rates.
As discussed in Note 9 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, ACE por-
tion of the extraordinary charge was based on the NJBPU Summary Order and
the NJBPU is to issue a more detailed order at a later date. If the NJBPU
final detailed order were to differ materially from the Summary Order, then
the extraordinary charge could change.

NOTE 9. RATE MATTERS
Electric Utility Industry Restructuring
New Jersey Electric Utility Industry Restructuring
On February 9, 1999, New Jersey enacted the Electric Discount and Energy
Competition Act the New Jersey Act which, among other things, provided cus-
tomers of New Jersey electric utilities with a choice of electricity suppliers
beginning August 1, 1999. Pursuant to the New Jersey Act, on July 15, 1999,
the NJBPU issued a Summary Order to ACE concerning stranded costs, unbundled
rates, and other matters related to restructuring. The NJBPU stated that a
more detailed order would be issued at a later date. Management expects the
NJBPU final order to be issued after appeals related to the NJBPU final
order on restructuring the electric supply business of Public Service Electric
and Gas Company are resolved. The outcome of these appeals could potentially
affect the NJBPU final order for ACE. The key provisions of the Summary Or-
der are discussed below.
Rate Decreases
In its Summary Order, the NJBPU directed ACE to implement a five percent ag-
gregate rate reduction effective August 1, 1999. ACE also must implement at
least an additional two percent rate reduction by January 1, 2001. By August
1, 2002, rates must be reduced by ten percent from the rates which were in ef-
fect as of April 30, 1997. Management estimates that the initial rate reduc-
tion effective August 1, 1999, will reduce revenues by approximately $50 mil-
lion on an annualized basis, assuming fiscal year 1998 sales and revenues.
Since an estimated $25 million of the revenue reduction resulted from the en-
ergy component of ACE regulated revenues previously exceeding related energy
costs, this portion of the revenue reduction should not affect earnings.
Stranded Cost Recovery and Securitization
The Summary Order provides that ACE may divest its nuclear and fossil fuel
baseload units and transfer the remaining generating units to a nonutility af-
filiated company at net book value. The NJBPU determined that ACE will have
the opportunity to recover 100% of the net stranded costs related to certain
generation units to be divested and the stranded costs associated with power
purchased from nonutility generators NUGs, subject to
II-44 further NJBPU proceedings. The Summary Order also permits securitization of
stranded costs. Securitization is expected to occur through a special purpose
entity which will issue bonds secured by the right to collect stranded costs
from customers. The Summary Order allows securitization of a 100% of the net
stranded costs of certain generation units to be divested, over a period not
to exceed 15 years, and b 100% of the costs to effect potential NUG contract
buyouts or buydowns, over a period not to exceed the remaining term of the re-
structured contracts. The Summary Order provides for stranded costs, net of
taxes, to be collected from customers through a transition bond charge over
the securitization term. The Summary Order also provides for customers' rates
to include a separate market transition charge for recovery of the income tax
expense associated with the revenues from stranded cost recovery.
As of December 31, 1999, the balance for ACE pre-tax recoverable stranded
costs was $9883 million, which includes the stranded costs estimated and re-
corded as a result of discontinuing the application of SFAS No. 71 as dis-
cussed in Note 6 to the Consolidated Financial Statements and the $2285 mil-
lion payment to terminate a NUG contract as discussed in Note 10 to the Con-
solidated Financial Statements. ACE amount of recoverable stranded costs
remains subject to adjustment based on the actual gains and losses realized on
the sale of certain electric generating plants, additional buyouts or buydowns
of NUG contracts, the NJBPU final restructuring order, and the final amount
determined to be recoverable through customer rates under the New Jersey Act.
Shopping Credits and Basic Generation Service
The Summary Order established minimum initial shopping credits for customers
who choose an alternative electric supplier, from a system average 527 cents
per kilowatt-hour kWh, effective August 1, 1999, to a system average of 548
cents per kWh in 2003. These shopping credits include transmission costs and
charges by ACE for Basic Generation Service BGS to be provided to retail
customers who do not choose another electricity supplier. ACE is obligated to
provide BGS through July 31, 2002; thereafter, the BGS supplier will be deter-
mined each year based on a competitive bidding process. In accordance with the
Summary Order, ACE will supply the BGS load requirement with power purchased
under its NUG contracts and the output generated by certain units to be di-
vested prior to divestiture of the units. ACE will purchase power through a
competitive bidding process for any BGS supply requirement greater than the
output from certain generation units to be divested and power purchased from
NUGs.
The Summary Order established the rates charged to ACE BGS customers for
such service, which include a component for the market-value of power pur-
chased from NUGs. The above-market portion of the cost of NUG power is to be
collected through a non-bypassable Net NUG Charge included in regulated elec-
tricity delivery rates, over the remaining term of the NUG contracts. The
above market portion of the costs of certain of ACE power plants is being
recovered through a Market Transition Charge, included in regulated electric-
ity delivery rates. The NJBPU Summary Order also provided that ACE regula-
tory liability for over-recovered energy supply costs as of July 31, 1999
would be offset by any subsequent under-recoveries of BGS and certain other
costs. Due to under-recoveries of such costs from August 1, 1999 to December
31, 1999, ACE reduced its liability for over-recovered energy supply costs by
$172 million and recognized a like amount of revenue. Similarly, any over-re-
coveries will increase the regulatory liability. Customer rates are to be ad-
justed for any deferred balance remaining after the initial four-year transi-
tion period which began August 1, 1999.
Code of Conduct
The NJBPU is presently considering Code of Conduct issues concerning the re-
lationship between regulated and non-regulated activities.
Delaware Electric Utility Industry Restructuring
On March 31, 1999, Delaware enacted the Electric Utility Restructuring Act
of 1999 the Delaware Act, which provided for a phase-in of retail customer
choice of electricity suppliers from October 1999 to October
II-45 2000, customer rate decreases, and other matters concerning restructuring the
electric utility industry in Delaware. On April 15, 1999, DPL submitted to the
DPSC a compliance plan for implementing the provisions of the Delaware Act in
DPL Delaware service area. On August 31, 1999, the DPSC issued an order on
DPL compliance plan. The DPSC order is discussed below.
Implementation Dates
The DPSC approved implementation dates for retail customer choice of elec-
tric suppliers of October 1, 1999 for customers with a peak monthly load of
1,000 kilowatts kW or more; January 15, 2000 for customers with a peak
monthly load of 300 kW or more; and October 1, 2000 for other customers.
Rate Decrease
The DPSC approved DPL proposed rate structure which provides for a 75%
decrease in DPL Delaware residential electric rates, effective October 1,
1999, with those rates held constant from October 1, 1999 to September 30,
2003. Also, non-residential rates are to be held constant from October 1, 1999
to September 30, 2002. Management estimates that the initial 75% residential
rate reduction effective October 1, 1999, will reduce revenues by approxi-
mately $175 million on an annualized basis, assuming fiscal year 1998 sales
and revenues.
Sale of Electric Generating Plants
The Delaware Act permits DPL to sell, transfer, or otherwise divest its
electric generating plants without DPSC approval after October 1, 1999. The
DPSC order effectively provides that electric rates will remain unchanged as
a result of such divestiture. See Note 13 to the Consolidated Financial State-
ments for related information concerning the expected sales of electric gener-
ating plants.
Stranded Cost Recovery
The rate structure approved by the DPSC also provides for DPL recovery of
stranded costs, $16 million net of taxes, or $31 million before taxes, through
a Competitive Transition Charge billed to non-residential customers from Octo-
ber 1, 1999 to September 30, 2002.
Shopping Credits
The system-average customer shopping credits, which include the costs of
electricity supply, transmission, and ancillary services, are 4736 cents per
kWh for the year beginning October 1, 1999, 4738 cents per kWh for the year
beginning October 1, 2000, and 4740 cents per kWh for the year beginning Oc-
tober 1, 2001.
Default Service for Electricity Supply
The Delaware Act makes DPL the provider of default service to customers who
do not choose an alternative electricity supplier for a period of 3 or 4 years
transition period for non-residential and residential customers, respective-
ly. Thereafter, the DPSC may conduct a bidding process to select the default
supplier for such customers. During the transition period, the energy compo-
nent of customers' rates for default service will be set at DPL average en-
ergy cost per kWh for the twelve months ended September 30, 1999.
The DPSC order permits customers with demand below 300 kW to choose an al-
ternative electric supplier and to switch back to DPL default service with-
out any time restrictions or price differential. Customers with demand above
300 kW who choose an alternative supplier and switch back to DPL default
service must either, at the customer option, return to DPL default service
for a minimum of 12 months or pay market prices.
II-46 Code of Conduct
The DPSC ruled that the existing Code of Conduct will remain in place, con-
ditioned upon the requirement that a revised code be proposed and, if neces-
sary, litigated. As requested by the DPSC, DPL filed a new Cost Accounting
Manual and Code of Conduct in November 1999.
Maryland Electric Utility Industry Restructuring
On April 8, 1999, Maryland enacted the Electric Customer Choice and Competi-
tion Act of 1999 the Maryland Act, which provided for customer choice of
electricity suppliers, customer rate decreases, and other matters concerning
restructuring the electric utility industry in Maryland. On May 5, 1999, DPL
submitted to the MPSC a proposed settlement agreement subsequently supple-
mented for implementing the provisions of the Maryland Act in DPL Maryland
service area. On October 8, 1999 the MPSC issued an order to DPL which ap-
proved the settlement agreement. The key elements of the approved settlement
agreement are discussed below.
Implementation Date
Effective July 1, 2000, all of DPL Maryland-retail customers will be eli-
gible to select an alternative electricity supplier.
Rate Decrease
The MPSC approved a 75% decrease in DPL Maryland residential electric
rates, effective July 1, 2000, with those rates held constant from July 1,
2000 to June 30, 2004. Also, non-residential rates are to be held constant
from July 1, 2000 to June 30, 2003. Management estimates that the initial 75%
residential rate reduction effective July 1, 2000, will reduce revenues by ap-
proximately $125 million on an annualized basis, assuming fiscal year 1998
sales and revenues.
Sale of Electric Generating Plants
The Maryland Act in conjunction with the approved settlement effectively
provide that electric rates will not be changed in the event DPL sells or
transfers generating assets. See Note 13 to the Consolidated Financial State-
ments for related information concerning the expected sales of electric gener-
ating plants.
Stranded Cost Recovery
The MPSC approved DPL recovery of stranded costs, $8 million net of taxes,
or $14 million before taxes, through a Competitive Transition Charge billed to
non-residential customers from July 1, 2000 to June 30, 2003.
Shopping Credits
The system-average customer shopping credits, which include the costs of
electricity supply, transmission, and ancillary services, are estimated to be
approximately 5302 cents per kWh for the year beginning July 1, 2000, 5305
cents per kWh for the year beginning July 1, 2001, and 5307 cents per kWh for
the year beginning July 1, 2002. These estimated shopping credits will be re-
set so that the energy component is DPL average energy cost per kWh for the
twelve months ended April 30, 2000.
Default Service for Electricity Supply
DPL is to provide default service to customers who do not choose an alterna-
tive electricity supplier during July 1, 2000 to July 1, 2004 for residential
customers and during July 1, 2000 to July 1, 2003 for non-residential custom-
ers. Subsequent to these default service periods, the MPSC is to determine the
default service supplier. During the initial periods when DPL provides default
service, the energy component of customers' rates will be set at DPL average
energy cost per kWh for the twelve months ended April 30, 2000.
II-47 Code of Conduct
On July 26, 1999, the MPSC initiated a new review of the generic affiliate
transaction provisions of the Maryland Act. Subsequently, the MPSC conducted
hearings and is expected to issue an order within several months.
Virginia Electric Utility Industry Restructuring
On March 29, 1999, the Governor of Virginia signed the Virginia Electric
Utility Restructuring Act the Virginia Act. In 1999, revenues from DPL
Virginia customers comprised about 14% of consolidated Conectiv electric rev-
enues earned from regulated electricity sales and deliveries. Significant pro-
visions of the Virginia Act are as follows  a A phase-in of retail electric competition is to start on January 1,
2002.
b The rates in effect on January 1, 2001 are to become capped rates,
which continue in effect through July 1, 2007, except for adjustments
for changes in fuel costs and state tax rates.
c A customer who chooses an alternative electricity supplier would pay
the incumbent utility the capped transmission and distribution rates
and a wires charge, representing the difference between the capped
generation rate and projected market prices for electricity.
d Just and reasonable net stranded costs are to be recovered through
capped rates and wires charges during the period January 1, 2001
through July 1, 2007.
Pursuant to the requirements of the Virginia Act, DPL filed in January 2000
an application for approval of a plan for functional separation of electric
generation from transmission and distribution by divestiture. The plan in-
volves complete divestiture by the third quarter of 2000 of DPL generation
facilities, some of which would be sold to unaffiliated parties and the re-
mainder of which are proposed to be transferred to a Conectiv subsidiary. By
the completion of the divestiture, DPL proposes an overall revenue decrease of
26% approximately $07 million on an annual basis. DPL also indicated in
its application that it expects to propose starting retail choice on or after
January 1, 2002 for all of its Virginia retail customers, instead of a phase-
in of retail choice.
Merger Rate Decrease
In accordance with the terms included in regulatory commissions orders'
which approved the Merger, ACE and DPL phased-in reductions in electric and
gas retail customer base rates. ACE total Merger-related electric base rate
decrease of $157 million was phased-in as follows: 1 $50 million effective
January 1, 1998 coincident with a $50 million increase for recovery of de-
ferred other postretirement benefit costs; 2 $99 million effective March 1,
1998, and 3 $08 million effective January 1, 1999. DPL total Merger-re-
lated base rate decrease of $130 million was phased-in as follows: 1 $115
million effective March 1, 1998, 2 $11 million effective March 1, 1999, and
3 $04 million effective October 1, 1999.
NOTE 10. TERMINATION OF PURCHASED POWER CONTRACT
On November 10, 1999, the NJBPU issued an Order approving ACE proposal to
terminate a contract under which ACE purchased energy and 116 megawatts MW
of capacity from a NUG partnership Pedricktown Co-generation Limited Partner-
ship owned 50% by other Conectiv subsidiaries. The NJBPU Order also provided
that ACE is entitled to recover from customers the contract termination pay-
ment of $2285 million, together with reasonable and prudently incurred trans-
action costs and interim financing costs as specified therein. The NJBPU Order
also found that the contract termination payment and related transaction costs
are eligible for long-term financing through the issuance of transition bonds
securitization. On December 28, 1999, ACE paid $2285 million to terminate
the contract and borrowed funds from a credit facility discussed in Note 19
to the Consolidated Financial Statements which ACE arranged to finance the
contract termination payment. The contract termination payment and related
costs are included in Recoverable Stranded Costs on the balance sheet as of
II-48 December 31, 1999. ACE customer rates were reduced by about 1% approxi-
mately $11 million of revenues on an annualized basis effective January 1,
2000 as a result of the net savings expected to result from the contract ter-
mination.
ACE anticipates that securitization will ultimately be used to finance the
stranded costs associated with the buyout or buydown of its NUG contracts in-
cluding the buyout described above, along with stranded costs determined in
connection with the planned divestiture of certain of ACE generating units.
As noted above, there can be no assurances that the NJBPU will approve the is-
suance of transition bonds for such costs or that ACE will be able to issue
and sell any such bonds.
On December 28, 1999, the Conectiv subsidiaries which own 50% of the NUG
partnership with which ACE terminated its contract received an $822 million
distribution from the NUG partnership. The distribution was primarily the re-
sult of a gain realized by the NUG partnership from the contract termination;
the Conectiv subsidiaries' share of the gain was $708 million, which was de-
ferred in Conectiv Consolidated Balance Sheet as of December 31, 1999 and
classified under Deferred Credits and Other Liabilities. The deferred gain
is expected to be amortized to income over the period revenues are collected
from ACE customers to repay the securitized debt attributed to the contract
termination payment.
NOTE 11. ENERGY HEDGING AND TRADING ACTIVITIES
Conectiv actively participates in the wholesale energy markets to support
its wholesale utility and competitive retail marketing activities. Conectiv
engages in commodity hedging activities to minimize the risk of market fluctu-
ations associated with the purchase and sale of energy commodities natural
gas, petroleum and electricity. Some hedging activities are conducted using
energy derivatives. The remainder of Conectiv hedging activity is conducted
by backing physical transactions with offsetting physical positions. The hedg-
ing objectives include the assurance of stable and known minimum cash flows
and the fixing of favorable prices and margins when they become available.
Conectiv also engages in energy commodity trading and arbitrage activities,
which expose Conectiv to commodity market risk when, at times, Conectiv cre-
ates net open energy commodity positions or allows net open positions to con-
tinue. To the extent that Conectiv has net open positions, controls are in
place that are intended to keep risk exposures within management-approved risk
tolerance levels.
Conectiv utilizes futures, options and swap agreements to manage risk.
Futures help manage commodity price risk by fixing purchase or sales prices.
Options provide a floor or ceiling on future purchases or sales prices while
allowing Conectiv to benefit from favorable price movements. Swaps are struc-
tured to provide the same risk protection as futures and options. Basis swaps
are used to manage risk by fixing the basis differential that exists between a
delivery location index and the commodity futures price.
Exposed commodity positions may be long or short. A long position indi-
cates that Conectiv has an excess of the commodity available for sale. A short
position means Conectiv will have to obtain additional commodity to fulfill
its sales requirements. A delta position is the conversion of an option into
futures contract equivalents. The option delta is dependent upon the strike
price, volatility, current market price and time-value of the option.
Counterparties to its various hedging and trading contracts expose Conectiv
to credit losses in the event of nonperformance. Management has evaluated such
risk and implemented credit checks and has established reserves for credit
losses. A large portion of the hedging and trading activities are conducted on
national exchanges backed by exchange clearinghouses. Management believes that
the overall business risk is minimized as a result of these procedures.
Natural Gas Activities
At December 31, 1999, Conectiv open futures contracts represented a net
long position with a notional quantity of 85 billion cubic feet Bcf,
through March 2002. Conectiv also had a net long commodity swap
II-49 position at December 31, 1999 equivalent to 12 Bcf and a net short basis
swaps position equivalent to 02 Bcf. At December 31, 1998, Conectiv open
futures contracts represented a net long position with a notional quantity of
131 Bcf, through February 2001. Conectiv also had a net long commodity swap
position at December 31, 1998 equivalent to 46 Bcf and a net long basis swaps
position equivalent to 53 Bcf.
During 1999, a gain of $50 million, including a $30 million unrealized
gain, was recognized for gas trading positions physical and financial com-
bined. In 1999, the annual average unrealized gain on trading activities was
$21 million. During 1998, recognized and unrealized gains from gas trading
positions were not material to Conectiv results of operations or financial
position.
Unrealized hedging losses of $76 million and $86 million as of December
31, 1999 and 1998, respectively, from natural gas futures, swaps and options
contracts used to hedge gas marketing activities are deferred in the Consoli-
dated Balance Sheets. These losses are offset by gains on the physical commod-
ity transactions being hedged.
Electricity Marketing and Trading Activities
At December 31, 1999, Conectiv had a net long exposure of 219,900 megawatt-
hours MWH through December 2000 primarily from forward contracts. At Decem-
ber 31, 1998, Conectiv had a net short exposure of 102,400 MWH through Decem-
ber 1999 primarily from forward contracts.
During 1999, a gain of $60 million, including a $13 million unrealized
gain, was recognized for electricity trading activities physical and finan-
cial combined. During 1998, a gain of $114 million, including a $12 million
unrealized gain, was recognized for electricity trading activities physical
and financial combined. The annual average unrealized gain on electricity
trading activities was $01 million in 1999 and $13 million in 1998.
The deferred gains and losses from hedges of electricity marketing activi-
ties were not material to Conectiv financial position as of December 31,
1999 and December 31, 1998.
Electricity Generation Activities
Under the NJBPU Summary Order, the electricity output from certain ACE
electric generating units is not dedicated to supplying BGS customers, but in-
stead is being operated on a deregulated basis, effective August 1, 1999. Ef-
fective October 1, 1999, the Delaware portion approximately 59% of DPL
electric generating plants was deregulated and the plants' output may, at
DPL option, be sold in deregulated markets or used to supply default service
customers in Delaware. Similarly, effective July 1, 2000, the Maryland portion
approximately 30% of DPL electric generating plants is deregulated and the
plants' output may, at DPL option, be sold in deregulated markets or used to
supply default service customers in Maryland.
Conectiv hedges the newly deregulated portion of its electric generating
units using derivative financial instruments and forward contracts. Conectiv
hedges portions of the fuel purchased and the electricity output of the gener-
ating plants to stabilize fuel costs and to lock-in prices for electricity
generated. As of December 31, 1999, Conectiv hedged 3,865,800 MWH of forward
generation output, through the sale of forward contracts, which resulted in an
$110 million unrealized and unrecognized gain as of December 31, 1999. A net
unrealized loss of $41 million which resulted from hedging the cost of gas
burned by electric generating units was deferred in the Consolidated Balance
Sheet as of December 31, 1999. This hedge consisted of a long position of nat-
ural gas futures, forwards and swaps with a combined notional amount of 129
Bcf.
Petroleum Activities
Conectiv markets petroleum products through a subsidiary. To hedge a portion
of its petroleum sales commitments, the subsidiary had net long futures posi-
tions as of December 31, 1999 and 1998 with notional equivalents of 376,000
barrels and 315,000 barrels, respectively. An unrealized hedging gain of $30
million was
II-50 deferred as of December 31, 1999 and an unrealized hedging loss of $31 mil-
lion was deferred as of December 31, 1998.
Petroleum trading activities began in 1999 and a $13 million trading gain
was recognized, including a $07 million unrealized gain. The average annual
unrealized gain on 1999 petroleum trading activities was $05 million.
NOTE 12. JOINTLY OWNED PLANT
Conectiv Consolidated Balance Sheets include its proportionate share of
assets and liabilities related to jointly owned plant. Both DPL and ACE have
ownership interests in electric power plants, transmission facilities, and
other facilities in which various parties have ownership interests. DPL and
ACE proportionate shares of operating and maintenance expenses of the
jointly owned plant is included in the corresponding expenses in Conectiv
Consolidated Statements of Income. DPL and ACE are responsible for providing
their share of financing for the jointly owned facilities.
DPL and ACE own 1482% of Salem in the aggregate. Salem Units 1 and 2 were
removed from operation by Public Service Electric & Gas Company PSE, the
Salem operator, in the second quarter of 1995 due to operational problems and
safety concerns. PSE returned Unit 2 to service in August 1997, and Unit 1
to service in April 1998. The net increase in expenses due to unrecovered re-
placement power and other costs, net of the benefit of lawsuit settlement pro-
ceeds received in 1997, was $31 million in 1998 and $71 million in 1997.
Information with respect to DPL and ACE shares of jointly owned plant as
of December 31, 1999 is shown below and reflects the write-downs which re-
sulted from discontinuing application of SFAS No. 71 as discussed in Note 6 to
the Consolidated Financial Statements. As discussed in Note 13 to the Consoli-
dated Financial Statements, agreements have been reached to sell to third par-
ties the jointly-owned nuclear and coal-fired plants listed below.                   Megawatt            Construction

NOTE 13. SUBSEQUENT EVENT--EXPECTED SALES OF ELECTRIC GENERATING PLANTS
Pursuant to the financial and strategic initiatives announced by Conectiv in
May 1999, Conectiv distributed offering memoranda for the proposed sale of nu-
clear and non-strategic baseload fossil electric generating plants owned by
DPL and ACE. Management intends to retain certain fossil fuel-fired electric
generating plants which are strategic to Conectiv energy business, pursuant
to Conectiv mid-merit strategy as discussed in the Deregulated Generation
and Power Plant Sales section of Management Discussion and Analysis of Fi-
nancial Condition and Results of Operations MD. A summary of the electric
generating plants which have been offered for sale is shown in the following
table.

a The net book values shown above are as of December 31, 1999, are stated in
millions of dollars, and reflect the write-downs discussed in Note 6 to
the Consolidated Financial Statements.
On September 30, 1999, Conectiv announced that DPL and ACE reached agree-
ments to sell their ownership interests in nuclear plants to PSEG Power LLC a
subsidiary of Public Service Enterprise Group Incorporated and PECO Energy
Company PECO for approximately $20 million, plus the net book value of the
interests of DPL and ACE in nuclear fuel on-hand as of the closing date. The
combined interests of DPL and ACE in the nuclear units which are being sold
include a 1502 percent 328 MW interest in Peach Bottom, a 1482 percent in-
terest 334 MW in Salem and a 50 percent interest 52 MW in Hope Creek.
Upon completion of the sale, DPL and ACE will transfer their respective nu-
clear decommissioning trust funds to the purchasers and PSEG Power LLC and
PECO will assume full responsibility for the decommissioning of Peach Bottom,
Salem, and Hope Creek. The sales are subject to various federal and state reg-
ulatory approvals and are expected to close by the third quarter of 2000.
On January 19, 2000, Conectiv announced that DPL and ACE reached agreements
to sell the wholly- and jointly-owned fossil units listed in the above table,
which have a total capacity of 1,8745 MW and a net book value of $4226 mil-
lion as of December 31, 1999 net of the write downs recorded as a result of
deregulation, to NRG Energy, Inc., a subsidiary of Northern States Power Com-
pany, for $800 million. The sales are subject to various federal and state
regulatory approvals and are expected to be completed during the third quarter
of 2000. Management expects that the aggregate proceeds from the sale of the
electric generating plants will be used for debt repayment, repurchases of
common stock and new investments that fit with Conectiv strategies, includ-
ing expansion of the mid-merit generation business.
The terms of DPL agreement with NRG Energy, Inc. provide for DPL to pur-
chase from NRG Energy, Inc. 500 megawatt-hours of firm electricity per hour
from completion of the sale through December 31, 2005. DPL expects to use
electricity purchased under this agreement and other purchased power agree-
ments to fulfill its obligations in Delaware and Maryland as a default service
provider. Recently DPL entered into an agreement to purchase 350 MW of capac-
ity and energy from PECO from March 2000 to February 2003.
Under the restructuring orders issued by the DPSC and MPSC, as discussed in
Note 9 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, DPL Delaware and Maryland
retail electric rates will not be changed in the event DPL sells or transfers
generating assets. Based on the terms of the restructuring orders and DPL
sales agreement with NRG Energy, Inc, management expects to recognize a net
gain in earnings of approximately $140 million to $150 million when DPL com-
pletes the sale of its electric generating plants which were not impaired from
deregulation. There can be no assurances, however, that the sales of DPL, or
ACE, electric generating plants will be completed pursuant to the agree-
ments, or that any gain will be realized from such sales of electric generat-
ing plants.
Under the NJBPU Summary Order, any gain or loss realized upon the sale of
ACE electric generating plants other than the Deepwater plant and combus-
tion turbines owned by ACE will affect the amount of ACE recoverable
stranded costs. Accordingly, any gain or loss realized by ACE on the sale of
these plants would not affect future earnings. Any loss on a sale within three
years of the Deepwater plant and combustion turbines owned by ACE, which began
operating on a deregulated basis effective August 1, 1999, cannot be recovered
II-52 from ACE customers. ACE agreement for the sale of electric generating
units to NRG Energy, Inc. includes the sale of the 239 MW Deepwater plant at a
loss which was recorded in the fourth quarter of 1999 as an adjustment to the
extraordinary item initially estimated and recorded in the third quarter of
1999.
For pro forma information concerning the expected sale of power plants, see
Exhibit 99 to this report on Form 10-K.
NOTE 14. NUCLEAR DECOMMISSIONING
Conectiv subsidiaries, DPL and ACE, record liabilities for their share of
the estimated cost of decommissioning the Peach Bottom, Salem, and Hope Creek
nuclear reactors over the remaining lives of the plants based on amounts col-
lected in rates charged to electric customers. ACE estimates its share of fu-
ture nuclear decommissioning costs $157 million based on site specific stud-
ies filed with and approved by the NJBPU. DPL estimates its share of future
nuclear decommissioning costs $98 million based on Nuclear Regulatory Com-
mission NRC regulations concerning the minimum financial assurance amount
for nuclear decommissioning. The ultimate cost of nuclear decommissioning for
the Peach Bottom, Salem, and Hope Creek reactors may exceed the current esti-
mates, which are updated periodically.
Conectiv consolidated accrued nuclear decommissioning liability, which is
reflected in the accumulated reserve for depreciation, was $1795 million as
of December 31, 1999 and $1677 million as of December 31,1998. The provision
reflected in depreciation expense for nuclear decommissioning was $67 million
in 1999, $106 million in 1998, and $42 million in 1997. External trust funds
established by DPL and ACE for the purpose of funding nuclear decommissioning
costs had an aggregate book balance stated at fair market value of $1669
million as of December 31, 1999 and $1559 million as of December 31, 1998.
Earnings on the trust funds are recorded as an increase to the accrued nuclear
decommissioning liability, which, in effect, reduces the expense recorded for
nuclear decommissioning. As discussed in Note 13 to the Consolidated Financial
Statements, upon completion of the expected sale of the nuclear plants, DPL
and ACE will transfer their respective nuclear decommissioning trust funds to
the purchasers who will then assume full responsibility for the
decommissioning of the nuclear plants.
The staff of the Securities and Exchange Commission SEC has questioned
certain of the current accounting practices of the electric utility industry,
including Conectiv, regarding the recognition, measurement and classification
of decommissioning costs for nuclear generating stations in the financial
statements of electric utilities. Recently, the FASB issued an exposure draft
of a new accounting pronouncement which addresses the accounting for obliga-
tions associated with the retirement of long-lived assets, such as
decommissioning costs of nuclear generating stations. Under this proposed pro-
nouncement, the present value of the decommissioning obligation would be capi-
talized as part of the cost of the nuclear generating station and recorded as
a liability. The cost capitalized would be depreciated over the life of the
nuclear generating station. Changes in the liability due to the passage of
time would be recorded as interest expense. Changes in the liability resulting
from revisions in the timing or amount of cash flows would increase or de-
crease the liability and the carrying amount of the nuclear generating sta-
tion. Trust fund income from the external decommissioning trusts would be re-
ported as investment income under the proposed pronouncement rather than as a
reduction of decommissioning expense.
NOTE 15. REGULATORY ASSETS AND LIABILITIES
In conformity with SFAS No. 71, Conectiv accounting policies reflect the
financial effects of rate regulation and decisions by regulatory commissions
having jurisdiction over the regulated utility businesses of DPL and ACE. Reg-
ulatory commissions occasionally provide for future recovery from customers of
current period expenses. When this happens, the expenses are deferred as regu-
latory assets and subsequently recognized in the Consolidated Statement of In-
come during the period the expenses are recovered from customers. Similarly,
regulatory liabilities may also be created due to the economic impact of an
action taken by a regulatory commission.
As discussed in Notes 1, 6, and 9 to the Consolidated Financial Statements,
in the third quarter of 1999, the electricity supply businesses of ACE and DPL
no longer met the requirements of SFAS No. 71. Accordingly                   II-53 regulatory assets and liabilities related to the electricity supply business
were written off, except to the extent that future cost recovery was provided
for through the regulated electricity delivery business. A new regulatory as-
set, Recoverable stranded costs, was established to recognize amounts to be
collected from regulated delivery customers for stranded costs which resulted
from deregulation of the electricity supply business.
The table below displays the regulatory assets and liabilities as of Decem-
ber 31, 1999 and December 31, 1998.                           December 31, December 31,

Recoverable Stranded Costs: Represents amounts to be collected from regu-
lated delivery customers net of amounts which have been amortized to expense
for stranded costs which resulted from deregulation of the electricity supply
business. Any gain realized on the sale of certain of ACE electric generat-
ing plants will reduce the amount of recoverable stranded costs. The $10 bil-
lion pre-tax balance as of December 31, 1999 is net of amounts amortized and
includes the $2285 million NUG contract termination payment discussed in Note
10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, with the remaining balance aris-
ing from the write-down of property, plant and equipment and recognition of
certain liabilities in conjunction with discontinuing the application of SFAS
No. 71 due to deregulation of the electricity supply business, as discussed in
Note 6 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.
Deferred Recoverable Income Taxes: Represents the portion of deferred income
tax liabilities applicable to DPL and ACE utility operations that has not
been reflected in current customer rates for which future recovery is proba-
ble. As temporary differences between the financial statement and tax bases of
assets reverse, deferred recoverable income taxes are amortized. Due to dis-
continuing the application of SFAS No. 71 to the electricity supply business,
the portion of deferred recoverable income taxes attributable to the electric-
ity supply businesses of DPL and ACE was written off in 1999.
Deferred Debt Refinancing Costs: See Deferred Debt Refinancing Costs in
Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.
Unrecovered State Excise Taxes: Represents additional amounts paid, by ACE,
as a result of prior legislative changes in the computation of New Jersey
state excise taxes. These costs are included in current customer rates, with
the remaining balance scheduled for full recovery over the next 3 years.
Deferred Other Postretirement Benefit Costs: Represents the non-cash portion
of other postretirement benefit costs deferred by ACE during 1993 through
1997. This cost is being recovered over a 15-year period which began on Janu-
ary 1, 1998.                   II-54  Unrecovered Purchased Power Costs: Includes prior deferrals by ACE of capac-
ity costs $12 million as of December 31, 1999 which had exceeded the related
recovery from customers. These capacity costs are scheduled for recovery
through customer rates within the next year. Unrecovered purchased power costs
also includes costs incurred by ACE for renegotiation of a long-term capacity
and energy contract. These costs are included in current customer rates with
the balance scheduled for full recovery over the next 15 years.
Deferred Energy Supply Costs: See Energy Supply Costs in Note 1 to the
Consolidated Financial Statements.
Deferred Costs for Nuclear  The December 31,
1999 balance represents amounts recoverable from ACE customers for amounts
owed by ACE to the U.S. government for clean-up of gaseous diffusion enrich-
ment facilities pursuant to the Energy Policy Act of 1992.
Regulatory liability for New Jersey income tax benefit: In 1999, a deferred
tax asset arising from the write down of ACE electric generating plant was
established. The deferred tax asset represents the future tax benefit expected
to be realized when the higher tax basis of the generating plants is deducted
for New Jersey state income tax purposes. ACE has requested the New Jersey Di-
vision of Taxation to rule on whether or not this tax benefit may be used to
reduce the rates charged to ACE regulated electricity delivery customers for
stranded cost recovery. To recognize that this tax benefit probably will be
given to ACE regulated electricity customers through lower electric rates,
ACE established a regulatory liability.
Asbestos Removal Costs: Represents costs incurred by ACE to remove asbestos
insulation from a wholly-owned generating station. These costs are included in
current customer rates with the balance scheduled for full recovery over the
next 30 years.
Deferred Demand-Side Management Costs: Represents deferred costs of programs
which allow DPL to reduce the peak demand for power. These costs are being re-
covered over 4 years.
NOTE 16. CONECTIV COMMON STOCK
Significant Transactions
Offer to Purchase
Pursuant to an offer to purchase shares of Conectiv common stock the Of-
fer, in June 1999, Conectiv paid $3614 million including expenses to pur-
chase 14,077,466 shares of Conectiv common stock through the Offer at a price
of $2550 per share, which was determined based on procedures described in the
Offer. Holders of shares of Class A common stock could participate in the Of-
fer by electing to convert shares of Class A common stock into shares of
Conectiv common stock and tendering such shares of Conectiv common stock pur-
suant to the Offer. The 14,077,466 shares of Conectiv common stock purchased
through the Offer included 1,309,251 shares of Conectiv common stock 159997
shares of Conectiv common stock for each share of Class A common stock con-
verted which were issued to and then tendered by holders of 818,297 shares of
Class A common stock who elected to convert shares of Class A common stock
through the Offer.
Buyback program
Conectiv also purchases shares of Conectiv common stock, from time to time,
pursuant to a plan to purchase up to $60 million market value of Conectiv
common stock. Under the buyback program, Conectiv purchased 1,670,000 shares
of Conectiv common stock for $314 million in 1999 and 503,700 shares of
Conectiv common stock for $113 million in 1998. On January 19, 2000, Conectiv
announced that its Board of Directors approved the open market purchase of up
to an additional 5 million shares of common stock.                   II-55 Merger
See Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements and the Statement of
Changes in Common Stockholders' Equity for information concerning changes in
common stock due to the Merger.
Other Common Stock Transactions
For additional information concerning issuances and redemptions of common
stock during 1997 through 1999, see the Consolidated Statements of Changes in
Common Stockholders' Equity.
Dividends
Conectiv announced on May 11, 1999 that it intended to reduce the dividends
on Conectiv common stock to a targeted payout ratio of 40% to 60% of earnings
per average share of common stock outstanding. Conectiv Board of Directors
declared a quarterly dividend per share on Conectiv common stock of $0385 for
the first quarter of 1999, and $022 per share in the second, third, and
fourth quarters of 1999, or a total of $1045 in 1999 which represented ap-
proximately 55% of the $189 of earnings per average share of Conectiv common
stock outstanding adjusted to exclude the special and extraordinary charges
discussed in Notes 5 and 6 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.
Conectiv common dividends paid to public stockholders are funded from the
common dividends DPL and ACE pay to Conectiv. DPL and ACE certificates of
incorporation require payment of all preferred dividends in arrears if any
prior to payment of common dividends to Conectiv, and have certain other limi-
tations on the payment of common dividends to Conectiv.
Under the Public Utility Holding Company Act of 1935, as amended, Conectiv
may not pay dividends on the shares of common stock and Class A common stock
from an accumulated deficit or paid-in-capital without SEC approval. As of De-
cember 31, 1999, Conectiv had an accumulated deficit of $365 million. In Jan-
uary 2000, the SEC approved payment of the dividends declared by Conectiv on
its common stock and Class A common stock in December 1999. Conectiv expects
to have retained earnings sufficient to offset dividends declared on shares of
common stock and Class A common stock beginning in the third quarter of 2000,
when the sale of the electric generating units discussed in Note 13 to the
Consolidated Financial Statements is expected to be completed. There can be no
assurances, however, that the sales of the electric generating units will be
completed, or that any gain will be realized from such sales of the electric
generating units. In any event, Conectiv expects to receive the necessary SEC
approvals during 2000 for the quarterly payment of dividends on shares of its
common stock and Class A common stock.
Stock-Based Compensation
Through the effective date of the Merger March 1, 1998, DPL Long-Term
Incentive Plan LTIP provided long-term incentives to key employees through
contingent awards of performance-based restricted stock, dividend rights, and
stock options. The DPL common stock options outstanding as of the Merger date
were converted to Conectiv common stock options and included in the Conectiv
Incentive Compensation Plan CICP. The restricted common stock previously
granted under DPL LTIP is earned and payable at the end of a four-year pe-
riod to the extent that stock performance compares favorably with the stock
performance of a peer group of utility companies. The 1994 awards were for-
feited in early 1998 when the required performance targets were not met. Re-
strictions on shares contingently granted in 1995 and 1996 lapsed upon the
Merger and the shares became fully vested. The restricted DPL common stock
contingently granted in 1997 was exchanged for Conectiv common stock upon the
Merger and is included in the CICP. As of December 31, 1999, there were 95,415
shares of the 1997 awards outstanding which had a $19 1/8 per share fair value
on the date of grant.
The CICP provides long-term awards to key employees and directors through
awards of stock-based compensation. Up to 5,000,000 shares of common stock may
be issued under the CICP during the ten-year period from March 1, 1998,
through February 28, 2008. Awards granted under the CICP which can be settled
in common stock have included performance accelerated restricted stock PARS,
stock options, and performance accelerated stock options PASO.
II-56  Conectiv granted 52,700 shares of PARS in 1998 and 71,500 shares of PARS in
1999 which are earned by participants over a seven-year vesting period unless
accelerated vesting occurs, in whole or in part, after three years due to sat-
isfaction of certain conditions required for accelerated vesting. For 22,000
shares of the PARS granted in 1998 and 22,000 shares of the PARS granted in
1999, a total stockholder return of 8% must be earned over the seven years for
those shares to vest, unless vesting is accelerated. The 52,700 shares of the
PARS granted in 1998 and the 71,500 shares of the PARS granted in 1999 had per
share fair values on the grant dates of $2284 and $2425, respectively.
Conectiv issued 289,000 stock options in 1998 and 367,800 stock options in
1999, which do not contain performance acceleration features and have an exer-
cise price of $2284 per share and $2425 per share, respectively. These stock
options have a ten-year life, with 50% of the options vesting after two years
and the remaining 50% vesting after three years. Conectiv also issued 150,000
PASO in 1999 exercise price of $2425 per share and 750,000 PASO in 1998
exercise price of $2284 per share. The PASO have a ten-year life and vest
after nine and a half years. One third of the PASO will vest if Conectiv
common stock price closes at or above $26 per share for ten consecutive days,
two thirds will vest if the stock price closes at or above $28 per share for
ten consecutive days, and all of the PASO will vest if the stock price
closes at or above $30 per share for ten consecutive days.
Changes in stock options including PASO are summarized below.                  1999          1998          1997

million in 1998, and $22 million in 1997. Pro forma net income loss, based
on the application of SFAS No. 123, Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation,
was $199306 million for 1999, $152676 million for 1998, and $101638 mil-
lion for 1997. Pro forma earnings loss per share of Conectiv common stock
was $203 for 1999, $149 for 1998 and $166 for 1997.

Under Conectiv Stockholders Rights Plan Plan, holders of Conectiv common
stock and holders of Conectiv Class A common stock were granted preferred
stock purchase rights on May 11, 1998, by means of a dividend at the rate of
one Right for each share of common stock and one Right for each share of Class
A common stock held. The Rights expire in 10 years.
The purpose of the Plan is to guard against partial tender offers or abusive
or unfair tactics that might be used in an attempt to gain control of Conectiv
without paying all stockholders a fair price for their shares. The Plan will
not prevent takeovers, but is designed to deter coercive, abusive, or unfair
takeover tactics and to encourage individuals or entities attempting to ac-
quire Conectiv to first negotiate with the Board of Directors.
Each Right would, after the Rights become exercisable, entitle the holder to
purchase from Conectiv one one-hundredth of one share of Series One Junior
Preferred Stock or one one-hundredth of one share of Series Two Junior Pre-
ferred Stock at an initial price of $65. The Rights will be exercisable only
if a person or group acquires beneficial ownership of 15% or more of the ag-
gregate voting power represented by Conectiv outstanding securities i.e.,
becomes an Acquiring Person as defined in the Plan or commences a tender or
exchange offer to acquire beneficial ownership of 15% or more of the aggregate
voting power represented by Conectiv outstanding securities. Conectiv gener-
ally will be entitled to redeem the Rights at $01 per Right at any time be-
fore a person or group becomes an Acquiring Person.
NOTE 17. CONECTIV CLASS A COMMON STOCK
General
Conectiv Class A common stock provides its holders a proportionately greater
opportunity to share in the growth prospects of, and a proportionately greater
exposure to the uncertainties associated with, the electric utility business
of ACE. Earnings applicable to Class A common stock are equal to a percentage
of Company Net Income Attributable to the Atlantic Utility Group, which is
earnings of the Atlantic Utility Group AUG less $40 million per year. The
AUG includes the assets and liabilities of the electric generation, transmis-
sion, and distribution businesses of ACE which existed on August 9, 1996 and
were regulated by the NJBPU.
The percentage of Company Net Income Attributable to the Atlantic Utility
Group applicable to Class A common stock was 30% at the date of the Merger.
Certain circumstances, as specified in the Restated Certificate of Incorpora-
tion of Conectiv, result in an adjustment to the percentage of Company Net
Income Attributable to the Atlantic Utility Group applicable to Class A com-
mon stock. As discussed in Note 16 to the Consolidated Financial Statements,
the number of shares of Class A common stock outstanding decreased by 818,297
as a result of the Offer. Due to this reduction in the number of shares of
Class A common stock outstanding and in accordance with the Restated Certifi-
cate of Incorporation of Conectiv, the percentage of Company Net Income At-
tributable to the Atlantic Utility Group applicable to Class A common stock
decreased to 273% in June 1999, when the Offer was completed.
The earnings of the Atlantic Utility Group AUG will be affected by the im-
plementation of the Summary Order in New Jersey, including the rate decreases
required by the Summary Order. See Note 9 to the Consolidated Financial
Statements for information concerning the Summary Order. The planned sales of
most of ACE electric generating plants are expected to decrease the earnings
capacity of the AUG. The extent of the decrease in earnings capacity will be
affected by how the proceeds from the sales of the generating plants are uti-
lized, which has not yet been finalized by Conectiv management and Board of
Directors. On January 19, 2000, Conectiv announced that it expects to use the
proceeds for debt repayment, repurchases of common stock and new investments
that fit with Conectiv strategies, including expansion of the mid-merit gen-
eration business. Under certain circumstances, the percentage of Company Net
Income Attributable to the Atlantic Utility Group applicable to Class A com-
mon stock may be adjusted. The electric generating plants of ACE which are not
sold to third parties are expected to be transferred to another Conectiv sub-
sidiary; such transfer would not
II-58 affect the earnings of the AUG or the percentage of Company Net Income At-
tributable to the Atlantic Utility Group applicable to Class A common stock
because the transferred electric generating plants would remain part of the
AUG.
Dividends
Dividends declared per share of Class A common stock were $320 for 1999 and
$320 for 1998. In comparison, earnings excluding special charges and the ex-
traordinary item which were applicable to Class A common stock were $144 in
1999 and $182 in 1998.

On August 3, 1998, ACE redeemed the remaining 100,000 shares of its $820 No
Par Preferred Stock at $100 per share or $100 million in total the book
value of the preferred stock.
In November 1998, a financing subsidiary trust owned by ACE issued $25 mil-
lion 1,000,000 shares of 7 3/8% preferred stock.
DPL and ACE have established wholly-owned subsidiary trusts for the purposes
of issuing common and preferred trust securities and holding Junior Subordi-
nated Debentures the Debentures issued by DPL and ACE, respectively. The De-
bentures held by the trusts are their only assets. The trusts use interest
payments received on the Debentures they hold to make cash distributions on
the trust securities.
DPL and ACE obligations pursuant to the Debentures and guarantees of
distributions with respect to the trusts' securities, to the extent the trusts
have funds available therefor, constitute full and unconditional guarantees of
the obligations of the trusts under the trust securities the trusts have is-
sued. DPL and ACE own all of the common securities of the trusts, which con-
stitute approximately 3% of the liquidation amount of all of the trust securi-
ties issued by the trusts.
For consolidated financial reporting purposes, the Debentures are eliminated
in consolidation against the trust investment in the Debentures. The pre-
ferred trust securities are subject to mandatory redemption upon payment of
the Debentures at maturity or upon redemption. The Debentures mature in 2026
to 2036. The Debentures are subject to redemption, in whole or in part, at the
option of DPL and/or ACE, at 100% of their principal amount plus accrued in-
terest, after an initial period during which they may not be redeemed and at
any time upon the occurrence of certain events.
NOTE 19. DEBT
Substantially all utility plant of DPL and ACE are subject to the liens of
the Mortgages collateralizing First Mortgage Bonds issued by DPL and ACE.
Maturities of long-term debt and sinking fund requirements during the next
five years are as follows: 2000 489 million; 2001 1008 million; 2002 3706 million; 2003 2128 million; 2004 1547 million.
As of December 31, 1999, Conectiv and its subsidiaries had credit agreements
providing $105 billion of aggregate borrowing capability, as follows: a
Conectiv the holding company had a $300 million credit agreement with a
five-year term that expires in February 2003; b Conectiv the holding compa-
ny had a $500 million credit agreement with a one-year term that expired in
February 2000, when Conectiv renewed the one                   II-62 year credit agreement and increased its capacity from $500 million to $730
million; c ACE had a $250 million credit facility which is discussed below.
On a consolidated basis, $273 million was available for borrowing as of Decem-
ber 31, 1999 under the various credit agreements and credit lines.
As discussed in Note 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, ACE bor-
rowed $2285 million from a $250 million revolving credit facility on December
28, 1999 to finance a payment for termination of a NUG purchased power con-
tract. ACE arranged this credit facility to provide interim financing of the
NUG contract termination payment until securitized bonds are issued. See Note
9 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for information concerning the ex-
pected securitization of ACE stranded costs. The revolving loan balance is
due on December 20, 2000 unless ACE elects to convert the outstanding loan
balance to a term loan. If securitized bonds have not been issued by December
20, 2000, ACE intends to exercise its option to convert the revolving loan
balance to a term loan. The term loan balance is due in two installments; 1
25% of the principal balance is due December 20, 2001, and 2 the remaining
term loan principal is due December 20, 2002.
Conectiv had a $5797 million consolidated short-term debt balance average
interest rate of 64% as of December 31, 1999, an increase of $2036 million
from the $3761 million balance average interest rate of 60% as of December
31, 1998. The $2036 million increase was primarily due to financing part of
the common stock purchased pursuant to the Offer and funding the expansion of
Conectiv Communications, Inc. telecommunications business.
On May 26, 1999, Conectiv issued $250 million of 673% Medium Term Notes
which mature as follows: $100 million in 2002; $50 million in 2003; $50 mil-
lion in 2004; $30 million in 2005; and $20 million in 2006. Proceeds from the
issuance of the Medium Term Notes and short-term borrowings under Conectiv
bank credit lines were used to finance the $3614 million purchase of Conectiv
common stock pursuant to the Offer, as discussed in Note 16 to the Consoli-
dated Financial Statements.
In May 1999, DPL repaid at maturity $30 million of 750% Medium Term Notes
and ACE repaid at maturity $30 million of 752% Medium Term Notes. In June
1999, ACE purchased $189 million of its First Mortgage Bonds, which had an
average interest rate of 688% and were scheduled to mature in 2013 $64 mil-
lion and 2023 $125 million. In July 1999, the Delaware Economic Develop-
ment Authority issued, on behalf of DPL, $3333 million of Variable Rate De-
mand Bonds VRDB due on demand or at maturity in July 2024. The proceeds from
the VRDB were used to refinance $2233 million of 73% long-term debt in Sep-
tember 1999 and $110 million of 75% long-term debt in October 1999.
In December 1999, ATE Investments, Inc., a Conectiv subsidiary, repaid at
maturity $150 million of long-term debt bearing an interest rate of 744%.
On December 14, 1999, the SEC approved Conectiv request regarding the fol-
lowing financing matters: a The authorized short-term debt borrowing capac-
ity of Conectiv the holding company and DPL was increased from a total of
$800 million to a total of $13 billion and b Conectiv was authorized to is-
sue securities as long as consolidated common equity as a percent of total
capitalization common equity ratio is 20% or higher. Conectiv also requested
SEC approval for the following financing matters: a The issuance of up to
$500 million of additional long-term debt by Conectiv the holding company,
which would bring the total amount of authorized Conectiv long-term debt to $1
billion, of which $250 million has been issued. Proceeds from the additional
long-term debt would be used to pay down short term debt; and b The authori-
zation to use proceeds from the issuance of securities for investments in a
Conectiv subsidiary that will own contractual rights for non-utility, combus-
tion turbine generating facilities. The SEC has currently reserved jurisdic-
tion over these requests, which requires additional information to be filed
by Conectiv prior to any SEC authorization.
On September 28, 1999, the parties to the agreements for Conectiv $800
million short-term credit facilities agreed to an amendment permitting a ratio
of total indebtedness to total capitalization of 70% through December 31,
2000. As of December 31, 1999, the ratio of total indebtedness to total capi-
talization computed in accordance with the terms of the credit agreements,
which allow for an adjustment to increase common equity by the amount of the
extraordinary item, was 635%.

II-64 2 The debt obligations of Conectiv subsidiaries included VRDB in the
amounts of $1584 million and $1251 million as of December 31, 1999 and
1998, respectively. The VRDB are classified as current liabilities because
the VRDB are due on demand by the bondholder. However, bonds submitted to
Conectiv subsidiaries for purchase are remarketed by a remarketing agent
on a best efforts basis. Management expects that bonds submitted for pur-
chase will continue to be remarketed successfully due to the credit wor-
thiness of Conectiv subsidiaries and the bonds' interest rates being set
at market. Conectiv subsidiaries also may utilize one of the fixed
rate/fixed term conversion options of the bonds. Thus, management consid-
ers the VRDB to be a source of long-term financing. The $1584 million
balance of VRDB outstanding as of December 31, 1999, matures in 2009
$125 million, 2014 $182 million, 2017 $304 million, 2024 $3333
million; 2028 $155 million, 2029 $300 million and 2031 $185 mil-
lion. Average annual interest rates on the VRDB were 33% in 1999 and
34% in 1998.

As of December 31, 1999, ACE and DPL commitments under long-term pur-
chased power contracts were as follows: ACE-708 MW of capacity; DPL-243 MW of
capacity; and DPL-100 MWH of firm electricity per hour. As discussed in Note 6
to the Consolidated Financial Statements, the net present value of expected
losses under uneconomic purchased power contracts was included in the extraor-
dinary item in the third quarter of 1999. Historical information is presented
below for these contracts including ACE from March 1, 1998 forward and also
includes amounts for the 116 MW NUG purchased power contract which was termi-
nated on December 28, 1999, as discussed in Note 10 to the Consolidated Finan-
cial Statements.                              1999  1998  1997

Capacity charges $ in  $2006 $1827 $285
Energy charges $ in  $1444 $1665 $381  Based on existing contracts as of December 31, 1999, Conectiv commitments
during the next five years for capacity and energy under long-term purchased
power contracts are estimated to be $3126 million in 2000; $3061 million in
2001; $3102 million in 2002; $3145 million in 2003; and $3190 million in
2004.
The terms of DPL wholly-owned power plant sale agreement discussed in Note
13 to the Consolidated Financial Statements provide for DPL to purchase from
NRG Energy, Inc. 500 MWH of firm electricity per hour from completion of the
sale through December 31, 2005. DPL expects to use electricity purchased under
this agreement and other purchased power agreements to fulfill its obligations
in Delaware and Maryland as a default service provider. Recently, DPL entered
into an agreement to purchase 350 MW of capacity and energy from PECO from
March 2000 to February 2003. These planned power purchases are excluded from
the commitments discussed above.
II-65 NOTE 22. LEASES
Nuclear Fuel
The ownership interests of DPL and ACE in nuclear fuel at Peach Bottom, Sa-
lem, and Hope Creek are financed through nuclear fuel energy contracts, which
are accounted for as capital leases. Payments under the contracts are based on
the quantity of nuclear fuel burned by the plants. The obligations of DPL and
ACE under the contracts are generally the net book values of the nuclear fuel
financed, which was $560 million, in total, as of December 31, 1999. As dis-
cussed in Note 13 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, under sales agree-
ments for the nuclear power plants which are pending completion, the nuclear
fuel is to be sold at its net book value, in conjunction with the sale of the
plants.
Lease Commitments
DPL leases an 119% interest in the Merrill Creek Reservoir. The lease is an
operating lease and payments over the remaining lease term, which ends in
2032, are $1676 million in aggregate. As discussed in Note 6 to the Consoli-
dated Financial Statements, the net present value of water-supply capacity
from the Merrill Creek Reservoir in excess of the electric generating plants'
requirements was included in the extraordinary item in the third quarter of
1999. DPL, ACE and other Conectiv subsidiaries also have long-term leases for
certain other facilities and equipment. Minimum commitments as of December 31,
1999, under the Merrill Creek Reservoir lease and other lease agreements ex-
cluding payments under the nuclear fuel energy contracts, which cannot be rea-
sonably estimated are as follows: 2000 197 million; 2001 197 million;
2002 197 million; 2003 217 million; 2004 191 million; after 2004 1629 million; total 2628 million.
Rentals Charged To Operating Expenses
The following amounts were charged to operating expenses for rental payments
under both capital and operating leases.                             1999  1998  1997

Leveraged Leases
The leveraged leases of Conectiv subsidiaries included five aircraft
leases and two containership leases as of December 31, 1999 and 1998. During
1999, declines in the estimated residual values of the airplanes and cargo
container-ships leased by Conectiv subsidiaries to third parties under
leveraged leases resulted in a write-down of the investments in leveraged
leases by $437 million before taxes $267 million after taxes. The net in-
vestment in leveraged leases as of December 31, 1999, and 1998 was as follows                               1999   1998

health-care cost trend rates of future years by one percentage point would in-
crease the accumulated postretirement benefit obligation by $159 million and
would increase annual aggregate service and interest costs by $18 million.
Decreasing the health-care cost trend rates of future years by one percentage
point would decrease the accumulated postretirement benefit obligation by
$140 million and would decrease annual aggregate service and interest costs
by $16 million.
The following schedules reconcile the beginning and ending balances of the
pension and other postretirement benefit obligations and related plan assets
for Conectiv. Other postretirement benefits include medical benefits for re-
tirees and their spouses and retiree life insurance.

II-68  The special termination benefits and curtailment and settlement gains and
losses shown above for 1998 resulted from Merger-related employee separation
programs discussed in Note 5 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.
Conectiv also maintains 401k savings plans for covered employees. Conectiv
contributes to the plan, in the form of Conectiv stock, at varying levels up
to $050 for each dollar contributed by employees, up to 6% of employee base
pay. The amount expensed for Conectiv matching contributions was $56 mil-
lion in 1999, $49 million in 1998, and $30 million in 1997.
NOTE 24. COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES
Commitments
Conectiv expected capital and acquisition expenditures are estimated to be
approximately $375 million to $400 million in 2000.
See Note 21 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for commitments related
to long-term purchased power contracts and Note 22 to the Consolidated Finan-
cial Statements for commitments related to leases.
Environmental Matters
Conectiv subsidiaries are subject to regulation with respect to the envi-
ronmental effects of their operations, including air and water quality con-
trol, solid and hazardous waste disposal, and limitations on land use by vari-
ous federal, regional, state, and local authorities. Federal and state stat-
utes authorize governmental agencies to compel responsible parties to clean up
certain abandoned or uncontrolled hazardous waste sites. Costs may be incurred
to clean up facilities found to be contaminated due to past disposal practic-
es. Conectiv current liabilities include $30 million as of December 31,
1999, and 1998, respectively, for potential clean-up and other costs related
to sites at which a Conectiv subsidiary is a potentially responsible party or
alleged to be a third party contributor. Conectiv does not expect such future
costs to have a material effect on its financial position or results of opera-
tions.
Nuclear Insurance
In conjunction with the ownership interests of DPL and ACE in Peach Bottom,
Salem, and Hope Creek, they could be assessed for a portion of any third-party
claims associated with an incident at any commercial nuclear power plant in
the United States. Under the provisions of the Price Anderson Act, if third-
party claims relating to such an incident exceed $200 million the amount of
primary insurance, they could be assessed up to $570 million on an aggregate
basis for such third-party claims. In addition, Congress could impose a reve-
nue-raising measure on the nuclear industry to pay such claims.
The co-owners of Peach Bottom, Salem, and Hope Creek maintain property in-
surance coverage of approximately $28 billion for each unit for loss or dam-
age to the units, including coverage for decontamination expense and premature
decommissioning. In addition, Conectiv is a member of an industry mutual in-
surance company, which provides replacement power cost coverage in the event
of a major accidental outage at a nuclear power plant. Under these coverages,
Conectiv is subject to potential retrospective loss experience assessments of
up to $73 million on an aggregate basis.
II-69 NOTE 25. BUSINESS SEGMENTS
The following information is presented in accordance with SFAS No. 131,
Disclosures about Segments of an Enterprise and Related Information. In ac-
cordance with SFAS No. 131, Conectiv business segments were determined from
Conectiv internal organization and management reporting, which are based
primarily on differences in products and services. Conectiv business seg-
ments under SFAS No. 131 are as follows: Energy--generates, purchases, and
sells electricity includes trading activities, also operates power plants
and thermal heating and cooling systems; Power Delivery--delivers electric-
ity and gas to customers at regulated prices over transmission and distribu-
tion systems;  services provided by Conectiv
Communications Inc. CCI, including local and long-distance telephone service
and Internet services; HVAC--represents heating, ventilation, and air condi-
tioning HVAC services provided by Conectiv Services, Inc. CSI. Segment in-
formation for 1998 and 1997 has been restated to conform with the current pre-
sentation.
All revenues of Conectiv business segments are from customers located in
the United States. Also, all assets of Conectiv business segments are lo-
cated in the United States.
As discussed in Note 9 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, Conectiv
electricity supply businesses were deregulated in the third quarter of 1999.
Prior to deregulation, billings to electric customers included unspecified
amounts for electricity supply and delivery; during this period revenues were
allocated directly to the Energy and Power Delivery business segments based on
the cost of services provided.
The services provided by one business segment to another business segment
are recorded as a transfer of costs, based on the fully-distributed cost of
the service provided. Common services which are shared by the business units
shared services are assigned directly or allocated based on various cost
causative factors, depending on the nature of the service provided. The depre-
ciation associated with shared services' assets is allocated to the business
segments; however, the assets and related capital expenditures are not allo-
cated.
The business segments' operating results are evaluated based on earnings
before interest and income taxes, which is generally equivalent to Operating
Income plus Other Income, less certain interest charges allocated to the busi-
ness segments. Earnings before interest and income taxes for 1999 and 1998
exclude the Special charges which are discussed in Note 5 to the Consoli-
dated Financial Statements. All Other business segments' earnings before
interest and income taxes for 1999 includes $421 million from equity in
earnings of Enertech as discussed in Note 7 to the Consolidated Financial
Statements. Earnings before interest and income taxes for 1998 includes the
January and February 1998 pre-Merger operating results of the former Atlan-
tic-owned companies. Earnings before interest and income taxes for the En-
ergy business segment in 1998 includes $177 million of equity in earnings of
a nonutility generation joint venture. Earnings before interest and income
taxes for 1997 excludes the gain on the sale of the Pine Grove landfill and
its related waste-hauling company, which is discussed in Note 7 to the Consol-
idated Financial Statements.
II-70  For internal management reporting purposes, Investments and Property, Plant
and Equipment are assigned to business segments, but Current Assets and De-
ferred Charges and Other Assets are not.                                             As of
