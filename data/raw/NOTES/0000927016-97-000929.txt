IDX SYSTEMS CORPORATION
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
DECEMBER 31, 1996
1. SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
NATURE OF BUSINESS
IDX Systems Corporation the Company operates in one principal industry
segment providing health care information systems and services throughout the
United States. Revenues are derived from the licensing of software,
maintenance and installation of software systems, and sale of computer
hardware.
BASIS OF PRESENTATION AND PRINCIPLES OF CONSOLIDATION
The Company leases a substantial portion of its space, including its
corporate headquarters and certain sales and support offices, from real estate
partnerships and trusts owned by stockholders and certain key employees of the
Company. These real estate partnerships and trusts include 116 Huntington
Avenue Limited Partnership HLP, BDP Realty Associates BDP and other
real estate partnerships and trusts REPs. Under generally accepted
accounting principles and rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange
Commission the Commission, the Company consolidated financial statements
are required to include the accounts of the Company and those real estate
partnership and trusts Affiliates whose real estate is leased exclusively
by the Company and for which the Company is subject to substantially all the
risks of ownership. Accordingly, for the year ended December 31, 1994, the
accompanying consolidated statements of income include the operations of the
Company, BDP and the REPs. Real estate owned by HLP is leased to the Company
under an operating lease. As a result of the termination of leases for
substantially all the space leased from the REPs in 1995, the accompanying
consolidated financial statements at December 31, 1996 and 1995 and for the
years then ended, include only the accounts of the Company and BDP. All
transactions between the Company and Affiliates are eliminated. Minority
interest represents net income and equity of the Affiliates.
RECLASSIFICATION
Certain amounts in 1995 and 1994 have been reclassified to permit
comparison.
REVENUE RECOGNITION
Software License Fees
The Company recognizes revenue in accordance with the provisions of AICPA
Statement of Position No. 91-1 Software Revenue Recognition SOP 91-1.
Software license fees represent revenues derived from the license of the
Company proprietary systems software. License revenue is deferred and
recognized upon fulfillment of contractual obligations based upon achievement
of specified milestones including delivery, installation, live processing of
customer transactions and final acceptance. During 1997, the AICPA is expected
to issue an SOP revising certain aspects of SOP 91-1. Based upon the current
version of the proposed SOP, the Company does not expect adoption will
materially affect its revenue recognition policies with respect to software
license fees which are principally recognized in connection with the
fulfillment of contractual obligations based upon achievements of milestones.
The expected issue date is currently not known.
Hardware Sales
Sale of computer equipment is recognized upon shipment, provided post-sale
vendor obligations are insignificant. If significant, revenue is deferred
until the obligations are fulfilled.
28
IDX SYSTEMS CORPORATION
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS--CONTINUED
Maintenance and Services
Installation service revenue related to systems sales is recognized upon
fulfillment of contractual obligations based upon achievement of specified
milestones. Professional service revenue is recognized as the services are
performed. Maintenance is recognized ratably over the term of the agreement.
RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT COSTS
Research and development costs are expensed as incurred. Software
development costs incurred after the establishment of technological
feasibility and until the product is available for general release are
capitalized, provided recoverability is reasonably assured. Technological
feasibility is established upon the completion of a working model which has
been approved for beta site testing. Software development costs, when
material, are amortized over the expected life of the product which, due to
the frequency of product revision releases, generally does not exceed two
years. In 1996, 1995 and 1994, software development costs eligible for
capitalization were not material and have been expensed.
CASH EQUIVALENTS
The Company considers highly liquid investments generally with a maturity of
three months or less when purchased, to be cash equivalents. Cash equivalents
are stated at cost, which approximates market value.
RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES
Concentration of Credit Risk
Financial instruments which potentially subject the Company to a
concentration of credit risk principally consist of cash and cash equivalents,
securities available-for-sale, and trade receivables.
The Company invests excess cash primarily in money market mutual funds with
high credit ratings, equity securities with highly rated issuers and treasury
notes and bonds issued by the United States Government and the State of
Vermont.
The Company sells its systems and services to health care providers
throughout the United States. To reduce credit risk, the Company performs
ongoing credit evaluations of the financial condition of its customers.
Although the Company is directly affected by the overall financial condition
of the health care industry, management does not believe significant credit
risk exists at December 31, 1996. The Company losses, which have
consistently been within management expectations, related to collection of
trade accounts receivable were approximately $138,000, $242,000 and $181,000,
in 1996, 1995 and 1994, respectively.
Significant Estimates and Assumptions
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally
accepted accounting principles requires management to make significant
estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and
liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of
the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses
during the reporting period. Significant estimates and assumptions by
management affect the Company allowance for doubtful accounts, revenue
recognition and certain accrued expenses. Actual results could differ from
those estimates.
INVESTMENT SECURITIES
The Company accounts for investment securities based on Statement of
Financial Accounting Standards No115, Accounting for Certain Investments in
Debt and Equity Securities SFAS No. 115. SFAS
29
IDX SYSTEMS CORPORATION
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS--CONTINUED
No. 115 provides the accounting and reporting requirements for investments in
equity securities that have readily determinable fair values and for all
investments in debt securities. All of the Company investments have been
classified as available-for-sale securities at December 31, 1996 and 1995.
Available-for-sale securities are carried at fair value with unrealized gains
and losses reported as a component of stockholders' equity.
PROPERTY AND EQUIPMENT
Real estate, which includes land, buildings and related improvements owned
by an Affiliate, is stated at cost. Buildings and related improvements are
depreciated using the straight-line method over their estimated useful lives
of 30 to 40 years.
Equipment is stated at cost and is depreciated over its estimated useful
life by using the straight-line method. Depreciation is generally computed
based on useful lives of three to five years for computer equipment and
software and five to ten years for furniture and fixtures. Leasehold
improvements are amortized using the straight-line method over the lesser of
the term of the respective lease or the estimated useful life of the asset.
ACCOUNTING FOR THE IMPAIRMENT OF LONG-LIVED ASSETS
Effective January 1, 1996, the Company adopted SFAS No. 121, Accounting for
the Impairment of Long-Lived Assets and for Long-Lived Assets to be Disposed
Of, which requires impairment losses to be recognized for long-lived assets
used in operations when indicators of impairment are present and the
undiscounted cash flows are not sufficient to recover the assets' carrying
amount. The impairment loss is measured by comparing the fair value of the
asset to its carrying amount. The adoption of SFAS No. 121 did not have any
effect on the carrying value of long-lived assets.
INCOME TAXES
On November 1, 1995, the Company terminated its status as an S Corporation
under Section 1362 of the Internal Revenue Code, and thereafter has become
subject to federal and state corporate income taxes. Prior to November 1,
1995, the Company was not liable for federal income taxes as income was taxed
directly to the Company stockholders. The Company had provided for income
taxes in states in which it operated that did not recognize S Corporation
status. This change in tax status resulted in the Company recording a
$2,036,000 tax benefit in 1995.
The Company accounts for income taxes using the liability method as required
by SFAS No. 109, Accounting for Income Taxes. Under this method, deferred
income taxes are recognized for the future tax consequences of differences
between the tax and financial accounting of assets and liabilities at each
year end. Deferred income taxes are based on enacted tax laws and statutory
tax rates applicable to the periods in which the differences are expected to
affect taxable income. A valuation allowance is established when necessary to
reduce deferred tax assets to the amounts expected to be realized. Income tax
expense is the tax payable for the period and the change during the period in
deferred tax assets and liabilities.
STOCK OPTION PLANS
The Company grants stock options for a fixed number of shares to employees
with an exercise price equal to the fair value of the shares at the date of
the grant. The Company has elected to follow Accounting Principles Board
Opinion No. 25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees APB 25 and
related Interpretations in accounting for its employee stock options because,
as discussed below, the alternative fair value accounting provided for under
SFAS No. 123, Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation, requires use of
option valuation models that were not developed for use in valuing employee
stock options. Under APB 25, because
30
IDX SYSTEMS CORPORATION
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS--CONTINUED
the exercise price of the Company employee stock options equals the market
price of the underlying stock on the date of grant, no compensation expense is
recognized.
NET INCOME PER SHARE
Net income per share is computed using the weighted average number of shares
of common stock and dilutive common equivalent shares outstanding during the
period. Common equivalent shares consist of the incremental common shares
issuable upon the exercise of stock options using the treasury stock method.
Primary and fully diluted net income per share amounts were the same in 1996.
PRO FORMA INFORMATION UNAUDITED
Pro Forma Consolidated Statement of Income
On November 1, 1995, the Company terminated its status as an S Corporation
and thereafter became subject to federal and state corporate income taxes.
Accordingly, for informational purposes, the accompanying consolidated
statements of income for the years ended December 31, 1995 and 1994 includes
an unaudited pro forma adjustment for income taxes, based on the tax laws in
effect at the time, which would have been recorded if the Company had not been
an S Corporation.
Total pro forma income tax expense is different from the amount which would
be provided by applying the statutory federal rate to income before income
taxes principally due to the effect of state income taxes, non-deductible
permanent items and capital losses for which a valuation allowance has been
provided due to the uncertainty of realization during the carryforward period.
Pro Forma Net Income Per Share
Pro forma net income per share is computed using pro forma net income and
the weighted average number of common and dilutive common stock equivalent
shares. Common Stock equivalents are attributable to stock options using the
treasury stock method and, for the nine-month period ended September 30, 1995
and the year ended December 31, 1994, include the weighted average estimated
number of shares which was necessary to fund the payment of undistributed S
Corporation earnings in excess of the previous twelve months net income.
Common Stock and Common Stock equivalent shares issued during the twelve-month
period prior to the effective date of the initial public offering have been
included in the calculation as if they were outstanding for the nine-month
period ended September 30, 1995 and the year ended December 31, 1994 using the
treasury stock method. The initial public offering price was used in the
determination of Common Stock equivalents for all periods presented up to the
effective date of the initial public offering. After that date, the market
prices of Common Stock were used for computing Common Stock equivalents.
Primary and fully diluted pro forma net income per share are the same for each
period presented.

leasehold improvements to be owned by the Company. At December 31, 1995,
leasehold improvements of $1,509,000 were capitalized by the Company and the
balance of the advance of $1,161,000 was remitted to the Company.

11. BENEFIT PLANS
PROFIT SHARING RETIREMENT PLAN
The Company maintains a profit sharing retirement plan for all employees
meeting age and service requirements. The contributions to the plan are
discretionary, as determined by the Board of Directors. The Company expects to
continue the plan indefinitely; however, the Company has reserved the right to
modify, amend or terminate the plan. For the years ended December 31, 1996,
1995 and 1994, the Company has expensed $2,840,000, $2,400,000 and $2,046,000,
respectively.
STOCK PURCHASE PLAN
In September 1995, the Company Board of Directors and stockholders
approved the 1995 Employee Stock Purchase Plan the ESPP under which
eligible employees may purchase Common Stock at a price per share equal to 85%
of the lower of the fair market value of the Common Stock at the beginning or
end of each offering period. Participation in the offering is limited to 10%
of an employee compensation not to exceed amounts allowed under Section 423
of the Internal Revenue Code, may be terminated at any time by the employee
and automatically ends on termination of employment with the Company. A total
of 500,000 shares of Common Stock have been reserved for issuance under this
plan. During the year ended December 31, 1996, approximately 160,000 shares
were purchased under this plan. At December 31, 1995, $351,000 had been
withheld from employees' salaries for 1996 purchases under the plan and were
included in accrued expenses.
NONQUALIFIED STOCK OPTIONS
Nonqualified stock options are granted at a minimum of the fair market value
at the date of grant, and generally vest over five years or immediately in the
event of a public stock offering or the merger of the Company when the Company
is not the surviving entity. The options have no expiration date. As of
December 31, 1996, nonqualified options to acquire 3,516,596 shares of Common
Stock have been granted at exercise prices ranging from $31 to $3188 per
share. During 1996, 1995 and 1994, options to acquire 8,000, 1,636,020 and
1,318,000 shares, respectively, were exercised at prices ranging from $31 to
$782 per share.
In September 1995, the Company Board of Directors approved the 1995
Director Stock Option Plan the Director Plan, which provides that each
non-employee director of the Company be granted an option to acquire 2,000
shares of Common Stock on the date that person becomes a director but, in any
event, not earlier than the effective date of the Director Plan. Options are
granted at a price equal to the fair market value on the date of grant. The
option becomes exercisable on the first anniversary of the date of grant, and
the term of the option is ten years from the date of grant. The Company has
reserved 30,000 shares of Common Stock for issuance under the Director Plan.
As of December 31, 1996, options to acquire 12,000 shares of Common Stock have
been granted under the Director Plan at exercise prices ranging from $1800 to
$3675 per share, 6,000 of which are exercisable.
INCENTIVE STOCK OPTION PLANS
During 1985 and 1994, the Company established incentive stock option plans
providing for the grant of options for the issuance of 959,640 and 696,460
shares, respectively, of Common Stock. Options are granted at fair market
value at the time of grant and became immediately exercisable at the time of
the initial public

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS--CONTINUED
offering. The 1994 Plan also provides for the grant of stock appreciation
rights SAR. The options expire on the tenth anniversary of the date of
the grant or upon termination of employment. No SAR have been granted under
the 1994 Plan which terminated upon the completion of the initial public
offering. The 1985 Plan was terminated in March 1995.
In September 1995, the Company stockholders approved the 1995 Stock Option
Plan the 1995 Option Plan. The 1995 Option Plan provides for the grant of
stock options to employees, officers and directors of, and consultants and
advisors to, the Company. Under the 1995 Option Plan, the Company may grant
options that are intended to qualify as incentive stock options under
provisions of the Internal Revenue Code or options not intended to qualify as
incentive stock options. The option grants, exercise price, vesting and
expiration will be authorized by a compensation committee comprised of the
Company nonmanagement directors. A total of 1,470,000 shares of Common Stock
may be issued upon the exercise of options granted under the 1995 Option Plan.
In 1994, the Board of Directors voted to distribute $424,000 to certain key
employees who are not stockholders. These distributions, which were charged to
selling, general and administrative expense in the year distributed, were made
to compensate key employees in connection with the expiration of certain
incentive stock options. These distributions were discretionary and the Board
is not obligated to approve similar distributions in future years.
STOCK BASED COMPENSATION
Pro forma information regarding net income and earnings per share is
required by SFAS No. 123, and has been determined as if the Company had
accounted for its employee stock options and shares issued pursuant to the
ESPP under the fair value method of that Statement. The fair value for these
options and shares issued pursuant to the ESPP were estimated at the date of
grant using the Black-Scholes option pricing model with the following weighted
average assumptions:
OPTIONS   ESPP
1996 1995 1996 1995
Expected life  69  31  57    Interest  65% 59% 64%    390% 240% 390%   Dividend  00% 00% 00%  
The Black-Scholes option valuation model was developed for use in estimating
the fair value of traded options which have no vesting restrictions and are
fully transferable. In addition, option valuation models require the input of
highly subjective assumptions including the expected stock price volatility.
Because the Company employee stock options have characteristics
significantly different from those of traded options, and because changes in
the subjective input assumptions can materially affect the fair value
estimate, in management opinion, the existing models do not necessarily
provide a reliable single measure of the fair value of its employee stock
options.
For purposes of pro forma disclosures, the estimated fair value of the
options is amortized to expense over the options' vesting period. The
Company pro forma information follows in thousands, except for earnings per
share information:
1996  1995
Pro forma net  $13,372 $9,523

The effects on 1996 and 1995 pro forma net income and net income per share
of expensing the estimated fair value of stock options and shares issued
pursuant to the ESPP are not necessarily representative of the effects on
reporting the results of operations for future years as the periods presented
include only one and two years of option grants under the Company plans.
