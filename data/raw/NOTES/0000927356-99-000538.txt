REPORT OF INDEPENDENT PUBLIC ACCOUNTANTS
To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of SCC Communications Corp.  We have audited the accompanying balance sheets of SCC Communications Corp. a
Delaware corporation as of December 31, 1998 and 1997, and the related
statements of operations, stockholders' equity deficit and cash flows for each
of the three years in the period ended December 31, 1998. These financial
statements are the responsibility of the Company management. Our
responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on
our audits.
We conducted our audits in accordance with generally accepted auditing
standards. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material
misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting
the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes
assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by
management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.
We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in
all material respects, the financial position of SCC Communications Corp. as of
December 31, 1998 and 1997, and the results of its operations and its cash flows
for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 1998, in conformity

SCC COMMUNICATIONS CORP.
NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
1 ORGANIZATION, BUSINESS AND LIQUIDITY
SCC Communications Corp., the Company, is a Delaware corporation. The
Company is the leading provider of 9-1-1 operations support systems services to
incumbent local exchange carriers ILECs, competitive local exchange carriers
CLECs and wireless carriers in the United States. The Company manages the
data which enables 9-1-1 calls to be routed to the appropriate public safety
agency with accurate and timely information about the caller identification
and location. In addition, the Company licenses its 9-1-1 software to carriers
that wish to manage the delivery of 9-1-1 data management services in-house.
2 SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
Operating Cycle
Assets and liabilities related to contracts are included in current assets and
liabilities in the accompanying balance sheets since they will be liquidated in
the normal course of contract completion, although this may require more than
one year.
Property and Equipment
Depreciation of property and equipment is computed using the straight-line
method over estimated useful lives of three to five years for computer hardware
and equipment, seven years for furniture and fixtures and the life of the lease
for leasehold improvements. The costs of repairs and maintenance are expensed
while enhancements to existing assets are capitalized.
Software Development Costs
The Company expenses the costs of developing computer software until
technological feasibility is established and capitalizes all costs incurred from
that time until the software is available for general customer release.
Technological feasibility for the Company computer software products is based
upon the earlier of the achievement of a a detailed program design free of
high-risk development issues or b completion of a working model. Costs of
major enhancements to existing products with a wide market are capitalized while
routine maintenance of existing products is charged to expense as incurred. The
establishment of technological feasibility and the ongoing assessment of the
recoverability of capitalized computer software development costs requires
considerable judgment by management with respect to certain external factors,
including, but not limited to, technological feasibility, anticipated future
gross revenues, estimated economic life and changes in software and hardware
technology.
Capitalized software costs are amortized on a product-by-product basis. The
annual amortization is the greater of the amount computed using a the ratio
that current gross revenues for a product bear to the total of current and
anticipated future gross revenues for that product, or b the straight-line
method over the remaining estimated economic life of the product which is
typically five years. Amortization expense related to capitalized software costs
from continuing operations totaled $145,000, $107,000 and $55,000, respectively,
for the years ended December 31, 1998, 1997 and 1996, respectively, and is
included in cost of data management services and licenses and implementation
services in the statements of operations. Revenue Recognition
The Company reports revenue based on its two segments, data management
services and licenses and implementation services. Revenue from data management
services generally consists of a non-recurring initial fee and monthly recurring
revenue. The non-recurring initial fee is recognized using the percentage-of-
completion method over the period required to convert the customer data to the
Company system and otherwise prepare for implementation. Revenue from
recurring monthly services is recognized in the period the services are
rendered. Related expenses are recognized as they are incurred and are included
in cost of data management services in the accompanying statements of
operations.
37
Because the Company software requires significant modification for each
customer, revenue related to software license fees and implementation of the
Company 9-1-1 systems at customer sites is recognized using the percentage-of-
completion method. Such contracts include a license fee for the use of the
Company software and service fees for the installation and customization of
the system. The Company costs to install its systems include direct labor,
third party license fees and miscellaneous expenses. Such costs are included in
cost of licenses and implementation services.
In applying the percentage-of-completion method, revenue and related costs are
recognized based on the percentage that labor hours incurred to date bear to
total estimated labor hours. Revenue recognized in excess of amounts billed is
reflected as unbilled project revenue and amounts billed in excess of revenue
recognized are reflected as deferred contract revenue in the accompanying
balance sheets. The Company recognizes any known or anticipated loss on
contracts in process when such losses are determined to exist.
Revenue from licenses and implementation services includes customer support
revenue which is recognized ratably over the related contract period on a
straight-line basis. Costs related to customer support revenue are included in
cost of licenses and implementation services in the accompanying statements of
operations. Concentration of Credit Risk
Financial instruments which potentially subject the Company to concentrations
of credit risk are primarily accounts receivable and investments in high-grade
treasury bonds and commercial paper. The Company accounts receivable are from
customers that are generally telecommunications service providers; accordingly,
the Company accounts receivable are concentrated in the telecommunications
industry. The Company principal customers Note 10 accounted for 30% and 40%
of the Company accounts receivable as of December 31, 1998 and 1997,
respectively. The Company has no significant financial instruments with off-
balance sheet risk of accounting loss, such as foreign exchange contracts,
option contracts or other foreign currency hedging arrangements.
Research and Development
Research and development efforts consist of salaries, supplies and other
related costs. These costs are expensed as incurred and totaled approximately
$1,376,000, $738,000 and $230,000 for the years ended December 31, 1998, 1997
and 1996, respectively. These costs are included in cost of data management
services and licenses and implementation services in the accompanying statements
of operations and do not include development costs incurred as part of the
efforts performed under licenses and implementation services contracts with the
Company customers.
Cash and Cash Equivalents
For purposes of reporting cash flows, cash and cash equivalents include highly
liquid investments with original maturities of 90 days or less.
Use of Estimates
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted
accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions.
These estimates affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities,
disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial
statements, and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the
reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.
Fair Market Value of Financial Instruments
Financial instruments include cash and cash equivalents, corporate debt
securities, accounts receivable and debt obligations. The carrying amounts for
cash and cash equivalents and accounts receivable approximate fair market value
because of the short maturity of these instruments. The fair value of notes and
capital lease obligations are estimated based on current rates available for
debt with similar maturities and securities, and at December 31, 1998 and 1997,
approximates the carrying value.

Investments in Marketable Securities
The Company investments in corporate debt securities are classified as held-
to-maturity and are carried at the amortized cost basis. The investments had
the following values at December 31, 1998                      Amortized/            Gross Unrealized  Gross Unrealized

Income Taxes
The Company follows Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 109 SFAS
109, which requires recognition of deferred income tax assets and liabilities
for the expected future income tax consequences, based on enacted tax laws, of
temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets
and liabilities. SFAS 109 also requires recognition of deferred tax assets for
the expected future tax effects of loss carryforwards and tax credit
carryforwards. Deferred tax assets are then reduced, if deemed necessary, by a
valuation allowance for the amount of any tax benefits which, on a more likely
than not basis, are not expected to be realized Note 6.
Stock Based Compensation Plans
The Company applies APB Opinion No. 25, Accounting for Stock Issued to
Employees, in accounting for its stock option and other stock-based
compensation plans for employees and directors. The Company has adopted the
disclosure provisions of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123
SFAS 123, Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation, for such options and
stock-based plans for employees and directors Note 4.
Impairment of Long-Lived Assets
The Company reviews its long-lived assets for impairment whenever events or
changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not
be recoverable from future undiscounted cash flows. Impairment losses are
recorded for the excess, if any, of the carrying value over the fair value of
the long-lived assets.
Earnings Per Share
The Company has adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 128,
Earnings Per Share, by retroactively restating income loss per share amounts
for all periods presented. Basic income loss per share is determined by
dividing net income loss available to common shareholders by the weighted
average number of common shares outstanding during each period. Diluted income
loss per share includes the effects of potentially issuable common stock, but
only if dilutive i.e., a loss per share is never reduced. The treasury stock
method, using the average price of the Company common stock for the period, is
applied to determine dilution from options and warrants. The if-converted method
is used for convertible securities. Potentially dilutive common stock options
that were excluded from the calculation of diluted income per share because
their effect is antidilutive totaled 51,000, 298,017 and 230,316 in 1998, 1997
and 1996, respectively.
A reconciliation of the numerators and denominators used in computing per
share net income from continuing operations is as follows                              Year Ended December 31,

Reverse Stock Split
On March 18, 1998, the Company Board of Directors authorized a one-for-three
reverse stock split which was effective June 23, 1998. All share amounts,
equivalent share amounts and per share amounts have been adjusted retroactively
to reflect the reverse stock split.
Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements Statement of Position 98-1
In March 1998, the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants
AICPA issued Statement of Position 98-1 SOP 98-1, Accounting for the
Costs of Computer Software Developed or Obtained for Internal Use. In general,
SOP 98-1 requires that certain costs to develop software for internal use be
capitalized. This statement is effective for fiscal years beginning after
December 15, 1998, although earlier adoption is permitted. These requirements
are to be applied prospectively from the date of adoption. The Company believes
SOP 98-1 will not materially impact its financial statements.
Statement of Position 98-5
In April 1998, the AICPA issued Statement of Position 98-5 SOP 98-5,
Reporting on the Costs of Start-Up Activities. SOP 98-5 provides guidance on
the financial reporting of start-up and organization costs and requires costs of
start-up activities and organization costs to be expensed as incurred. SOP 98-5
is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 1998 and the Company
believes SOP 98-5 will not materially impact its financial statements.
Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 133
In June 1998, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Statement of
Financial Accounting Standards No. 133, Accounting for Derivative Instruments
and Hedging Activities. The Statement establishes accounting and reporting
standards requiring that every derivative instrument including certain
derivative instruments embedded in other contracts be recorded in the balance
sheet as either an asset or liability measured at its fair value. The
statement requires that changes in the derivative fair value be recognized
currently in earnings unless specific hedge accounting criteria are met. Special
accounting for qualifying hedges allows a derivative gains and losses to
offset related results on the hedged item in the income statement, and requires
that a company must formally document, designate, and assess the effectiveness
of transactions that receive hedge accounting.
Statement No. 133 is effective for fiscal years beginning after June 15, 1999.
A company may also implement the Statement as of the beginning of any fiscal
quarter after issuance that is, fiscal quarters beginning June 16 1998 and thereafter. Statement No. 133 cannot be applied retroactively.
Statement No. 133 must be applied to a derivative instruments and b certain
derivative instruments embedded in hybrid contracts that were
40
issued, acquired, or substantively modified after December 31, 1997 and, at the
company election, before January 1, 1998.
The Company does not typically enter into arrangements that would fall under
the scope of Statement No. 133. The Company management has not yet quantified
the impacts of adopting Statement 133 on the Company financial statements and
has not determined the timing of or method of the Company adoption of
Statement No. 133. However, should the Company determine to utilize the
arrangements covered by Statement No. 133, the Statement could increase
volatility in earnings and other comprehensive income. Because the Company has
not historically entered into such arrangements, management believes that
Statement No. 133 will not significantly affect its financial reporting.
Statement of Position 98-9
In December 1998, the AICPA issued Statement of Position 98-9 SOP 98-9,
Modification of SOP 97-2, Software Revenue Recognition, With Respect to Certain
Transactions. SOP 98-9 amends certain paragraphs of Statement of Position 97-2
SOP 97-2, Software Revenue Recognition, to require the application of a
residual method of accounting for software revenue when certain conditions
exist. SOP 98-9 also amends Statement of Position 98-4 SOP 98-4, Deferral
of the Effective Date of a Provision of SOP 97-2 to extend the deferral of the
application of certain passages of SOP 97-2 provided by SOP 98-4 through fiscal
years beginning on or before March 15, 1999.  All other provisions of SOP 98-9
are effective for transactions entered into in fiscal years beginning after
March 15, 1999. Earlier adoption is permitted, however, retroactive application
is prohibited. The Company believes SOP 98-9 will not materially impact its
financial statements.
Reclassifications
Certain reclassifications have been made to prior year balances to conform to
the current year presentation.
3 DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS
On June 30, 1997, the Company sold the net assets of its Premise Products
Division. The sale resulted in a net loss of $2,032,000. The net losses of this
division are included in the statements of operations as loss from operations of
discontinued division. Revenue from the division for the six months ended June
30, 1997 and for the year ended December 31, 1996 was $5,785,000 and
$12,274,000, respectively.
4 STOCKHOLDERS' EQUITY DEFICIT
Common Stock and Preferred Stock
In March 1998, the Company Board of Directors authorized an increase in
common stock to 30,000,000 shares and authorized 15,000,000 shares of
undesignated preferred stock. In 1998 the Company also retired 36,250 shares of
treasury stock.

redemption.
Putable Common Stock Warrant
In November 1997, the Company borrowed $4,000,000 from Banc One Capital
Partners II, LLC the Lender Note 5. In connection with the loan, the
Lender received a warrant to purchase 195,148 shares of the Company common
stock for $100. In June 1998, the Lender exercised this warrant. Because of the
put feature of the warrant, the Company recorded an amount equal to the number
of shares under the warrant times the difference between the current market
value, as defined, and the market value of the shares at the time the warrant
was issued. This amount was recorded as an increase in the value of the putable
common stock warrant and charged to accumulated deficit in the accompanying
financial statements through the time that the warrant was exercised. The
amount recorded was $77,000 and $8,000 in 1998 and 1997, respectively.
Stock Subscriptions Receivable
In September 1997, in connection with the sale of the Company Premise
Products Division, several former employees of the Company signed full recourse
promissory notes to the Company to exercise their vested stock options. The
notes accrue interest at 607% per annum. The Company extended the due date on
the notes to March 20, 1999 and is pursuing collection of the notes that remain
unpaid.
42
Stock Option Plan
The Company adopted the 1998 Stock Incentive Plan 1998 Plan effective June
23, 1998, which is a successor to the Company 1990 Option Plan. A total of
2,928,872 shares have been authorized for issuance under the 1998 Plan,
including shares authorized under the 1990 Option Plan. The shares reserved for
issuance will increase automatically on the first trading day of each calendar
year, beginning with the 1999 calendar year, by 3% of the number of shares of
common stock outstanding on the last trading day of the immediately preceding
calendar year. The 1998 Plan allows for issuances of options to officers, non-
employee Board members and consultants, as provided for under the terms of the
1998 Plan.
In October 1995, the Company granted an option to purchase 66,666 shares of
common stock to an officer of the Company. The option is exercisable at $600
per share and was issuable contingent on the attainment of certain objectives.
During 1997, the Company Board of Directors determined that the officer had
met the objectives required under the agreement, causing the options to be
issued. No compensation expense was recorded on this option because the exercise
price exceeded the fair market value of the shares.
Employee Stock Purchase Plan
On March 18, 1998, the Company adopted an employee stock purchase plan
ESPP under which eligible employees may contribute up to 10% of their
salaries through payroll deductions to purchase shares of the Company common
stock. The first offering period of the ESPP began March 1, 1998 and ended on
December 31, 1998. Thereafter, offering periods will be successive six month
periods. At the end of each offering period, amounts contributed by employees
will be used to purchase shares of the Company common stock at a price equal
to 85% of the lower of the closing price of the common stock on the first day or
last day of the offering period. The Company Board of Directors has authorized
the issuance of up to 200,000 shares under the ESPP and may terminate the ESPP
at any time. At January 1 of each year, the shares available under the ESPP will
be restored to 200,000, although the Company Board of Directors may elect to
restore a lesser number of shares. In 1998, the Company issued 61,105 shares
under the ESPP.
Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123 SFAS 123
SFAS 123, Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation, defines a fair value
based method of accounting for employee stock options or similar equity
instruments. However, SFAS 123 allows the continued measurement of compensation
cost for such plans using the intrinsic value based method prescribed by APB
Opinion No. 25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees APB 25, provided
that pro forma disclosures are made of net income or loss assuming the fair
value based method of SFAS 123 had been applied. The Company has elected to
account for its stock-based compensation plans under APB 25; accordingly, for
purposes of the pro forma disclosures presented below, the Company has computed
the fair values of all options granted under the 1998 Option Plan, which
succeeds the 1997 Option Plan, during 1998, 1997 and 1996, using the Black-
Scholes pricing model and the following weighted average assumptions                            1998        1997        1996
Risk-free interest rate.       471%       641%       616%
Expected dividend yield.       000%       000%       000%

Expected       66004%       0001%       0001  To estimate lives of options for this valuation, it was assumed options will
be exercised upon becoming fully vested. All options are initially assumed to
vest. Cumulative compensation costs recognized in pro forma net income or loss
with respect to options that are forfeited prior to vesting is adjusted as a
reduction of pro forma compensation expense in the period of forfeiture. Because
the Company common stock was not yet publicly traded, the expected market
volatility was assumed to be zero in 1996 and 1997. In 1998, the Company
common stock was not yet traded for an extended period of time, thus the
expected market volatility was based on the stock prices of companies whose
operations are similar to the Company. Actual volatility of the Company
common stock may vary. Fair value computations are highly sensitive to the
volatility factor assumed; the greater the volatility, the higher the computed
fair value of options granted.
The total fair value of options granted under the 1998 Option Plan was
computed to be approximately $1,406,000, $499,000 and $187,000 for the years
ended December 31, 1998, 1997 and 1996, respectively. These amounts are
amortized ratably over the vesting periods of the options or recognized at date
of grant if no vesting period is required. Pro forma stock-based compensation,
net of the effect of forfeitures, was $417,000, $232,000 and $80,000 for 1998,
1997 and 1996, respectively.

6 INCOME TAXES
The Company has operated in three countries, the United States, Canada and
Australia. For income tax return reporting purposes, the Company has
approximately $8,500,000 of net operating loss carryforwards and approximately
$467,000 of research and development tax credit carryforwards available to
offset future federal taxable income or federal tax liabilities in the United
States. The research and development credit and net operating loss carryforwards
expire at various dates through 2011. The Company also has $208,000 of foreign
tax credit carryforwards.
The Tax Reform Act of 1986 contains provisions which may limit the net
operating loss and credit carryforwards available to be used in any given year
upon the occurrence of certain events including significant changes in ownership
of the Company. In accordance with certain provisions of the Internal Revenue
Code of 1986, as amended the Code, a greater than 50% change in ownership of
a company within a three year period results in an annual limitation on the
Company ability to utilize its net operating loss carryforwards from tax
periods prior to the ownership change.
Deferred income tax assets and liabilities at December 31, 1998 and 1997, were

As of December 31, 1998 and 1997, the Company reversed $1,689,000 and
$2,413,000, respectively, of the valuation allowance on part of its deferred tax
assets, as the Company believes it is more likely than not that such tax
benefits will be realized. Approximately $533,000 of the income tax benefit in
1998 was allocated to the extraordinary loss on early extinguishment of debt.
Management believes the remaining tax assets of $450,000 as of December 31,
1998 relate to tax credits that do not satisfy the realization criteria set
forth in SFAS No. 109 and has recorded a valuation allowance for such net tax
assets.
The components of the provision benefit for income taxes attributable to
income from operations as of December 31, 1998, 1997 and 1996, were as follows                    45

8 EMPLOYEE BENEFIT PLAN
The Company has a 401k plan under which eligible employees may defer up to
15% of their compensation. The Company may make matching contributions and
discretionary contributions if approved by the Board of Directors. For 1998,
1997 and 1996, no employer matching or discretionary contributions were made to
the 401k plan. However, in February 1999, the Company Board of Directors
approved a matching contribution for employees, which is effective April 1,
1999. The Company will match 50% of employee contributions up to 6% of the
employee salary, not to exceed $1,000 in 1999. Matching contributions will
vest 35%, 70% and 100% for one, two and three years of service, respectively.
9 RELATED PARTY TRANSACTION
The Company provides data management and certain consulting services to and
leases equipment from entities in which a stockholder of the Company has an
ownership interest. A representative of the stockholder is a member of 
46
the Company Board of Directors. The Company received net proceeds of
approximately $6,735,000, $6,959,000 and $6,606,000 in 1998, 1997 and 1996,
respectively, pursuant to these agreements. Amounts due to the stockholder under
the lease agreements net of amounts due to the Company for services rendered as
of December 31, 1998 and 1997 were $3,962,000 and $5,148,000, respectively. The
leases have interest rates ranging from 850% to 950%, require monthly payments
and have expiration dates varying through October 2002.
10 REPORTABLE SEGMENTS AND MAJOR CUSTOMERS
Reportable Segments
The Company has two reportable segments, data management services and licenses
and implementation services. The Company measures its reportable segments based
on revenue for each segment and costs directly related to each segment. General
and administrative, sales and marketing and other costs are not measured by
segment. Data management services include the provisioning of an outsourcing
solution for 9-1-1 data management to customers, including ILECs, CLECs and
wireless carriers. Licenses and implementation services include the licensing,
customization and installation of the Company 9-1-1 software solutions.
Substantially all of the Company customers are in the United States.
These segments are managed separately because the nature of and resources used
for each segment is unique. Data management services include ongoing data
management and monitoring of systems and other enhanced services. Under data
management services, the customer data is transferred to the Company systems
and the Company owns the systems used to manage the data. Under licenses and
implementation services, the customer performs data management and systems
monitoring activities. The customer also owns the hardware, licenses the
Company software and maintains the data on its internal systems under this
segment.
Revenue and costs are segregated in the Statement of Operations for the two
reportable segments. The Company does not segregate assets between the segments
as it is impractical to do so. Major Customers
Revenue from certain customers exceeded 10% of total revenue for the
respective year as follows: 27%, 25% and 21% in 1998; 30%, 29% and 22% in 1997
and 47% and 35% in 1996. Contracts with certain of these customers have a ten-
year duration and provide for fixed monthly fees based upon the number of
subscriber records managed and upon the services selected by the customer. All
of these customers are in the Company data management services segment.
11 LEGAL MATTERS
The Company is subject to various claims and business disputes in the ordinary
course of business. While the outcome of these matters cannot be predicted with
certainty, management anticipates that the ultimate outcome of the issues will
not have a material impact on the financial statements.
