INDEPENDENT AUDITORS REPORT The Board of Directors and Shareholders of
Columbia Sportswear Company: We have audited the
accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Columbia Sportswear Company and subsidiaries as of December 31, 2002 and 2001, and the related consolidated statements of operations, shareholders equity and cash flows for each of the three years in
the period ended December 31, 2002. These financial statements are the responsibility of the Companys management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audits. We conducted our audits in accordance with auditing standards
generally accepted in the United States of America. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a
test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial
statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. In our opinion, such consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Columbia Sportswear Company and subsidiaries as of December 31, 2002 and 2001,
and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2002, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. DELOITTE TOUCHE LLP Portland, Oregon January 30, 2003 March 14, 2003 as to Note 17

NOTE 1BASIS OF
PRESENTATION AND ORGANIZATION Nature of the business:
Columbia Sportswear Company is a global
leader in the design, manufacture, marketing and distribution of active outdoor apparel, including outerwear, sportswear, footwear, and related accessories. NOTE 2SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES Basis of presentation: The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Columbia Sportswear Company and its wholly-owned subsidiaries the
Company. All significant intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America
requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and
expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from these estimates and assumptions. Certain reclassifications of amounts reported in the prior period financial statements have been made to conform to classifications used
in the current period financial statements. Dependence on
key suppliers: The Companys
products are produced by independent manufacturers worldwide. For 2002 the Company sourced approximately 99% by dollar volume of its products outside the United States, principally in the Far East. The Companys three largest factory groups
accounted for approximately 17% of the Companys total global production for 2002 and another company produced substantially all of the zippers used in the Companys products. From time to time, the Company has experienced difficulty
satisfying its raw material and finished goods requirements. Although the Company believes that it could identify and qualify additional factories to produce these materials, the unavailability of some existing manufacturers for supply of these
materials could have a material adverse affect on the Company. Cash and cash equivalents: Cash and cash equivalents are stated at cost and represent investments with original maturities of three months or less. At December 31, 2002 and 2001, cash and cash equivalents included $194,670,000 and $79,082,000 of investments,
respectively, primarily comprised of investment grade asset-backed debt obligations, municipal tax-exempt securities, preferred auction rate securities and money market funds. Accounts receivable: Accounts receivable have been reduced by an allowance for doubtful accounts, which was $9,341,000 and $8,016,000 at December 31, 2002 and
2001, respectively. The provision for bad debt expense was $3,704,000, $3,531,000 and $4,854,000 in 2002, 2001, and 2000, respectively. The charges to the reserve were $2,379,000, $1,341,000 and $3,563,000 in 2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively.
32 Table of Contents COLUMBIA SPORTSWEAR COMPANY NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTSContinued
Inventories:
Inventories are carried at the lower of
cost or market. Cost is determined using the first-in, first-out method. The Company periodically reviews its inventories for excess, close-out or slow moving items and makes provisions as necessary to properly reflect inventory value. Property, plant, and equipment: Property, plant, and equipment are stated at cost.
Depreciation of machinery and equipment, furniture and fixtures and amortization of leasehold improvements is provided using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets, ranging from 3 to 10 years. Buildings are
depreciated using the straight-line method over 30 years. The interest-carrying costs of capital assets under construction are capitalized based on the Companys weighted average borrowing rates. Capitalized interest was $1,000,000, $792,000 and $145,000 in 2002, 2001 and 2000,
respectively. Intangibles and other assets:

September 2000, the Company acquired the Sorel trademark rights, associated brand names and other related intellectual property rights for $7,967,000 in cash. The acquired intangible assets ceased being amortized on January 1, 2002 with the adoption
of SFAS No. 142. The related accumulated amortization was $996,000 at December 31, 2002 and 2001. Impairment of long-lived and intangible assets: The Company evaluates the carrying value of long-lived assets for possible impairment as events or changes arise indicating that such
assets should be reviewed. If an asset is determined to be impaired, the loss is measured as the amount by which the carrying value of the asset exceeds its fair value. Fair value is based on the best information available, including quoted market
prices, prices for similar assets or the results of valuation techniques. The Company has determined that its long-lived assets as of December 31, 2002 and 2001 are not impaired. Deferred income taxes: United States income taxes are provided currently on financial statement earnings of non-U.S. subsidiaries
expected to be repatriated. The Company determines annually the amount of undistributed non-U.S. earnings to invest indefinitely in its non-U.S. operations. Deferred income taxes are provided for temporary differences between the amount of assets
and liabilities for financial and tax reporting purposes. Deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance when it is estimated to be more likely than not that some portion of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. 
33 Table of Contents COLUMBIA SPORTSWEAR COMPANY NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTSContinued
Revenue Recognition:
The Company records wholesale and
licensed product revenues when title passes and the risks and rewards of ownership have passed to the customer, based on the terms of sale. Title generally passes upon shipment or upon receipt by the customer depending on the country of the sale and
the agreement with the customer. Retail store revenues are recorded at the time of sale. In certain countries outside of the U.S., precise information regarding the date of receipt by the customer is not readily available. In these cases, the Company estimates the date of receipt by the
customer based upon historical and expected delivery times by geographic location. Upon shipment, the Company also provides for estimated sales returns and miscellaneous claims from customers as reductions to revenues. The estimates are based on historical rates of product returns
and claims. However, actual returns and claims in any future period are inherently uncertain and thus may differ from the estimates. If actual or expected future returns and claim were significantly greater or lower than the reserves that had been
established, the Company would record a reduction or increase to net revenues in the period in which it made such determination. Foreign currency translation: The assets and liabilities of the Companys foreign subsidiaries have been translated into U.S. dollars using the exchange rates in
effect at period end, and the net sales and expenses have been translated into U.S. dollars using average exchange rates in effect during the period. The foreign currency translation adjustments are included as a separate component of accumulated
other comprehensive loss in shareholders equity and are not currently adjusted for income taxes as they relate to indefinite net investments in non-U.S. operations. Fair value of financial instruments: Based on borrowing rates currently available to the Company for bank loans with similar terms and maturities,
the fair value of the Companys long-term debt approximates the carrying value. Furthermore, the carrying value of all other financial instruments potentially subject to valuation risk principally consisting of cash and cash equivalents,
accounts receivable and accounts payable also approximate fair value because of their short-term maturities. Derivatives: The Company accounts for derivatives in accordance with SFAS No. 133, Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging
Activities, as amended by SFAS No. 137, Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities Deferral of the Effective Date of SFAS No. 133 and SFAS No. 138, Accounting for Certain Derivative Instruments and
Certain Hedging Activities an Amendment of SFAS No. 133. Substantially all foreign currency derivatives entered into by the Company qualify for and are designated as foreign-currency cash flow hedges, including those hedging foreign currency denominated firm commitments.
Changes in fair values of outstanding cash flow
hedge derivatives that are highly effective are recorded in other comprehensive income, until earnings are affected by the variability of cash flows of the hedged transaction. In most cases amounts recorded in other comprehensive income will be
released to earnings some time after maturity of the related derivative. The consolidated statement of operation classification of effective hedge results is the same as that of the underlying exposure. Results of hedges of product costs are
recorded in 
34 Table of Contents COLUMBIA SPORTSWEAR COMPANY NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTSContinued cost of sales when the underlying hedged transaction affects earnings. Unrealized derivative gains and losses recorded in current and
non-current assets and liabilities and amounts recorded in other comprehensive income are non-cash items and therefore are taken into account in the preparation of the consolidated statement of cash flows based on their respective balance sheet
classifications. Stock-based compensation:
The Company has elected to follow the
accounting provisions of Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 25 APB 25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees, for stock-based compensation and to furnish the pro forma disclosures required under SFAS No. 148,
Accounting for Stock-Based CompensationTransition and Disclosure. No stock-based employee compensation cost is reflected in net income, as all options granted under those plans had an exercise price equal to the market value of the
underlying common stock on the date of the grant. The following table illustrates the effect on net income and earnings per share if the Company had applied the fair value recognition provisions of SFAS No. 123 to stock-based compensation in thousands, except per share amounts 2002

The
effects of applying SFAS No. 123 in this pro forma disclosure are not necessarily indicative of future amounts. Advertising costs: Advertising costs are expensed as incurred. Through cooperative advertising programs, the Company reimburses its retail customers for some of their costs of advertising the Companys products. The
Company records these costs in selling, general and administrative expense at the time when it is obligated to its customers for the costs. This obligation may arise prior to the related advertisement being run. Advertising expense was $36,273,000 35,011,000 and $27,343,000 for the years ended December 31, 2002, 2001, and 2000, respectively. Product warranty: The Companys outerwear and Sorel products carry lifetime limited warranty provisions for defects in quality and workmanship. A reserve is established at the time of sale to cover estimated
warranty costs based on

Recent Accounting
Pronouncements In June 2001, the
Financial Accounting Standards Board FASB issued SFAS No. 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets. This statement eliminates amortization of goodwill and certain intangible assets with indefinite useful lives and sets
forth methods to periodically evaluate these assets for impairment. The Company adopted SFAS No. 142 on January 1, 2002 and therefore ceased amortization of certain intangible assets. Other than the cessation of amortization, the adoption of this
statement had no impact on the Companys results of operations or cash flows for the year ended December 31, 2002. Amortization expense for intangible assets with indefinite useful lives was $796,000 for 2001 and $199,000 for 2000. During the
fourth quarter of 2002, the Company completed an impairment test on the intangible assets and determined that these assets were not impaired. In July 2002, the FASB issued SFAS No. 146, Accounting for Costs Associated with Exit or Disposal Activities. This statement
requires that a liability for a cost associated with an exit or disposal activity be recognized when the liability is incurred. Under previous guidance, a liability for an exit cost was recognized at the date of the commitment to an exit plan. The
provisions of this statement will be applied prospectively, as applicable, and are effective for exit or disposal activities that are initiated after December 31, 2002. In December 2002, the FASB issued SFAS No. 148, Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation
Transition and Disclosure, an amendment of SFAS No. 123, Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation. This statement provides alternative methods of transition for voluntary change to the fair value based method of accounting for
stock-based employee compensation. In addition, this statement amends the disclosure requirements of SFAS No. 123 to require prominent disclosures in both annual and interim financial statements about the method of accounting for stock-based
employee compensation and the effect of the method used on reported results. The Company has chosen to continue to account for stock-based compensation using the intrinsic value method prescribed in APB 25 and related interpretations. The provisions
of SFAS No. 148 are effective for fiscal years ended after December 15, 2002. Thus, the Company has adopted the disclosure provisions of SFAS No. 148 in the financial reports for the year ended December 31, 2002. As the adoption of this statement
involves disclosures only, the Company does not expect a material impact on its financial position or results of operations. In November 2002, the FASB issued FASB Interpretation No. 45, Guarantors Accounting and Disclosure Requirements for
Guarantees, Including Indirect Guarantees of Indebtedness of Others FIN 45. This interpretation elaborates on the disclosures to be made by a guarantor in its interim and annual financial statements about its obligations under
specified guarantees that it has issued. It also clarifies that a guarantor is required to recognize, at the inception of a guarantee, a liability for the fair value of the obligation undertaken in issuing the guarantee. The disclosure requirements
in this interpretation are effective for financial statements of interim or annual periods ending after December 15, 2002. The Company has adopted the disclosure provisions of FIN 45 see Note 2 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial
Statements. Additionally, the recognition of a 
36 Table of Contents COLUMBIA SPORTSWEAR COMPANY NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTSContinued guarantors obligation should be applied on a prospective basis to guarantees issued after December 31, 2002. The Company does not
believe that the provisions of FIN 45 will have a material effect on its financial position or results of operations. In January 2003, the FASB issued FASB Interpretation No. 46, Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities FIN 46.
This interpretation explains how to identify variable interest entities and how an enterprise assesses its interest in a variable interest entity to decide whether to consolidate that entity. This interpretation requires existing unconsolidated
variable interest entities to be consolidated by their primary beneficiaries if the entities do not effectively disperse risks among parties involved. Variable interest entities that effectively disperse risks will not be consolidated unless a
single party holds an interest or combination of interest that effectively recombines risks that were previously dispersed. This interpretation applies immediately to variable interest entities created after January 31, 2003, and to variable
interest entities in which an enterprise obtains an interest after that date. It applies in the first fiscal year or interim period beginning after June 15, 2003, to variable interest entities in which an enterprise holds a variable interest that it
acquired before February 1, 2003. The Company does not believe that the provisions of FIN 46 will have a material effect on its financial position or results of operations. NOTE 3INVENTORIES, NET Inventories consist of the following in thousands:  December 31 2002

payments, it is prohibited, subject to certain exceptions, from making dividend payments or other distributions. The Company has arrangements in place to facilitate the import and purchase of inventory through the issuance of sight letters of credit.
The arrangements consist of an unsecured and uncommitted revolving line of credit of $25,000,000 and a $125,000,000 import line of credit at December 31, 2002, to issue documentary letters of credit on a sight basis and are renewed on an annual
basis. The combined limit under this agreement was $150,000,000 at December 31, 2002. The revolving line accrues interest at the banks prime rate minus 2% per annum. The revolving line also has a fixed rate option based on the banks cost
of funds plus 45 basis points. There was no balance outstanding on this line as of December 31, 2002 and 2001. At December 31, 2002, the Company had $76,562,000 of firm purchase orders placed under this facility. The Company also has available an unsecured and uncommitted

2002, the shareholders of the Company approved an increase in the number of authorized shares of common stock from 50,000,000 shares to 125,000,000 shares. At December 31, 2002 and 2001, 39,737,065 and 39,282,921 shares of common stock were issued
and outstanding, respectively. 
39 Table of Contents COLUMBIA SPORTSWEAR COMPANY NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTSContinued
On June 9,
1999, the shareholders of the Company approved the 1999 Employee Stock Purchase Plan ESPP. There are 750,000 shares of common stock authorized for issuance under the ESPP, which allows qualified employees of the Company to purchase
shares on a quarterly basis up to fifteen percent of their respective compensation. The purchase price of the shares is equal to eighty five percent of the lesser of the closing price of the Companys common stock on the first or last trading
day of the respective quarter. As of December 31, 2002 and 2001, 164,164 and 120,685 shares of common stock, respectively, had been issued under the ESPP. Share amounts above have been restated to reflect the three-for-two stock split that was distributed on June 4, 2001, to all shareholders
of record at the close of business on May 17, 2001. NOTE
9INCOME TAXES The Company applies an
asset and liability method for income taxes that requires the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in the Companys financial statements or tax returns.
In estimating future tax consequences, the Company generally considers all expected future events other than enactment of changes in the tax laws or rates. Deferred taxes are provided for temporary differences between assets and liabilities for
financial reporting purposes and for income tax purposes. Valuation allowances are recorded against net deferred tax assets when it is more likely than not the asset will not be realized. Undistributed earnings of the Companys Canadian subsidiary amounted to approximately $15,700,000 as of
December 31, 2002. If those earnings were distributed in the form of dividends or otherwise, a portion would be subject to both U.S. income taxes and foreign withholding taxes. It is anticipated that the U.S. income taxes and foreign withholding
taxes would be substantially offset by the corresponding foreign tax credits resulting from such a distribution. In November 2002, the Internal Revenue Service IRS commenced an examination of the Companys 2000 federal income tax
return. The Company believes that adequate accruals have been provided for this and all other open tax years. The Company receives a U.S. income tax benefit upon the exercise of the majority of its employee stock options. The benefit is equal to
the difference between the fair market value of the stock at the time of exercise and the option price, times the appropriate tax rate. The Company has recorded the benefit associated with the exercise of employee stock options directly to
shareholders equity. The components of the
provision benefit for income taxes consist of the following in thousands:  Year ended December 31 2002 2001 2000 Current Federal

NOTE 10PROFIT
SHARING PLAN The Company has a 401k
profit-sharing plan, which covers substantially all employees with more than ninety days of service. The Company may elect to make discretionary matching and/or non-matching contributions. All contributions to the plan are determined by the Board of
Directors and totaled $2,930,000, $2,582,000 and $2,106,000 for the years ended December 31, 2002, 2001, and 2000, respectively. NOTE 11PARTICIPATION SHARE AGREEMENT Effective December 1990, the Company adopted a Participation Share Agreement the Participation Plan with a key employee. The
Participation Plan provided for the grant of participation shares equivalent to 10% of the Company, which were to be awarded at various dates through January 2000. These shares vest at a rate of 20% per year following the award date. Effective December 31, 1996, the original Participation Plan
was terminated and a Deferred Compensation Conversion Agreement the Agreement was entered into. Under the Agreement, the participation shares, whether or not vested or awarded under the Participation Plan, were converted to 2,700,653
shares of common stock. The total value of the share conversion was $15,693,000, of which $6,320,000 was unvested as of December 31, 1996. The unvested portion was recorded as a reduction in shareholders equity and has been 
41 Table of Contents COLUMBIA SPORTSWEAR COMPANY NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTSContinued amortized to compensation expense as shares are earned during the vesting period. Compensation expense related to the Participation Plan and
the 1996 conversion totaled $682,000 for each of the years ended December 31, 2002, 2001, and 2000. As of December 31, 2002, 234,833 shares of common stock awarded were subject to future vesting and included in issued and outstanding shares of
common stock. As provided in the Agreement and
because the executives employment terminated January 3, 2003, the 234,833 unvested shares will vest automatically unless the executive is compensated by the Company within 180 days from the termination date. The amount of such compensation
would be $498,000, and would be accounted for as a reduction to shareholders equity upon cancellation of the unvested shares. NOTE 12COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES The Company leases certain operating facilities from related parties of the Company. Total rent expense, including month-to-month rentals,
for these leases amounted to $370,000, $381,000 and $408,000 for the years ended December 31, 2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively. Rent expense was $2,587,000, $2,568,000 and $2,464,000 for non-related party leases during the years ended December 31, 2002, 2001 and

Company is a party to various legal claims, actions and complaints. Although the ultimate resolution of legal proceedings cannot be predicted with certainty, management believes that disposition of these matters will not have a material adverse
effect on the Companys consolidated financial statements. NOTE 13STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION The Companys 1997 Stock Incentive Plan the Plan provides for issuance of up to 5,400,000 shares of the Companys Common Stock of which 1,024,153 shares were available for future stock option grants under the
Plan at December 31, 2002. Options granted prior to 2001 generally become exercisable ratably over a five-year period beginning from the date of grant and expire ten years from the date of grant. Options granted after 2000 generally become
exercisable over a period of four years beginning one year after the date of grant and expire ten years from the date of the grant.

Company continues to measure compensation cost for the Plan using the method of accounting prescribed by APB 25. In electing to continue to follow APB 25 for expense recognition purposes, the Company is required to provide the expanded disclosures
required under SFAS No. 148 for stock-based compensation granted, including disclosure of pro forma net income and earnings per share, as if the fair value based method of accounting defined in the SFAS No. 123 Accounting for Stock-Based
Compensation, had been adopted. The
Company has computed, for pro forma disclosure purposes, the value of all stock options granted during 2002, 2001 and 2000 using the Black-Scholes option pricing model as prescribed by SFAS No. 123 using the following weighted average assumptions 2002

1714 NOTE 14EARNINGS
PER SHARE SFAS No. 128, Earnings per
Share requires dual presentation of basic and diluted earnings per share EPS. Basic EPS is based on the weighted average number of common shares outstanding. Diluted EPS reflects the potential dilution that could occur if
securities or other contracts to issue common stock were exercised or converted into common stock. There were no adjustments to net income in computing diluted earnings per share for the years ended December 31, 2002, 2001 and 2000. A

NOTE 16FINANCIAL
RISK MANAGEMENT AND DERIVATIVES The
Companys foreign currency risk management objective is to protect cash flows resulting from sales, purchases and other costs from the impact of exchange rate movements. The Company manages a portion of these exposures with short-term
strategies after giving consideration to market conditions, contractual agreements, anticipated sale and purchase transactions, and other factors. Firmly committed and anticipated transactions and the related receivables and payables may be hedged
with forward exchange contracts or purchased options. Premiums paid on purchased options are included in prepaid expenses and are recognized in earnings ratably over the life of the option. Gains and losses arising from foreign currency forward and
purchased option contracts, and cross-currency swap transactions are recognized in cost of goods sold or selling, general and administrative expenses as offsets of gains and losses resulting from the underlying hedged transactions. Hedge
effectiveness is determined by evaluating whether gains and losses on hedges will offset gains and losses on the underlying exposures. This evaluation is performed at inception of the hedge and periodically over the life of the hedge. At December 31, 2002 and 2001, the Company had approximately
$71,978,000 and $53,974,000, respectively, notional in forward exchange contracts. The net unrealized derivative gain loss included in the Companys liabilities and deferred in other comprehensive income was $2,544,000 and $844,000 at
December 31, 2002 and 2001, respectively. The
counterparties to derivative transactions are major financial institutions with high investment grade credit ratings. However, this does not eliminate the Companys exposure to credit risk with these institutions. This credit risk is generally
limited to the unrealized gains in such contracts should any of these counterparties fail to perform as contracted and is immaterial to any one institution at December 31, 2002 and 2001. To manage this risk, the Company has established strict
counterparty credit guidelines, which are continually monitored and reported to Senior Management according to prescribed guidelines. As a result, the Company considers the risk of counterparty default to be minimal. NOTE 17SUBSEQUENT EVENT On March 13, 2003, the Company entered into a merger
agreement to acquire Mountain Hardwear, Inc. Mountain Hardwear for aggregate consideration of approximately $36 million, including approximately $30 million in cash and $6 million of debt assumption. The merger is subject to approval
by the shareholders of Mountain Hardwear and other customary closing conditions and is expected to close on March 31, 2003. Mountain Hardwear, which is based in Richmond, California, designs, develops and markets technically advanced equipment and
