With the participation of the Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer, our management conducted an assessment of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting based on the framework and criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework 1992, issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. The scope of managements assessment of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting included all of our consolidated operations except for the operations of Celesio AG, which we acquired on February 6, 2014. This exclusion is in accordance with the SECs general guidance that an assessment of a recently acquired business may be omitted from our scope in the year of acquisition. Celesio AG constituted 27%of the total assets and 4%of total revenues of the consolidated financial statements of the Company as of and for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2014. Based on this assessment, our management has concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of March31, 2014. Deloitte Touche LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, audited the financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K and has also audited the effectiveness of the Companys internal control over financial reporting as of March31, 2014. This audit report appears on page 56 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. May13, 2014/s/ John H. HammergrenJohn H. HammergrenChairman of the Board, President and Chief Executive OfficerPrincipal Executive Officer/s/ James A. BeerJames A. BeerExecutive Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerPrincipal Financial Officer54Table of ContentsMcKESSON CORPORATIONREPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRMTo the Board of Directors and Stockholders of McKesson Corporation:We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of McKesson Corporation and subsidiaries the Company as of March 31, 2014and 2013, and the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive income, stockholders equity, and cash flows for each of the three fiscal years in the period ended March 31, 2014. Our audits also included the consolidated financial statement schedule financial statement schedule listed in the Index at . We also have audited the Companys internal control over financial reporting as of March 31, 2014, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework 1992 issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. As described in Managements Annual Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting, management excluded from its assessment the internal control over financial reporting at Celesio AG, which was acquired on February 6, 2014. Celesio AG constituted 27% of the total assets and 4% of total revenues of the consolidated financial statements of the Company as of and for the year ended March 31, 2014. Accordingly, our audit did not include the internal control over financial reporting at Celesio AG. The Companys management is responsible for these financial statements and financial statement schedule, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Managements Annual Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements and financial statement schedule, and an opinion on the Companys internal control over financial reporting based on our audits. We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board United States. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audits of the financial statements included examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, and evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions. A companys internal control over financial reporting is a process designed by, or under the supervision of, the companys principal executive and principal financial officers, or persons performing similar functions, and effected by the companys board of directors, management, and other personnel to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A companys internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that 1 pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; 2 provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and 3 provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the companys assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. Because of the inherent limitations of internal control over financial reporting, including the possibility of collusion or improper management override of controls, material misstatements due to error or fraud may not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. Also, projections of any evaluation of the effectiveness of the internal control over financial reporting to future periods are subject to the risk that the controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. 55Table of ContentsMcKESSON CORPORATIONIn our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of McKesson Corporation and subsidiaries as of March31, 2014and 2013, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three fiscal years in the period ended March31, 2014, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Also, in our opinion, such financial statement schedule, when considered in relation to the basic consolidated financial statements taken as a whole, presents fairly, in all material respects, the information set forth therein. Also, in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of March31, 2014, based on the criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework 1992 issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. /s/ Deloitte Touche LLPSan Francisco, CaliforniaMay 13, 201456Table of ContentsMcKESSON

or we and other similar pronouns delivers pharmaceuticals, medical supplies and healthcare information technology that make healthcare safer while reducing costs. We conduct our business through two operating segments, McKesson Distribution Solutions and McKesson Technology Solutions, as further described in Financial Note 25, Segments of Business.Basis of Presentation: The consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes are prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles GAAP. The consolidated financial statements of McKesson include the financial statements of all wholly-owned subsidiaries and majority-owned or controlled companies. We also evaluate our ownership, contractual and other interests in entities to determine if they are variable interest entities VIEs, if we have a variable interest in those entities and the nature and extent of those interests. These evaluations are highly complex and involve judgment and the use of estimates and assumptions based on available historical information and managements judgment, among other factors. Based on our evaluations, if we determine we are the primary beneficiary of such VIEs we consolidate such entities into our financial statements. Refer to Financial Note 15, Variable Interest Entities for more information on these VIEs. Investments in business entities in which we do not have control, but have the ability to exercise significant influence over operating and financial policies, are accounted for using the equity method and our proportionate share of income or loss is recorded in other income, net. Equity investments in non-publicly traded entities are primarily accounted for using the cost method. Intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated. Fiscal Period: The Companys fiscal year begins on April 1 and ends on March 31. Unless otherwise noted, all references to a particular year shall mean the Companys fiscal year.Reclassifications: Certain prior year amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current year presentation.Use of Estimates: The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires that we make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. Actual amounts could differ from those estimated amounts.Cash and Cash Equivalents: All highly liquid debt instruments purchased with original maturity of three months or less at the date of acquisition are included in cash and cash equivalents.Cash equivalents, which are available-for-sale, are carried at fair value. Cash equivalents are primarily invested in AAA rated prime and U.S. government money market funds denominated in U.S. dollars, AAA rated prime money market funds denominated in Euros, overnight repurchase agreements collateralized by U.S. Treasury bonds, Canadian government securities and/or securities that are guaranteed or sponsored by the U.S. government and an AAA rated prime money market fund denominated in British pound sterling.The remaining cash and cash equivalents are deposited with several financial institutions. Deposits at U.S. banks exceed the amount insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation. We mitigate the risk of our short-term investment portfolio by depositing funds with reputable financial institutions and monitoring risk profiles and investment strategies of money market funds. Within the Celesio operations, the majority of deposits are placed in Germany with only banks that are part of deposit protection programs.Restricted Cash: Cash that is subject to legal restrictions or is unavailable for general operating purposes is classified as restricted cash and is included within prepaid expenses and other in the consolidated balance sheets. At March31, 2014and 2013restricted cash was not material.Marketable Securities Available-for-Sale: We carry our marketable securities, which are available-for-sale, at fair value and they are included in prepaid expenses and other in the consolidated balance sheets. The unrealized gains and losses, net of the related tax effect, computed in marking these securities to market have been reported within stockholders equity. At March31, 2014and 2013marketable securities were not material62Table of ContentsMcKESSON CORPORATIONFINANCIAL NOTES ContinuedIn determining whether an other-than-temporary decline in market value has occurred, we consider the duration that, and extent to which, the fair value of the investment is below its cost, the financial condition and future prospects of the issuer or underlying collateral of a security, and our intent and ability to retain the security in order to allow for an anticipated recovery in fair value. Other-than-temporary declines in fair value from amortized cost for available-for-sale equity securities that we intend to sell or would more likely than not be required to sell before the expected recovery of the amortized cost basis are charged to other income expense in the period in which the loss occurs. Concentrations of Credit Risk and Receivables: Our trade receivables are subject to a concentration of credit risk with customers primarily in our Distribution Solutions segment. During 2014, sales to our ten largest customers accounted for approximately 48%of our total consolidated revenues. Sales to our largest customer, CVS Caremark Corporation CVS, accounted for approximately 16%of our total consolidated revenues. At March31, 2014, trade accounts receivable from our ten largest customers were approximately 32%of total trade accounts receivable. Accounts receivable from CVSwere approximately 12%of total trade accounts receivable. As a result, our sales and credit concentration is significant. We also have agreements with group purchasing organizations GPOs, each of which functions as a purchasing agent on behalf of member hospitals, pharmacies and other healthcare providers. The accounts receivables balances are with individual members of the GPOs. A default in payment, a material reduction in purchases from these or any other large customers, or the loss of a large customer or customer groups could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition, results of operations and liquidity. In addition, trade receivables are subject to a concentration of credit risk with customers in the institutional, retail and healthcare provider sectors, which can be affected by a downturn in the economy and changes in reimbursement policies. This credit risk is mitigated by the size and diversity of the customer base as well as its geographic dispersion. We estimate the receivables for which we do not expect full collection based on historical collection rates and ongoing evaluations of the creditworthiness of our customers. An allowance is recorded in our consolidated financial statements for these amounts.Financing Receivables: We assess and monitor credit risk associated with financing receivables, namely lease and notes receivables, through regular review of our collection experience in determining our allowance for loan losses. On an ongoing basis, we also evaluate credit quality of our financing receivables utilizing aging of receivables and write-offs, as well as considering existing economic conditions, to determine if an allowance is necessary. Financing receivables are derecognized if legal title to them has been transferred and all related risks and rewards incidental to ownership have passed to the buyer. As of March31, 2014and 2013, financing receivables and the related allowance were not material to our consolidated financial statements.Inventories: We report inventories at the lower of cost or market LCM. Inventories for our Distribution Solutions segment consist of merchandise held for resale. For our Distribution Solutions segment, the majority of the cost of domestic inventories is determined using the last-in, first-out LIFO method. The majority of the cost of inventories held in foreign locations is based on weighted average purchase prices using the first-in, first-out method. Technology Solutions segment inventories consist of computer hardware with cost generally determined by the standard cost method, which approximates average cost. Rebates, cash discounts, and other incentives received from vendors are accounted for as a reduction in the cost of inventory and are recognized when the inventory is sold. The LIFO method was used to value approximately 67%and 80%of our inventories at March31, 2014and 2013. If we had used the FIFO method of inventory valuation, which approximates current replacement costs, inventories would have been approximately $431million and $120million higher than the amounts reported at March31,2014and 2013, respectively. These amounts are equivalent to our LIFO reserves. Our LIFO valuation amount includes both pharmaceutical and non-pharmaceutical products. In 2014, 2013and 2012, we recognized net LIFO expense of $311million, $13million and $11million within our consolidated statements of operations. A LIFO expense is recognized when the net effect of price increases on branded pharmaceuticals and non-pharmaceutical products held in inventory exceeds the impact of price declines and shifts towards generic pharmaceuticals, including the effect of branded pharmaceutical products that have lost market exclusivity. A LIFO credit is recognized when the net effect of price declines and shifts towards generic pharmaceuticals exceeds the impact of price increases on branded pharmaceuticals and non-pharmaceutical products held in inventory.We believe that the average inventory costing method provides a reasonable estimation of the current cost of replacing inventory i.e., market. As such, our LIFO inventory is valued at the lower of LIFO or market. Primarily due to historical net deflation in our pharmaceutical inventories, pharmaceutical inventories at LIFO were $60million higher than market as of March31, 2013. As a result, we recorded a LCM credit of $60million and $16million in 2014and 2013within our consolidated statements of operations to adjust our LIFO inventories to market. 63Table of ContentsMcKESSON CORPORATIONFINANCIAL NOTES ContinuedShipping and Handling Costs: We include costs to warehouse, pick, pack and deliver inventory to our customers in selling, distribution and administrative expenses.Property, Plant and Equipment: We state our property, plant and equipment at cost and depreciate them under the straight-line method at rates designed to distribute the cost of properties over estimated service lives ranging from oneto thirtyyears.Goodwill: Goodwill is tested for impairment on an annual basis in the fourth quarter or more frequently if indicators for potential impairment exist. Impairment testing is conducted at the reporting unit level, which is generally defined as a             component one level below our Distribution Solutions and Technology Solutions operating segments, for which discrete financial information is available and segment management regularly reviews the operating results of that unit. Components that have essentially similar operations, products, services, customers and operating margins are aggregated as a single reporting unit. The first step in goodwill testing requires us to compare the estimated fair value of a reporting unit to its carrying value. This step may be performed utilizing either a qualitative or quantitative assessment. If the carrying value of the reporting unit is lower than its estimated fair value, no further evaluation is necessary. If the carrying value of the reporting unit is higher than its estimated fair value, the second step must be performed to measure the amount of impairment loss. Under the second step, the implied fair value of goodwill is calculated in a hypothetical analysis by subtracting the fair value of all assets and liabilities of the reporting unit, including any unrecognized intangible assets, from the fair value of the reporting unit calculated in the first step of the impairment test. If the carrying value of goodwill for the reporting unit exceeds the implied fair value of goodwill, an impairment charge is recorded for that excess.  To estimate the fair value of our reporting units, we use a combination of the market approach and the income approach. Under the market approach, we estimate fair value by comparing the business to similar businesses or guideline companies whose securities are actively traded in public markets. Under the income approach, we use a discounted cash flow model in which cash flows anticipated over several periods, plus a terminal value at the end of that time horizon, are discounted to their present value using an appropriate expected rate of return. The discount rate used for cash flows reflects capital market conditions and the specific risks associated with the business. In addition, we compare the aggregate of the reporting units fair value to the Companys market capitalization as a further corroboration of the fair values. The testing requires a complex series of assumptions and judgment by management in projecting future operating results, selecting guideline companies for comparisons and assessing risks. The use of alternative assumptions and estimates could affect the fair values and change the impairment determinations.Intangible Assets: Currently all of our intangible assets are subject to amortization and are amortized based on the pattern of their economic consumption or on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives, ranging from oneto thirty-eightyears. We review intangible assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the assets may not be recoverable. Determination of recoverability is based on the lowest level of identifiable estimated future undiscounted cash flows resulting from use of the asset and its eventual disposition. Measurement of any impairment loss is based on the excess of the carrying value of the asset over its fair market value. Capitalized Software Held for Sale: Development costs for software held for sale, which primarily pertain to our Technology Solutions segment, are capitalized once a project has reached the point of technological feasibility. Completed projects are amortized after reaching the point of general availability using the straight-line method based on an estimated useful life of approximately threeyears. At each balance sheet date, or earlier if an indicator of an impairment exists, we evaluate the recoverability of unamortized capitalized software costs based on estimated future undiscounted revenues net of estimated related costs over the remaining amortization period. Capitalized Software Held for Internal Use: We capitalize costs of software held for internal use during the application development stage of a project and amortize those costs over their estimated useful lives ranging from oneto tenyears. As of March31, 2014and 2013, capitalized software held for internal use was $514million and $465million, net of accumulated amortization of $1,004million and $1,011million, and was included in other assets in the consolidated balance sheets.Insurance Programs:Under our insurance programs, we seek to obtain coverage for catastrophic exposures as well as those risks required to be insured by law or contract. It is our policy to retain a significant portion of certain losses primarily related to workers compensation and comprehensive general, product and vehicle liability. Provisions for losses expected under these programs are recorded based upon our estimate of the aggregate liability for claims incurred as well as for claims incurred but not yet reported. Such estimates utilize certain actuarial assumptions followed in the insurance industry64Table of ContentsMcKESSON CORPORATIONFINANCIAL NOTES ContinuedRevenue Recognition:Distribution SolutionsRevenues for our Distribution Solutions segment are recognized when product is delivered and title passes to the customer or when services have been rendered and there are no further obligations to the customer.Revenues are recorded net of sales returns, allowances, rebates and other incentives. Our sales return policy generally allows customers to return products only if they can be resold for value or returned to suppliers for full credit. Sales returns are accrued based on estimates at the time of sale to the customer. Sales returns from customers were approximately $19billion in 2014, $19billion in 2013and $16billion in 2012. Taxes collected from customers and remitted to governmental authorities are presentedon a net basis; that is, they are excluded from revenues.Revenues for our Distribution Solutions segment include large volume sales of pharmaceuticals primarily to a limited number of large customers who warehouse their own product. We order bulk product from the manufacturer, receive and process the product primarily through our central distribution facility and deliver the bulk product generally in the same form as received from the manufacturer directly to our customers warehouses. We also record revenues for direct store deliveries from most of these same customers. Direct store deliveries are shipments from the manufacturer to our customers of a limited category of products that require special handling. We assume the primary liability to the manufacturer for these products.Revenues are recorded gross when we are the primary party obligated in the transaction, take title to and possession of the inventory, are subject to inventory risk, have latitude in establishing prices, assume the risk of loss for collection from customers as well as delivery or return of the product, are responsible for fulfillment and other customer service requirements, or the transactions have several but not all of these indicators.Our Distribution Solutions segment also engages in multiple-element arrangements, which may contain a combination of various products and services. Revenue from a multiple element arrangement is allocated to the separate elements based on their relative selling price and recognized in accordance with the revenue recognition criteria applicable to each element. Relative selling price is determined based on vendor-specific objective evidence VSOE of selling price, if available, third-party evidence TPE, if VSOE of selling price is not available, or estimated selling price ESP, if neither VSOE of selling price nor TPE is available. Technology SolutionsRevenues for our Technology Solutions segment are generated primarily by licensing software and software systems consisting of software, hardware and maintenance support, and providing claims processing, outsourcing and professional services. Software and hardware are included in product revenue, while maintenance support among other services are included in service revenue. Revenue for this segment is recognized as follows:Software systems are marketed under information systems agreements as well as service agreements. Perpetual software arrangements are recognized at the time of delivery or under the percentage-of-completion method if the arrangements require significant production, modification or customization of the software. Contracts accounted for under the percentage-of-completion method are generally measured based on the ratio of labor hours incurred to date to total estimated labor hours to be incurred. Changes in estimates to complete and revisions in overall profit estimates on these contracts are charged to earnings in the period in which they are determined. We accrue for contract losses if and when the current estimate of total contract costs exceeds total contract revenue.Revenue from time-based software license agreements is recognized ratably over the term of the agreement. Software implementation fees are recognized as the work is performed or under the percentage-of-completion method. Maintenance and support agreements are marketed under annual or multi-year agreements and are recognized ratably over the period covered by the agreements. Hardware revenues are generally recognized upon delivery.Subscription, content and transaction processing fees are generally marketed under annual and multi-year agreements and are recognized ratably over the contracted terms beginning on the service start date for fixed fee arrangements and recognized as transactions are performed beginning on the service start date for per-transaction fee arrangements. Remote processing service fees are recognized monthly as the service is performed. Outsourcing service revenues are recognized as the service is performed65Table of ContentsMcKESSON CORPORATIONFINANCIAL NOTES ContinuedWe also offer certain products on an application service provider basis, making our software functionality available on a remote hosting basis from our data centers. The data centers provide system and administrative support, as well as hosting services. Revenue on products sold on an application service provider basis is recognized on a monthly basis over the term of the contract beginning on the service start date of products hosted.This segment engages in multiple-element arrangements, which may contain any combination of software, hardware, implementation or consulting services, or maintenance services. For multiple element arrangements that do not include software, revenue is allocated to the separate elements based on their relative selling price and recognized in accordance with the revenue recognition criteria applicable to each element. Relative selling price is determined based on VSOE of selling price if available, TPE, if VSOE of selling price is not available, or ESP if neither VSOE of selling price nor TPE is available. For multiple-element arrangements accounted for in accordance with specific software accounting guidance when some elements are delivered prior to others in an arrangement and VSOE of fair value exists for the undelivered elements, revenue for the delivered elements is recognized upon delivery of such items. The segment establishes VSOE for hardware and implementation and consulting services based on the price charged when sold separately, and for maintenance services, based on renewal rates offered to customers. Revenue for the software element is recognized under the residual method only when fair value has been established for all of the undelivered elements in an arrangement. If fair value cannot be established for any undelivered element, all of the arrangements revenue is deferred until the delivery of the last element or until the fair value of the undelivered element is determinable. For multiple-element arrangements with both software elements and nonsoftware elements, arrangement consideration is allocated between the software elements as a whole and nonsoftware elements. The segment then further allocates consideration to the individual elements within the software group, and revenue is recognized for all elements under the applicable accounting guidance and our policies described above. Supplier Incentives:Fees for service and other incentives received from suppliers, relating to the purchase or distribution of inventory, are generally reported as a reduction to cost of goods sold. We consider these fees and other incentives to represent product discounts and as a result, the amounts are recorded as a reduction of product cost and are recognized through cost of goods sold upon the sale of the related inventory.Supplier Reserves: We establish reserves against amounts due from suppliers relating to various price and rebate incentives, including deductions or billings taken against payments otherwise due to them. These reserve estimates are established based on judgment after considering the status of current outstanding claims, historical experience with the suppliers, the specific incentive programs and any other pertinent information available. We evaluate the amounts due from suppliers on a continual basis and adjust the reserve estimates when appropriate based on changes in factual circumstances. As of March31, 2014and 2013supplier reserves were $181million and $164million. The ultimate outcome of any outstanding claims may be different than our estimate. All of the supplier reserves at March31, 2014and 2013pertain to our Distribution Solutions segment.Income Taxes:We account for income taxes under the asset and liability method, which requires the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been included in the financial statements. Under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the difference between the financial statements and the tax basis of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse. Tax benefits from uncertain tax positions are recognized when it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained upon examination, including resolutions of any related appeals or litigation processes, based on the technical merits. The amount recognized is measured as the largest amount of tax benefit that is greater than 50 percentlikely of being realized upon effective settlements. Deferred taxes are not provided on undistributed earnings of our foreign operations that are considered to be permanently reinvested.Foreign Currency Translation:Our international subsidiaries generally consider their local currency to be their functional currency. Assets and liabilities of these international subsidiaries are translated into U.S. dollars at year-end exchange rates and revenues and expenses are translated at average exchange rates during the year. Currency translation adjustments for the year are included in other comprehensive income or loss in the statements of consolidated comprehensive income, and the cumulative effect is included in the stockholders equity section of the consolidated balance sheets. When we sell all or substantially all of an international entity, the related share of the cumulative currency translation adjustment is removed from stockholders equity and is included in the gain or loss on sale in the consolidated statements of operations. Realized gains and losses from currency exchange transactions are recorded in operating expenses in the consolidated statements of operations and were not material to our consolidated results of operations in 2014, 2013or 201266Table of ContentsMcKESSON CORPORATIONFINANCIAL NOTES ContinuedDerivative Financial Instruments:Derivative financial instruments are used principally in the management of foreign currency and interest rate exposures and are recorded on the consolidated balance sheets at fair value. If a derivative is designated as a fair value hedge, the changes in the fair value of the derivative and of the hedged item attributable to the hedged risk are recognized as a charge or credit to earnings. If the derivative is designated as a cash flow hedge, the effective portions of changes in the fair value of the derivative are included in other comprehensive income or loss in the statements of consolidated comprehensive income, and the cumulative effect is included in the stockholders equity section of the consolidated balance sheets. The cumulative changes in fair value are reclassed to the consolidated statements of operations when the hedged item affects earnings. We periodically evaluate hedge effectiveness, and ineffective portions of changes in the fair value of cash flow hedges are recognized as a charge or credit to earnings. Derivative instruments not designated as hedges are marked-to-market at the end of each accounting period with the change included in earnings. Comprehensive Income: Comprehensive income consists of two components, net income and other comprehensive income. Other comprehensive income refers to revenue, expenses, and gains and losses that under GAAP are recorded as an element of shareholders equity but are excluded from net income. Our other comprehensive income consists of foreign currency translation adjustments from those subsidiaries where the local currency is the functional currency, unrealized gains and losses on cash flow hedges, as well asunrealized gains and losses on retirement-related benefit plans. Noncontrolling Interests: Noncontrolling interests primarily represent the portion of Celesios profit or loss, net assets and comprehensive income that is not allocable to McKesson Corporation.Share-Based Compensation:We account for all share-based compensation transactions using a fair-value based measurement method. The share-based compensation expense, for the portion of the awards that is ultimately expected to vest, is recognized on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period. The compensation expense recognized has been classified in the consolidated statements of operations or capitalized on the consolidated balance sheets in the same manner as cash compensation paid to our employees.Loss Contingencies:We are subject to various claims, other pending and potential legal actions for damages, investigations relating to governmental laws and regulations and other matters arising out of the normal conduct of our business. When a loss is considered probable and reasonably estimable, we record a liability in the amount of our best estimate for the ultimate loss. However, the likelihood of a loss with respect to a particular contingency is often difficult to predict and determining a meaningful estimate of the loss or a range of loss may not be practicable based on the information available and the potential effect of future events and decisions by third parties that will determine the ultimate resolution of the contingency. Moreover, it is not uncommon for such matters to be resolved over many years, during which time relevant developments and new information must be reevaluated at least quarterly to determine both the likelihood of potential loss and whether it is possible to reasonably estimate a range of possible loss. When a loss is probable but a reasonable estimate cannot be made, disclosure of the proceeding is provided. Disclosure also is provided when it is reasonably possible that a loss will be incurred or when it is reasonably possible that the amount of a loss will exceed the recorded provision. We review all contingencies at least quarterly to determine whether the likelihood of loss has changed and to assess whether a reasonable estimate of the loss or range of the loss can be made. As discussed above, development of a meaningful estimate of loss or a range of potential loss is complex when the outcome is directly dependent on negotiations with or decisions by third parties, such as regulatory agencies, the court system and other interested parties. Such factors bear directly on whether it is possible to reasonably estimate a range of potential loss and boundaries of high and low estimate67Table of ContentsMcKESSON CORPORATIONFINANCIAL NOTES ContinuedBusiness Combinations:We account for acquired businesses using the acquisition method of accounting, which requires that once control is obtained of a business, 100%of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed, including amounts attributed to noncontrolling interests, be recorded at the date of acquisition at their respective fair values. Any excess of the purchase price over the estimated fair values of the net assets acquired is recorded as goodwill. Acquisition-related expenses and related restructuring costs are expensed as incurred. Several valuation methods may be used to determine the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed. For intangible assets, we typically use the income method. This method starts with a forecast of all of the expected future net cash flows for each asset. These cash flows are then adjusted to present value by applying an appropriate discount rate that reflects the risk factors associated with the cash flow streams. Some of the more significant estimates and assumptions inherent in the income method or other methods include the amount and timing of projected future cash flows, the discount rate selected to measure the risks inherent in the future cash flows and the assessment of the assets life cycle and the competitive trends impacting the asset, including consideration of any technical, legal, regulatory, or economic barriers to entry. Determining the useful life of an intangible asset also requires judgment as different types of intangible assets will have different useful lives and certain assets may even be considered to have indefinite useful lives.Recently Adopted Accounting PronouncementsComprehensive Income: In the first quarter of 2014, we adopted disclosure guidance related to the reporting of amounts reclassified out of Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income AOCI. The guidance requires disclosure of amounts reclassified out of AOCI by component. In addition, an entity is required to present either on the face of the statement of operations or in the notes, significant amounts reclassified out of AOCI by the respective line items of net income but only if the amount reclassified is required to be reclassified to net income in its entirety in the same reporting period. For amounts not reclassified in their entirety to net income, an entity is required to cross-reference to other disclosures that provide additional detail about those amounts. This guidance did not have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements.Balance Sheet Offsetting: In the first quarter of 2014, we adopted disclosure guidance related to the offsetting of assets and liabilities. The guidance requires an entity to disclose information about offsetting assets and liabilities for derivatives, repurchase agreements and reverse purchase agreements, and securities borrowing and securities lending transactions that are either offset in accordance with specific GAAP criteria or subject to a master netting arrangement or similar agreement. The amended guidance did not have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements.Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements Not Yet AdoptedCumulative Translation Adjustments: In March 2013, amended guidance was issued for parents accounting for the cumulative translation adjustment upon derecognition of certain subsidiaries or group of assets within a foreign entity or of an investment in a foreign entity. The amended guidance requires the release of any cumulative translation adjustment into net income only upon complete or substantially complete liquidation of a controlling interest in a subsidiary or a group of assets within a foreign entity. Also, it requires the release of all or a pro rata portion of the cumulative translation adjustment to net income in case of sale of an equity method investment that is a foreign entity. The amended guidance is applicable to us effective first quarter of fiscal 2015. Early adoption is permitted. We are currently evaluating the impact of this amended guidance on our consolidated financial statements.Discontinued Operations:In April 2014, amended guidance was issued for reporting of discontinued operations and disclosures of disposals of components. The amended guidance raises the threshold for disposals to qualify as discontinued operations and permitssignificant continuing involvement and continuing cash flows with the discontinued operation. In addition, the amended guidance requires additional disclosures for discontinued operations and new disclosures for individually material disposal transactions that do not meet the definition of a discontinued operation. The amended guidance is effective for us prospectively commencing in the first quarter of 2016. Early adoption is permitted. We are currently evaluating the impact of this amended guidance on our consolidated financial statements68Table of ContentsMcKESSON CORPORATIONFINANCIAL NOTES Continued2.Business CombinationsFiscal 2014On February6, 2014, we completed the acquisition of 776%of the then outstanding common shares of Celesio AGCelesio and certain convertible bonds of Celesio for cash consideration of $45 billion, net of cash acquired the Acquisition. Upon the acquisition, our ownership of Celesios fully diluted common shares was 756%and, as required, we consolidated Celesios debt with a fair value of $23 billionas a liability on our consolidated balance sheet. The Acquisition was funded by utilizing a senior bridge loan, our existing accounts receivable sales facility and cash on hand. Celesio is an international wholesale and retail company and a provider of logistics and services to the pharmaceutical and healthcare sectors. Celesios headquarters is in Stuttgart, Germany and it operates in 14 countries around the world. The acquisition of Celesio expands our global geographic area; the combined company will be one of the largest pharmaceutical wholesalers and providers of logistics and services in the healthcare sector worldwide.Our acquisition of Celesio was consummated through a series of transactions: 1293million of common shares of Celesio were acquired from Franz Haniel Cie. GmbH Haniel for cash consideration of 2350per common share or $4,128 million. 4,840of the 7,000convertible bonds issued by Celesio in the nominal aggregate amount of 350milliondue in October 2014 the 2014 Bonds, and 2,180of the 3,500convertible bonds issued by Celesio in the nominal amount of 350milliondue in April 2018 the 2018 Bonds were acquired from Elliot International, L.P., The Liverpool Limited Partnership and Elliot Capital Advisers, L.P. together, the Elliot Group for cash consideration of $951 million. The 2,180acquired 2018 Bonds were converted to 114 millioncommon shares of Celesio303of the 2014 Bonds and 216of the 2018 Bonds were acquired in private transactions for cash consideration of $63million. 139of the acquired 2018 Bonds were converted to 07 millioncommon shares of Celesio.From February7,2014 through March 31, 2014, we converted our remaining 2014 Bonds and 2018 Bonds into 119millionof Celesio common shares. Also during this time period, substantially all of the remaining 2014 Bonds and 2018 Bonds held by third parties were converted to 9 millionof Celesio common shares valued at $313 millionand approximately $30 millionin cash. At March 31, 2014, we owned approximately 754%of Celesios outstanding and fully diluted common shares.In accordance with a business combination agreement that we entered into with Celesio in January 2014, on February 28, 2014 and April 7, 2014 we launched voluntary public tender offers for the common shares of Celesio that remain outstanding for 2350per share. In April 2014, the last of these tender offers expired and we acquired 1million of additional common shares. We also intend to enter into a domination and profit and loss transfer agreement, with Celesio as the dominated party, pursuant to Sections 291 et seq. of the German Stock Corporation Act Aktiengesetz - AktG. Such a domination and profit and loss transfer agreement does not require any further regulatory approval69Table of ContentsMcKESSON CORPORATIONFINANCIAL NOTES ContinuedThe following table summarizes the preliminary recording of the fair values of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed as of the acquisition date.

These inputs are considered Level 3 inputs under the fair value measurements and disclosure guidance.Acquired intangibles primarily consist of $1,574 millionof customer relationships, $1,202 millionof pharmacy licenses and $172 millionof trademarks. The estimated weighted average life of the customer relationships, pharmacy licenses, trademarks and total intangible assets are eleven years, twenty-six years, fourteen yearsand seventeen years. The fair value of Celesios long-term debt was determined by quoted market prices in a less active market and other observable inputs from available market information, which are considered to be Level 2 inputs under the fair value measurements and disclosure guidance. The fair values of the conversion options on Celesios convertible bonds, which are classified as current liabilities, were determined by using an option pricing model that uses observable market data for all inputs, such as historical volatility of the Companys common stock, risk-free interest rate and other factors that are considered to be Level 2 inputs under the fair value measurements and disclosure guidance. The fair value of the noncontrolling interests on the date of acquisition of $1,500 millionwas made up of the following components:In  value of Celesio common shares not acquired by McKesson$1,412Fair value of Celesios previously existing noncontrolling interests88Total$1,500The fair value of the noncontrolling interests for the Celesio common shares that were not acquired by McKesson was determined by a quoted market price that is considered to be a Level 1 input under the fair value measurements and disclosure guidance70Table of ContentsMcKESSON CORPORATIONFINANCIAL NOTES ContinuedThe excess of the purchase price and the noncontrolling interests over the fair value of the acquired net assets has been allocated to goodwill, which primarily reflects the expected future benefits to be realized upon integrating the business.

Celesio contributed $48 billionof revenues and immaterial net earnings from the date of the acquisition through March 31, 2014.The following table provides pro forma results of operations for the years ended March 31, 2014 and March 31, 2013, as if Celesio had been acquired as of April 1, 2012. The pro forma results include the effect of preliminary purchase accounting adjustments such as the estimated changes in depreciation and amortization expense on the acquired tangible and intangible assets, financing costs, and related income tax expense. These adjustments are subject to change within the measurement period as our fair values assessments are finalized. The pro forma results do not reflect any material cost of integration activities or benefits that may result from synergies that may be derived from any integration activities.

PSS World Medicalof Jacksonville, Florida for $2900per share plus the assumption of PSS World Medicals debt, or approximately $19billion in aggregate, consisting of cash consideration of $13billion, net of cash acquired, and the assumption of long-term debt with a fair value of $06billion. The cash paid at acquisition was funded from cash on hand and the issuance of long-term debt. PSS World Medical markets and distributes medical products and services throughout the United States.The acquisition of PSS World Medical expands our existing Medical-Surgical business.Included in the purchase price allocation are acquired identifiable intangibles of $568million, the fair value of which was primarily determined by applying the income approach, using several significant unobservable inputs for projected cash flows and a discount rate. These inputs are considered Level 3 inputs under the fair value measurements and disclosure guidance.Acquired intangibles primarily consist of $539million of customer lists and $15million of trademarks and trade names.

Wepreviously held a 50%ownership interest and were the primary tenant in this building. This transaction was accounted for as a step acquisition, which required that we re-measure our previously held50%ownership interest to fair value and record the difference between the fair value and carrying value as a gain in the consolidated statements of operations. The re-measurement to fair value resulted in a non-cash pre-tax gain of $81million $51million after-tax, which was recorded as a gain on business combination within Corporate in the consolidated statements of operations during the first quarter of 2013. The total fair value of the net assets acquired was $180million, which was allocated as follows: building and improvements of $113million and land of $58million with the remainder allocated for settlement of our pre-existing lease and lease intangible assets. The fair value of the building and improvements was determined based on current market replacement costs less depreciation and unamortized tenant improvement costs, as well as, other relevant market information, which are considered to be Level 3 inputs under the fair value measurements and disclosure guidance. The building and improvements have a weighted average useful life of 30years. The fair value of the land was determined using comparable sales of land within the surrounding market, which is considered to be a Level 2 input.Fiscal 2012On March25, 2012, we acquired substantially all of the assets of Drug Trading Company Limited, the independent banner business of the Katz Group Canada Inc. Katz Group, and Medicine Shoppe Canada Inc., the franchise business of the Katz Group collectively, Katz Assetsfor $925million, which was funded from cash on hand. The acquisition of the assets from the Drug Trading Company Limited consists of a marketing and purchasing arm of independently owned pharmacies in Canada. The acquisition of Medicine Shoppe Canada Inc. consists of the franchise business of providing services to independent pharmacies in Canada.Financial results for the acquired Katz Assets have been included in the results of operations within our Canadian pharmaceutical distribution and services business, which is part of our Distribution Solutions segment, beginning in the first quarter of 2013.Included in the purchase price allocation are acquired identifiable intangibles of $442million, the fair value of which was determined by applying the income approach, using several unobservable inputs for projected cash flows and a discount rate.

The excess of the purchase price over the net tangible and intangible assets of approximately $512million was recorded as goodwill, which primarily reflects the expected future benefits to be realized upon integrating the business. The amount of goodwill expected to be deductible for tax purposes is $290million.During the last three years, we also completed a number of other smaller acquisitions within both of our operating segments. Financial results for our business acquisitions have been included in our consolidated financial statements since their respective acquisition dates.

Related expenses for 2013 primarily pertained to our acquisition of PSS World Medical and our gain on business combination from our acquisition of the remaining 50%ownership interest in our corporate headquarters building, and for 2012 were primarily incurred to integrate a 2011 acquisition. Additional acquisition-related expenses are expected to be incurred as we integrate our acquired businesses. Goodwill recognized for our business acquisitions is generally not expected to be deductible for tax purposes. However, if we acquire the assets of a company, the goodwill may be deductible for tax purposes. For all acquisitions other than Celesio, the pro forma results of operations for our business acquisitions, and the results of operations for these acquisitions since the acquisition date have not been presented because the effects were not material to the consolidated financial statements on either an individual or an aggregate basis. 3.Discontinued OperationsIn 2014, we committed to a plan to sell our International Technology and our Hospital Automation businesses from our Technology Solutions segment and certain businesses from our Distribution Solutions segment. The results of operations and cash flows for these businesses are classified as discontinued operations for the years ended March31, 2014, 2013and 2012in our consolidated financial statements. 73Table of ContentsMcKESSON CORPORATIONFINANCIAL NOTES ContinuedDuring the third quarter of 2014, we recorded an $80 millionpre-tax $80 millionafter-tax non-cash impairment charge to reduce the carrying value of our International Technology business to its estimated net realizable value fair value less costs to sell. The charge was primarily the result of the terms of the preliminary purchase offers received for this business during the third quarter of 2014. The impairment charge was primarily attributed to goodwill and other long-lived assets and as a result, there was no tax benefit associated with this charge. The ultimate selling price of our International Technology business may be higher or lower than our current assessment of fair value.During the third quarter of 2014, we sold our Hospital Automation business for net cash proceeds of $55 millionand recorded a pre-tax and after-tax loss of $5 millionand $7 million.A summary of results of discontinued operations is as follows: Years Ended March 31,In  loss from discontinued operations$102$9$26Loss on sale5Income loss from discontinued operations before income tax107926Income tax expense benefit112Income loss from discontinued operations, net of tax$96$9$24The assets and liabilities of our discontinued operations were classified as held-for-sale effective June 30, 2013. All applicable assets of the businesses to be sold are included under the caption Prepaid expenses and other and all applicable liabilities under the caption Other accrued liabilities within our consolidated balance sheet at March31, 2014. The carrying values of the assets and liabilities classified as held-for-sale were $267million and $248million at March31, 2014. 4.Asset Impairments and Product Alignment ChargesIn 2014, 2013 and 2012, we recorded asset impairments and product alignment charges of $57 million, $46million and $51million in our Technology Solutions segment. Fiscal 2014During the third quarter of 2014, our Technology Solutions segment recorded pre-tax charges totaling $57 million. These charges primarily consist of $35 millionof product alignment charges, $15 millionof integration-related expenses and $7 millionof reduction-in-workforce severance charges. Included in the total charge was $35 millionfor severance for employees primarily in our research and development, customer services and sales functions, and $15 millionfor asset impairments which primarily represents the write-off of deferred costs related to a product that will no longer be developed. Charges were recorded in our consolidated statement of operations as follows: $34 millionin cost of sales and $23 millionin operating expenses.Fiscal 2013During the fourth quarter of 2013, we recorded $46million of non-cash pre-tax impairment charges. These charges were the result of a significant decrease in estimated revenues for a software product. The charge included a $36million goodwill impairment to reduce the carrying value of goodwill within the applicable reporting unit to its implied fair value. In addition, the goodwill had a nominal tax basis. This impairment charge was recorded in operating expenses within our consolidated statement of operations. Refer to Financial Note 19, Fair Value Measurements, for more information on this nonrecurring fair value measurement. The balance of the charge represents a $10million impairment to reduce the carrying value of the unamortized capitalized software held for sale costs for this product to its net realizable value. We concluded that the estimated future undiscounted revenues, net of estimated related costs, were insufficient to recover its carrying value. This impairment charge was recorded in cost of sales within our consolidated statement of operations. 74Table of ContentsMcKESSON CORPORATIONFINANCIAL NOTES ContinuedFiscal 2012During the third quarter of 2012, we approved a plan to align our hospital clinical and revenue cycle healthcare software products within our Technology Solutions segment. As part of this alignment strategy, we began converging our core clinical and revenue cycle Horizon and Paragon product lines onto Paragons Microsoft-based platform. Additionally, we stopped development of our Horizon Enterprise Revenue Management HzERM software product. The plan resulted in a pre-tax charge of $51million in 2012, of which $31million was recorded to cost of sales and $20million was recorded to operating expenses within our consolidated statement of operations. The majority of these charges were incurred in the third quarter of 2012. The pre-tax charge included $24million of non-cash asset impairment charges, primarily for the write-off of prepaid licenses and commissions and capitalized internal use software that were determined to be obsolete as they would not be utilized going forward, $10million for severance, $7million for customer allowances and $10million for other charges. 5.Impairment and Sale of an Equity InvestmentDuring 2013, we committed to a plan to sell our 49%equity interest in Nadro, S.A. de C.V. Nadro and in the fourth quarter of 2013 recorded a pre-tax impairment charge of $191million reducing the investments carrying value to its estimated fair value. The charge reflected deterioration in Nadros market position, projected lower revenue growth rates and operating margins and continued business challenges in the wholesale pharmaceutical distribution business in Mexico. Cumulative foreign currency translation losses of $69million were included in the assessment of the investments carrying value for purposes of calculating the impairment charge. Cumulative foreign currency translation losses net of tax, were included in Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income on our consolidated balance sheet at March 31, 2013. The impairment charge was recorded in impairment of an equity investment in the consolidated statements of operations within our Distribution Solutions segment. Refer to Financial Note 19, Fair Value Measurements, for more information on this fair value measurement. In September 2013, we completed the sale of our 49%equity interest in Nadro which resulted in nomaterial gain or loss. Under the terms of the agreement, we received $41million in total cash consideration. There was no material gain or loss on the disposition based on the adjusted net realizable value of the investment at the time of the sale. Prior to the sale, our investment in Nadro was accounted for under the equity method of accounting within our Distribution Solutions segment. 6.Share-Based CompensationWe provide share-based compensation to our employees, officers and non-employee directors, including stock options, an employee stock purchase plan, restricted stock units RSUs and performance-based restricted stock units PeRSUs collectively, share-based awards. Most of our share-based awards are granted in the first quarter of each fiscal year. Compensation expense for the share-based awards is recognized for the portion of awards ultimately expected to vest. We estimate the number of share-based awards, which will ultimately vest primarily based on historical experience. The estimated forfeiture rate established upon grant is re-assessed throughout the requisite service period and is adjusted when actual forfeitures occur. The actual forfeitures in future reporting periods could be higher or lower than current estimates. The compensation expense recognized has been classified in the consolidated statements of operations or capitalized in the consolidated balance sheets in the same manner as cash compensation paid to our employees. There was nomaterial share-based compensation expense capitalized as part of the cost of an asset in 2014, 2013and 201275Table of ContentsMcKESSON CORPORATIONFINANCIAL NOTES ContinuedImpact on Net IncomeThe components of share-based compensation expense and related tax benefits are as follows:Years Ended March 31, In  options222423Employee stock purchase plan121110Share-based compensation expense160167154Tax benefit for share-based compensation expense 3555955Share-based compensation expense, net of tax$105$108$991This expense was primarily the result of PeRSUs awarded in prior years, which converted to RSUs due to the attainment of goals during the applicable years performance period2Represents estimated compensation expense for PeRSUs that are conditional upon attaining performance objectives during the current years performance period3Income tax benefit is computed using the tax rates of applicable tax jurisdictions. Additionally, a portion of pre-tax compensation expense is not tax-deductible. Stock PlansIn July 2013, our stockholders approved the 2013 Stock Plan to replace the 2005 Stock Plan. These stock plans provide our employees, officers and non-employee directors the opportunity to receive equity-based, long-term incentives in the form of stock options, restricted stock, RSUs, PeRSUs and other share-based awards. The 2013 Stock Plan reserves 300millionshares plus the remaining number of shares reserved but unused under the 2005 Stock Plan. As of March31, 2014, 336million shares remain available for future grant under the 2013 Stock Plan. Stock OptionsStock options are granted at no less than fair market value, and those options granted under the 2013 Stock Plan generally have a contractual term of sevenyears and follow a four-year vesting schedule.Compensation expense for stock options is recognized on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period and is based on the grant-date fair value for the portion of the awards that is ultimately expected to vest. We use the Black-Scholes options-pricing model to estimate the fair value of our stock options. Once the fair value of an employee stock option is determined, current accounting practices do not permit it to be changed, even if the estimates used are different from actual. The options-pricing model requires the use of various estimates and assumptions as follows:Expected stock price volatility is based on a combination of historical volatility of our common stock and implied market volatility. We believe that this market-based input provides a reasonable estimate of our future stock price movements and is consistent with employee stock option valuation considerations.Expected dividend yield is based on historical experience and investors current expectations.The risk-free interest rate for periods within the expected life of the option is based on the constant maturity U.S. Treasury rate in effect at the time of grant.Expected life of the options is based primarily on historical employee stock option exercises and other behavior data and reflects the impact of changes in contractual life of current option grants compared to our historical grants76Table of ContentsMcKESSON CORPORATIONFINANCIAL NOTES ContinuedWeighted-average assumptions used to estimate the fair value of employee stock options were as follows:Years Ended March 31, 201420132012Expected stock price volatility22%27%27%Expected dividend yield07%09%10%Risk-free interest rate07%08%21%Expected life in years455The following is a summary of stock options outstanding at March31, 2014:Options OutstandingOptions ExercisableRange of ExercisePricesNumber ofOptionsOutstandingat Year EndIn   PriceNumber ofOptionsExercisable atYear EndIn   following table summarizes stock option activity during 2014:In millions, except per share  YearsAggregateIntrinsic Value2Outstanding, March 31,  March 31, 20146$78074$473Vested and expected to vest15$77274$472Vested and exercisable, March 31, 20143610732811The number of options expected to vest takes into account an estimate of expected forfeitures2The intrinsic value is calculated as the difference between the period-end market price of the Companys common stock and the exercise price of in-the-money options.

Total compensation expense for RSUs under our stock plans is determined by the product of the number of shares that are expected to vest and the grant date market price of the Companys common stock. The Compensation Committee determines the vesting terms at the time of grant. These awards generally vest in threeto fouryears. We recognize expense for RSUs on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period.Non-employee directors receive an annual grant of RSUs, which vest immediately and are expensed upon grant. The director may choose to receive payment immediately or defer receipt of the underlying shares if they meet director stock ownership guidelines. At March31, 2014, 150,000RSUs for our directors are vested.PeRSUs are RSUs for which the number of RSUs awarded may be conditional upon the attainment of one or more performance objectives over a specified period. PeRSUs are accounted for as variable awards until the performance goals are reached and the grant date is established. Total compensation expense for PeRSUs is determined by the product of the number of shares eligible to be awarded and expected to vest, and the market price of the Companys common stock, commencing at the inception of the requisite service period. During the performance period, the compensation expense for PeRSUs is re-computed using the market price and the performance modifier at the end of a reporting period. At the end of the performance period, if the goals are attained, the awards are granted and classified as RSUs and accounted for on that basis. We recognize compensation expense of these awards on a straight-line basis over the requisite aggregate service period of generally fouryears.The following table summarizes RSU activity during 2014:In millions, except per share  Date FairValue Per ShareNonvested, March 31,  March 31, 20144$9325The following table provides data related to RSU activity: Years Ended March 31, In millions201420132012Total fair value of shares vested$184$66$44Total compensation cost, net of estimated forfeitures, related to nonvested RSU awards not yet recognized,  period in years over which RSU cost is expected to be recognized223In May 2013, the Compensation Committee approved 1million PeRSU target share units representing the base number of awards that could be granted, if goals are attained, and would be granted in the first quarter of 2014 the 2014PeRSU.

The ESPP allows eligible employees to purchase shares of our common stock through payroll deductions. The deductions occur over three-month purchase periods and the shares are then purchased at 85%of the market price at the end of each purchase period. Employees are allowed to terminate their participation in the ESPP at any time during the purchase period prior to the purchase of the shares. The 15%discount provided to employees on these shares is included in compensation expense. The shares related to funds outstanding at the end of a quarter are included in the calculation of diluted weighted average shares outstanding. These amounts have not been significant.

Discrete tax expense for 2014 primarily related to a $122 millioncharge regarding an unfavorable decision from the Tax Court of Canada with respect to transfer pricing issues. Included in the 2012discrete tax benefit is a $31million credit to income tax expense as a result of the reversal of an unrecognized tax benefit relating to our AWP litigation. The 2013 federal and state current income tax expense reflects the utilization of alternative minimum tax credit carryforwards.We have received reassessments from the Canada Revenue Agency CRA for a total of $219 millionrelated to a transfer pricing matter impacting years 2003 through 2009. We previously appealed the reassessment for 2003 to the Tax Court of Canada and have filed a notice of objection for 2004 through 2009. On December13, 2013, the Tax Court of Canada dismissed our appeal of the reassessment with respect to 2003. On January10, 2014, we filed a Notice of Appeal to the Federal Court of Appeal in response to the judgment of the Tax Court of Canada. As a result of the unfavorable Tax Court Decision relating to 2003, we recognized a discrete tax expense of $122 millionin the third quarter of 2014, which includes tax and interest, for the years 2003 through 2013. The ultimate resolution of these issues could result in an increase or decrease to income tax expense. We have received tax assessments of $98 millionfrom the U.S. Internal Revenue Service IRS relating to 2003 through 2006. We are pursuing administrative relief through the appeals process. We continue to believe in the merits of our tax positions and that we have adequately provided for any potential adverse results relating to these examinations in our financial statements.The IRS is currently examining our U.S. corporation income tax returns for 2007 through 2009. The CRA is currently examining our Canadian income tax returns for 2010 through 2013.  In nearly all jurisdictions, the tax years prior to 2003 are no longer subject to examination. Significant judgments and estimates are required in determining the consolidated income tax provision and evaluating income tax uncertainties. Although our major taxing jurisdictions are the U.S. and Canada, we are subject to income taxes in numerous foreign jurisdictions. Our income tax expense, deferred tax assets and liabilities and uncertain tax liabilities reflect managements best assessment of estimated current and future taxes to be paid. We believe that we have made adequate provision for all income tax uncertainties.The reconciliation between our effective tax rate on income from continuing operations and statutory tax rate is as follows:Years Ended March 31, In millions201420132012Income tax expense at federal statutory rate$734$670$670State income taxes net of federal tax benefit575856Foreign income taxed at various rates166136174Canadian litigation122Unrecognized tax benefits and settlements6118Tax credits61313Other, net717Income tax expense$742$581$514At March31, 2014undistributed earnings of our foreign operations totaling $42billion were considered to be permanently reinvested. Nodeferred tax liability has been recognized on the basis difference created by such earnings since it is our intention to utilize those earnings in the foreign operations as well as to fund certain research and development activities for an indefinite period of time. The determination of the amount of deferred taxes on these earnings is not practicable because the computation would depend on a number of factors that cannot be known until a decision to repatriate the earnings is made80Table of ContentsMcKESSON CORPORATIONFINANCIAL NOTES ContinuedDeferred tax balances consisted of the following: March 31, In  allowances$106$84Deferred revenue136106Compensation and benefit related accruals641553Net operating loss and credit  valuation allowance270118Total  valuation and other assets2,1632,089Fixed assets and systems development  liabilities4,1333,114Net deferred tax  net deferred tax asset$51$16Current net deferred tax  deferred tax asset1921Long-term deferred tax liability1,283278Net deferred tax liability$2,801$1,867We assess the available positive and negative evidence to determine whether deferred tax assets are more likely than not to be realized. As a result of this assessment, valuation allowances have been recorded on certain deferred tax assets in various tax jurisdictions. The increase in valuation allowances in the current year relate primarily to net operating losses incurred in certain tax jurisdictions for which no tax benefit was recognized and deferred tax assets that were acquired as part of the Celesio acquisition which are not more likely than not to be realized.We have federal, state and foreign net operating loss carryforwards of $53million, $2,524million and $935million. The federal and state net operating losses will expire at various dates from 2015 through 2034. Substantially all of our foreign net operating losses have indefinite lives. In addition, we have Canadian research and development credit carryforwards of $11million, and we believe it is more likely than not that these credits will be realized. The Canadian research and development credits will expire at various dates from 2029 to 2034.The following table summarizes the activity related to our gross unrecognized tax benefits for the last three years:Years Ended March 31, In  tax benefits at beginning of period$560$595$635Additions based on tax positions related to prior years1064611Reductions based on tax positions related to prior years3110872Additions based on tax positions related to current year233137Reductions based on  based on the lapse of the applicable statutes of  tax benefits at end of period$647$560$59581Table of ContentsMcKESSON CORPORATIONFINANCIAL NOTES ContinuedOf the total $647million in unrecognized tax benefits at March31, 2014, $490million would reduce income tax expense and the effective tax rate if recognized. During the next twelve months, it is reasonably possible that audit resolutions and the expiration of statutes of limitations could potentially reduce our unrecognized tax benefits by up to $230million. However, this amount may change because we continue to have ongoing negotiations with various taxing authorities throughout the year.We report interest and penalties on unrecognized tax benefits as income tax expense. In 2014 and 2013, we recognized income tax expense of $48million and a reduction to income tax expense of $8 million, related to interest and penalties in our consolidated statements of operations. The income tax expense for interest and penalties recognized in 2014 was primarily due to the additional interest resulting from the increase of our Canadian gross unrecognized tax benefits. The reduction to income tax expense in 2013 was primarily due to the reversal of accrued interest resulting from the reduction of our gross unrecognized tax benefits. At March31,2014and 2013, we had $179million and $131 million, accrued for the payment of interest and penalties on unrecognized tax benefits. 9.Earnings Per Common ShareBasic earnings per common share attributable to McKesson are computed by dividing net income attributable to McKesson by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the reporting period. Diluted earnings per common share are computed similar to basic earnings per common share except that it reflects the potential dilution that could occur if dilutive securities or other obligations to issue common stock were exercised or converted into common stock.

Prior to the Celesio acquisition, we amended this facility to increase the maximum debt to capital ratio from 565%to 65%, and added an extended cure period with respect to defaults under the credit facility relating to Celesio. Borrowings under this renewed credit facility bear interest based upon either the London Interbank Offered Rate or a prime rate. There were noborrowings under this credit facility during 2014, 2013and 2012. As of March 31, 2014and 2013, there were noborrowings outstanding under this credit facility.Commercial PaperThere were nocommercial paper issuances during 2014, 2013and 2012and noamounts outstanding at March31, 2014and 2013. DebtCovenantsOur various borrowing facilities and long-term debt are subject to certain covenants. Our principal debt covenant is our U.S. dollar denominated debt to capital ratio under our $13 billionunsecured revolving credit facility, which cannot exceed 65%. For the purpose of calculating this ratio, borrowings under the $135 billionAccounts Receivable Sales facility are excluded. If we exceed this ratio, repayment of debt outstanding under the revolving credit facility could be accelerated. As of March31, 2014, we were in compliance with our financial covenants15.Variable Interest EntitiesConsolidated Variable Interest EntitiesWe consolidate VIEs when we have the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact the entitys economic performance, as well as the obligation to absorb losses or right to receive benefits of the entity, and as a result we are considered to be the primary beneficiary of these entities. In addition to the consolidation of certain VIEs in our specialty health practices, as a result of our acquisition of Celesio, we have interests in seven new consolidated VIEs. These Celesio VIEs are single-lessee leasing entities in which Celesio as the lessee has the majority of the risk of the leased assets through the minimum lease payments owed by Celesio to the VIEs. As a result of absorbing this risk, the leases provide Celesio with power over the operations of the leased properties as well as the obligation to absorb losses or right to receive benefits of the entity. Consolidated VIEs have an immaterial impact on our consolidated statements of operations and cash flows. Total assets and liabilities included in our consolidated balance sheet for these VIEs were $160 millionand $75 millionat March 31, 201488Table of ContentsMcKESSON CORPORATIONFINANCIAL NOTES ContinuedInvestments in Unconsolidated Variable Interest EntitiesWe are involved with VIEs, which we do not consolidate because we do not have the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact their economic performance and thus are not considered the primary beneficiary of the entities. Our relationships include equity investments, lending, leasing, contractual or other relationships with the VIEs. Our most significant relationships are with oncology and other specialty practices. Under these practice arrangements, we generally own or lease all of the real estate and the equipment used by the affiliated practices and manage the practices administrative functions. As a result of our acquisition of Celesio, we also have relationships with certain pharmacies in Europe with whom we may provide financing, have equity ownership and/or a supply agreement whereby we supply the vast majority of the pharmacies purchases. Our maximum exposure to loss regardless of probability as a result of all unconsolidated VIEs was $12billion and $11billion at March31, 2014and 2013, which primarily represents the value of intangible assets related to service agreements and lease and loan receivables. These amounts exclude the customer loan guarantees discussed in Financial Note 21, Financial Guarantees and Warranties. We believe that there is no material loss exposure on these assets or from these relationships. 16.Pension BenefitsWe maintain a number of qualified and nonqualified defined benefit pension plans and defined contribution plans for eligible employees.Defined Benefit Pension PlansEligible U.S. employees who were employed by the Company as of December 31, 1995 are covered under the Company-sponsored defined benefit retirement plan. In 1997, the plan was amended to freeze all plan benefits as of December 31, 1996. Benefits for the defined benefit retirement plan are based primarily on age of employees at date of retirement, years of creditable service and the average of the highest 60 monthsof pay during the 15 yearsprior to the plan freeze date. We also have defined benefit pension plans for eligible employees outside of the U.S., as well as an unfunded nonqualified supplemental defined benefit plan for certain U.S. executives. Most of the non-U.S. defined benefit pension plans cover employees located in Germany, Norway and the United Kingdom. Celesio has defined benefit pension plans for eligible employees located predominately in Germany, Norway and the United Kingdom. Upon the acquisition of Celesio, as required, we consolidated Celesios pension assets and obligations on our consolidated balance sheet. Benefits for these plans are based primarily on each employees final salary, with annual adjustments for inflation. The obligations in Norway are largely related to the state-regulated pension plan which is managed by the Norwegian Public Service Pension Fund SPK. According to the terms of the SPK, the plan assets of state regulated plans in Norway must correspond very closely to the pension obligation calculated using the principles codified in Norwegian law. The shortfall may not exceed 1%of the obligation. If the shortfall exceeds this threshold, it must be remedied within 2 years. In the United Kingdom, several Celesio subsidiaries participate in a joint pension plan. This plan is largely funded by contractual trust arrangements that hold Company assets that may only be used to pay pension obligations. The Trustee Board decides on the minimum contribution to the plan in association with selected employees of the entity. A valuation is performed at regular intervals in order to determine the amount of the contribution and to ensure that the minimum contribution is made. The pension obligation in Germany is unfunded with the exception of the contractual trust arrangement used to fund pensions of Celesios Management Board.Defined benefit plan assets and obligations are measured as of the Companys fiscal year-end. 89Table of ContentsMcKESSON CORPORATIONFINANCIAL NOTES ContinuedThe net periodic expense, which includes net pension expense for Celesio since the date of acquisition, for our pension plans is as follows:U.S. PlansNon-U.S. PlansYears Ended March 31, Years Ended March 31, In  cost - benefits earned during the year$4$4$4$6$3$3Interest cost on projected benefit obligation1921241177Expected return on  of unrecognized actuarial loss, prior service costs and net transitional  gain1Net periodic pension expense$35$33$29$8$6$5The projected unit credit method is utilized in measuring net periodic pension expense over the employees service life for the pension plans.

Pension obligations for our unfunded plans are based on the recommendations of independent actuaries. Projected benefit obligations relating to our unfunded non-U.S. plans were $260 millionand $7 millionat March 31, 2014 and 2013. Funding obligations for our non-U.S. plans vary based on the laws of each non-U.S. jurisdiction.Expected benefit payments, including assumed executive lump sum payments, for our pension plans are as follows: $84million, $190million, $74million, $86million and $105million for 2015to 2019and $413million for 2020through 2024. Expected benefit payments are based on the same assumptions used to measure the benefit obligations and include estimated future employee service. Expected contributions to be made for our pension plans are $67million for 2015.Weighted-average assumptions used to estimate the net periodic pension expense and the actuarial present value of benefit obligations were as follows:U.S. PlansNon-U.S. PlansYears Ended March 31, Years Ended March 31, 201420132012201420132012Net periodic pension expenseDiscount  of increase in  long-term rate of return on plan  obligationDiscount  of increase in  of ContentsMcKESSON CORPORATIONFINANCIAL NOTES ContinuedOur defined benefit pension plan liabilities are valued using a discount rate based on a yield curve developed from a portfolio of high quality corporate bonds rated AA or better whose maturities are aligned with the expected benefit payments of our plans.

S. pension plan assets is to generate long-term investment returns consistent with capital preservation and prudent investment practices, with a diversification of asset types and investment strategies. Periodic adjustments are made to provide liquidity for benefit payments and to rebalance plan assets to their target allocations.The target allocations for U.S. plan assets at March31, 2014and 2013 are 50%equity investments, 45%fixed income investments including cash and cash equivalents and 5%real estate. Equity investments include common stock, preferred stock, and equity commingled funds. Fixed income investments include corporate bonds, government securities, mortgage-backed securities, asset-backed securities, other directly held fixed income investments, and fixed income commingled funds. The real estate investment is in a commingled real estate fund. For both our and Celesios plan assets outside of the U.S., the investment strategies are subject to local regulations and the asset/liability profiles of the plans in each individual country. Plan assets of the non-U.S. plans are broadly invested in a manner appropriate to the nature and duration of the expected future retirement benefits payable under the plans. Plan assets are primarily invested in high-quality corporate and government bond funds and equity securities. Assets are properly diversified to avoid excessive reliance on any particular asset, issuer or group of undertakings so as to avoid accumulations of risk in the portfolio as a whole.We develop the expected long-term rate of return assumption based on the projected performance of the asset classes in which plan assets are invested. The target asset allocation was determined based on the liability and risk tolerance characteristics of the plans and at times may be adjusted to achieve overall investment objectives93Table of ContentsMcKESSON CORPORATIONFINANCIAL NOTES ContinuedFair Value Measurements: The following tables represent our pension plan assets as of March31, 2014and 2013, using the fair value hierarchy by asset class. The fair value hierarchy has three levels based on the reliability of the inputs used to determine fair value. Level 1 refers to fair values determined based on unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets. Level2 refers to fair values estimated using significant other observable inputs and Level 3 includes fair values estimated using significant unobservable inputs.

Cash and cash equivalents - Cash and cash equivalents include short-term investment funds that maintain daily liquidity and aim to have constant unit values of $100. The funds invest in short-term fixed income securities and other securities with debt-like characteristics emphasizing short-term maturities and high credit quality. Directly held cash and cash equivalents are classified as Level 1 investments. Cash and cash equivalents include money market funds and other commingled funds, which have daily net asset values derived from the underlying securities; these are classified as Level 1 or Level 2 investments.Common and preferred stock - This investment class consists of common and preferred shares issued by U.S. and non-U.S. corporations. Common shares are traded actively on exchanges and price quotes are readily available. Preferred shares may not be actively traded. Holdings of common shares are generally classified as Level 1 investments. Preferred shares are classified as Level 2 investments.Equity commingled funds - Some equity investments are held in commingled funds, which have daily net asset values derived from quoted prices for the underlying securities in active markets; these are classified as Level 1 or Level 2 investments.Fixed income securities - Government securities consist of bonds and debentures issued by central governments or federal agencies; corporate bonds consist of bonds and debentures issued by corporations; mortgage-backed securities consist of debt obligations secured by a mortgage or pool of mortgages; and asset-backed securities primarily consist of debt obligations secured by an asset or pool of assets other than mortgages. Inputs to the valuation methodology include quoted prices for similar assets in active markets, and inputs that are observable for the asset, either directly or indirectly, for substantially the full term of the asset. Multiple prices and price types are obtained from pricing vendors whenever possible, enabling cross-provider price validations. Fixed income securities are generally classified as Level 1 or Level 2 investments.Fixed income commingled funds - Some fixed income investments are held in commingled funds, which have daily net asset values derived from the underlying securities; these are classified as Level 2 investments. 95Table of ContentsMcKESSON CORPORATIONFINANCIAL NOTES ContinuedReal estate funds - The value of the real estate funds is reported by the fund manager and is based on a valuation of the underlying properties. Inputs used in the valuation include items such as cost, discounted future cash flows, independent appraisals and market based comparable data. The real estate funds are classified as Level 2 and Level 3 investments.Other commingled funds - The other commingled funds are invested in equities, bonds, commodities, other alternative investments and cash and cash equivalents. These funds are valued based on the weekly net asset values derived from the quoted prices for the underlying securities in active markets and, for alternative investments, based on other valuation techniques. Other commingled funds are classified as Level 1 or Level 2 investments.Other - At March 31, 2014, this includes $46 millionof plan asset value relating to the Norwegian Public Service Pension Fund SPK. In principle, the SPK is organized as a pay-as-you-go system guaranteed by the Norwegian government as it holds no Company-owned assets to back the pension liabilities. The Company pays a pension premium used to fund the plan, which is paid directly to the Norwegian government and is accounted for as governmental income in the annual budget for Norway. To be able to report back plan asset values for the participating employers, SPK has established an annual account for each participating employer to keep track of the financial status of the plan, including managing the contributions and the payments. Further, the investment return credited to this account is determined annually by the SPK based on the performance of long-term government bonds.The following table represents a reconciliation of Level 3 plan assets held during the years ended March31, 2014and 2013:U.S. PlansNon-U.S. PlansIn millionsReal  at March 31, 2012$12$$12$5$$5Unrealized gain on plan assets still held11Purchases, sales and settlements11Balance at March 31,  gain on plan assets still held2211Purchases, sales and settlementsBalance at March 31,  PlansThe Company contributes to a number of multiemployer pension plans under the terms of collective-bargaining agreements that cover union-represented employees in the U.S. In 2014, as a result of our acquisition of Celesio, we also contribute to the Pensjonsordningen for Apoteketaten POA, a mandatory multiemployer pension scheme for our Pharmacy employees in Norway, managed by the association of Norwegian Pharmacies. The risks of participating in these multiemployer plans are different from single-employer pension plans in the following aspects: iassets contributed to the multiemployer plan by one employer may be used to provide benefits to employees of other participating employers; iiif a participating employer stops contributing to the plan, the unfunded obligations of the plan may be borne by the remaining participating employers; and iiiif the Company chooses to stop participating in some of its multiemployer plans, the Company may be required to pay those plans an amount based on the underfunded status of the plan, referred to as a withdrawal liability. Actions taken by other participating employers may lead to adverse changes in the financial condition of a multiemployer benefit plan and our withdrawal liability and contributions may increase. 96Table of ContentsMcKESSON CORPORATIONFINANCIAL NOTES ContinuedContributions and amounts accrued for U.S. Plans were not material for the years ended March31, 2014, 2013, and 2012.  Celesios contributions to the POA exceeding 5%of total plan contributions were $5 millionsince our acquisition of Celesio in February 2014. Based on actuarial calculations, we estimate Celesios funded status to be less than 65%as of March 31, 2014. Noamounts were accrued for liability associated with the POA as Celesio has no intention to withdraw from the plan.Defined Contribution PlansWe have a contributory profit sharing investment plan PSIP for U.S. employees not covered by collective bargaining agreements. Eligible employees may contribute to the PSIP up to 75%of their eligible compensation on a pre-tax basis not to exceed IRS limits. The Company makes matching contributions in an amount equal to 100%of the employees first 3%of pay contributed and 50%for the next 2%of pay contributed. The Company also may make an additional annual matching contribution for each plan year to enable participants to receive a full match based on their annual contribution. Contribution expenses for the PSIP were $71million, $61million and $58million for the years ended March31, 2014, 2013, and 2012. 17.Postretirement Benefits We maintain a number of postretirement benefits, primarily consisting of healthcare and life insurance welfare benefits, for certain eligible U.S. employees. Eligible employees consist of those who retired before March 31, 1999 and those who retired after March 31, 1999, but were an active employee as of that date, after meeting other age-related criteria. We also provide postretirement benefits for certain U.S. executives. Defined benefit plan obligations are measured as of the Companys fiscal year-end.The net periodic expense for our postretirement welfare benefits is as follows:Years Ended March 31, In millions201420132012Service cost - benefits earned during the year$2$2$2Interest cost on accumulated benefit obligation567Amortization of unrecognized actuarial gain and prior service credit121Curtailment gain2Net periodic postretirement expense$4$6$8Information regarding the changes in benefit obligations for our postretirement welfare plans is as follows: Years Ended March 31, In millions20142013Benefit obligation at beginning of period$131$144Service cost22Interest cost56Actuarial gain29Benefit payments1512Curtailment gain2Benefit obligation at end of period$119$131The components of the amount recognized in accumulated other comprehensive income for the Companys other postretirement benefits at March31, 2014and 2013were net actuarial gains of $8million and $6million and net prior service credits of $1million and $1million. Other changes in benefit obligations recognized in other comprehensive income were net actuarial gains of $2million, $7million and $3million in 2014, 2013and 201297Table of ContentsMcKESSON CORPORATIONFINANCIAL NOTES ContinuedWe estimate that the amortization of the actuarial gain from stockholders equity to other postretirement expense in 2015will be $4million. Comparable 2014amount was $1million.Other postretirement benefits are funded as claims are paid. Expected benefit payments for our postretirement welfare benefit plans are as follows: $10million annually for 2015to 2019and $45million cumulatively for 2020through 2024. Expected benefit payments are based on the same assumptions used to measure the benefit obligations and include estimated future employee service. Expected contributions to be made for our postretirement welfare benefit plans are $11million for 2015.Weighted-average discount rates used to estimate postretirement welfare benefit expenses were 384%, 444%and 509%for 2014, 2013and 2012. Weighted-average discount rates for the actuarial present value of benefit obligations were 408%, 384%and 444%for 2014, 2013and 2012.Actuarial gain or loss for the postretirement welfare benefit plan is amortized to income or expense over a three-year period. The assumed healthcare cost trends used in measuring the accumulated postretirement benefit obligation were 700%and 750%for prescription drugs, 750/700%and 750/725%for ages pre-65/post-65 medical and 500%and 525%for dental in 2014and 2013. For 2014, 2013and 2012, a one-percentage-point increase or decrease in the assumed healthcare cost trend rate would not have a material impact on the postretirement benefit obligations.Pursuant to various collective bargaining agreements, we contribute to multiemployer health and welfare plans that cover union-represented employees. Our liability is limited to the contractual dollar obligations set forth by the collective bargaining agreements. Contributions to the plans and amounts accrued were not material for the years ended March 31, 2014, 2013, and 201218.Hedging ActivitiesIn the normal course of business, we are exposed to interest rate changes and foreign currency fluctuations. At times we limit these risks through the use of derivatives such as interest rate swaps and forward foreign exchange contracts. In accordance with our policy, derivatives are only used for hedging purposes. We do not use derivatives for trading or speculative purposes. Foreign currency rate riskPrior to the acquisition of Celesio, the majority of our operations were conducted in U. S. dollars; however, certain assets and liabilities, revenues and expense and purchasing activities were incurred in and exposed to other currencies. We have established certain foreign currency rate risk programs that manage the impact of foreign currency fluctuation. These programs are utilized on a transactional basis when we consider there to be a risk in fair value or volatility in cash flows. These programs reduce but do not entirely eliminate foreign currency rate risk. Over the last three years, we have entered into forward contracts and a foreign currency option to hedge against cash flows denominated primarily in Canadian dollars and British pounds. At March 31, 2014, forward contracts having a total notional value of $463 millionwere designated for hedge accounting. These contracts will mature between March 2015 and March 2020. Changes in the fair valuesfor contracts designated for hedge accounting were recorded to accumulated other comprehensive income and reclassified into earnings in the same period in which the hedged transaction affects earnings; amounts recorded to earnings for these contracts were not material in 2014, 2013 and 2012. Changes in the fair values for contracts not designated for hedge accounting were recorded directly to earnings; amounts recorded to earnings for these contracts were not material in 2014, 2013 and 2012. Celesio has a number of forward contracts to hedge against cash flows denominated primarily in British pounds and other European currencies. The contracts will mature from April 1, 2014 to January 2015. None of these contracts were designated for hedge accounting and accordingly, changes in the fair value of these contracts are recorded directly in earnings. At March 31, 2014, the total notional values of these contracts was $1,091 million. Amounts recorded to earnings were not material for 2014. 98Table of ContentsMcKESSON CORPORATIONFINANCIAL NOTES ContinuedInterest rate riskCelesio also has interest rate swaps to hedge the interest rate risk associated with Celesios variable rate debt. Interest rate swaps are used to modify the market risk exposures in connection with the variable rate debt to achieve primarily Euro dollar fixed rate interest expense. The interest rate swap transactions generally involve the exchange of floating or fixed interest payments and have a gross notional of $96 millionat March 31, 2014. The interest rate swaps will mature during the first half of 2015. These contracts are not designated for hedge accounting and, accordingly, changes in the fair value of the swaps were recorded directly in earnings. Amounts recorded to earnings were not material for 2014.

Fair Value MeasurementsFair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. The analysis of fair value is conducted by our accounting and finance personnel who organizationally report to the Chief Financial Officer. There is a three-level hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs used in determining fair value by their reliability and preferred use, as follows:Level 1 - Valuations based on quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.Level 2 - Valuations based on quoted prices in active markets for similar assets and liabilities, quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in inactive markets, or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data.Level 3 - Valuations based on inputs that are both significant to the fair value measurement and unobservable. At March31, 2014and 2013, the carrying amounts of cash, certain cash equivalents, restricted cash, receivables, drafts and accounts payable, short-term borrowings, promissory notes and other current liabilities approximated their estimated fair values because of the short maturity of these financial instruments. Our long-term debt and other financing arrangements are carried at amortized cost. The carrying amounts and estimated fair values of these liabilities were $104billion and $108billion at March31, 2014and $49billion and $55billion at March31, 2013. The estimated fair values of our long-term debt and other financing were determined using quoted market prices in a less active market and other observable inputs from available market information, which are considered to be Level 2 inputs, and may not be representative of actual values that could have been realized or that will be realized in the future.Assets Measured at Fair Value on a Recurring BasisOur financial assets measured at fair value on a recurring basis consist of the following:March31, 2014March31, 2013In millionsLevel 1Level 2Level 3TotalLevel 1Level 2Level 3TotalCash EquivalentsMoney market funds  deposits 212129595Repurchase agreements 2569569447447Total cash  Gross unrealized gain and losses were not material for the years ended March 31, 2014and 2013. Based on quoted prices of identical investments2 The carrying amounts of these cash equivalents approximated their estimated fair values because of their short maturities.Fair values of our marketable securities were determined using quoted prices in active markets for identical assets, which are considered Level 1 inputs under the fair value measurements and disclosure guidance. Fair values for our marketable securities were not material at March 31, 2014 and 2013.Fair values of our forward foreign currency derivatives were determined using quoted market prices of similar instruments in an active market and other observable inputs from available market information. These inputs are considered Level 2 under the fair value measurements and disclosure guidance, and may not be representative of actual values that could have been realized or that will be realized in the future. Refer to Financial Note 18, Hedging Activities, for more information on our forward foreign currency derivatives.There were no transfers between Level 1, Level 2 or Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy during the years ended March 31, 2014and 2013. 100Table of ContentsMcKESSON CORPORATIONFINANCIAL NOTES ContinuedAssets Measured at Fair Value on a Nonrecurring BasisWe measure certain long-lived assets at fair value on a nonrecurring basis when they are deemed to be other-than-temporarily impaired. If the cost of an investment exceeds its fair value, we evaluate, among other factors, our intent to hold the investment, general market conditions, the duration and extent to which the fair value is less than cost and the financial outlook for the industry and location. An impairment charge is recorded when the cost of the asset exceeds its fair value and this condition is determined to be other-than-temporary. Fiscal 2014Impairment of Our International Technology Business:As discussed in Financial Note 3, Discontinued Operations, during 2014 we recorded an $80 millionnon-cash pre-tax and after-tax impairment charge to reduce the carrying value of our International Technology business to its estimated fair value, less costs to sell. The impairment charge was primarily the result of the terms of the preliminary purchase offers received for this business during 2014. Accordingly, the fair value measurement is classified as Level 3 in the fair value hierarchy. Fiscal 2013For the year ended March 31, 2013, assets measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis consisted of our investment in Nadro and goodwill for a reporting unit within our Technology Solutions segment. Both of these assets were measured using Level 3 inputs.Impairment of an Equity Investment:As discussed in Financial Note 5, Impairment and Sale of an Equity Investment, during 2013 we committed to a plan to sell our investment in Nadro and in the fourth quarter of 2013 recorded an impairment charge of $191million to reduce the carrying value to fair value. Fair value of our investment in Nadro was determined using income and market valuation approaches. Under the income approach, we used a discounted cash flow DCF analysis based on estimated future results. This valuation approach is considered a Level 3 fair value measurement due to the use of significant unobservable inputs related to the timing and amount of future cash flows based on projections of revenues and operating costs and discounting those cash flows to their present value. The key inputs and assumptions of the DCF method are the projected cash flows, the terminal value of the business and the discount rate. The key inputs for the market valuation approach were Nadros fiscal 2012 unaudited earnings before interest, depreciation and amortization EBITDA and an EBITDA multiple based on similar guideline U.S. pharmaceutical companies whose securities are actively traded in public markets. This valuation approach is considered a Level 3 fair value measurement. Finally, we evaluated the fair values under both valuation methods and concluded on an average of the two methods. In September 2013, we completed the sale of our 49%interest in Nadro which resulted in nomaterial gain or loss.Goodwill:As discussed in Financial Note 4, Asset Impairments and Product Alignment Charges, in 2013 we recorded a goodwill impairment charge of $36million in one of Technology Solutions segments reporting units. The impairment charge was primarily the result of a significant decrease in estimated revenues for a software product. As required under step two goodwill impairment testing, we determined the fair value of the reporting unit and the fair value of the reporting units net assets, excluding goodwill but including any unrecognized intangible assets. The implied fair value of goodwill was then calculated on a residual basis that is, by subtracting the sum of the fair value of the net assets from the fair value of the reporting unit. The impairment was equal to the carrying amount of goodwill. Fair value assessment of the reporting unit as well as the reporting units net assets are considered a Level 3 measurement due to the significance of unobservable inputs developed using company specific information. We used the market approach and income approach DCF model to determine the fair value of the reporting unit and a DCF model to determine the fair value of the reporting units most significant assets intangibles. Additionally, fair values reflect a risk premium to the discount rate due to the uncertainty in forecasting future cash flows. 101Table of ContentsMcKESSON CORPORATIONFINANCIAL NOTES Continued20.Lease ObligationsWe lease facilities and equipment almost solely under operating leases. At March31, 2014, future minimum lease payments required under operating leases that have initial or remaining noncancelable lease terms in excess of one year for years ending March 31 are:In  minimum lease payments 1$2,0701Minimum lease payments have not been reduced by minimum sublease rentals of $44million due under future noncancelable subleases. Rental expense under operating leases was $298million, $232million and $229million in 2014, 2013and 2012. We recognize rent expense on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease, taking into account, when applicable, lessor incentives for tenant improvements, periods where no rent payment is required and escalations in rent payments over the term of the lease. Deferred rent is recognized for the difference between the rent expense recognized on a straight-line basis and the payments made per the terms of the lease. Remaining terms for facilities leases generally range from oneto twelveyears, while remaining terms for equipment leases range from oneto fiveyears. Most real property leases contain renewal options generally for five-year increments and provisions requiring us to pay property taxes and operating expenses in excess of base period amounts. Sublease rental income was not material for 2014, 2013and 2012. 21.Financial Guarantees and WarrantiesFinancial GuaranteesWe have agreements with certain of our customers financial institutions, mainly in Canada and Europe, under which we have guaranteed the repurchase of our customers inventory or our customers debt in the event these customers are unable to meet their obligations to those financial institutions. For our inventory repurchase agreements, among other requirements, inventories must be in resalable condition and any repurchase would be at a discount. The inventory repurchase agreements mostly relate to certain Canadian customers and range from oneto twoyears. Customers debt guarantees range from oneto fifteenyears and are primarily provided to facilitate financing for certain customers. The majority of our customers debt guarantees are secured by certain assets of the customer. At March31, 2014, the maximum amounts of inventory repurchase guarantees and customers debt guarantees were $204million and $272million, of which $4 millionhad been accrued. The expirations of these financial guarantees are as follows: $154million, $31million, $17million, $21million and $37 millionfrom 2015through 2019and $216million thereafter.At March31, 2014, our banks and insurance companies have issued $161million of standby letters of credit and surety bonds, which were issued on our behalf mostly related to our customer contracts and in order to meet the security requirements for statutory licenses and permits, court and fiduciary obligations and our workers compensation and automotive liability programs. Additionally, at March 31, 2014, we have a commitment to contribute up to $40million to a non-consolidated investment for building and equipment construction. Our software license agreements generally include certain provisions for indemnifying customers against liabilities if our software products infringe a third partys intellectual property rights. To date, we have not incurred any material costs as a result of such indemnification agreements and have not accrued any liabilities related to such obligations102Table of ContentsMcKESSON CORPORATIONFINANCIAL NOTES ContinuedIn conjunction with certain transactions, primarily divestitures, we may provide routine indemnification agreements such as retention of previously existing environmental, tax and employee liabilities whose terms vary in duration and often are not explicitly defined. Where appropriate, obligations for such indemnifications are recorded as liabilities. Because the amounts of these indemnification obligations often are not explicitly stated, the overall maximum amount of these commitments cannot be reasonably estimated. Other than obligations recorded as liabilities at the time of divestiture, we have historically not made material payments as a result of these indemnification provisions.WarrantiesIn the normal course of business, we provide certain warranties and indemnification protection for our products and services. For example, we provide warranties that the pharmaceutical and medical-surgical products we distribute are in compliance with the U.S. Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act and other applicable laws and regulations. We have received the same warranties from our suppliers, which customarily are the manufacturers of the products. In addition, we have indemnity obligations to our customers for these products, which have also been provided to us from our suppliers, either through express agreement or by operation of law.We also provide warranties regarding the performance of software and products we sell. Our liability under these warranties is to bring the product into compliance with previously agreed upon specifications. For software products, this may result in additional project costs, which are reflected in our estimates used for the percentage-of-completion method of accounting for software installation services within these contracts. In addition, most of our customers who purchase our software and automation products also purchase annual maintenance agreements. Revenues from these maintenance agreements are recognized on a straight-line basis over the contract period and the cost of servicing product warranties is charged to expense when claims become estimable. Accrued warranty costs were not material to the consolidated balance sheets22.Other Commitments and Contingent LiabilitiesIn addition to commitments and obligations in the ordinary course of business, we are subject to various claims, other pending and potential legal actions for damages, investigations relating to governmental laws and regulations and other matters arising out of the normal conduct of our business. As described below, many of these proceedings are at preliminary stages and many seek an indeterminate amount of damages.When a loss is considered probable and reasonably estimable, we record a liability in the amount of our best estimate for the ultimate loss. However, the likelihood of a loss with respect to a particular contingency is often difficult to predict and determining a meaningful estimate of the loss or a range of loss may not be practicable based on the information available and the potential effect of future events and decisions by third parties that will determine the ultimate resolution of the contingency. Moreover, it is not uncommon for such matters to be resolved over many years, during which time relevant developments and new information must be reevaluated at least quarterly to determine both the likelihood of potential loss and whether it is possible to reasonably estimate a range of possible loss. When a loss is probable but a reasonable estimate cannot be made, disclosure of the proceeding is provided. Disclosure also is provided when it is reasonably possible that a loss will be incurred or when it is reasonably possible that the amount of a loss will exceed the recorded provision. We review all contingencies at least quarterly to determine whether the likelihood of loss has changed and to assess whether a reasonable estimate of the loss or range of loss can be made. As discussed above, development of a meaningful estimate of loss or a range of potential loss is complex when the outcome is directly dependent on negotiations with or decisions by third parties, such as regulatory agencies, the court system and other interested parties. Such factors bear directly on whether it is possible to reasonably estimate a range of potential loss and boundaries of high and low estimates.We are party to the legal proceedings described below. Unless otherwise stated, we are currently unable to estimate a range of reasonably possible losses for the unresolved proceedings described below. Should any one or a combination of more than one of these proceedings be successful, or should we determine to settle any or a combination of these matters, we may be required to pay substantial sums, become subject to the entry of an injunction or be forced to change the manner in which we operate our business, which could have a material adverse impact on our financial position or results of operations. 103Table of ContentsMcKESSON CORPORATIONFINANCIAL NOTES ContinuedI. Litigation and ClaimsOn April 16, 2013, the Companys wholly-owned subsidiary, U.S. Oncology, Inc. USON, was served with a third amended qui tamcomplaint filed in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of New York by tworelators, purportedly on behalf of the United States, twenty-onestates and the District of Columbia, against USON and fiveother defendants, alleging that USON solicited and received illegal kickbacks from Amgen in violation of the Anti-Kickback Statute, the False Claims Act, and various state false claims statutes, and seeking damages, treble damages, civil penalties, attorneys fees and costs of suit, all in unspecified amounts, United States ex rel. Piacentile v. Amgen Inc., et al., CV 04-3983 SJ. Previously, the United States declined to intervene in the case as to all allegations and defendants except for Amgen. On February 5, 2013, the United States filed a motion to dismiss the claims pled against Amgen. On September 30, 2013, the court granted the United States motion to dismiss. On April 4, 2014, USON filed a motion to dismiss the claims pled against it. The court has not yet ruled on USONs motion.II. Average Wholesale Price AWP LitigationOn May 1, 2013, an action was filed in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California by several Ohio health benefit programs against the Company asserting claims under the federal and Ohio RICO statutes, and seeking damages, treble damages, attorneys fees, and costs of suit, all in unspecified amounts, based on the same allegations as the Companys previously disclosed AWP litigation, Ohio v. McKesson Corporation, et al., CV-13-2000-SI. The plaintiffs allege that in late 2001, the Company and First DataBank, Inc., a publisher of pharmaceutical pricing information, conspired to improperly raise the published AWP for certain prescription drugs, and that this alleged conduct resulted in higher drug reimbursement payments. On July 12, 2013, the parties filed a stipulation dismissing with prejudice the claims asserted against the Company under the Ohio RICO statutes. On February 28, 2014, the Company entered into a settlement agreement with the plaintiffs. On March 12, 2014, pursuant to a stipulation between the parties and the terms of the parties settlement agreement, the court entered an order dismissing this action with prejudice. The Company has a reserve relating to AWP public entity claims, which is reviewed at least quarterly and whenever events or circumstances indicate changes, including consideration of the pace and progress of discussions relating to potentially resolving other public entity claims. Pre-tax charges relating to changes in the Companys AWP litigation reserve, including accrued interest, are recorded in the Distribution Solutions segment. The Companys AWP litigation reserve is included in other current liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets. The following is the activity related to the AWP litigation reserve for the years ended March31, 2014, 2013and 2012:Years Ended March 31, In millions201420132012AWP litigation reserve at beginning of period$42$453$330Charges incurred6872149Payments made10548326AWP litigation reserve at end of period$5$42$453The charges for 2014 and 2013 primarily related to state Medicaid and other claims. The charges for 2012 primarily related to the Douglas County, Kansas Action settlement and the state and federal Medicaid claims. 104Table of ContentsMcKESSON CORPORATIONFINANCIAL NOTES ContinuedIII.Government Subpoenas and Investigations From time-to-time, the Company receives subpoenas or requests for information from various government agencies. The Company generally responds to such subpoenas and requests in a cooperative, thorough and timely manner. These responses sometimes require time and effort and can result in considerable costs being incurred by the Company. Such subpoenas and requests also can lead to the assertion of claims or the commencement of civil or criminal legal proceedings against the Company and other members of the health care industry, as well as to settlements. Examples of such subpoenas and investigations include subpoenas commencing in 2013 from the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration to certain of the Companys pharmaceutical distribution facilities seeking information and records about the Companys distribution of certain controlled substances. The Company is currently responding to these requests. In addition, in the third quarter 2013, the Company was informed of an investigation by the United States Department of Justice through the United States Attorneys Office for the Middle District of Tennessee. The Company believes that the investigation is focused on distribution procedures with respect to the Vaccine for Childrens Program administered by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. In connection with the investigation, the Company has received and has responded to a subpoena seeking information and records from the Companys Specialty Health business. In the third quarter of 2014, the Company was informed of an investigation by the United States Department of Justice through the United States Attorneys Office for the Northern District of West Virginia of potential claims under the Comprehensive Drug Abuse Prevention and Control Act. The Company believes that the investigation is focused on the Companys pharmaceutical distribution of certain controlled substances by its Landover, Maryland distribution center, which closed in 2012. In addition, in the fourth quarter 2014, the Company was informed of an investigation by the United States Department of Justice through the United States Attorneys Office for the Eastern District of Tennessee. The Company believes that the investigation is focused on billing and coding services performed by our Technology business. The Company is in the process of providing requested documents.IV.Environmental Matters Primarily as a result of the operation of the Companys former chemical businesses, which were fully divested by 1987, the Company is involved in various matters pursuant to environmental laws and regulations. The Company has received claims and demands from governmental agencies relating to investigative and remedial actions purportedly required to address environmental conditions alleged to exist at eightsites where it, or entities acquired by it, formerly conducted operations and the Company, by administrative order or otherwise, has agreed to take certain actions at those sites, including soil and groundwater remediation. In addition, the Company is one of multiple recipients of a New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection Agency directive and a separate United States Environmental Protection Agency directive relating to potential natural resources damages NRD associated with one of these eightsites. Although the Companys potential allocation under either directive cannot be determined at this time, it has agreed to participate with a potentially responsible party PRP group in the funding of certain tasks to support an NRD assessment, the costs of which are reflected in the aggregate estimates set forth below. Based on a determination by the Companys environmental staff, in consultation with outside environmental specialists and counsel, the current estimate of the Companys probable loss associated with the remediation costs for these eightsites is $7million, net of approximately $1million that third parties have agreed to pay in settlement or is expected, based either on agreements or nonrefundable contributions which are ongoing, to be contributed by third parties. The $7million is expected to be paid out between May2014and March2034. The Companys estimated probable loss for these environmental matters has been entirely accrued for in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. In addition, the Company has been designated as a PRP under the Superfund law for environmental assessment and cleanup costs as the result of its alleged disposal of hazardous substances at 14sites. With respect to these sites, numerous other PRPs have similarly been designated and while the current state of the law potentially imposes joint and several liability upon PRPs, as a practical matter, costs of these sites are typically shared with other PRPs. At one of these sites, the United States Environmental Protection Agency has selected a preferred remedy with an estimated cost of approximately $70million. It is not certain at this point in time what proportion of this estimated liability will be borne by the Company or by the other PRPs. Accordingly, the Companys estimated probable loss at those 14sites is approximately $20million, which has been entirely accrued for in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. However, it is possible that the ultimate costs of these matters may exceed or be less than the reserves.  105Table of ContentsMcKESSON CORPORATIONFINANCIAL NOTES ContinuedV. Other Matters The Company is involved in various other litigation and governmental proceedings, not described above, that arise in the normal course of business. While it is not possible to determine the ultimate outcome or the duration of any such litigation or governmental proceedings, the Company believes, based on current knowledge and the advice of counsel, that such litigation and proceedings will not have a material impact on the Companys financial position or results of operations23.Stockholders EquityEach share of the Companys outstanding common stock is permitted one vote on proposals presented to stockholders and is entitled to share equally in any dividends declared by the Companys Board of Directors the Board. In July 2013, the quarterly dividend was raised from $020to $024per common share for dividends declared after such date, until further action by the Board. Dividends were $092per share in 2014and $080per share in 2013and 2012. The Company anticipates that it will continue to pay quarterly cash dividends in the future. However, the payment and amount of future dividends remain within the discretion of the Board and will depend upon the Companys future earnings, financial condition, capital requirements and other factors.Share Repurchase PlansStock repurchases may be made from time-to-time in open market transactions, privately negotiated transactions, through accelerated share repurchase ASR programs, or by any combination of such methods. The timing of any repurchases and the actual number of shares repurchased will depend on a variety of factors, including our stock price, corporate and regulatory requirements, restrictions under our debt obligations and other market and economic conditions.Information regarding the share repurchase activity over the last three years is as follows:Share Repurchases 1In millions, except price per share dataTotal Number of Shares Purchased 2 3Average Price Paid Per ShareApproximate Dollar Value of Shares that May Yet Be Purchased Under the ProgramsBalance, March 31, 2011$499Share repurchase plans approved:April 20111,000January 2012650Shares  March 31, 2012$299Share repurchase plans approved:April 2012700January 2013500Shares  March 31, 2013$340Shares repurchased$Balance, March 31, 2014$3401This table does not include shares tendered to satisfy the exercise price in connection with cashless exercises of employee stock options or shares tendered to satisfy tax withholding obligations in connection with employee equity awards. 2All of the shares purchased were part of the publicly announced programs. 3The number of shares purchased reflects rounding adjustments106Table of ContentsMcKESSON CORPORATIONFINANCIAL NOTES ContinuedDuring the fourth quarter of 2013, we retired approximately 2million shares repurchased for $217million by the Company. The retired shares constitute authorized but unissued shares. We elected to allocate any excess of share repurchase price over par value between additional paid-in capital and retained earnings. As such, $195million was recorded as a decrease to retained earnings.Other Comprehensive Income LossInformation regarding other comprehensive income loss including noncontrolling interest, net of tax by component are as follows:Years Ended March 31, In millions201420132012Foreign currency translation adjustmentsForeign currency translation adjustments arising during period, net of income tax expense benefit of nil, $2 and $2 1$9$52$56Reclassified to income statement, net of income tax expense of $24, nil and nil 244535256Unrealized losses on cash flow hedgesUnrealized losses on cash flow hedges arising during period, net of income tax benefit of nil, nil and nil65Changes in retirement-related benefit plansNet actuarial gain loss and prior service credit cost arising during period, net of income tax benefit of $16, $22 and $18174038Amortization of actuarial loss, prior service cost and transition obligation, net of income tax expense of $12, $12 and $9 3221817Foreign currency translation adjustments, net of income tax expense of nil, nil and nil44Reclassified to income statement, net of income tax expense of $1, nil and nil1361821Other Comprehensive Income Loss, net of tax$83$70$821The 2014 amounts include net foreign currency translation gain of $21 millionattributable to noncontrolling interests2As a result of our sale of our 49%equity interest in Nadro, foreign currency translation net losses of $44million were reclassified from AOCI to other income, within our consolidated statement of operations. Such losses were previously considered in our impairment evaluation of the investment when we committed to a plan to sell the investment during the fourth quarter of 2013, and accordingly did not impact earnings for 2014.  3Pre-tax amount was reclassified into cost of sales and operating expenses in the consolidated statements of operations.

As a result, there was noannual rental expense paid in 2014 and 2013. We incurred $10million in 2012 of annual rental expense paid to this equity-held investment25.Segments of BusinessWe report our operations in two operating segments: McKesson Distribution Solutions and McKesson Technology Solutions. The factors for determining the reportable segments included the manner in which management evaluates the performance of the Company combined with the nature of the individual business activities. We evaluate the performance of our operating segments on a number of measures, including operating profit before interest expense, income taxes and results from discontinued operations. The McKesson Distribution Solutions segment distributes ethical and proprietary drugs and equipment and health and beauty care products throughout North America and internationally. This segment includes our International pharmaceutical distribution and services business which reflects the results of operations from our acquisition of Celesio in February 2014. This segment also provides specialty pharmaceutical solutions for biotech and pharmaceutical manufacturers, and practice management, technology, clinical support and business solutions to oncology and other specialty practices operating in the community setting. This segment also provides medical-surgical supply distribution, equipment, logistics and other services to healthcare providers through a network of distribution centers within the U.S. In addition, this segment sells financial, operational and clinical solutions for pharmacies retail, hospital, alternate site and provides consulting, outsourcing and other services. In September 2013, we sold our 49%interest in Nadro, S.A. de C.V. Nadro, a pharmaceutical distributor in Mexico. Prior to the sale, financial results for Nadro were included in this segment. The McKesson Technology Solutions segment includes McKesson Health Solutions, which includes our InterQual clinical criteria solution, claims payment solutions and network performance tools. This segment also delivers enterprise-wide clinical, patient care, financial, supply chain, strategic management software solutions, as well as connectivity, outsourcing and other services, including remote hosting and managed services, to healthcare organizations. This segments customers include hospitals, physicians, homecare providers, retail pharmacies and payers primarily from North America.Corporate includes expenses associated with Corporate functions and projects and the results of certain equity investments. Corporate expenses are allocated to the operating segments to the extent that these items can be directly attributable to the segment. 108Table of ContentsMcKESSON CORPORATIONFINANCIAL NOTES ContinuedFinancial information relating to our reportable operating segments and reconciliations to the consolidated totals is as follows:Years Ended March 31,In  Solutions 1North America pharmaceutical distribution and  pharmaceutical distribution and services4,848Medical-Surgical distribution services5,6483,6033,145Total Distribution  Solutions - products and services3,1833,0232,897Total  profitDistribution   Expenses, Net449335413Interest expense303240251Income From Continuing Operations Before Income  and amortization 2Distribution   for long-lived assets3Distribution   net by geographic area 4United  derived from services represent less than 2%of this segments total revenues. 2Amounts primarily include amortization of acquired intangible assets purchased in connection with acquisitions, capitalized software held for sale and capitalized software for internal use. 3Long-lived assets consist of property, plant and equipment4Net revenues were attributed to geographic areas based on the customers shipment locations. 109Table of ContentsMcKESSON CORPORATIONFINANCIAL NOTES ContinuedSegment assets and property, plant and equipment, net by geographic areas were as follows:March 31,In millions20142013Segment assetsDistribution   and cash  plant and equipment, netUnited  of ContentsMcKESSON CORPORATIONFINANCIAL NOTES Continued26.Quarterly Financial Information UnauditedThe quarters results of operations are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected for the entire year.
