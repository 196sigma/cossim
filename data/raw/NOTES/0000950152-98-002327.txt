Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data -- Notes 1 and 10 to 
the Consolidated Financial Statements.
Operating income for 1997 was reduced by special charges of $1,421 for
severance compensation relating to re-engineering and $14,066 relating to 
the inn renewal program. Had such charges not been incurred, operating 
income for 1997, would have been $103,462 and operating income as a 
percentage of revenues would have been 295%. See Item 8. Financial 
Statements and Supplementary Data -- Note 10 to the Consolidated Financial 
Statements.
RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
1997 COMPARED TO 1996
The Company revenues are principally derived from room rentals. Revenues
increased $338 million, or 106%, from $3174 million in 1996 to $3512 million
in 1997. Fiscal year 1997 consisted of 53 weeks while 1996 consisted of 52
weeks. The extra week of revenue represented approximately $5 million of the
increase in revenues for 1997. REVPAR for Comparable Inns increased $34, or
10%, from $3338 in 1996 to $3372 in 1997. The revenue increase for the
Comparable Inns was primarily caused by an increase in ADR of $251, or 56 from $4498 in 1996 to $4749 in 1997. The average occupancy percentage for the
Comparable Inns decreased from 742% in 1996 to 710% in 1997. The Company
attributes the decline in occupancy and nominal REVPAR growth to the increased
supply of competitive hotel rooms, aggressive price increases early in the first
quarter, low occupancies due to the New Year holiday falling on a Wednesday,
and a significant reduction in demand for hotel rooms in the Atlanta and Texas
markets where approximately 10% of the Company properties are located. The
Company believes that the decrease in the Atlanta market is due to the high
demand generated in 1996 related to the Summer Olympic Games while the decrease
in the Texas market is due to an increase in room supply. Approximately $24
million
15
16
$1 million attributed to the extra week of the increase in revenues was
attributable to an increase in the operation of 31 Inns in Stabilization.
Management expects newly developed or acquired inns to initially operate below
historical company averages of occupancy and ADR and to experience an occupancy
stabilization period after construction or renovation.
Direct room expenses include salaries, wages, utilities, repairs and
maintenance, property taxes, advertising, room supplies and security. Direct
room expenses increased $42 per occupied room, or 20%, from $2146 in 1996 to
$2188 in 1997. The expenses increased primarily because of the addition of new
inns and generally higher salary and wage expenses that were partially offset by
the need for fewer repairs and maintenance expenditures as a result of the inn
renewal program. As a percentage of revenues, direct room expenses decreased
from 481% in 1996 to 459% in 1997. See Item 2. Properties.
Depreciation and amortization increased $61 million, or 216%, from $282
million in 1996 to $343 million in 1997. The increase primarily reflects
depreciation on inns opened in 1996 and 1997.
Corporate expenses include the cost of general management, training and field
supervision of inn managers, franchising, development, reservations and
administrative expenses. Corporate expenses increased $24 million or 84%, from
$289 million in 1996 to $313 million in 1997. The increase consists primarily
of expenses associated with the development of the Company franchising program
and an increase in incentive compensation. As a percentage of revenue, corporate
expenses were 91% and 89% in 1996 and 1997, respectively. Management expects
corporate expenses to remain at the current level and will partially fund
increased reservation expenses through the collection of franchise reservation
fees. The Company does not pay any post retirement benefits other than pension
benefits. In 1997, the Company terminated its defined benefit pension plan
subject to appropriate regulatory approvals. Earned benefits will be paid to
employees during 1998, at which time, a final settlement cost of approximately
$16 million will be paid by the Company. See Item 8. Financial Statements and
Supplementary Data -- Note 9 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.
Marketing expenses include the cost of media advertising and related production
costs, billboard expenses and expenses associated with the Company corporate
sales group. Marketing expenses increased $48 million, or 298%, from $161
million in 1996 to $209 million in 1997. The increase in marketing is
attributed to the Company expansion of the corporate sales group and to
increased media expenses related to additional advertising associated with the
Company first ever summer advertising campaign to further enhance the
Company brand awareness. As a percentage of revenue, marketing expenses were
51% and 59% in 1996 and 1997, respectively. Management expects on-going
marketing expenses to remain at or about the same percentage of revenue as in
1997 and will partially fund on-going marketing expenses through the collection
of franchise marketing fees.
In 1996, the Company recognized a special charge of $5 million relating to an
adjustment to recognize impairments of certain long-lived assets. Also, in the
fourth quarter of 1996, the Company commenced a chainwide renewal program to
refurbish approximately 85% of its inns which was substantially completed in the
fourth quarter of 1997. The Company recently decided to expand the program to
include the remaining 15% of the Company inns and replace all remaining
furniture that does not meet current decor standards. This program commenced in
the fourth quarter of 1997 and is expected to be completed in the second quarter
of 1998. The Company recognized special charges of $245 million of which $104
million $78 million related to early asset retirements was recognized during
the fourth quarter of 1996 and $141 million $24 million related to early
asset retirements was recognized during 1997. See Item 1.
Business -- Strategy, Item 2. Properties, Capital Resources and Liquidity
Capital Expenditures and Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary
Data -- Notes 1 and 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.
In the second half of 1997, the Company commissioned a task force to perform a
thorough examination of its Corporate structure and processes to increase
productivity and reduce costs in relation to its strategic growth plans. The
Company recognized a special charge of $14 million related to severance
expenses associated with the re-engineering program in the fourth quarter of
1997. See Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data -- Note 10 to the
Consolidated Financial Statements.
Had the special charges of $109 million in 1996 related to the inn renewal
program and the fixed asset impairments not been incurred, operating expenses
and operating income for 1996 would have been $2260 million and $915 million,
respectively. Had the special charges of $155 million in 1997 related to the
inn renewal program and severance compensation not been incurred, operating
expenses and operating income for 1997 would have been $2477 million and $1035
million, respectively.
16
17
Interest expense increased $44 million, or 105%, from $418 million in 1996 to
$462 million in 1997 because of increased borrowings under the Company $250
million Bank Credit Facility related to development, acquisitions and capital
expenditures associated with the inn renewal program. At January 3, 1998,
approximately $178 million of the Company debt bore interest at variable
rates. Over the near term, management anticipates future interest expense
increases due to continued borrowings under the Bank Credit Facility to fund the
Company development and acquisition program.
1996 COMPARED TO 1995
Revenues increased $260 million, or 89%, from $2914 million in 1995 to $3174
million in 1996. REVPAR for Comparable Inns increased $037, or 11%, from
$3301 for the 210 Comparable Inns in 1995 to $3338 for the 223 Comparable Inns
in 1996. The REVPAR increase for the Comparable Inns was primarily caused by an
increase in ADR of $227, or 53%, from $4271 in 1995 to $4498 in 1996 The
average occupancy percentage for the Comparable Inns decreased 31 percentage
points from 773% in 1995 to 742% in 1996. Management attributes the decrease
in average occupancy percentage primarily to market sensitivity to increases in
ADR. Approximately $183 million of the increase in revenues was caused by an
increase in the operations of 20 inns acquired and one inn developed through
1995 $165 million and six inns acquired and 11 inns developed in 1996 $18
million.
Direct room expenses increased $155 per occupied room, or 78%, from $1991 in
1995 to $2146 in 1996. The Company experienced operating expense increases for
payroll, primarily from higher labor rates; repairs and maintenance, because of
an increase in planned maintenance projects; security, because of heightened
customer awareness and concern and commissions on travel agent sales due to
increased travel agent bookings, primarily from the 1996 summer Olympics. The
expense increases were partially offset by higher telephone commissions income
from customers' long distance calls under a long distance commission program.
The overall occupancy decline in 1996 also contributed to the increase in direct
room expenses per occupied room. The increase was also caused, in part, by
operating additional inns acquired in 1994, 1995 and 1996, which generally
obtained occupancies below historical Company averages, resulting in a higher
average expense per occupied room. As a percentage of revenues, direct room
expenses increased from 473% in 1995 to 481% in 1996.
Depreciation and amortization increased $13 million, or 48%, from $269
million in 1995 to $282 million in 1996. The increase primarily reflects
depreciation on inns opened in 1995 and 1996. Included in 1995 is a provision
for approximately $10 million resulting from management decision to demolish
and rebuild, due to unstable soil conditions, one of the buildings, containing
55 rooms, at its Jackson, Mississippi inn.
Corporate expenses increased $42 million, or 170%, from $247 million in 1995
to $289 million in 1996. The increase consists primarily of increases in
payroll costs, relocation expenses and franchise taxes. Payroll increased as a
result of the Company incurring a full year expense in 1996 for positions
vacated during 1995 due to the change in management. In addition, the Company
incurred increases in staffing and relocation expenses related to the Company
development and franchise departments. Franchise taxes increased due to an
increase in equity as a result of the Offering. As a percentage of revenue,
corporate expenses were 85% and 91% in 1995 and 1996, respectively.
Marketing expenses decreased $12 million, or 69%, from $173 million in 1995
to $161 million in 1996. The decrease in marketing expense is attributed to
reduced media advertising partially offset by increased billboard advertising
associated with operating additional hotels.
Special charges in 1996 consisted of $104 million and $5 million relating to
the inn renewal program and impairments of certain long-lived assets,
respectively. Special charges in 1995 consist of $31 million relating to a
change in management. See Item 1. Business -- Strategy, Item 2. Properties,
Capital Resources and Liquidity Capital Expenditures and Item 8. Financial
Statements and Supplementary Data -- Note 10 to the Consolidated Financial
Statements.
Had the special charges of $109 million in 1996 and $31 million 1995 not been
incurred, operating expenses would have been $2260 million and $2067 million,
respectively, and operating income would have been $915 million and $847
million, respectively.
Interest expense decreased $95 million, or 185%, from $513 million in 1995 to
$418 million in 1996, primarily because of the retirement of $128 million of
debt out of the proceeds from the Offering.

1 EBITDA for 1995 was reduced by a special charge of $3,142 relating to a
change in management. Had such charge not been incurred, EBITDA would have
been $112,132 and EBITDA as a percentage of revenues would have been 385%.
Cash flow from operations for 1995 was reduced by $1,873 due to such charge.
Had such charge not been incurred, cash flow from operations would have been
$49,658. See Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data -- Note 10
to the Consolidated Financial Statements.
2 EBITDA for 1996 was reduced by a special charge of $2,551 relating to the
inn renewal program. Had such charge not been incurred, EBITDA would have
been $120,531 and EBITDA as a percentage of revenues would have been 380%.
Cash flow from operations for 1996 was reduced by $1,524 due to such charge.
Excluding this charge, cash flow from operations would have been $62,072.
See Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data -- Note 10 to the
Consolidated Financial Statements.
18
19
3 EBITDA for 1997 was reduced by total special charges of $13,100 of which
$1,421 was for severance compensation related to re-engineering and $11,679
related to the inn renewal program. Had such charges not been incurred,
EBITDA would have been $138,750 and EBITDA as a percentage of revenues would
have been 395%. Cash flow from operations for 1997 was reduced by $8,004
due to such charges. Excluding these charges, cash flow from operations
would have been $87,180. See Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary
Data -- Note 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.
4 Gross operating profit is revenues less direct room expenses.
5 EBITDA is operating income plus the sum of interest income, other income,
depreciation, amortization and loss on fixed asset retirements. EBITDA is
not intended to represent cash flow from operations as defined by generally
accepted accounting principles, and such information should not be
considered as an alternative to net income, cash flow from operations or any
other measure of performance prescribed by generally accepted accounting
principles. EBITDA is included herein because management believes that
certain investors find it to be a useful tool for measuring the ability to
service debt.
6 For purposes of calculating the ratio of earnings to fixed charges, earnings
include income before income taxes plus fixed charges, excluding capitalized
interest. Fixed charges consist of interest expense, including capitalized
interest and the portion of rental expense representative of an interest
factor.
In general, the Company has historically financed its development through
internal cash flow and secured debt. As of January 3, 1998, 174 of the Company
254 inns, in addition to the Company corporate facilities, were pledged to
secure its long-term debt and its Bank Credit Facility. The Company may pledge
additional inns to secure additional long-term debt in order to continue to fund
the Company acquisition and development program.
Cash and cash equivalents decreased $65 million from $197 million at December
28, 1996 to $132 million at January 3, 1998.
The Company has in the past frequently operated with current liabilities in
excess of current assets as a result of partially financing its expansion
through internally generated cash. The Company believes that cash flow from
operations will be sufficient to satisfy its working capital needs in 1998. At
January 3, 1998, the Company had current liabilities of $517 million, including
current maturities of long-term debt of $120 million, and current assets of
$366 million.
Current maturities of long-term debt remained unchanged at $120 million at
December 28, 1996 and January 3, 1998 due to normal amortization of mortgage
notes and obligations under capital leases.
As of January 3, 1998, $846 million was available for borrowing under the
Company $250 million Bank Credit Facility. Borrowings under the Bank Credit
Facility bear interest at either the administrative agent prime rate or LIBOR
plus tiered spreads based upon the Company leverage ratios. The Bank Credit
Facility contains various covenants typical of senior secured bank facilities,
and currently requires the Company to maintain a tangible net worth of not less
than $200 million and to maintain the following financial ratios: funded debt to
EBITDA of not more than 475 to 10, EBITDA to fixed charges and restricted
payments including payment of dividends on the Company Common Stock of not
less than 145 to 10 and senior debt to senior EBITDA of not more than 425 to
10. The Bank Credit Facility contains events of default for breach of these
covenants as well as other events of default customary for financings of similar
size and nature, including a change in control of the Company.
As of January 3, 1998, the Company total long-term indebtedness including
current maturities was approximately $551 million. Approximately $348 million
of such indebtedness is mortgage indebtedness and approximately $178 million of
such indebtedness bears interest at variable rates. For a further description of
the Company mortgage indebtedness, see Item 8. Financial Statements and
Supplementary Data -- Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

CAPITAL EXPENDITURES
The following table sets forth certain information regarding the Company cash
flow from operations and capital expenditures, excluding development,
acquisitions, and related improvements, for 1995, 1996 and 1997.
Fiscal Years
1995        1996        1997
Cash flow from operations      $47,785      $60,548      $79,176
Capital expenditures 1       15,194       26,0762     45,6042
1 Includes furniture, fixtures, equipment, lobby conversions, room
renovations, exterior renovations such as roofing, paving and concrete walks
and general corporate expenditures.
2 1996 and 1997 capital expenditures include $64 million and $374 million,
respectively, in improvements related to the Company inn renewal program.
In addition, during 1996 and 1997, the Company spent $17 million and $7
million, respectively, on software related to the revenue management system
associated with the Company inn renewal program.
The Company has substantially completed improvements of 18 development sites 16
inns open and renovation of 27 inns acquired and open after the Merger and
prior to 1997. In connection with the improvements and renovations of these
inns, the Company spent $486 million in 1997, and expects to spend
approximately $80 million in 1998 to complete these improvements and
renovations. In 1997, the Company acquired 11 development sites one inn open,
of which two were subject to long term leases, and acquired one inn closed for
renovation, for an aggregate cost, including construction and renovation costs,
of $315 million and $64 million, respectively, for improvements and
renovations to these properties over the next 18 months.
Subsequent to January 3, 1998, the Company purchased one development site for an
aggregate cost of $5 million. Currently, the Company has no development sites
under contract to purchase.
Management expects to fund the Company 1998 capital expenditures associated
with improvements for its Comparable Inns from cash flow from operations and
from available cash. Estimated 1998 expenditures associated with the developed
properties and acquired inns will be financed from these sources together with
borrowing under the Bank Credit Facility. The Company may issue additional
equity or debt, or expand its Bank Credit Facility to fund future expansion
activities.
HISTORICAL CASH FLOWS
1997 COMPARED TO 1996
Cash provided by operations increased $187 million, or 309%, from $605
million in 1996 to $792 million in 1997, generally as the result of increases
in net income of $13 million, non-cash charges to income of $38 million and
$136 million in various working capital components.
Net cash used by investing activities increased $47 million from $1266 million
in 1996 to $1313 million in 1997, primarily resulting from expenditures for
acquisitions, construction and renovation activities associated with the
Company expansion program and $381 million for expenditures related to the
inn renewal program. Expenditures for property and equipment in 1997 include the
acquisition of nine development sites and one inn for a total cost, including
improvements of $379 million and $486 million related to improvements and
renovations to 18 development sites and 27 properties acquired prior to 1997.
Net cash provided by financing activities decreased $356 million from $812
million in 1996 to $456 million in 1997. Cash provided by financing activities
in 1996 included $626 million in net proceeds from the Offering after principal
payments of long-term debt. 1997 includes net borrowings under the Bank Credit
Facility of $892 million, which were offset by principal payments of long term
debt of $379 million and the net purchase of common stock for treasury of $57
million.
20
21
1996 COMPARED TO 1995
Cash provided by operations increased $127 million, or 266%, from $478
million in 1995 to $605 million in 1996, generally as the result of an increase
in net income and non-cash charges to income and a change in various working
capital components.
Net cash used by investing activities increased $392 million from $874 million
in 1995 to $1266 million in 1996, primarily as the result of expenditures for
acquisitions, renovation and construction activities associated with the
Company expansion program. Expenditures for property and equipment in 1996
include the acquisition of seven inns and eight development sites for a total
cost, including improvements, of $626 million and $389 million related to
renovations and improvements to 20 properties and 10 development sites acquired
prior to 1996.
Net cash provided by financing activities increased $392 million from $420
million in 1995 to $812 million in 1996, primarily as a result of $1486
million in proceeds of the Offering and net borrowings under the Bank Credit
Facility of $254 million, which were partially offset by the purchase of
treasury stock for $65 million and principal payments of long term debt of
$860 million.
EBITDA
EBITDA increased $77 million, or 65%, from $1180 million in 1996 to $1257
million in 1997. EBITDA increased $90 million, or 83%, from $1090 million in
1995 to $1180 million in 1996. EBITDA in 1995 includes a special charge of $31
million for a change in management. EBITDA in 1996 and 1997 includes special
charges of $25 million and $117 million, respectively, related to the inn
renewal program. In addition, 1997 includes $14 million of severance
compensation related to re-engineering. Had such special charges not been
incurred, EBITDA would have been $1121 million, $1205 million and $1388
million in 1995, 1996, and 1997, respectively. EBITDA is not intended to
represent cash flow from operations as defined by generally accepted accounting
principles, and such information should not be considered as an alternative to
net income, cash flow from operations or any other measure of performance
prescribed by generally accepted accounting principles. EBITDA is included
herein because management believes that certain investors find it to be a useful
tool for measuring the ability to service debt.
INFLATION
The rate of inflation as measured by changes in the average consumer price index
has not had a material effect on the revenues or net earnings of the Company in
the three most recent years.
YEAR 2000 ISSUE
The Year 2000 issue is related to computer systems that currently record years
in a two-digit format. Such computer systems will be unable to properly
interpret dates beyond the year 1999 which could result in a system failure or
cause disruption of business operations.
The Company is in the process of reviewing its computer systems and programs and
identifying critical vendors with respect to the Year 2000 issue. The Company is
assessing the amount of programming required to upgrade or replace each of its
affected systems and expects to complete implementation and testing of systems
revisions by early 1999. In addition, the Company is actively working with all
of its major vendors and suppliers to assess their compliance efforts and the
Company exposure to them.
The Company is in the process of replacing its accounting software with a system
that is Year 2000 compliant. The Company expects implementation of the new
accounting system to be completed by the first quarter of 1999 at an approximate
cost of $3 million.
The total cost to the Company of the Year 2000 compliance activities has not
been and is not anticipated to be material to its financial position or results
of operations in any given year. These costs and the date on which the Company
plans to complete the Year 2000 modification and testing processes are based on
management best estimates, which were derived utilizing numerous assumptions
of
21
22
future events including the continued availability of certain resources, third
party modification plans and other factors. However, there can be no guarantee
that these estimates will be achieved and actual results could differ from these
estimates.
FORWARD LOOKING STATEMENTS; CERTAIN FACTORS AFFECTING FUTURE RESULTS
This Form 10-K includes forward looking statements, including, without
limitation, statements concerning the Company ability to increase REVPAR, the
time and cost of completion of renovation and construction of, and improvements
to, acquired inns and development sites, the chainwide property renewal program,
the revenue management system, the impact of the revenue management system on
REVPAR and the expected stabilization of acquired or developed inns. Any forward
looking statements contained in this Form 10-K or any other reports or documents
prepared by or made by management of the Company involve risks and uncertainties
and are subject to change based on various important factors. The following
factors, among others, in some cases have affected and in the future could
affect the Company actual financial performance and could cause actual results
to differ, perhaps materially, from those set forth in such forward looking
statements.
EXPANSION RISKS. The Company ability to expand depends on a number of factors,
including the selection and availability of suitable locations at acceptable
prices, the hiring and training of sufficiently skilled management and personnel
and the availability of financing. There can be no assurance that financing or
desirable locations for acquisition or new development will be available or, if
available, will be on terms acceptable to the Company. The Company expects that
its franchising business will face risks that competition from other hotel
franchising businesses may impair the Company ability to attract franchisees
and that franchisees may fail to uphold the Company standards of quality and
service or fail to fulfill their financial and other obligations to the Company.
Furthermore, provisions in the indenture the Indenture governing the Notes,
in the Bank Credit Facility and in certain mortgage indebtedness agreements may
restrict the Company ability to meet its expansion objectives. See Capital
Resources and Liquidity. Although the Company believes that it has the
infrastructure in place to accommodate the planned expansion, the Company
corporate management expenses will increase as the number of inns grows, which
could adversely affect the Company financial performance.
There can be no assurance that the Company expansion plans will be completed
successfully or that the nature of such expansion will not be modified to
reflect future events or economic conditions. There can be no assurance that
newly acquired inns will conform to the Company previous standards of
construction and design or that the Company new inn design will achieve guest
acceptance. The Company inability to successfully implement its expansion
plans would limit the Company ability to grow its revenue base.
LODGING INDUSTRY RISKS. The lodging industry in general, including the Company,
may be adversely affected by such factors as changes in national and regional
economic conditions particularly in geographic areas in which the Company has a
high concentration of inns, changes in local market conditions, oversupply of
hotel space or a reduction in local demand for rooms and related services,
competition in the hotel industry, changes in interest rates, the availability
of financing and other factors relating to the operation of economy hotels.
Operating factors affecting the lodging industry generally, including the
Company, include i competition from other hotels, motels and recreational
properties, ii demographic changes, iii the recurring need for renovations,
refurbishment and improvements of hotels and increased expenses related to inn
security, iv restrictive changes in zoning and similar land use laws and
regulations that influence or determine wages, prices or construction costs, v
changes in the characteristics of hotel locations, vi the inability to secure
property and liability insurance to fully protect against all losses or to
obtain such insurance at reasonable costs, vii changes in real estate tax
rates and other operating costs, viii changes or cancellations in local
tourist, athletic or cultural events, ix changes in travel patterns which may
be affected by increases in transportation costs or gasoline prices, changes in
airline schedules and fares, strikes, weather patterns or relocation or
construction of highways, x increases in operating expense and litigation as a
result of on-premise assaults of guests by third parties and xi changes in
brand identity and reputation. Unexpected or adverse changes in any of the
foregoing factors could have a material adverse effect on the Company
business, assets, financial condition or results of operations.
CYCLICALITY. The hotel industry is subject to periods of cyclical growth and
downturn. From 1990 through 1992, for example, the U. S. hotel industry
experienced a cyclical downturn which resulted from, among other things,
over-building in the industry and sluggish general economic conditions in the
United States. According to STR, in 1997, increases in room supply were greater
than increases in demand for both the industry as a whole and the economy chain
segment. There can be no assurance that downturns or prolonged adverse
conditions
22
23
in the hotel industry, in real estate or capital markets or in national or local
economies will not have a material adverse impact on the Company.
SEASONALITY. Demand, and thus room occupancy, is affected by normally recurring
seasonal patterns and, in most locations, is higher in the summer and early fall
months May through October than the balance of the year. Historically,
revenues in the first quarter have been lower than in other quarters and the
Company has incurred net losses in the first quarter.
COMPETITION. The economy segment of the hotel industry is highly competitive.
The Company inns generally operate in areas that contain numerous competitors.
Demographic, geographic, or other changes in one or more of the Company
markets could impact the convenience or desirability of the sites of certain
hotels, which would adversely affect the operations of those hotels. There can
be no assurance that new or existing competitors will not significantly lower
rates or offer greater convenience, services or amenities or significantly
expand or improve facilities in a market in which the Company hotels compete,
thereby adversely affecting the Company operations. See Item 2.
Business -- Competition. In addition, some of the Company competitors have a
larger network of locations and greater resources than the Company and are less
leveraged than the Company. Competition may generally reduce the number of
suitable hotel development or acquisition opportunities offered to the Company
and increase the bargaining power of property owners seeking to sell, which
could adversely affect the Company financial performance.
REGULATORY RISKS. The lodging industry is subject to numerous federal, state and
local government regulations, including building and zoning requirements. Also,
the Company is subject to laws governing its relationship with employees,
including minimum wage requirements, overtime, working conditions and work
permit requirements. An increase in the minimum wage rate, employee benefit
costs or other costs associated with employees, could adversely affect the
Company. Under the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 the ADA, all
public accommodations are required to meet certain federal requirements related
to access and use by disabled persons. These and other initiatives could
adversely affect the Company, as well as the lodging industry in general.
ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS. Various federal, state and local laws, ordinances and
regulations impose liability on present and former real property owners and
operators for the cost of cleaning up or removing contamination caused by
hazardous or toxic materials. Such liability may be imposed without regard to
fault or legality of the original actions, and may be joint and several with
other responsible parties. If the liability is joint and several, the Company
could be responsible for payment of the full amount of the liability, whether or
not any other responsible party is also liable. The presence of contamination
at, or even adjacent to or near, a property also can affect the valuation of
that property or the ability of the owner to sell, lease or obtain financing for
the property and may in certain circumstances form the basis for liability to
third persons for personal injury or other damages. See Item 2.

INDEPENDENT AUDITORS' REPORT
The Board of Directors and Stockholders of
Red Roof Inns, Inc.
We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Red Roof Inns,
Inc. and its subsidiaries as of December 28, 1996 and January 3, 1998, and the
related consolidated statements of income, stockholders' equity and cash flows
for each of the three years in the period ended January 3, 1998. These financial
statements are the responsibility of the Company management. Our
responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on
our audits.
We conducted our audits in accordance with generally accepted auditing
standards. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material
misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting
the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes
assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by
management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.
We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
In our opinion, such consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all
material respects, the financial position of Red Roof Inns, Inc. and its
subsidiaries at December 28, 1996 and January 3, 1998, and the results of their
operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended
January 3, 1998 in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
For the Years Ended December 30, 1995, December 28, 1996 and January 3, 1998
1.  SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
GENERAL - The Company was formed in November 1993 and is a subsidiary of The
Morgan Stanley Real Estate Fund, L.P. MSREF. The Company operates on a 52-53
week fiscal year which ends on the Saturday nearest to December 31. At December
30, 1995 1995, December 28, 1996 1996 and January 3, 1998 1997, the
Company operated 231, 248 and 254 inns, respectively. The 1995 and 1996 years
consist of 52 weeks each and the 1997 year consists of 53 weeks.
PRINCIPLES OF CONSOLIDATION - The accompanying consolidated financial statements
include the accounts of Red Roof Inns, Inc. and its wholly owned subsidiaries,
RRI Investment Co. and RRI Financial Inc. All material intercompany transactions
and balances have been eliminated in consolidation.
NATURE OF OPERATIONS - The Company, whose revenues are primarily derived from
room rentals, is an owner/operator and franchiser of economy inns. The Company
properties are primarily located throughout the Midwest, East, South and Gulf
Coast regions of the United States. The Company began franchising economy inns
in 1997 and at January 3, 1998 five franchised inns were in operation.
FRANCHISE REVENUE - Franchise revenue consists of royalty fees, which are based
on a percentage of franchised inns gross room sales, and initial franchise fees
which are recorded as revenue when an inn opens as a franchised unit. Total
franchise revenue for 1997 was approximately $225,000. Reservation fees and
marketing fees charged by the Company to its franchised inns total of
approximately $12,000 and $15,000, respectively for 1997 are recorded as a
reduction of corporate and marketing expenses.
USE OF ESTIMATES - The preparation of the consolidated financial statements in
conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to
make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the
consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. Actual results could
differ from these estimates, but it is management opinion that any changes in
estimates would not have a material effect on the consolidated financial
statements.
SUPPLIES - Supplies inventory is stated at cost, which represents the cost to
supply the inns with their respective initial operating inventories.
Replacements needed to maintain or increase the original operating inventory are
charged to expense in the period such replacement or increase occurs.
PROPERTY AND EQUIPMENT - Property and equipment are stated at cost. Depreciation
and amortization of property and equipment is based on the straight-line method
over estimated composite useful lives that range from 3 to 15 years for
furniture, fixtures and equipment and 12 to 40 years for buildings and
improvements.
CAPITALIZATION OF DEVELOPMENT EXPENSES - Costs incurred by the Company related
to site development and acquisitions are capitalized and allocated to the
properties developed or acquired. Costs capitalized during 1995, 1996 and 1997
totaled $1,138,000, $2,162,000 and $2,385,000, respectively.
GOODWILL - The excess of the purchase price over the fair values of net assets
acquired goodwill is being amortized on a straight-line basis over 35 years.
Goodwill at December 28, 1996 and January 3, 1998 is net of accumulated
amortization of $6,922,000 and $9,187,000, respectively.
DEFERRED LOAN FEES AND COSTS - Deferred loan fees and costs are amortized using
the straight-line method over the terms of the loans ranging from 5 to 15 years.
Deferred loan fees and costs at December 28, 1996 and January 3, 1998 are net of
accumulated amortization of $2,958,000 and $3,571,000, respectively.
In May 1997, the Company refinanced its $150 million bank credit facility with a
$250 million bank credit facility. In connection with the refinancing, the
Company recognized an extraordinary charge against income of $746,000, net of
tax, $02 per share -- basic and $03 per share -- diluted related to the
write off of unamortized loan costs of $1,228,000.

RED ROOF INNS, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED
OTHER ASSETS - Other assets principally include software costs, net of
accumulated amortization using the straight-line method over a useful life of
five years, preliminary site acquisition costs, escrow deposits for furniture
replacements and investments in affiliates.
ASSET IMPAIRMENTS - Annually, or more frequently if events or circumstances
change, a determination is made by management, in accordance with Statement of
Financial Accounting Standards SFAS No. 121, to ascertain whether property and
equipment, goodwill, and other intangible assets have been impaired based on the
sum of estimated future undiscounted cash flows from operating activities. If
the estimated net cash flows are less than the carrying amount of such assets,
the Company recognizes an impairment loss in an amount necessary to write down
such assets to a fair value as determined from expected discounted cash flows.
During 1996, the Company recorded an impairment charge of $450,000 related to
land held for sale and a charge of $7,847,000 related to assets being disposed
in connection with its inn renewal program. During 1997, the Company recorded a
charge of $3,009,000 substantially related to assets being disposed in
connection with its inn renewal program. These amounts have been included in
special charges. See Note 10.
Based upon its most recent analysis, the Company believes that property,
goodwill and other intangibles at January 3, 1998 are realizable and the
depreciation and amortization periods are appropriate.
INCOME TAXES - The Company is subject to federal, state and local income taxes.
Income taxes are provided for all taxable items included in the statements of
income in accordance with SFAS No. 109.
SELF-INSURANCE PROGRAMS - The Company uses a retrospective self-insurance plan
for general liability and workers' compensation. A liability has been recorded
in the financial statements based on information currently available as to the
estimated ultimate cost for incidents incurred prior to the balance sheet dates.
Losses in excess of certain limits are insured with third-party insurance
companies. Estimated payments against the insurance liability for each of the
next five years are: 1998 -- $4,157,000; 1999 -- $2,492,000; 2000 -- $1,881,000;
2001 -- $1,549,000 and 2002 -- $473,000.
ADVERTISING - The Company expenses the costs of advertising including
production costs the first time advertising takes place. Advertising expenses
consist of local advertising which is included in direct room expenses and
billboard and national media advertising which is included in marketing and inn
renewal program expenses. Advertising expense was $17,728,000, $17,907,000 and
$25,224,000 for 1995, 1996 and 1997, respectively.
EARNINGS PER SHARE - In 1997, the Company adopted SFAS No. 128, Earnings Per
Share which required retroactive adoption. The new standard simplifies the
computation of earnings per share and requires the presentation of basic and
diluted earnings per share. Basic income per share amounts are based on the
weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding during the years
presented. Diluted income per share amounts are based on the weighted average
number of shares of common stock and stock options outstanding during the years
presented.
CASH EQUIVALENTS - Cash in excess of daily requirements is invested in money
market and government securities with maturities of three months or less. Such
investments are considered to be cash equivalents. The majority of such funds
are held by the Company administrative agent bank. The Company has not
experienced any losses on these investments.
RECLASSIFICATIONS - Certain amounts in the prior years' financial statements
have been reclassed to conform with the 1997 presentation.
2.  TRANSACTIONS WITH AFFILIATES
The Company operates two hotels under long-term capital lease agreements with
affiliated partnerships which own the hotels. Such affiliation exists because
the Company is a partner in the partnerships. The Company ownership interests
in the operating profits and losses of such partnerships are 3% and 29 respectively, and ownership in the residual values of such partnerships is 73%
and 80%, respectively. The partnerships are consolidated as capital leases and
are immaterial to the consolidated financial statements.

33
The Company was provided certain underwriting services through an affiliate of
MSREF in connection with the Company 1996 initial public stock offering and
obtains certain shared administrative services with unrelated parties through
master contracts available through MSREF.
3.  LEASES
The Company leases certain assets used in its operations under long-term capital
leases, principally three hotels including one with an unrelated party and
land. These leases typically contain renewal and purchase options and expire at
various dates through 2006. The leases generally require payment of property
taxes, insurance and maintenance costs. The Company leases land, hotels, a
warehouse and billboard advertising space under noncancelable operating leases.
Land leases expire at various dates through 2034 and other leases expire at
various dates through 2019. Total operating rent expense for 1995, 1996 and 1997
was $11,269,000, $12,622,000 and $12,248,000, respectively.

million at the May 2002 maturity date. Borrowings under the bank credit facility
bear interest at either LIBOR plus tiered spreads based upon the Company
leverage ratios or the administrative agent prime rate. The bank credit
facility also contains various covenants that include restrictions on the
incurrence of additional debt, stock repurchase and the payment of dividends
which are similar to the covenants related to the senior unsecured notes. The
bank credit facility contains events of default. Both the covenants and events
of default are customary for financing of similar size and nature, including a
change in control of the Company.
Notes payable and the bank credit facility are collateralized by certain
property and equipment with a net book value totaling $380,000,000 and
$470,000,000 at December 28, 1996 and January 3, 1998, respectively.
As of January 3, 1998, the Company has $4,323,000 in standby letters of credit
from banks, expiring at various dates through December 2005.

1998, $186,170,000 is available for restricted payments under the terms of the
Notes of which $49,566,000 is available from retained earnings.
The Notes are not redeemable by the Company until December 15, 1998 when they
become redeemable at 104813% of their principal amount, declining ratably to
par on and after December 15, 2000, plus accrued interest.
6.  STOCKHOLDERS' EQUITY
During 1995, the Company stockholders made a capital contribution of
$18,000,000 to provide funds for inn acquisitions. On January 31, 1996, the
Company issued 10,000,000 shares of common stock in an initial public offering
the Offering at a price of $1600 per share. Net proceeds of the Offering
were approximately $149 million which were used to repay approximately $128
million of mortgage
34
35
indebtedness. Approximately $21 million was retained for inn acquisitions,
conversions, new development and for general corporate purposes.
In connection with the Offering, $96 million in underwriting discounts and
commissions were paid to certain underwriters, including an affiliate of MSREF.
In August 1996, the Company repurchased 500,000 shares of its common stock in
the open market for an aggregate purchase price of $6,476,000, or $1295 per
share. During the fourth quarter of 1997, the Company purchased 500,000 shares
of its common stock in the open market for an aggregate purchase price of
$7,976,000, or $1595 per share. The shares were placed in treasury and will be

purchase plans.
7.  EMPLOYEE AND DIRECTOR STOCK PLANS
In March 1995, the Company adopted a non-qualified Management Stock Option Plan
for certain officers and employees effective as of December 29, 1994. In
December 1995, the Company Board of Directors adopted the Amended and Restated
1994 Management Equity Incentive Plan the Plan. The Plan is overseen by the
Compensation Committee appointed by the Board of Directors, which is comprised
of not less than two directors who are not officers or employees of the Company.
Under the terms of the Plan, awards may be granted in the form of: i incentive
stock options, which are intended to qualify under Sec. 422 of the Internal
Revenue Code of 1986, as amended; ii stock options which are not intended to
so qualify; iii shares of the Company common stock which will be subject to
certain conditions and restrictions restricted shares; or iv performance
units performance units, which represent the right to receive an amount
equal to the value related to the performance units awarded, such as the fair
market value of a share of common stock. Awards may be granted by the committee
at its discretion to key employees including officers and directors who are
employees of the Company. The Plan generally provides that the number of shares
of common stock with respect to which options, restricted shares and performance
units may be granted to any individual employee may not exceed 400,000 during
any single fiscal year. The aggregate number of shares of common stock which may
be issued under the Plan is 2,400,000 provided that in no event shall more than
10% of the shares of common stock authorized for issuance under the Plan be
granted in the form of awards other than options.
Generally, each option will have a term ending 10 years from the date of grant.
Each option will vest and become exercisable on such date or dates and on the
basis of other criteria, including without limitation the performance of the
Company, as the committee may determine at its discretion and as shall be
specified in the option agreement evidencing the grant of such options. The
option price is determined by the committee at the time of the grant and may not
be less than the fair market value of the shares of common stock on the date of
grant exclusive of the options granted in 1994, which were issued at less than
fair market value at the time of the grant. Options granted in 1995, 1996 and
1997 vest at the rate of 25% per year.
In October 1995, the Company adopted the 1995 Director Stock Option Plan for
directors who are not officers or employees of the Company. The plan is
administered by a committee of not less than two directors appointed by the
Board of Directors. Any eligible director is automatically granted an initial
option to purchase 10,000 shares. Subsequently, following each annual meeting of
the stockholders of the Company, each eligible director shall be granted an
option to purchase 1,000 shares. The initial option to purchase 10,000 shares
vests in equal amounts over a five-year period and future grants vest
immediately. The exercise price of the options is based on the fair market value
of the common stock on the last trading day prior to the date on which the
option is granted. All options expire 10 years after the date of grant. The
Company has reserved 60,000 shares under the Plan and in 1996 and 1997, granted
options to purchase 10,000 and 22,000 shares, respectively.

under the Company stock option plans totaled 210,550; 518,149 and 734,640
shares, respectively, and had a weighted average option price per share of
$766, $1151 and $1301, respectively. For options outstanding at January 3,
1998, 124,750, 430,555, and 179,335 shares are exercisable at a weighted average
exercise price of $543, $1391, and $1611, respectively. The weighted average
remaining contractual life of these options is 60, 83, and 83 years,
respectively.
At January 3, 1998, 844,850 shares are available for future grants of stock
options.
During 1995, 1996 and 1997, the Company recognized compensation expense in
corporate expenses of $488,000, $339,000 and $281,000 respectively, related to
the granting of options in 1994 at less than fair market value at the date of
grant. Grants in 1995, 1996 and 1997 were issued at fair market value.
SFAS No. 123, Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation, defines a fair value
method of accounting for stock options and similar equity instruments. Under the
fair value method, compensation cost is measured at the grant date based on the
fair value of the award and is recognized over the service period, which is
usually the vesting period. Companies are encouraged, but not required, to adopt
the fair value method of accounting for employee stock-based transactions.
Companies are also permitted to continue to account for such transactions under
Accounting Principles Board Opinion APB No. 25, Accounting for Stock Issued
to Employees, but are required to disclose in a note to the financial
statements pro forma net income and earnings per share as if the company had
applied the new method of accounting. The Company applies APB No. 25 in
accounting for its stock-based compensation plans. Had compensation cost been
36
37
determined on the basis of fair value pursuant to SFAS No. 123, for options
granted in 1995, 1996 and 1997, net income and earnings per share would have
been as follows in thousands, except per share amounts:
1995   1996   1997
Net income
As reported       $18,322  $24,064  $25,358

As reported       $  99  $  87  $  90
Pro forma        $  98  $  82  $  85
The following weighted average assumptions were used in the option pricing
model: a risk free interest rate of 77%, 67% and 68% for 1995, 1996 and 1997,
respectively; an expected life of the options of 75 years; no expected dividend
yield and a volatility factor of 25 for 1995 and 1996 and volatility factor of
26 for 1997. The weighted average per share fair value of the options granted
in 1995, 1996 and 1997 was $691, $659 and $740, respectively.
Due to the inclusion of only 1995, 1996 and 1997 option grants, the effects of
applying SFAS No. 123 in 1995, 1996 and 1997 may not be representative of the
pro forma impact in future years.
8.  EMPLOYEE STOCK PURCHASE PLAN
In February 1998, the Company Board of Directors adopted the Company Amended
and Restated 1996 Employee Stock Purchase Plan the Stock Purchase Plan which
is intended to qualify under Sec. 423 of the Internal Revenue Code. The purpose
of the Stock Purchase Plan is to provide employees of the Company with an
opportunity to acquire or increase a proprietary interest in the Company by
applying payroll deductions or contributions to the purchase of shares of the
Company common stock. All employees of the Company are eligible to participate
in the Stock Purchase Plan. The purchase price is 85% of the fair market value
of the Company common stock at the beginning of the contribution period, which
begins on the last Sunday of January and ends on the last Saturday of the
following January of each year or, if less, 85% of such fair market value on the
last day of the contribution period. The Stock Purchase Plan allows employees to
purchase shares through contribution or payroll deductions of up to 10% of base
pay, and provides that no employee may purchase in any calendar year shares
having a value determined at the time the right to purchase is granted in
excess of $25,000. The aggregate number of shares of common stock reserved for
purchase under the stock purchase plan is 300,000. Such shares may be either
authorized by unissued shares or issued shares reacquired by the Company and
held as treasury shares.
In January 1997, the Company sold 48,647 shares of common stock out of treasury
to employees at $1264 per share for the 1996 plan year and in January 1998,
sold 34,916 shares of common stock out of treasury to employees at $1519 per
share for the 1997 plan year. The weighted average per share fair value of the
shares issued in 1997 and 1998 was $326 and $387, respectively.
9.  RETIREMENT PLANS
The Company has a defined benefit pension plan the Pension Plan covering all
employees except seasonal employees. The benefits are based on years of service,
final average compensation and final average compensation in excess of average
social security covered compensation at retirement. The Company funding policy
was to contribute annually at least the minimum amount required under the
funding standards of ERISA. Pension Plan assets are held by a bank trust company
and are invested primarily in cash equivalents and fixed income investments. On
December 28, 1996, the Company froze the Pension Plan which decreased the
Company projected benefit obligations by $2,500,000 and resulted in a
curtailment gain of $286,000. During 1997, the Company terminated the Pension
Plan, subject
37

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED
to receipt of appropriate regulatory approvals. Earned benefits through the date
the Pension Plan was frozen are expected to be paid to employees during 1998, at
which time a final settlement cost of approximately $1,600,000 will be paid by
the Company.
The weighted-average discount rate used in determining the actuarial present
value of the projected benefit obligation was 725% and 611% at December 28,
1996 and January 3, 1998, respectively. The decrease in the discount rate for
1997 reflects the interest rate that will be used to determine lump sum payments
for the Pension Plan termination. The rate of increase in future compensation
was 5% and the expected long-term rate of return on assets was 9% for 1996.
The following table sets forth the Pension Plan funded status as of December
28, 1996, and January 3, 1998 and amounts recognized in the financial statements
