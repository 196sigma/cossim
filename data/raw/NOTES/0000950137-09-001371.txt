75 40 Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm The Board of Directors and Stockholders
Corn Products International, Inc. We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Corn Products International, Inc.
and subsidiaries the Company as of December31, 2008 and 2007, and the related consolidated
statements of income, comprehensive income, stockholders equity and redeemable equity, and cash
flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended December31, 2008. We also have audited
the Companys internal control over financial reporting as of December31, 2008, based on criteria
established in Internal ControlIntegrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring
Organizations of the Treadway Commission COSO. The Companys management is responsible for these
consolidated financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control over financial
reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial
reporting, included in the accompanying Managements Report on Internal Controls over Financial
Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated financial statements
and an opinion on the Companys internal control over financial reporting based on our audits. We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight
Board United States. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement and
whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material
respects. Our audits of the consolidated financial statements included examining, on a test basis,
evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the
accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, and evaluating the overall
financial statement presentation. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included
obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a
material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of
internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other
procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a
reasonable basis for our opinions. A companys internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable
assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial
statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A
companys internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that 1
pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the
transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; 2provide reasonable assurance that
transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance
with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company
are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company;
and 3provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized
acquisition, use, or disposition of the companys assets that could have a material effect on the
financial statements. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or
detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are
subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that
the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all
material respects, the financial position of Corn Products International, Inc. and subsidiaries as
of December31, 2008 and 2007, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of
the years in the three-year period ended December31, 2008, in conformity with accounting
principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Also in our opinion, the Company
maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of
December31, 2008, based on criteria established in Internal
ControlIntegrated Framework issued by
the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission COSO. 41 As discussed in Note 2 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements, effective

See notes to the consolidated financial statements. 47 NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS NOTE 1 Description of the Business Corn Products International, Inc. the Company was founded in 1906 and became an independent and
public company as of December31, 1997. The Company operates domestically and internationally in
one business segment, corn refining, and produces a wide variety of products. NOTE 2 Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Basis of presentation The consolidated financial statements consist of the accounts of the
Company, including all significant subsidiaries. Intercompany accounts and transactions are
eliminated in consolidation. The preparation of the accompanying consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles
generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions
about future events. These estimates and the underlying assumptions affect the amounts of assets and liabilities
reported, disclosures about contingent assets and liabilities, and reported amounts of revenues and expenses.
Such estimates include the value of purchase consideration, valuation of accounts receivable, inventories,
goodwill, intangible assets and other long-lived assets, legal contingencies, guarantee obligations, and
assumptions used in the calculation of income taxes, and pension and other postretirement benefits, among
others. These estimates and assumptions are based on managements best estimates and judgment. Management
evaluates its estimates and assumptions on an ongoing basis using historical experience and other factors,
including the current economic environment, which management believes to be reasonable under the
circumstances. Management will adjust such estimates and assumptions when facts and circumstance dictate.
Foreign currency devaluations, corn price volatility, access to difficult credit markets, and declines in the global
economic environment have combined to increase the uncertainty inherent in such estimates and assumptions.
As future events and their effects cannot be determined with precision, actual results could differ significantly
from these estimates. Changes in those estimates resulting from continuing changes in the economic
environment will be reflected in the financial statements in future periods. Assets and liabilities of foreign subsidiaries, other than those whose functional currency is the
US dollar, are translated at current exchange rates with the related translation adjustments
reported in stockholders equity as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income loss.
Income statement accounts are translated at the average exchange rate during the period. Where the
US dollar is considered the functional currency, monetary assets and liabilities are translated at
current exchange rates with the related adjustment included in net income. Non-monetary assets and
liabilities are translated at historical exchange rates. The Company incurs foreign currency
transaction gains/losses relating to assets and liabilities that are denominated in a currency
other than the functional currency. For 2008, 2007 and 2006, the Company incurred foreign currency
transaction gains lossesof $9million, $4million and $1million, respectively. The Companys
accumulated other comprehensive loss included in stockholders equity on the Consolidated Balance
Sheets includes cumulative translation loss adjustments of $363million and $132million at
December31, 2008 and 2007, respectively. Cash and cash equivalents Cash equivalents consist of all instruments purchased with an original
maturity of three months or less, and which have virtually no risk of loss in value. Inventories Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value. Costs are
determined using the first-in, first-out FIFOmethod. Investments Investments in the common stock of affiliated companies over which the Company does
not exercise significant influence are accounted for under the cost method and are carried at cost
or less. The Companys wholly-owned Canadian subsidiary has an investment that is accounted for
under the cost method. The carrying value of this investment was $5million at December31, 2008
and $6million at December31, 2007. Investments that enable the Company to exercise significant
influence, but do not represent a controlling interest, are accounted for under the equity method;
such investments are carried at cost or less, adjusted to reflect the Companys proportionate share
of income or loss, less dividends received. The Company did not have any investments accounted for
under the equity method at December31, 2008 or 2007. The Company also has an equity interest in
the CME Group Inc. CME, which it classifies as available for sale securities. This investment,
which totaled $2million at December31, 2008 and $7million at December31, 2007, is carried at
fair value with unrealized gains and losses recorded to other comprehensive income. The Company
would recognize a loss on its investments when there is a loss in value of an investment that is
other than a temporary decline. Property, plant and equipment and depreciation Property, plant and equipment are stated at cost
less accumulated depreciation. Depreciation is generally computed on the straight-line method over
the estimated useful lives of depreciable assets, which range from 10 to 50years for buildings and
from 3 to 25years for all other assets. Where permitted by law, accelerated depreciation methods
are used for tax purposes. The Company reviews the recoverability of the net book value
of
property, plant and equipment for impairment whenever events and circumstances indicate that the
net book value 48 of an asset may not be recoverable from estimated future cash flows expected to
result from its use and eventual disposition. If this review indicates that the carrying values
will not be recovered, the carrying values would be reduced to fair value and an impairment loss
would be recognized. Goodwill and other intangible assets Goodwill $351million and $423million at December31,
2008 and 2007, respectively represents the excess of cost over fair value of net assets acquired.
The Company also has other intangible assets $8million at December31, 2008 and $3million at
December31, 2007, respectively. The carrying amount of goodwill and other intangible assets by
geographic segment as of December31, 2008 and 2007 was as follows

The Company assesses goodwill for impairment annually or more frequent if impairment indicators
arise. The Company has chosen to perform this annual impairment assessment in December of each
year. The Company has completed the required impairment assessments and determined there to be no
goodwill impairment. However, as a result of the current operating performance and expectations
regarding future operating performance of the Companys Korean operations Korea, the fair value
of these assets was only modestly in excess of their carrying value. The net book value of
goodwill relating to Korea was approximately $120million at December31, 2008. The Company used a discounted cash flow model DCF model to determine the current fair value of
its Korean operation. Management believes that this approach is appropriate because it provides a
fair value estimate based upon Koreas expected long-term operating and cash flow performance.
This approach also mitigates most of the impact of cyclical downturns that occur in the industry.
This approach was based on a ten-year projection of operating results and cash flows that is
discounted using a weighted-average cost of capital. The projection is based upon the Companys
best estimates of projected economic and market conditions over the related period including growth
rates, estimates of future expected changes in operating margins and cash expenditures. Other
significant estimates and assumptions include terminal value growth rates, and future capital
expenditures. The Company specifically made the following operating assumptions for Korea: a
reduction of corn costs and freight rates to historical levels; recovery of HFCS sales volume to
the carbonated beverage industry; recovery of starch volume to the paper industry and glucose
volumes to distributors; and the introduction of new products into the Korean market. Revenue recognition The Company recognizes operating revenues at the time title to the goods and
all risks of ownership transfer to customers. This transfer is considered complete when a sales
agreement is in place, delivery has occurred, pricing is fixed or determinable and collection is
reasonably assured. In the case of consigned inventories, the title passes and the transfer of
ownership risk occurs when the goods are used by the customer. Taxes assessed by governmental
authorities and collected from customers are accounted for on a net basis and thereby excluded from
revenues. Hedging instruments The Company uses derivative financial instruments principally to offset
exposure to market risks arising from changes in commodity prices and interest rates. Derivative
financial instruments currently used by the Company consist of commodity futures and option
contracts, interest rate swap agreements and treasury lock agreements. The Company enters into
futures and option contracts, which are designated as hedges of specific volumes of commodities
corn and natural gas that will be purchased and processed in a future month. These derivative
financial instruments are recognized in the Consolidated Balance Sheets at fair value. The Company
has also, from time to time, entered into interest rate swap agreements that effectively converted
the interest rate on certain fixed rate debt to a variable interest rate and, on certain variable
rate debt, to a fixed interest rate. The Companys treasury lock agreements lock the benchmark
rate for an anticipated fixed rate borrowing. See also Note 4 and Note 5 of the notes to the
consolidated financial statements for additional information. 49 On the date a derivative contract is entered into, the Company designates the derivative as either
a hedge of variable cash flows to be paid related to interest on variable rate debt, as a hedge of
market variation in the benchmark rate for a future fixed rate debt issue or as a hedge of certain
forecasted purchases of corn or natural gas used in the manufacturing process a cash-flow
hedge, or as a hedge of the fair value of certain debt obligations a fair-value hedge. This
process includes linking all derivatives that are designated as fair-value or cash-flow hedges to
specific assets and liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheet, or to specific firm commitments
or forecasted transactions. For all hedging relationships, the Company formally documents the
hedging relationships and its risk-management objective and strategy for undertaking the hedge
transactions, the hedging instrument, the item, the nature of the risk being hedged, how the
hedging instruments effectiveness in offsetting the hedged risk will be assessed, and a
description of the method of measuring ineffectiveness. The Company also formally assesses, both
at the hedges inception and on an ongoing basis, whether the derivatives that are used in hedging
transactions are highly effective in offsetting changes in cash flows or fair values of hedged
items. When it is determined that a derivative is not highly effective as a hedge or that it has
ceased to be a highly effective hedge, the Company discontinues hedge accounting prospectively. Changes in the fair value of a floating-to-fixed interest rate swap, treasury lock or a futures
contract for corn or natural gas that is highly effective and that is designated and qualifies as a
cash-flow hedge are recorded in other comprehensive income loss, net of applicable income taxes,
and recognized in the Consolidated Statement of Income when the variable rate interest is paid, the
future fixed interest rate is established or the finished goods produced using the hedged item are
sold. The maximum term over which the Company hedges exposures to the variability of cash flows
for commodity price risk is 60months. Changes in the fair value of a fixed-to-floating interest
rate swap agreement that is highly effective and that is designated and qualifies as a fair-value
hedge, along with the loss or gain on the hedged debt obligation that is attributable to the hedged
risk, are recorded in earnings. The ineffective portion of the change in fair value of a
derivative instrument that qualifies as either a cash-flow hedge or a fair-value hedge is reported
in earnings. The Company discontinues hedge accounting prospectively when it is determined that the derivative
is no longer effective in offsetting changes in the cash flows or fair value of the hedged item,
the derivative expires or is sold, terminated or exercised, the derivative is de-designated as a
hedging instrument because it is unlikely that a forecasted transaction will occur, or management
determines that designation of the derivative as a hedging instrument is no longer appropriate.
When hedge accounting is discontinued because it is probable that a forecasted transaction will not
occur, the Company continues to carry the derivative on the Consolidated Balance Sheet at its fair
value, and gains and losses that were accumulated in other comprehensive income lossare
recognized immediately in earnings. When hedge accounting is discontinued because it is determined
that the derivative no longer qualifies as an effective fair-value hedge, the Company continues to
carry the derivative on the Consolidated Balance Sheet at its fair value and no longer adjusts the
hedged asset or liability for changes in fair value. The adjustment of the carrying amount of the
hedged asset or liability is accounted for in the same manner as other components of the carrying
amount of that asset or liability. In all other situations in which hedge accounting is
discontinued, the Company continues to carry the derivative at its fair value on the Consolidated
Balance Sheet and recognizes any changes in its fair value in earnings. Stock-based compensation The Company has a stock incentive plan that provides for stock-based
employee compensation, including the granting of stock options and shares of restricted stock, to
certain key employees. The plan is more fully described in Note 12. Effective January1, 2006,
the Company adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No123R, Share-based Payment
SFAS 123R, which requires, among other things, that compensation expense be recognized for
employee stock options. Prior to the adoption of SFAS 123R, the Company accounted for stock
compensation using the recognition and measurement principles of Accounting Principles Board
Opinion No25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees, and related Interpretations. Under
that method, compensation expense was recorded only if the current market price of the underlying
stock on the date of grant exceeded the option exercise price. Since stock options are granted at
exercise prices that equal the market value of the underlying common stock on the date of grant
under the Companys stock incentive plan, no compensation expense related to stock options was
recorded in the Consolidated Statements of Income prior to January1, 2006. Earnings per common share Basic earnings per common share is computed by dividing net income by
the weighted average number of shares outstanding including redeemable common stock, which
totaled 745 for 2008, 747million for 2007 and 741million for 2006. Diluted earnings per share
EPSis computed by dividing net income by the weighted average number of shares outstanding,
including the dilutive effect of outstanding stock options and other shares associated with
long-term incentive compensation plans. The weighted average number of shares outstanding for
diluted EPS calculations was 759million, 765million and 758million for 2008, 2007 and 2006,
respectively. In 2008 and 2007, options to purchase approximately 13million and 6million shares of common stock,
respectively, were excluded 50 from the calculation of the weighted average number of shares
outstanding for diluted EPS because their effects were anti-dilutive. There were no anti-dilutive
stock option shares for 2006. Risks and uncertainties The Company operates domestically and internationally in one business
segment. In each country, the business and assets are subject to varying degrees of risk and
uncertainty. The Company insures its business and assets in each country against insurable risks in
a manner that it deems appropriate. Because of this geographic dispersion, the Company believes
that a loss from non-insurable events in any one country would not have a material adverse effect
on the Companys operations as a whole. Additionally, the Company believes there is no significant
concentration of risk with any single customer or supplier whose failure or non-performance would
materially affect the Companys results. Recently adopted accounting standards In September2006, the Financial Accounting Standards
Board FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards SFAS No157, Fair Value
Measurements SFAS 157. SFAS 157 defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring
fair value and expands disclosures about fair value measurements. The Company has adopted the
provisions of SFAS 157 with respect to financial assets and liabilities effective January1, 2008,
as required. In February2008, the FASB issued Staff Position No.FAS 157-2, Effective Date of
FASB Statement No157, which provides a one year deferral of the effective date of SFAS 157 for
non-financial assets and non-financial liabilities, except those that are recognized or disclosed
in the financial statements at fair value at least annually. In accordance with this
interpretation, the Company has only adopted the provisions of SFAS 157 with respect to its
financial assets and liabilities that are measured at fair value within its 2008 financial
statements. The provisions of SFAS No157 have not been applied to non-financial assets and
non-financial liabilities. The major categories of assets and liabilities that are measured at
fair value, for which the Company has not applied the provisions of SFAS No157, are as follows:
reporting units measured at fair value in the first step of a goodwill impairment test under SFAS
No142, and long-lived assets measured at fair value for an impairment test under SFAS No144.
The adoption of SFAS 157 did not have a material impact on the Companys results of operations,
financial condition or cash flow. As a result of the adoption of SFAS 157, the Company now
provides additional disclosures in its notes to the financial statements. SFAS 157 defines fair
value as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an
orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. SFAS 157 also establishes
a fair value hierarchy to improve consistency and comparability in fair value measurements and
disclosures. The fair value hierarchy prioritizes the inputs used to measure fair value into three
broad categories referred to as Level 1, Level 2 and Level 3 inputs. Level 1 inputs consist of
quoted prices unadjustedin active markets for identical assets or liabilities. Level 2 inputs
are inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or
liability, either directly or indirectly for substantially the full term of the financial
instrument. Level 2 inputs include quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active
markets, quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not
active, or inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the asset or liability or can be
derived principally from or corroborated by observable market data. Level 3 inputs are
unobservable inputs for the asset or liability. Unobservable inputs shall be used to measure fair
value to the extent that observable inputs are not available, thereby allowing for situations in
which there is little, if any, market activity for the asset or liability at the measurement date. Presented below are the fair values of the Companys financial instruments and derivatives at

In February2007, the FASB issued SFAS No159, The Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and
Financial Liabilities SFAS 159. SFAS 159 allows entities the option to measure certain
financial assets and liabilities at fair value at specified election dates. Such election, which
may be applied on an instrument by instrument basis, is typically irrevocable once elected.
Subsequent unrealized gains and losses on items for which the fair value option has been elected
are to be reported in earnings. SFAS 159 is effective for fiscal years beginning after November
15, 2007. The Company adopted SFAS 159 and elected not to measure any additional financial
instruments and other items at fair value. In June2006, the FASB issued FASB Interpretation No48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income
Taxes FIN 48. FIN 48 is an interpretation of FASB Statement No109, Accounting for Income
Taxes, and seeks to reduce the diversity
in practice associated with certain aspects of measurement and recognition in accounting for income
taxes. In addition 51 FIN 48 provides guidance on de-recognition, classification, interest and
penalties, and accounting in interim periods and requires expanded disclosure with respect to
uncertainty in income taxes. The Company adopted FIN 48 effective January1, 2007. The cumulative
effect of the adoption of FIN 48 was reflected as a reduction in the beginning balance of retained
earnings of $2million. See also Note 7 for additional information. In September2006, the FASB issued SFAS No158, Employers Accounting for Defined Benefit Pension
and Other Postretirement Plansan amendment of FASB Statements No87, 88, 106 and 132R SFAS
158. Among other things, SFAS 158 requires companies to: irecognize in the balance sheet, a
net liability or asset and an offsetting adjustment to accumulated other comprehensive income, to
record the funded status of defined benefit pension and other post-retirement benefit plans; ii
measure plan assets and obligations that determine its funded status as of the end of the companys
fiscal year; and iiirecognize in comprehensive income the changes in the funded status of a
defined benefit pension and postretirement plan in the year in which the changes occur. The
requirement to recognize the funded status of a benefit plan and the disclosure requirements are
effective as of the end of the fiscal year ending after December15, 2006. The requirement to
measure the plan assets and benefit obligations as of the year-end balance sheet date is effective
for fiscal years ending after December15, 2008. The Company adopted SFAS 158 effective December
31, 2006 by recording a charge to accumulated other comprehensive loss of $34million, net of
income taxes of $18million, to recognize the unfunded portion of its defined benefit pension and
other postretirement plan liabilities. Effective December31, 2008, the Company began measuring
its plan assets and benefit obligations using a December31, 2008 balance sheet date. Previously,
the Company had used a September30th measurement date. The change to using a year-end
balance sheet measurement date did not have a material impact on the Companys consolidated
financial statements. See also Note 8 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for
additional information. NOTE 3 Acquisitions On February12, 2007, the Company acquired the food business assets of SPI Polyols, a subsidiary of
ABF North America Holdings, Inc., and the common shares of an SPI unit that owned the 50percent of
Getec Guanabara Quimica Industrial S.A. GETEC not previously held by Corn Products
International. GETEC is a major Brazilian producer of polyols, including liquid sorbitol and
mannitol, and anhydrous dextrose, for the personal care, food, candy and confectionary, and
pharmaceutical markets. The Company paid approximately $66million in cash to complete this
acquisition, which was accounted for under the purchase method of accounting. Goodwill of
approximately $43million was recorded. Effective with the acquisition, GETEC, which was
previously accounted for as a non-controlled affiliate under the equity method, became a
wholly-owned consolidated subsidiary of the Company. On August31, 2006, the Companys wholly-owned subsidiary, Corn Products Brasil Ingredientes
Industriais Ltda. Corn Products Brazil, paid $22million in cash to increase its ownership
interest in GETEC from 20percent to 50percent. The Company accounted for this investment as a
non-controlled affiliate under the equity method of accounting until February2007 when, as
discussed above, it increased its ownership in GETEC to 100percent. On December19, 2006, the Companys wholly-owned Argentinean subsidiary, Productos de Maiz, S.A.,
paid $16million in cash to acquire substantially all of the common stock of DEMSA Industrial
Peru-Derivados del Maiz, S.A. DEMSA, the only corn refiner in Peru. Goodwill of approximately
$4million was recorded. Established in 1964, DEMSA sells regular and modified corn starch,
glucose, grits, corn oil, corn flour, hominy feed, caramel color and other products to the food and
beverage, papermaking, corrugated, pharmaceutical, textiles and animal feed markets. All of the Companys acquisitions were accounted for under the purchase method. Had the
acquisitions described above occurred at the beginning of the respective years, the effect on the
Companys consolidated financial statements would not have been significant. 52 NOTE 4 Financial Instruments, Derivatives and Hedging Activities Fair value of financial instruments The carrying values of cash equivalents, accounts receivable, accounts payable and short-term
borrowings approximate fair values. Futures contracts, which are designated as hedges of specific
volumes of commodities are recognized at fair value. Foreign currency forward contracts, swaps and
options hedge transactional foreign exchange risk related to assets and liabilities denominated in
currencies other than the functional currency and are recognized at fair value. The Companys
treasury lock agreements, which lock the benchmark rate for an anticipated fixed rate borrowing,
are recognized at fair value. The fair value of the Companys long-term debt is estimated based on
quotations of major securities dealers who are market makers in the securities. Presented below
are the carrying amounts and the fair values of the Companys long-term debt at December31, 2008
and 2007.

Derivatives The Company uses financial instruments primarily to manage the exposure to price risk related to
the purchases of corn and natural gas used in the manufacturing process, to manage transactional
foreign exchange risk and to manage its exposure to changes in interest rates on existing or
anticipated borrowings. The Company generally does not enter into derivative instruments for any
purpose other than hedging the cash flows associated with future interest payments on variable rate
debt and specific volumes of commodities that will be purchased and processed in a future month,
and hedging the exposure related to changes in the fair value of certain outstanding fixed rate
debt instruments and hedging transactional foreign exchange risk. The Company generally uses
derivative instruments such as forward contracts, currency swaps and options to manage
transactional foreign exchange risk and generally hedges twelve to eighteen months forward. As of
December31, 2008, we had $34million of net notional foreign currency forward contracts that
hedged net liability transactional exposures. As of December31, 2007, we had $14million of net
notional foreign currency forward contracts that hedged net liability transactional exposures. The derivative financial instruments that the Company uses in its management of commodity-price
risk include corn futures contracts and options traded through regulated commodity exchanges and
over-the-counter gas swaps. The derivative financial instruments that the Company uses in its
management of interest rate risk consist of interest rate swap and treasury lock agreements. By
using derivative financial instruments to hedge exposures to changes in commodity prices and
interest rates, the Company exposes itself to credit risk and market risk. Credit risk is the risk
that the
counterparty will fail to perform under the terms of the derivative contract. When the fair value
of a derivative contract is positive, the counterparty owes the Company, which creates credit risk
for the Company. When the fair value of a derivative contract is negative, the Company owes the
counterparty and, therefore, it does not possess credit risk. The Company minimizes the credit
risk in derivative instruments by entering into transactions only with investment grade
counterparties. Market risk is the adverse effect on the value of a financial instrument that
results from a change in commodity prices or interest rates. The market risk associated with
commodity-price and interest rate contracts is managed by establishing and monitoring parameters
that limit the types and degree of market risk that may be undertaken. 53 The Company maintains a commodity-price risk management strategy that uses derivative instruments
to minimize significant, unanticipated earnings fluctuations caused by commodity-price volatility.
For example, the manufacturing of the Companys products requires a significant volume of corn and
natural gas. Price fluctuations in corn and natural gas cause market values of corn inventory to
differ from its cost and the actual purchase price of corn and natural gas to differ from
anticipated prices. The Company periodically enters into futures and option contracts for a portion of its anticipated
corn and natural gas usage, generally over the next twelve months, in order to hedge the price risk
associated with fluctuations in market prices. The contracts limit the unfavorable effect that
price increases will have on corn and natural gas purchases. All of the Companys futures and
option contracts have been designated as cash flow hedges. Unrealized gains and losses associated with marking the corn and natural gas futures and option
contracts to market are recorded as a component of other comprehensive income lossand included
in the stockholders equity section of the Consolidated Balance Sheets as part of accumulated other
comprehensive loss. These amounts are subsequently reclassified into earnings in the month in
which the related corn or natural gas is used or in the month a hedge is determined to be
ineffective. The Company assesses the effectiveness of a hedge using a corn or natural gas futures or option
contract based on changes in the contracts intrinsic value. The changes in the market value of
such contracts have historically been, and are expected to continue to be, highly effective at
offsetting changes in the price of the hedged items. The amounts representing the ineffectiveness
of these cash flow hedges are not significant. The Company assesses its exposure to variability in interest rates by continually identifying and
monitoring changes in interest rates that may adversely impact future cash flows and the fair value
of existing debt instruments, and by evaluating hedging opportunities. The Company maintains risk
management control systems to monitor interest rate risk attributable to both the Companys
outstanding and forecasted debt obligations as well as the Companys offsetting hedge positions.
The risk management control systems involve the use of analytical techniques, including sensitivity
analysis, to estimate the expected impact of changes in interest rates on the fair value of the
Companys outstanding and forecasted debt instruments. The Company uses a combination of fixed and variable rate debt to finance its operations. The debt
obligations with fixed cash flows expose the Company to variability in the fair value of
outstanding debt instruments due to changes in interest rates. The Company has, from time to time,
entered into interest rate swap agreements that effectively converted the interest rate on certain
fixed-rate debt to a variable rate. These swaps called for the Company to receive interest at a
fixed rate and to pay interest at a variable rate, thereby creating the equivalent of variable-rate
debt. The Company designated these interest rate swap agreements as hedges of the changes in fair
value of the underlying debt obligation attributable to changes in interest rates and accounted for
them as fair value hedges. Changes in the fair value of interest rate swaps designated as hedging
instruments that effectively offset the variability in the fair value of outstanding debt
obligations are reported in earnings. These amounts offset the gain or loss that is, the change
in fair value of the hedged debt instrument that is attributable to changes in interest rates
that is, the hedged risk which is also recognized in earnings. The Company did not have any
interest rate swap agreements outstanding at December31, 2008 or 2007. In 2007 and 2006, the
Company entered into Treasury Lock agreements the T-Locks that fixed the benchmark component of
the interest rate to be established for certain fixed rate debt see also Note 5. The T-Locks are
designated as hedges of the variability in cash flows associated with future interest payments
caused by market fluctuations in the benchmark interest rate until the fixed interest rate is
established, and are accounted for as cash flow hedges. Accordingly, changes in the fair value of
the T-Locks are recorded to other comprehensive income lossuntil the consummation of the
underlying debt offering, at which time any realized gain lossis amortized to earnings over the
life of the debt. The net gain or loss recognized in earnings during 2008, 2007 and 2006,
representing the amount of the Companys hedges ineffectiveness and the
component of the Companys derivative instruments gain or loss excluded from the assessment of
hedge effectiveness, was not significant. At December31, 2008, the Companys accumulated other comprehensive loss account included $179
million of losses, net of tax of $107million, pertaining to commodities related derivative
instruments that hedge the anticipated cash flows from future transactions, most of which are
expected to be recognized in earnings within the next twelve months. Transactions and events
expected to occur over the next twelve months that will necessitate reclassifying these derivative
losses to earnings include the sale of finished goods inventory that includes previously hedged
purchases of raw corn and the usage of hedged natural gas. Additionally, the Companys accumulated
other comprehensive loss account at December31, 2008 54 included $8million of losses, net of tax of $5million, related to T-Locks. Cash flow hedges
discontinued during 2008 were not material. NOTE 5 Financing Arrangements The Company had total debt outstanding of $866million and $649million at December31, 2008 and
2007, respectively. Short-term borrowings at December31, 2008 and 2007 consist primarily of
amounts outstanding under various unsecured local country operating lines of credit. Short-term borrowings consist of the following at December31

The Company has a $500million senior, unsecured revolving credit facility consisting of a $470
million US revolving credit facility and a $30million Canadian revolving credit facility
together, the Revolving Credit Agreement that matures April26, 2012. The Canadian revolving
credit facility is guaranteed by Corn Products International, Inc. At December31, 2008, there
were $146million of borrowings outstanding under the US revolving credit facility and $29million
of borrowings outstanding under the Canadian revolving credit facility. At December31, 2007,
there were no outstanding borrowings under the US revolving credit facility or the Canadian
revolving credit facility. On April10, 2007, the Company sold $200million of 60percent Senior Notes due April15, 2017 and
$100million of 6625percent Senior Notes due April15, 2037. Interest on the notes is required
to be paid semi-annually on April15th and October15th. The notes are unsecured
obligations of the Company and rank equally with the Companys other unsecured, senior
indebtedness. The Company may redeem the notes, in whole at any time or in part from time to time,
at its option at a redemption price equal to the greater of: i100percent of the principal
amount of the notes to be redeemed; and iithe sum of the present values of the remaining
scheduled payments of principal and interest thereon not including any portion of such payments of
interest accrued as of the date of redemption, discounted to the date of redemption on a
semi-annual basis assuming a 360-day year consisting of twelve 30-day months at the Treasury Rate
as defined in the applicable Indenture, plus, in the case of the 2017 notes, 25 basis points and
plus, in the case of the 2037 notes, 30 basis points, plus, in each case, accrued interest thereon
to the date of redemption. The net proceeds from the sale of the notes were used by the Company to
repay its $255million 825percent Senior Notes at the maturity date of July15, 2007 including
accrued interest thereon, and for general corporate purposes. In February2007, Corn Products Brasil Ingredientes Industriais Ltda., the Companys wholly-owned
Brazilian subsidiary, entered into two floating rate government export loans totaling $23million
to finance the acquisition of the remaining ownership interest in GETEC. The notes are local
currency denominated obligations that mature in January2010. Long-term debt consists of the following at December31

million in 2012, $200million in 2017 and $100million in 2037. The Companys long-term debt at
December31, 2008 includes $181million of 845percent senior notes that mature August15, 2009.
These borrowings are included in long-term debt as the Company has the ability and intent to
refinance the notes on a long-term basis prior to the maturity date. Corn Products International, Inc. guarantees certain obligations of several of its consolidated
subsidiaries, which aggregated $51million and $37million at December31, 2008 and 2007,
respectively. As noted above, the Company plans to refinance its $181million of 845percent senior notes due
August2009, by issuing long-term, fixed rate debt in 2009. In conjunction with this plan and in
order to manage its exposure to variability in the benchmark interest rate on which the fixed
interest rate of the planned debt will be based, the Company entered into a Treasury Lock agreement
the T-Lock with respect to $50million of such future indebtedness. The T-Lock is designated
as a hedge of the variability in cash flows associated with future interest payments caused by
market fluctuations in the benchmark interest rate between the time the T-Lock was entered and the
time the debt is priced. It is accounted for as a cash flow hedge. Accordingly, changes in the
fair value of the T-Lock are recorded to other comprehensive income lossuntil the consummation
of the planned debt offering, at which time any realized gain losswill be amortized over the
life of the debt. In 2006, the Company had entered into Treasury Lock agreements the T-Locks that fixed the
benchmark component of the interest rate to be established for the $200million 60percent Senior
Notes due April15, 2017. The T-Locks were accounted for as cash flow hedges. The T-Locks expired
on March21, 2007 and the Company paid approximately $5million, representing the losses on the
T-Locks, to settle the agreements. The $5million loss is included in accumulated other
comprehensive loss and is being amortized to financing costs over the term of the $200million 60
percent Senior Notes due April15, 2017. On February1, 2006, the Company terminated its remaining fixed to floating interest rate swap
agreements associated with its 845percent senior notes. The swap termination resulted in a gain
of approximately $3million, which approximated the fair value of the swap contract. The fair
value adjustment to the hedged debt at the termination date $3million is being amortized as a
reduction to financing costs over the remaining term of the underlying debt through August2009. 56 NOTE 6 Leases The Company leases rail cars, certain machinery and equipment, and office space under various
operating leases. Rental expense under operating leases was $30million, $27million and $24
million in 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively. Minimum lease payments due on leases existing at

Net operating loss carryforwards at December31, 2008 include state net operating losses of $2
million and foreign net operating losses of $9million. The state net operating losses expire in
various years through 2028. Foreign net operating losses of $6million will expire in 2009 through
2013 if unused, while $3million may be carried forward indefinitely. The foreign tax credit
carryforwards of $29million at December31, 2008 will expire in 2012 through 2018 if not utilized. SFAS No109, Accounting for Income Taxes, requires that a valuation allowance be established when
it is more likely than not that all or a portion of a deferred tax asset will not be realized. In
making this assessment, management considers the level of historical taxable income, scheduled
reversal of deferred tax liabilities, tax planning strategies, and projected future taxable income.
The Company maintains a valuation allowance of $26million against certain foreign tax credits and
foreign net operating losses that management has determined will more likely than not expire prior
to realization. The valuation allowance at December31, 2008, with respect to foreign tax credit
carryforwards, increased to $19million from $18million at December31, 2007. The valuation
allowance with respect to foreign net operating losses decreased to $7million at December31, 2008
from $8million at December31, 2007. A reconciliation of the federal statutory tax rate to the Companys effective tax rate follows

Provisions are made for estimated US and foreign income taxes, less credits that may be available,
on distributions from foreign subsidiaries to the extent dividends are anticipated. No provision
has been made for income taxes on 58 approximately $919million of undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries at December31, 2008,
as such amounts are considered permanently reinvested. The Company adopted FIN 48 effective January1, 2007. A reconciliation of the beginning and

Of this total, $14million represents the amount of unrecognized tax benefits that, if recognized,
would affect the effective tax rate in future periods. The Company accounts for interest and penalties related to income tax matters in income tax
expense. The Company had accrued interest and penalties of $3million as of December31, 2008 and
$4million as of December31, 2007. The Company is subject to US federal income tax as well as income tax in multiple state and non-US
jurisdictions. The Internal Revenue Service IRS has concluded its audit of all years through
2004. The Company remains subject to potential examination in Canada for the years 2000 to 2008,
Brazil for the years 2002 to 2008 and Mexico for the years 2004 to 2008. The statute of
limitations is generally open for the years 2002 to 2008 for various other non-US jurisdictions. During 2008 and 2007, the Company made deposits of approximately $13million and $17million,
respectively, to the Canadian tax authorities relating to an ongoing audit examination. The
Company has settled $2million of the claims and is in the process of appealing the remaining items
from the audit. It is expected that the appeal process will not be concluded within the next
twelve months. The Company believes that it has adequately provided for the most likely outcome of
the appeal process. It is reasonably possible that the total amount of unrecognized tax benefits will increase or
decrease within twelve months of December31, 2008. The Company currently estimates that such
increases or decreases will not be significant. NOTE 8 Benefit Plans The Company and its subsidiaries sponsor noncontributory defined benefit pension plans covering
substantially all employees in the United States and Canada, and certain employees in other foreign
countries. Plans for most salaried employees provide pay-related benefits based on years of
service. Plans for hourly employees generally provide benefits based on flat dollar amounts and
years of service. The Companys general funding policy is to make contributions to the plans in
amounts that are within the limits of deductibility under current tax regulations. Certain foreign
countries allow income tax deductions without regard to contribution levels, and the Companys
policy in those countries is to make the contribution required by the terms of the applicable plan.
Domestic plan assets consist primarily of common stock, corporate debt securities and short-term
investment funds. Domestic salaried employees are covered by a defined benefit cash balance pension plan, which
provides benefits based on service and Company credits to the participating employees accounts of
between 3percent and 10percent of base salary, bonus and overtime. The Company also provides healthcare and/or life insurance benefits for retired employees in the
United States, Canada and Brazil. US salaried employees are provided with access to postretirement
medical insurance through Retirement Health Care Spending Accounts. US salaried employees accrue
an account during employment, which can be used after employment to purchase postretirement medical
insurance from the Company and Medigap or through Medicare HMO policies after age 65. The accounts are credited with a flat dollar amount and indexed for
inflation annually during 59 employment. The accounts also accrue interest credits using a rate equal
to a specified amount above the yield on five-year Treasury notes. Employees can use the amounts
accumulated in these accounts, including credited interest, to purchase postretirement medical
insurance. Employees become eligible for benefits when they meet minimum age and service
requirements. The Company recognizes the cost of these postretirement benefits by accruing a flat
dollar amount on an annual basis for each domestic salaried employee. The Company has the right to
modify or terminate these benefits. Healthcare benefits for retirees outside the United States and
Canada are generally covered through local government plans. The Company adopted the recognition provisions of SFAS 158 effective December31, 2006 by recording
a charge to accumulated other comprehensive loss of $34million, net of income taxes of $18
million, to recognize the unfunded portion of its defined benefit pension and other postretirement
plan liabilities. This charge includes a credit of $3million, net of tax of $2million,
associated with the reversal of a minimum pension liability. SFAS 158 requires the Company to change the measurement date from September30 to December31,
effective December31, 2008 for the US plans. The non-US plans were not affected by the change in
the measurement date as they have historically been measured as of December31, 2008. As a result,
the Company adjusted retained earnings by approximately $1million, representing the net periodic
benefit cost for the period between September30, 2007 and January1, 2008. The company elected to
use the 15month approach as allowed under FAS 158. Pension Obligation and Funded Status The changes in pension benefit obligations and plan assets

The Company has assumed an expected long-term rate of return on assets of 725percent for US plans
and 700percent for Canadian plans. In developing the expected long-term rate of return
assumption on plan assets, which consist mainly of US equity and debt securities, management
evaluated historical rates of return achieved on plan assets and the asset allocation of the plans,
input from the Companys independent actuaries and investment consultants, and historical trends
in long-term inflation rates. Projected return estimates made by such consultants are based upon
broad equity and bond indices. The discount rate reflects a rate of return on high quality fixed income investments that match the
duration of the expected benefit payments. The Company has typically used returns on long-term,
high quality corporate AA bonds as a benchmark in establishing this assumption. The discount rate
is reviewed annually. Plan Assets The Companys investment policy for its pension plans is to balance risk and return
through diversified portfolios of high-quality equity instruments, fixed income securities, and
short-term investments. Maturities for fixed income securities are managed such that sufficient
liquidity exists to meet near-term benefit payment obligations. For US pension plans, the weighted
average target range allocation of assets was 41-71percent with equity managers, 19-69percent
with fixed income managers and 1-3percent in cash. The asset allocation is reviewed regularly
and portfolio investments are rebalanced to the targeted allocation when considered appropriate.
The Companys pension plan weighted average asset allocation as of December31, 2008 for US plans
and non-US plans and as of September30, 2007 for US plans and October31, 2007 for non-US plans is

In 2008, the Company made cash contributions of $16million and $8million to its US and non-US
pension plans, respectively. The Company currently anticipates that in 2009 it will make cash
contributions of $3million and $4million to its US and non-US pension plans, respectively. Cash
contributions in subsequent years will depend on a number of factors including the performance of
plan assets. The following benefit payments, which reflect anticipated future service, as

The discount rate reflects a rate of return on high quality fixed income investments that match the
duration of expected benefit payments. The Company has typically used returns on long-term,
high-quality corporate AA bonds as a benchmark in establishing this assumption. The discount rate
is reviewed annually. In measuring the postretirement benefit obligation, for the United States, the Company assumed an
increase in the per capita cost of healthcare benefits of 90percent in 2009, declining ratably to
50percent by the year 2013 and remaining at that level thereafter. For Canada, the Company
assumed an increase in the per capita cost of healthcare benefits of 90percent in 2009, declining
ratably to 50percent by the year 2013 and remaining at that level thereafter. In addition, for
Canada, the Company assumed an increase in the per capita cost of dental benefits of 40percent
per year. Note that the Canada London Union Plan is not affected by health care trend rates. For
Brazil, the Company assumed an increase in the 64 per capita cost of healthcare benefits of 76
percent per year. An increase in the assumed healthcare cost trend rate by 1percentage point
would increase the accumulated postretirement benefit obligation at December31, 2008 by $9
million, while a decrease in the rate of 1percentage point would decrease the obligation by $7
million, with a corresponding effect on the service and interest cost components of the net
periodic postretirement benefit cost for the year then ended of $11million for an increase of 1
percentage point and $09million for a decrease of 1percentage point. Estimated future benefit payments The following benefit payments, which reflect anticipated

The Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement and Modernization Act of 2003 provides a federal
subsidy to employers sponsoring retiree health care benefit plans that provide a benefit that is at
least actuarially equivalent to Medicare PartD. The Company receives a Medicare PartD subsidy
for the certain retirees. The impact of the Medicare PartD subsidy is immaterial for benefit
payment cash flows. NOTE 9  Termination of Proposed Merger Agreement On June23, 2008, the Company and Bunge Limited Bunge announced that the two companies had
entered into a definitive agreement under which Bunge would acquire Corn Products in an all-stock
transaction. The aggregate transaction value based on the price of Bunges stock at that date was
approximately $48billion including assumption of debt. On November10, 2008, the Companys Board of Directors withdrew its recommendation in favor of the
merger agreement and recommended against adoption of the agreement. On the same day Bunges Board
of Directors voted to terminate the merger agreement, citing the decision of the Corn Products
Board of Directors. Under the terms of the agreement, the Company reimbursed Bunge for $10million
of their expenses in connection with the proposed acquisition. In addition, the Company incurred
approximately $6million of expenses relating to the proposed transaction. 65 NOTE 10 Supplementary Information Balance Sheets Supplementary information is set forth below

Natural Gas Purchase Agreement On January20, 2006, Corn Products Brazil CPO Brazil, the Companys wholly-owned Brazilian
subsidiary entered into a Natural Gas Purchase and Sale Agreement the Agreement with Companhia
de Gas de Sao Paulo Comgas Comgas. Pursuant to the terms of the Agreement, Comgas supplies
natural gas to the cogeneration facility at CPO Brazils Mogi Guacu plant. This agreement will
expire on March31, 2023, unless extended or terminated under certain conditions specified in the
Agreement. During the term of the Agreement, CPO Brazil is obligated to purchase from Comgas, and
Comgas is obligated to provide to CPO Brazil, certain minimum quantities of natural gas that are
specified in the Agreement. The price for such quantities of natural gas is determined pursuant to
a formula set forth in the Agreement. The price may vary based upon gas commodity cost and
transportation costs, which are adjusted annually; the distribution margin which is set by the
Brazilian Commission of Public Energy Services; and the fluctuation of exchange rates between the
US dollar and the Brazilian real. We estimate that the total minimum expenditures by CPO Brazil
through the remaining term of the Agreement will be approximately $268million based on current
exchange rates as of December31, 2008 and estimates regarding the application of the formula set
forth in the Agreement, spread evenly over the remaining term of the Agreement. CPO Brazil will
make payments of approximately $19million in each of the next five years in accordance with the
Agreement. The amount of gas purchased under this Agreement for the years ended December31, 2008,
2007 and 2006 was approximately $22million, $20million and $19million, respectively. NOTE 11 Redeemable Common Stock The Company has an agreement with certain common stockholders collectively the holder, relating
to 500,000 shares of the Companys common stock, that provides the holder with the right to require
the Company to repurchase those common shares for cash at a price equal to the average of the
closing per share market price of the Companys common stock for the 20 trading days immediately
preceding the date that the holder exercises the put option. The put option is exercisable at any
time until January2010 when it expires. The holder can also elect to sell the common shares on
the open market, subject to certain restrictions. The common shares subject to the put option are
classified as redeemable common stock in the Companys Consolidated Balance Sheets. The Company has the right, but not the obligation, to extend the put option for an additional
three years. The holder of the put option may not require the Company to repurchase less than
500,000 shares on any single exercise of the option. In the event the holder exercises the put
option requiring the Company to repurchase the shares, the Company would be required to pay for the
shares within 90 calendar days from the exercise date. Any amount due would accrue interest at the
Companys revolving credit facility rate from the date of exercise until the payment date. The carrying value of the redeemable common stock was $14million at December31, 2008 and $19
million at December31, 2007, based on the average of the closing per share market prices of the
Companys common stock for the 20 trading days immediately preceding the respective balance sheet
dates $2862 per share and $3830 per share at December31, 2008 and 2007, respectively.
Adjustments to mark the redeemable common stock to market value are recorded directly to additional
paid-in capital in the stockholders equity section of the Companys Consolidated Balance Sheets.
During 2007, the holder sold 727,000 shares of redeemable common stock in open market transactions.
There were 500,000 shares of redeemable common stock outstanding at December31, 2008 and 2007. 67 NOTE 12 Stockholders Equity Preferred stock The Company has authorized 25million shares of $001 par value preferred stock, none of which were
issued or outstanding as of December31, 2008 and December31, 2007. Treasury Stock During 2008, the Company issued, from treasury, 45,500 restricted common shares and 583,835 common
shares upon the exercise of stock options under the stock incentive plan and 206,582 common shares
under other incentive plans. During 2007, the Company issued, from treasury, 77,950 restricted
common shares and 875,774 common shares upon the exercise of stock options under the stock
incentive plan and 7,027 common shares under other incentive plans. During 2006, the Company
issued, from treasury, 67,700 restricted common shares and 1,300,095 common shares upon the
exercise of stock options under the stock incentive plan and 34,522 common shares under other
incentive plans. The Company reacquired 18,527, 32,040 and 28,000 shares of its common stock during 2008, 2007 and
2006, respectively, by both repurchasing shares from employees under the stock incentive plan and
through the cancellation of forfeited restricted stock. The Company repurchased shares from
employees at average purchase prices of $3396, $4488 and $3180, or fair value at the date of
purchase, during 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively. All of the acquired shares are held as common
stock in treasury, less shares issued to employees under the stock incentive plan. On November7, 2007, the Companys Board of Directors approved a common stock repurchase program
that permits the Company to purchase up to 5million shares of its outstanding common stock over a
period that runs through November30, 2010. In 2008, the Company repurchased 25,000 common shares
in open market transactions at a cost of approximately $09million. In 2007, the Company
repurchased 1,480,500 common shares in open market transactions at a cost of approximately $55
million. Substantially all of the 2007 repurchases were made under the Companys previously
authorized 4million share repurchase program, except for 32,100 shares that were repurchased under
the existing 5million share program. At December31, 2008 the Company had 4,942,900 shares
available to be repurchased under its existing program. The Company has repurchased all of the
shares allowed under its previously authorized 4million share repurchase program. In 2006, the
Company repurchased 862,800 common shares in open market transactions at a cost of $23million.
The parameters of the Companys stock repurchase program are not established solely with reference
to the dilutive impact of shares issued under the Companys stock incentive plan. However, the
Company expects that, over time, share repurchases will offset the dilutive impact of shares issued
under the stock incentive plan. 68 Set forth below is a reconciliation of common stock share activity for the years ended December31,
2006, 2007 and 2008

Share-based payments The Company has a stock incentive plan SIP administered by the compensation committee of
its Board of Directors that provides for the granting of stock options, restricted stock and other
stock-based awards to certain key employees. A maximum of 8million shares were originally
authorized for awards under the SIP. As of December31, 2008, 44million shares were available
for future grants under the SIP. Shares covered by awards that expire, terminate or lapse will
again be available for the grant of awards under the SIP. Total share-based compensation expense
for 2008 was $13million, net of income tax effect of $4million. The Company granted nonqualified options to purchase 812,800, 777,600 and 1,084,200 shares of the
Companys common stock during 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively. The options are exercisable upon
vesting, which occurs for grants issued in 2008 and 2007 evenly over a three-year period at the
anniversary dates of the date of grant, and have a term of 10years. Stock options granted prior
to 2007 are exercisable upon vesting, which occurs in 50percent increments at the one and two year
anniversary dates of the date of grant, and also have a term of 10years. Compensation expense is
recognized on a straight-line basis for awards. As of December31, 2008, certain of these
nonqualified options have been forfeited due to the termination of employees. The fair value of stock option awards was estimated at the grant dates using the Black-Scholes
option pricing model with the following assumptions

The expected life of options represents the weighted average period of time that options granted
are expected to be outstanding giving consideration to vesting schedules and the Companys
historical exercise patterns. The risk-free interest rate is based on the US Treasury yield curve
in effect at the time of the grant for periods corresponding with the expected life of the options.
Expected volatility is based on historical volatilities of the Companys common stock. Dividend
yields are based on historical dividend payments. The weighted average fair value of options
granted during 2008, 2007 and 2006 was estimated to be $906, $1033 and $772, respectively. 69 A summary of stock option and restricted stock transactions for the last three years follows

The number of options exercisable at December31, 2008 was 31million. Stock options outstanding at December31, 2008 had an aggregate intrinsic value of approximately
$26million and an average remaining contractual life of 62years. Stock options exercisable at
December31, 2008 had an aggregate intrinsic value of approximately $26million and an average
remaining contractual life of 51years. Stock options outstanding at December31, 2007 had an
aggregate intrinsic value of approximately $61million and an average remaining contractual life of
63years. Stock options exercisable at December31, 2007 had an aggregate intrinsic value of
approximately $53million and an average remaining contractual life of 54years. In addition to stock options, the Company awards shares of restricted common stock to certain key
employees. The restricted shares issued under the plan are subject to cliff vesting, generally for
five years provided the employee remains in the service of the Company. Expense is recognized on a
straight-line basis over the vesting period taking into account an
estimated forfeiture rate. The fair value of the restricted stock is
determined based upon the number of shares granted 70 and the quoted market price of the Companys common stock at the date of
the grant. Compensation expense pertaining to these awards was $1million in each of 2008, 2007,
and 2006. The following table summarizes restricted share activity for the year ended December31, 2008

The weighted-average fair value of restricted stock granted during the year ended December31,
2008, 2007 and 2006 was $3436, $3443 and $2789, respectively.
Restricted stock with a total fair value of $1million vested in
each of 2008, 2007 and 2006. As of December31, 2008, additional paid-in capital included $3million of unrecognized
compensation cost related to restricted stock that will be amortized on a weighted-average basis
over 21years. The recognized compensation cost related to restricted stock totaling $2million
at December31, 2008 is included in share-based payments subject to redemption in the Consolidated
Balance Sheet. Other share-based awards under the SIP Under the compensation agreement with the Board of Directors at least 50percent of a directors
compensation is awarded based on each directors election to receive such compensation in the form
of restricted stock units, which track investment returns to changes in value of the Companys
common stock with dividends being reinvested. Stock units under this plan vest immediately. The
compensation expense relating to this plan included in the Consolidated Statements of Income for
2008, 2007 and 2006 was not material. At December31, 2008, there were approximately 190,000 share
units outstanding under this plan at a carrying value of approximately $6million. The Company has a long term incentive plan for officers under which awards thereunder are
classified as equity in accordance with SFAS 123R. The ultimate payment of the performance shares
will be based 50percent on the Companys stock performance as compared to the stock performance of
a peer group and 50percent on a return on capital employed versus the target percentage.
Compensation expense for the stock performance portion of the plan is based on the fair value of
the plan that is determined on the day the plan is established. The fair value is calculated using
a Monte Carlo simulation model. Compensation expense for the return on capital employed portion of
the plan is based on the probability of attaining the target percentage goal and is reviewed at the
end of each reporting period. The total compensation expense for these awards is being amortized
over a three-year service period. Compensation expense relating to these awards included in the
Consolidated Statements of Income for 2008, 2007 and 2006 was
$5million, $5million and $2million, respectively. These amounts are included in share-based payments subject to redemption in
the Consolidated Balance Sheet at December31, 2008. As of December31, 2008, the unrecognized
compensation cost relating to these plans was $3million, which will be amortized over the
remaining requisite service period of 2years. This amount will vary each reporting period based
on changes in the probability of attaining the goal. 71 Accumulated Other Comprehensive Loss A summary

NOTE 13 Mexican Tax on Beverages Sweetened with HFCS On January1, 2002, a discriminatory tax on beverages sweetened with high fructose corn syrup
HFCS approved by the Mexican Congress late in 2001, became effective. In response to the
enactment of the tax, which at the time effectively ended the use of HFCS for beverages in Mexico,
the Company ceased production of HFCS 55 at its San Juan del Rio plant, one of its three plants in
Mexico. Over time, the Company resumed production and sales of HFCS and by 2006 had returned to
levels attained prior to the imposition of the tax as a result of certain customers having obtained
court rulings exempting them from paying the tax. The Mexican Congress repealed this tax effective
January1, 2007. In response to the imposition of the tax, the Company submitted an arbitration claim against the
government of Mexico under the provisions of the North American Free Trade Agreement NAFTA
seeking recovery for damages. In July2006, a hearing of the NAFTA Tribunal in the case was held
to determine whether Mexico has state responsibility for a violation of obligations owed by Mexico
to foreign investors under NAFTA Chapter11. In a decision dated January15, 2008, the Tribunal
issued an order holding that Mexico had violated NAFTA Article1102, National Treatment. In July
2008, a hearing regarding the amount of damages was held before the same Tribunal. The Company
sought damages and pre- and post-judgment interest totaling to $288million through December31,
2008. The Tribunal asked for post-hearing submissions on specific topics relative to the damages
claims which were filed on October31, 2008. The amount and timing of a final award by the
Tribunal is not known at this time. 72 NOTE 14 Segment Information The Company operates in one business segment, corn refining, and is managed on a geographic
regional basis. Its North America operations include corn-refining businesses in the United
States, Canada and Mexico. The Companys South America operations include corn-refining businesses

in our internal control over financial reporting during the quarter ended December31, 2008 that
have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over
financial reporting. Managements Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over
financial reporting. This system of internal controls is designed to provide reasonable assurance
that assets are safeguarded and transactions are properly recorded and executed in accordance with
managements authorization. Internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that   
1.
Pertain to the maintenance of records that, in
reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and
dispositions of our assets.   
2.
Provide reasonable assurance that transactions are

conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United
States, and that our receipts and expenditures are being made only in
accordance with authorizations of our management and directors.   
3.
Provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or
timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of
our assets that could have a material effect on our financial
statements. Management conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of internal control over financial
reporting based on the framework of Internal Control Integrated Framework issued by the Committee
of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission COSO. Based on the evaluation, management
