REPORT OF INDEPENDENT CERTIFIED PUBLIC ACCOUNTANTS  To Viisage Technology, Inc.:  We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Viisage Technology, Inc. and subsidiary as of December 31, 2003 and 2002, and the related
consolidated statements of operations, changes in shareholders equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2003. These financial statements are the responsibility of the Companys management. Our
responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audits.  We conducted our audits in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in the United States of America. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether
the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used
and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.  In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the
consolidated financial position of Viisage Technology, Inc. and subsidiary as of December 31, 2003 and 2002, and the consolidated results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2003, in
conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.  As discussed in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company changed its method of accounting for certain revenue arrangements.  /s/BDO SEIDMAN, LLP  Boston, Massachusetts

VIISAGE TECHNOLOGY, INC.  Notes
To Consolidated Financial Statements  1. DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS
Viisage Technology, Inc. Viisage or the
Company delivers advanced technology identity solutions for governments, law enforcement agencies and businesses concerned with enhancing security, reducing identity theft, providing access control, and protecting personal privacy.
Viisage focuses on identity solutions for civil identification, criminal identification and border management applications that improve personal convenience and security, deter fraud, and reduce identification program costs. By combining secure
document and face recognition biometric technologies that quickly, reliably, and accurately identify individuals in both one-to-one and one-to-many situations, Viisage has created innovative identity solutions. The Companys goal is to help its
customers solve three critical aspects of verifying and managing identities:  assurance that an identification document is authentic,  confidence that the person holding the identification document is uniquely tied to and authorized to use the document, and  verification of the privileges the document grants.  Our business involves two related segments: secure credentials and biometrics. Our secure credentials solutions involve the design, development, marketing
and implementation of integrated software and hardware solutions that produce identification credentials utilizing face recognition and other biometric technologies. The focus of our biometric technology solutions is primarily on applications
designed to deter criminal and terrorist activities, including government research and development contracts.  Viisage combines its proprietary biometric and secure credential software and hardware products with complementary industry standard products to create
identity solutions that integrate into its customers environments. These turnkey solutions integrate secure document technologies, image and data capture, relational databases, and multiple biometrics, improving the customers ability to
process and manage identity information. Applications include passports, drivers licenses, voter registration, national identification credentials, law enforcement, social services, access control, surveillance and PC network and Internet
access security. Viisages primary customers are government agencies with particular penetration in U.S. government agencies such as the Department of State and state departments of motor vehicles, social services, and law enforcement. Viisage
is the sole source provider of high security technology and services to the U.S. Department of State for the production of U.S. passports by virtue of an acquisition in 2004 and has captured a large percentage of the domestic drivers license
market. Viisage also has provided services under subcontracts for projects in the United Arab Emirates, Jamaica, the Philippines and the U.S. Immigration and Naturalization Service.  2. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES  Principles of Consolidation 
The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its wholly owned subsidiary, Biometrica Systems, Inc. All significant
inter-company balances and transactions have been eliminated.  Use of Estimates  The preparation of financial
statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date
of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.  Computation of Net Income Loss per Share  We follow SFAS No. 128, Earnings Per Share, where basic earnings loss per share is computed by dividing income loss available to common
shareholders by the weighted average number of common shares 
49 Table of Contents VIISAGE TECHNOLOGY, INC.  Notes To Consolidated Financial StatementsContinued 
outstanding. The computation of diluted earnings loss per share is similar to the basic earnings loss per share computation except the denominator is
increased to include the number of additional shares that would have been outstanding if the dilutive potential common shares had been issued. In addition, the numerator is adjusted for any changes in income or loss that would result from the
assumed conversions of those potential shares.  Basic and
diluted earnings loss per share calculations are as follows in thousands:  Year Ended December 31 2003 2002 2001 Net loss available to common shareholders used in basic and diluted EPS 17,660 9,530 1,539 Weighted average common shares used in basic EPS 21,445 20,046 16,265 Effect of dilutive securities Weighted average common shares and dilutive potential common shares used in dilutive EPS 21,445 20,046 16,265  The diluted per share
amounts do not reflect the impact of options outstanding, the conversion of convertible subordinated debt, the conversion of convertible preferred stock, or stock warrants, for approximately 4,152,000, 3,382,000 and 3,163,000 shares at December 31,
2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively because the effect of each is antidilutive.  Contract Revenue and Cost Recognition  For the year ended December 31, 2003, we incurred a non-cash charge of $121 million representing the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle related to our adoption of Emerging Issues Task Force 00-21,
Accounting for Revenue Arrangements with Multiple Deliverables, or EITF 00-21, on a cumulative basis as of January 1, 2003.  Secure Credentials Revenue and Cost Recognition  We have determined that our secure credentials contracts involve the provision of multiple elements. The first element consists of hardware, system
design, implementation, training, consumables management, maintenance and support which is accounted for as equipment and related executory services under lease in accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board Statement No. 13, or FASB 13.
The second element consists of customized software which is accounted for as a long-term contract in accordance with AICPA Statement of Position 97-2, Software Revenue Recognition, or SOP 97-2, and Statement of Position 81-1, Accounting
for Performance of Construction-Type and Certain Production-Type Contracts, or SOP 81-1, on a units of delivery method of measurement.  Costs related to the hardware element of our secure credentials contracts are capitalized on the balance sheet and are depreciated over the contract term
beginning when the system goes into service. Our secure credentials contracts typically require us to customize, design, and install equipment and software at customer locations, as well as perform training, supply consumables, maintain the
equipment and provide support services. Nonperformance of training, consumables management, maintenance and support services would prevent us from receiving payment for the costs incurred in the customization, design and installation of the system.
EITF 00-21 limits the amount of revenue allocable to the customization, design and installation of the system to the amount that is not contingent upon the production of credentials. Revenue on these contracts under EITF 00-21 is earned based on,
and is contingent upon, the production of credentials from the system. Due to the contingent 
50 Table of Contents VIISAGE TECHNOLOGY, INC.  Notes To Consolidated Financial StatementsContinued 
performance of credential production in our secure credentials contracts, we defer revenue recognition for the system design and installation phase of our
contracts, including customized software and equipment, and recognize revenue as credentials are produced.  Costs related to the customized software element of our secure credentials contracts are capitalized on the balance sheet during the period in which we
are designing and installing the system and are amortized over the contract term beginning when the system goes into service. Costs related to this element of our secure credentials contracts incurred after the system is in service are expensed as
incurred. Revenue related to this element of our secure credentials contracts is recorded as credentials are produced by the system.  Our secure credentials contracts typically provide that the state department of transportation, or similar agency, will pay a fixed price per credential
produced utilizing a system we design, implement and support. Our fixed pricing includes charges for the use of the system, materials and the data that is stored on the credentials. Prices under these contracts vary depending on, among other things:
Design and integration complexities;  Nature and number of workstations and sites installed;  Projected number of secure credentials to be produced;  Size of the database;  Level of post-installation involvement that will be required of us; and  Competitive environment.  Prior to the adoption of EITF 00-21, we recognized revenue and costs associated with our secure credentials contracts as a single accounting element using
the percentage-of-completion methodology.  Biometrics
Segment Revenue and Cost Recognition  Within our
biometrics segment, our contracts typically provide for the development, customization and installation of face recognition systems for government agencies, law enforcement agencies and businesses. These contracts are generally fixed price, and
include milestones and acceptance criteria for the various deliverables under the contract. Contract prices vary depending on, among other things, design and integration complexities, the nature and number of workstations and sites, the size of the
database, the level of post-installation support and the competitive environment. In certain cases, we provide licenses of off-the-shelf versions of our face recognition software on a per user basis.  We recognize revenue under these contracts using the percentage-of-completion
methodology in accordance with SOP 81-1. We use the percentage-of-completion methodology to account for revenue under these contracts because:  A high level of certainty exists regarding expected cash flows from these contracts; and  A reliable basis exists for determining the percentage of the contract that will be completed at the end of the accounting period.  We measure the percentage complete as costs are incurred or based on
milestones. Revenue is recognized when scheduled performance milestones and customer acceptance criteria have been achieved. These milestones are specific events or deliverables clearly identified in the contract. We recognize revenue based on the
total 
51 Table of Contents VIISAGE TECHNOLOGY, INC.  Notes To Consolidated Financial StatementsContinued 
milestone billable to the customer less revenue related to any future maintenance requirements. Billings occur under these contracts when the milestone is
delivered and accepted by the customer. Milestones can include customized systems, installation and services as defined by the contract.  We record costs and estimated earnings in excess of billings under these contracts as current assets. We record billings in excess of costs and estimated
earnings and accrued contract costs as current liabilities.  Revenue related to software licenses of off-the-shelf face recognition software is recognized in accordance with SOP 97-2. For these software licenses we recognize revenue when:  Persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists;  Delivery has occurred;  The sales price is fixed and determinable;  Collection is probable; and  There are no post delivery obligations.  We adopted EITF 00-21 on a cumulative basis as of January 1, 2003. Based on our evaluation of biometrics contracts and the application of the new
guidance, the adoption of EITF 00-21 did not have an impact on the accounting for revenue from biometrics systems under long-term contracts.  Cash and Cash Equivalents  We consider all highly liquid instruments, with maturity of three months or less when acquired, to be cash equivalents. As of December 31, 2003 and 2002,
cash and cash equivalents consisted entirely of cash and exclude approximately $63 million and $74 million, respectively, the use of which was restricted under our term loan agreement.  Fair Value of Financial Instruments  The carrying amounts of our financial instruments, including cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable and payable and
short and long-term borrowings, approximate fair values.  Accounts Receivable and Concentrations of Credit Risk  Accounts receivable are due principally from government agencies and contractors to government agencies, under long-term contracts that we entered into with our customers. Billings rendered in connection with work performed are in
accordance with the terms of the contract and collateral is not required. Management periodically reviews accounts receivable for possible uncollectible amounts. In the event management determines a specific need for an allowance, a provision for
doubtful accounts is provided. As of December 31, 2003 and 2002 , management determined that no allowance for doubtful accounts was necessary.  For the year ended December 31, 2003, two customers, Pennsylvania Department of Transportation and Illinois Secretary of State, each accounted for more
than 10% of our revenue and an aggregate of 26% of our revenue. As of December 31, 2003, the accounts receivable from these customers was $14 million. For the year ended December 31, 2002, two customers, Connecticut Department of Information
Technology and Mississippi Department of ITS each accounted for over 10% of our revenues and an aggregate of 22% of revenues for the year. As of December 31, 2002, the accounts receivable balances for these customers totaled approximately 
52 Table of Contents VIISAGE TECHNOLOGY, INC.  Notes To Consolidated Financial StatementsContinued 
$349,000. For the year ended December 31, 2001, four customers, Illinois Secretary of State, Unisys Corporation Florida Department of Safety and Motor
Vehicles, Kentucky Transportation Cabinet and Pennsylvania Department of Transportation, each accounted for over 10% of our revenues and an aggregate of 49% of revenues for the year.  Property and Equipment  Property and equipment are recorded at cost or the lesser of fair value or the present value of minimum lease payments for items acquired under capital
leases. Depreciation and amortization are calculated using the straight-line or usage-based methods over the estimated useful lives of the related assets 3 to 7 years or the lease term, whichever is shorter.  System assets related to the hardware and customized software elements of our
secure credentials contracts after January 1, 2003 are depreciated over the related contract terms using the straight-line method beginning when the system goes into service. The straight line method approximates the ratio that current gross
revenues for the contract bear to the total of current and anticipated future gross revenues for that contract in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards SFAS No. 86, Accounting for the Costs Computer Software to be Sold,
Leased, or Otherwise Marketed.  Intangible Assets
Intangible assets consist primarily of completed
technology, patents, customer lists and other assets primarily arising from the acquisition of a business or business assets. These intangible assets are amortized using the straight-line method over their estimated useful lives of 5 to 17 years in
thousands.  December31 WeightedAverage Useful Life 2003 2002 Gross carrying amount Patents 606 534 17years

53 Table of Contents VIISAGE TECHNOLOGY, INC.  Notes To Consolidated Financial StatementsContinued 
Long Lived Assets  We evaluate long-lived assets with finite lives, such as intangible assets, property and equipment and certain other assets,
for impairment in accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 144 SFAS 144, Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets. We record an impairment charge whenever
events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not be recoverable through the estimated undiscounted future cash flows from the use of these assets. When any such impairment exists, the related assets are
written down to fair value.  Research and Development
Research and development costs are charged to expense as
incurred.  Software Development  We review software development costs incurred in accordance with the
provisions of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards SFAS No. 86, Accounting for the Costs of Computer Software to be Sold, Leased, or Otherwise Marketed, which requires that certain costs incurred in the development of computer
software to be sold or leased be capitalized once technological feasibility is reached. Prior to 2002 and for the year ended December 31, 2003 we did not capitalize any software development costs because development costs incurred subsequent to the
establishment of technological feasibility were not material. For the year ended December 31, 2002 we capitalized $207,000 in software development costs, which is being amortized over three years. We recorded amortization expense of $69,000 and
$34,000 related to this asset in fiscal 2003 and 2002, respectively.  Costs related to software developed for internal use are expensed as incurred until technological feasibility has been reached. Costs for externally purchased software is capitalized and depreciated over its estimated useful life not to
exceed five years.  Income Taxes  We account for income taxes under SFAS No. 109, Accounting for Income
Taxes. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the estimated future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases.
Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are measured using currently enacted tax rates. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date. Due to the
uncertainty surrounding the realization of our net deferred tax asset, we have provided a full valuation allowance against this amount.  Stock-Based Compensation  We account for our stock-based compensation plans under Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees, and
accordingly account for employee stock based compensation utilizing the intrinsic value method. SFAS No. 123, Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation, establishes a fair value based method of accounting for stock-based compensation plans. We
have adopted the disclosure only alternative under SFAS No. 123, which requires disclosure of the pro forma effects on earnings and earnings per share as if SFAS No. 123 had been adopted as well as certain other information.  In December 2002, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Statement
of Financial Accounting Standards No. 148, Accounting for Stock-Based CompensationTransition and Disclosure FAS 148, which i amends FAS Statement No. 123, Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation, to provide
alternative methods of 
54 Table of Contents VIISAGE TECHNOLOGY, INC.  Notes To Consolidated Financial StatementsContinued 
transition for an entity that voluntarily changes to the fair value based method of accounting for stock-based employee compensation ii amends the
disclosure provisions of FAS 123 to require prominent disclosure about the effects on reported net income of an entitys accounting policy decisions with respect to stock-based employee compensation and iii amends APB Opinion No. 28,
Interim Financial Reporting, to require disclosure about those effects in interim financial information. Items ii and iii of the new requirements in FAS 148 are effective for financial statements for fiscal years ending after December 15,
2002. We initially adopted FAS 148 beginning for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2002 and continue to account for stock-based compensation utilizing the intrinsic value method. The additional disclosures required by FAS 148 are as follows in
thousands:  Year Ended December 31 2003 2002 2001 Net income loss as reported 17,660 9,530 1,534 Add: stock based employee compensation expense included in reported net income loss, net of tax Deduct: total stock based employee compensation determined under fair value based method for all awards, net of tax 3,358 2,279 3,036 Pro forma net income loss 21,018 11,809 4,570 Earnings per share Basic and diluted, as reported 082 048 009 Basic and diluted, pro forma 098 059 028
Recent Accounting
Pronouncements  In April 2003, the FASB issued SFAS No.
149 which amends and clarifies financial accounting and reporting for derivative instruments, including certain derivative instruments embedded in other contracts, and for hedging activities under SFAS No. 133. In particular, SFAS No. 149 clarifies
under what circumstances a contract with an initial net investment meets the characteristic of a derivative discussed in SFAS No. 133, clarifies when a derivative contains a financing component, amends the definition of an underlying as initially
defined in SFAS No. 133 to conform it to language used in FIN No. 45, Guarantors Accounting and Disclosure Requirements for Guarantees, Including Indirect Guarantees of Indebtedness of Others, and amends certain other existing pronouncements.
SFAS No. 149 is effective for all contracts entered into or modified after June 30, 2003, subject to certain exceptions. The adoption of this statement did not have an impact on our financial position, results of operations, or cash flows.
In May 2003, the FASB issued SFAS No. 150, Accounting for
Certain Financial Instruments with Characteristics of both Liabilities and Equity, which establishes standards for how an issuer classifies and measures certain financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity. SFAS No.
150 requires that an issuer classify a financial instrument that is within its scope as a liability or an asset in some circumstances, while many of such instruments were previously classified as equity or mezzanine equity. The
statement also requires that income statement treatment be consistent with the balance sheet classification. That is, if the instrument is classified as a liability, payments to the holders are interest expense, not dividends, and changes in value
are recorded in earnings. The statement relates to three specific categories of instruments: mandatorily redeemable shares, freestanding written put options and forward contracts that obligate an entity to purchase its own shares, and freestanding
contracts that obligate an entity to pay with its own shares in amounts that are either unrelated, or inversely related, to the price of the shares. SFAS No. 150 is effective immediately

for financial instruments entered into or modified after May 31, 2003 and otherwise is effective in the first interim period beginning after June 15, 2003.
The adoption of this statement did not have an impact on our financial position, results of operations, or cash flows.  In January 2003, the FASB issued Financial Interpretation No. 46, Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities FIN 46, which requires the
consolidation of certain variable interest entities. In December 2003, the FASB issued a revision to FIN 46. The revised FIN 46, which replaces the original FIN 46 issued in January 2003, clarifies the application of Accounting Research Bulletin No.
51, Consolidated Financial Statements, to certain entities in which equity investors do not have the characteristics of a controlling financial interest or do not have sufficient equity at risk for the entity to finance its activities without
additional subordinated financial support. While this interpretation exempts certain entities from its requirements, it also expands the definition of a variable interest entity VIE to a broader group of entities than those previously
considered special-purpose entities SPEs and specifies the criteria under which it is appropriate for an investor to consolidate VIEs. Application of the revised FIN 46 is required in financial statements of public entities
that have interest in structures that are commonly referred to as SPEs for periods ending after December 15, 2003. For all other types of VIEs, application of the revised FIN 46 by public entities is required for periods ending after
March 15, 2004. The application of this interpretation with respect to structures commonly referred to as SPEs did not have a material impact on our financial position, results of operations, or cash flows. We currently do not expect the
application of this interpretation with respect to other types of VIEs to have a material impact on our financial position, results of operations, or cash flows.  In December 2003, the Securities and Exchange Commission SEC published SAB No. 104, Revenue
Recognition. SAB No. 104 was effective upon issuance and supersedes SAB No. 101, Revenue Recognition in Financial Statements, and rescinds the accounting guidance contained in SAB No. 101 related to multiple-element revenue arrangements
that was superseded by EITF Issue No. 00-21. Accordingly, SAB No. 104 rescinds portions of the interpretive guidance included in Topic 13 of the codification of staff accounting bulletins. While the wording of SAB No. 104 has changed to reflect the
guidance of EITF 00-21, the revenue recognition principles of SAB No. 101 have remained largely unchanged. The adoption of SAB No. 104 did not have a material effect on our financial position, results of operations, or cash flows.  3. RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS  Debt  In May 2003 we entered into a loan agreement with Lau Technologies which is a significant shareholder of Viisage, which
provided for four term notes aggregating $73 million but not to exceed an outstanding principal balance of $70 million at any point in time. Two of these term notes, in the amounts of approximately $16 million and $287,000, replaced existing
system finance lease obligations we had with a commercial leasing organization. These finance lease obligations were paid in full with the proceeds of the two new term notes. The remaining two new term notes with borrowing limits of $30 million and
$25 million, are additional financing related to two new state contracts. All four new term notes bear interest at a rate of 85%. We believe that the terms of this loan agreement are the same as the terms that would have been provided to us by an
unaffiliated lender. In particular, the financial covenants under this loan agreement are the same as the financial covenants under our loan agreement with our primary bank lender. We will draw funding on these notes as needed to meet our
obligations for equipment purchases on the related state contracts. As of December 31, 2003 we had approximately $41 million outstanding under this loan agreement, leaving approximately $29 million available for future needs. Interest expense
related to these term notes was $229,000 for the year ended December 31, 2003 See Note 6 for further information.  Licenses  In fiscal 2001 and 2000, we obtained from Lau an exclusive, perpetual, worldwide license to use a U.S. patent purchased from Daozeng Lu and Simon Lu, and
all improvements thereto, which relates to a system for 
56 Table of Contents VIISAGE TECHNOLOGY, INC.  Notes To Consolidated Financial StatementsContinued 
automatically verifying the identity of an individual using identification parameters that are carried on an escort memory such as an identification or
credit card. In 2002, we purchased this patent from Lau as part of the acquisition of Laus face recognition assets.  Other  On January 10, 2002, we acquired the assets of Lau Security Systems, including technology, patents, contracts and distribution channels. In return, we
agreed to pay Lau a royalty of 31% of face recognition revenues over the next 12 and one half years, up to a maximum of $275 million and assume certain liabilities related to the acquired business. Royalty expense included in operating expenses
was approximately $101,000 and $108,000 for the years ended December 31, 2003 and 2002. There were no royalties paid to Lau for these technology patents in 2001.  We provided administrative services for Lau for an annual fee of approximately $109,000 and $114,000 for the years ended
December 31, 2003 and 2002.  A Use and Occupancy Agreement with
Lau requires us to pay our proportionate share of the cost of shared facilities and office services including rent, insurance, property taxes, utilities and other operating expenses, based on square footage or equipment utilized. The annual fee for
facilities and services is revised for changes in space utilized and in operating expenses. For the years ended December 31, 2003, 2002 and 2001 fees paid under this use and occupancy agreement were $725,000, $699,000 and $360,000, respectively.
This agreement was terminated in January 2004.  Our employees
participate in various Lau employee benefit plans. We pay our proportionate share of the costs of such plans based on the number of participating employees.  Management believes the methods for allocating expenses and those costs related to shared facilities and equipment are reasonable and approximate what
these costs would be on a stand-alone basis.  At December 31,
2002 we had $50,000 of accounts receivable due from Lau and approximately $126,000 of accounts payable due to Lau. At December 31, 2003 there was no accounts receivable balance due from Lau and there was $23,000 of accounts payable due to Lau.
We have employment and noncompetition agreements with certain
officers. Such agreements provide for employment and related compensation, and restrict the individuals from competing, as defined, with us during the terms of their respective agreements and for up to two years thereafter. The agreements also
provide for stock options under our stock option plan and for severance payments upon termination under circumstances defined in such agreements.  4. PROPERTY AND EQUIPMENT  Property and equipment are summarized as follows in thousands:  December 31 WeightedAverage Useful Life 2003

850 16,816 451 11,827 10,066  In accordance with the
new loan agreements, all of our term notes are collateralized by certain of our assets and the related contract assets. We are required to maintain the following financial covenants under the agreements in effect at December 31, 2003:  in every fiscal year after January 1, 2003, our secure identification segment must have positive net income, excluding income taxes;  in at least three quarters of each of our fiscal years after January 1, 2003, our secure identification segment must have positive net income, excluding income taxes; if the secure
identification segment has a net loss, that net loss may not exceed $200,000; 
58 Table of Contents VIISAGE TECHNOLOGY, INC.  Notes To Consolidated Financial StatementsContinued  our net loss for the last three fiscal quarters of 2003, excluding income taxes, may not exceed $2,000,000, $2,000,000 and $1,500,000, respectively;  our net loss for the first three fiscal quarters of 2004, excluding income taxes, may not exceed $1,500,000, $1,000,000 and $500,000, respectively;  our net income for the last fiscal quarter of 2004 must be at least $100,000, excluding income taxes;  we must have positive net income, excluding income taxes, beginning with the year ending December31, 2005 and continuing for each year thereafter;  we must have tangible net worth as defined in the loan agreements of at least $30 million at the end of each fiscal quarter beginning with the second fiscal quarter of 2003;
the ratio of our indebtedness as defined in the loan agreements to our tangible net worth as defined must not exceed 25 to 1;  at the end of each fiscal quarter, the ratio of our secure identification segments operating cash flow as defined in the loan agreements for the four most recent fiscal
quarters to our debt service liability as defined in the loan agreements shall be at least 125 to 1; and  our capital expenditures in any fiscal year cannot exceed $1,500,000, and no single capital expenditure can exceed $250,000 without the lenders prior written approval.
Additionally, in accordance with the new
agreement, we must maintain $51 million of cash on deposit with Commerce Bank and Trust Company. This amount is recorded as restricted cash in long-term assets. As of December 31, 2003 we had an additional $12 million of restricted cash at
Commerce related to our loan agreements with Lau.  We are in
compliance with our bank and Lau covenants at December 31, 2003.  We also have one capital lease arrangement where we are also required to maintain the same financial ratios and minimum levels of tangible capital funds, as stated above. Pursuant to this arrangement, the lessor purchases certain of our
digital identification systems and leases them back to us for deployment with identified and contracted customers approved by the lessor. The lessor retains title to systems and has an assignment of our rights under the related customer contracts,
including rights to use the software and technology underlying the related systems. Under these arrangements, the lessor bears the credit risk associated with payments by our customers, but we bear performance and appropriation risk and are
generally required to repurchase a system in the event of a termination by a customer for any reason except credit default. These project lease arrangements are accounted for as capital leases. At December 31, 2003 and 2002, we had approximately
$318,000 and $50million outstanding under these lease-financing arrangements respectively.  In April 2003 we entered into an arrangement for approximately $15 million of equipment financing with three of our suppliers. These project lease
arrangements are accounted for as capital leases. There are no financial covenants associated with these leasing arrangements. As of December 31, 2003 we have outstanding $876,000 under these arrangements. The interest rates on these capital leases
are between 6% and 8% and are fixed. The terms of these leases range from 12 months to 60 months. In August 2003 we entered into an arrangement for financing of database licenses with another vendor. As of December 31, 2003 we have outstanding
$600,000 under this arrangement.

8. LITIGATION  On July 31, 2003 the superior court for Fulton County, Georgia issued a preliminary injunction prohibiting Georgias Department of Motor Vehicle
Safety from continuing to work with us to install a new drivers license system for the State of Georgia. This injunction is the result of a lawsuit filed in March 2003 by one of our competitors, Digimarc ID Systems, LLC. The suit claims that
the Department of Motor Vehicle Safety did not comply with its own bid process when selecting a vendor for the digital drivers license program. The merits of Digimarcs claims against the Department of Motor Vehicle Safety are to be
addressed in further court proceedings. The Department of Motor Vehicle Safety has confirmed that our contract with them remains in place. However, if the lawsuit is successful and we lose the contract, we could lose up to $197 million in revenue
that we expected to recognize over the next five and one-half years. In addition, although we expect that the Department of Motor Vehicle Safety would be required to reimburse us for our costs incurred under the contract, if we are unable to obtain
reimbursement of those costs, we could be required to recognize a loss of up to approximately $5 million for costs incurred to date on the Georgia contract.  9. RETIREMENT BENEFITS  We participate in the Lau 401k plan and pay our proportionate share of plan expenses based on the number of participants. The plan permits pretax
contributions by participants of up to 15% of base compensation. We may make discretionary contributions to the plan, subject to certain limitations. Participants are fully vested in their contributions and vest 20% per year in employer
contributions. Our costs for this plan amounted to approximately $182,000, $191,000 and $99,000 for the years ended December 31, 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively.  We do not offer any postretirement benefits.  10. INCOME TAXES  There was no provision for Federal income taxes for the years ended December 31, 2003, 2002 and 2001 due to the net operating losses.  Income tax expense for the year ended December 31, 2003 represented state
income taxes of $63,000. A reconciliation of the federal statutory rate to our effective tax rate for the years ended December 31, 2003, 2002 and 2001 is as follows:  2003 2002 2001 Federal statutory rate

surrounding the realization of our net deferred tax asset, we have provided a full valuation allowance against this amount.  At December 31, 2003, we have available estimated net operating loss carryforwards for federal tax purposes of approximately $416 million to reduce,
subject to certain limitations, future income taxes. These carryforwards expire from 2012 through 2023 and are subject to review and possible adjustment by the Internal Revenue Service.  11. SHAREHOLDERS EQUITY  Stock Option Plans  Under the 1996 Management Stock Option Plan and the 1996 Director Stock Option Plan the Plans, the Board of Directors may grant incentive and
nonqualified stock options to employees and officers and nonqualified stock options to directors. Generally, incentive stock options are granted at fair market value and are subject to the requirements of Section 422 of the Internal Revenue Code of
1986, as amended. Nonqualified options are granted at exercise prices determined by the Board of Directors. Options granted to date to directors vest immediately or between one to four years from the date of grant. Options granted to management and
employees vest at various rates over periods ranging from three to seven years or, in some cases, earlier if certain performance criteria are met. The performance criteria are based on each $1 million increase in Company value up to approximately $1
billion, as adjusted. All options granted under the Plans expire ten years from the date of grant.  In fiscal year 2001, we adopted the 2001 Stock in Lieu of Cash Compensation for Directors Plan to compensate the non-employee members of the
Board of Directors. The number of shares that may be issued under the plan shall not exceed, in the aggregate, 800,000 shares of our common stock.  During 2003 and 2002, each member of our Board of Directors received $60,000 of compensation in cash and stock. For each year an aggregate of 78,738 and
61,686 shares of common stock, respectively was issued. The fair market value of the common stock on the grant date was approximately $300,000 and $380,000 for the years ended December 31, 2003 and 2002 and was expensed during each year then ended.
In addition, we issued an aggregate of 60,000 stock options to our Board of Directors in each year.  At December 31, 2003, we have reserved 4,807,100 shares of common stock for issuance under the management plan, of which 664,398 shares are available for
future grants. We have reserved 576,616 shares of common stock for issuance under the directors plan, of which 125,000 are available for future grants.

for the years ended December 31, 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively, for currently vested options. The remaining unvested amount of $53 million as of the December 31, 2003, will be amortized over the related future vesting periods.  
63 Table of Contents VIISAGE TECHNOLOGY, INC.  Notes To Consolidated Financial StatementsContinued 
Employee Stock Purchase Plan  In 1997, we adopted the 1997 Employee Stock Purchase Plan and between 1997 and May 2001 and reserved 340,000 shares of
common stock for issuance under the plan. The purchase price is determined by taking the lower of 85% of the closing price on the first or last day of periods defined in the plan. As of December 31, 2003, 260,583 shares have been issued and options
to purchase 5,611 shares of common stock at $306 per share were vested under the plan.  Common Stock  In
February 2002, Lau exercised an option to purchase 60,000 shares of common stock at $190 per share, pursuant to an agreement entered into with us in 1999 under which Lau guaranteed a contract indemnification obligation of ours.  At December 31, 2003 we had outstanding warrants, which can be converted into
812,469 shares of common stock, with exercise prices ranging from $1079 to $1235 and expiration dates from November 30, 2005 to November 6, 2006.  On September 8, 2003, we sold an aggregate of 3,517,503 shares of our common stock, at a purchase price of $3775 per share, in a private sale to
institutional investors. The gross proceeds were approximately $133 million before investment fees and related expenses of approximately $10 million. In addition, on January 27, 2004 we sold an additional 456,007 shares of our common stock at
$3775 per share for proceeds of $17 million in a private sale to the same institutional investors following the closing of the ZN acquisition. We believe that the net proceeds of these sales and cash flow from operations will enable us to fund our
ongoing operations for at least the next 12 months.

12. BUSINESS SEGMENTS, GEOGRAPHICAL INFORMATION, AND CONCENTRATIONS OF RISK  We follow SFAS No. 131 Disclosures about Segments of a Business
Enterprise and Related Information, which establishes standards for reporting information about operating segments. Operating segments are defined as components of a company about which the chief operating decision maker evaluates regularly in
deciding how to allocate resources and in assessing performance.  The following table provides financial information by segment for the years ended December 31, 2003, 2002 and 2001. We allocate direct costs and administrative expenses to each business segment based on managements analysis of each
segments resource needs. Revenue is reported within the segments by customer contracts. Within the secure credentials segment there is a component of the contract that utilizes our biometrics technology. We did not report business segments
prior to 2002 and therefore have not restated our results, other than revenue for the year ended December 31, 2001 to provide segment information because it would be impracticable to do so in thousands.  Year ended December 31, 2003
