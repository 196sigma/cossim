REPORT OF INDEPENDENT PUBLIC ACCOUNTANTS
Board of Directors and Stockholders
MetaTools, Inc.
We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of MetaTools,
Inc. as of December 31, 1996 and 1995, and the related consolidated statements
of operations, stockholders' equity deficit and cash flows for each of the
three years in the period ended December 31, 1996, and the related financial
statement schedule as listed in the index on page 29 of this Form 10-K. These
consolidated financial statements and financial statement schedule are the
responsibility of the Company management. Our responsibility is to express
an opinion on these financial statements and financial statement schedule
based on our audits.
We conducted our audits in accordance with generally accepted auditing
standards. These standards require that we plan and perform the audit to
obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of
material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence
supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit
also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant
estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial
statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis
for our opinion.
In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above
present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of MetaTools,
Inc. as of December 31, 1996 and 1995, and the results of its operations and
its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31,
1996, in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles. In
addition, in our opinion, the financial statement schedule referred to above,
when considered in relation to the basic financial statements taken as a
whole, presents fairly, in all material respects, the information required to
be included therein.

METATOOLS, INC.
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
1. BUSINESS AND ORGANIZATION
The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of MetaTools,
Inc. the Company and its wholly-owned subsidiaries. All significant
intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.
MetaTools is a leading designer of visual computing and graphics software
and technologies for professionals and consumers for Windows, Macintosh and
other digital editing operating systems. MetaTools designs, develops,
publishes, markets and supports visual computing software tools and
technologies for the creation, editing, and manipulation of computer graphic
images, digital art, and Internet/online content.
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally
accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and
assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and
disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial
statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the
reporting period. The Company monitors the activities of its distributors in
an effort to minimize excessive returns and establishes its reserves based on
its estimates of expected returns. While historically the Company returns
have been within expectations, the establishing of reserves requires judgments
regarding such factors as future competitive conditions and product life
cycles, which can be difficult to predict. Actual results could differ from
those estimates.
The computer graphic imaging and visual computing markets, and the personal
computer industry in general, are characterized by rapidly changing
technology, resulting in short product life cycles and price declines. The
Company must continuously update its existing products to keep them current
with changing technology and must develop new products to take advantage of
new technologies that could render the Company existing products obsolete.
The Company future prospects are highly dependent on its ability to keep
pace with its competitors' innovations, to adapt to new operating systems,
hardware platforms and emerging industry standards, and to provide additional
functionality to the Company existing products. The inability of the Company
to develop and introduce such products in a timely manner would have a
material adverse effect on the Company future business, operating results,
financial condition, and cash flows.
2. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
REVENUE RECOGNITION
The Company recognizes revenue in accordance with Statement of Position 91-1
SOP 91-1, Software Revenue Recognition, issued by the American Institute
of Certified Public Accountants. Product revenues are recognized upon shipment
to the customer, satisfaction of significant Company obligations, if any, and
reasonable assurance regarding the collectability of the corresponding
receivable. At the time of shipment, the Company accrues for the estimated
cost of post contract support in accordance with SOP 91-1. The Company
provides an allowance for estimated returns at the time of product shipment
and adjusts this allowance as needed based on actual returns history. At
December 31, 1996 and 1995, the Company had an allowance for potential returns
of approximately $817,000 and $601,000, respectively.
The Company has entered into agreements whereby it licenses products to
original equipment manufacturers and foreign publishers which provide such
customers the right to produce and distribute multiple copies of its software.
Nonrefundable fixed fees are recognized as revenue at delivery of the product
master to the customer, satisfaction of significant Company obligations, if
any, and reasonable assurance regarding the collectability of the
corresponding receivable. Per copy royalties in excess of fixed amounts are
recognized as revenue when such amounts exceed fixed minimum royalties.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS--CONTINUED
INVENTORIES
Inventories consist of finished products and software components, primarily
instruction manuals, diskettes, CD ROMs and packaging ready for assembly. The
Company periodically evaluates the carrying value of its inventories,
including a review for potentially excess or obsolete products, and adjusts
these as necessary. At December 31, 1996 and 1995, the Company had reserves of
approximately $211,000 and $534,000, respectively, for potentially excess or
obsolete inventory items. Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or
market, with cost determined using the first-in, first-out method.
PROPERTY AND EQUIPMENT
Property and equipment are stated at cost. Assets are depreciated on the
straight-line method over their estimated useful lives, which range from 3 to
7 years. Leasehold improvements are amortized over the shorter of the life of
the lease or the life of the asset. Upon sale, any gain or loss is included in
the consolidated statement of operations. Maintenance and minor replacements
are expensed as incurred.
RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT
Research and development costs are expensed as incurred.
SOFTWARE DEVELOPMENT COSTS
The Company accounts for its software development costs in accordance with
Statement of Financial Accounting Standard SFAS No. 86, Accounting for
the Costs of Computer Software to be Sold, Leased or Otherwise Marketed. This
statement provides for capitalization of certain software development costs
once technological feasibility is established. The costs so capitalized are
then amortized on a straight-line basis over the estimated product life
generally eighteen months to three years, or on the ratio of current revenue
to total projected product revenues, whichever is greater. To date, the
establishment of technological feasibility of the Company products and
general release have substantially coincided. As a result, the Company has not
capitalized any internal software development costs since costs qualifying for
such capitalization have not been significant.
ADVERTISING
The Company reports the costs of all advertising as expenses in the periods
in which those costs are incurred. The Company shares portions of certain
distributors' advertising expenses through co-op advertising arrangements.
Advertising expense was approximately $3,384,000, $2,453,000, and $1,328,000
for the years ended December 31, 1996, 1995, and 1994, respectively.
CASH EQUIVALENTS AND SHORT-TERM INVESTMENTS
The Company considers all highly liquid investments purchased with an
original maturity of three months or less to be cash equivalents.
The Company considers its investment portfolio available for sale as defined
in SFAS No. 115. The amortized cost of securities, which approximate market
value at December 31, 1996, are adjusted for amortization of premiums and
accretion of discounts to maturity. Such amortization, realized gains and
losses, interest and dividends, and declines in value judged to be other than
temporary are included in investment income. The cost of securities sold is
based on the specific identification method.

METATOOLS, INC.
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS--CONTINUED
The Company invests its cash in accordance with a policy that seeks to
maximize returns while ensuring both liquidity and minimal risk of principal
loss. The policy limits investments to certain types of instruments issued by
institutions with investment grade credit ratings, and places restrictions on

stock are excluded from the computation when their effect is antidilutive,
except that, pursuant to the Securities and Exchange Commission Staff
Accounting Bulletins, common and common equivalent shares, issued at prices
below the public offering price during the twelve months immediately preceding
the initial filing date of the Company initial public offering have been
included in the calculation as if they were outstanding for all periods
presented, using the treasury stock method and the initial public offering
price. The net income loss attributable to common stockholders excludes the
impact of approximately $192,000 and $21,000 for the years ended December 31,
1995 and 1994, respectively, which represents the preferred stock dividend on
redeemable convertible preferred stock issued within the twelve-month period

were included in the determination of the number of shares used in the per
share calculations.

Deferred income taxes reflect the net tax effects of temporary differences
between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting
purposes and the amounts used for income tax purposes, together with net
operating loss and tax credit carryforwards. Significant components of the
Company deferred tax assets and liabilities are as follows:
DECEMBER 31,
1996     1995
Deferred tax assets:
Allowance for returns and doubtful accounts. $  537,000 $  434,000
Inventory    110,000   294,000
Accrued    130,000   186,000

Net deferred  $  726,000 $                                  
The net change in the valuation allowance for deferred taxes during the year
ended December 31, 1996 was approximately $523,000. The Company management
believes a valuation allowance is required for the net operating losses of RTG
due to potential limitations on the Company ability to utilize the loss
carryforwards pursuant to the ownership rule changes of the Internal Revenue
Code, Section 382. The valuation allowance increased by approximately $227,000
in 1995 as a result of the increase in current temporary differences, offset
by changes in the net operating loss carryforwards.
At December 31, 1996, the Company has net operating loss carryforwards of
approximately $2,591,000 for federal income tax purposes, which begin expiring
in 2011. The Company net operating loss carryforwards relate to the
Company acquisition of RTG Note 3.
14. COMMITMENTS

16. SUBSEQUENT EVENTS
On February 11, 1997, the Company entered into a definitive merger agreement
with Fractal Design Corporation Fractal. The definitive agreement and plan
of reorganization provides that upon the effective date of the merger, each
share of Fractal common stock shall be converted into 0749 shares of the
Company common stock and each option to purchase Fractal common stock will
be converted into options to purchase 0749 shares of the Company common
stock at an exercise price equal to the exercise price to purchase Fractal
options prior to the merger divided by 0749. It is anticipated that
approximately 8,962,000 shares of MetaTools common stock will be issued in
connection with the merger, based upon the number of shares of Fractal common
stock issued and outstanding at December 31, 1996 which number does not
include shares of MetaTools common stock to be issued to holders of options to
purchase shares of Fractal common stock. The merger is intended to be
accounted for as a pooling of interests and the companies intend to structure
the merger to qualify as a tax free reorganization. The merger is contingent
upon customary conditions including the approval of the stockholders of the
Company and the shareholders of Fractal, the occurrence of no event which
could have a material adverse effect with respect to the other party, and the
satisfaction of any governmental or regulatory requirements to legally effect
the merger. The merger is expected to become effective in the quarter ending
June 30, 1997.
