ITEM 8. FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA.           REPORT OF INDEPENDENT PUBLIC ACCOUNTANTS
To Royal Precision, Inc. We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Royal Precision,
Inc. a Delaware corporation and subsidiaries as of May 31, 2000 and 1999 and
the related consolidated statements of operations, stockholders' equity and cash
flows for the three years in the period ended May 31, 2000. These financial
statements  are the  responsibility  of the  Company  management.  Our
responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on
our audits.
We conducted our audits in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted
in the United States. Those standards require that we plan and perform the
audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are
free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis,
evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An
audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant
estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial
statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis
for our opinion.
In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present
fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Royal Precision,
Inc. and subsidiaries as of May 31, 2000 and 1999, and the results of their
operations and their cash flows for the three years in the period ended May 31,
2000 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United
States.                         /s/ ARTHUR ANDERSEN LLP Phoenix, Arizona

In connection with the FMP-RG Merger, RG issued warrants to purchase 50,000
shares of RG common stock to an investment banker. Such warrants are included in
the 982,250 RG options and warrants outstanding as of the Merger date referred
to above. The warrants were exercisable at a price of $002 per share. Such
warrants were exercised in September 1997 for $1,000.
RP recorded a charge of $842,000 during the year ended May 31, 1998 for
nonrecurring expenses related to the FMP-RG Merger. The components of this
expense are $348,000 related to a computer software installation that was
abandoned as a result of the FMP-RG Merger, $100,000 related to certain headwear
related contracts, $150,000 of relocation expenses and $244,000 of severance as
a result of organizational changes in connection with the FMP-RG Merger.
DEPENDENCE ON RIFLE SHAFT SALES Sales of the Rifle shaft were $187 million, $131 million and $98 million
for the years ended May 31, 2000, 1999 and 1998, respectively. While management
believes that demand for the Rifle shaft should remain high for the next
several years, there can be no assurance that sales of the Rifle shaft will
continue to grow or that the product will retain its profitability. If sales or
profitability of the Rifle shaft decrease without the Company introduction
of new profitable products, the Company overall financial performance would be
materially adversely affected.
2. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES PRINCIPLES OF CONSOLIDATION All significant intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in
consolidation.
USE OF ESTIMATES IN THE PREPARATION OF FINANCIAL STATEMENTS The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles
generally accepted in the United States requires management to make estimates
and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and
disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial
statements such as the estimate for impairment of long-lived assets and the
reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual
results could differ from those estimates.
INVENTORIES Inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market. Cost is determined on the
first-in, first-out method.
19
PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT Property, plant and equipment are carried at acquired cost. Major additions and
betterments are capitalized, while replacements, maintenance and repairs which
do not extend the useful lives of the assets are charged to operations as
incurred. Upon the disposition of property, plant and equipment, any resulting
gain or loss is recognized in income.
Depreciation of plant and equipment is provided for, commencing when such assets
are placed in service, using the straight-line basis over the following
estimated useful lives                              USEFUL LIVES
Buildings and improvements               275-40 years
Machinery and equipment                3-12 years
Furniture, fixtures and office equipment        3-12 years
GOODWILL Goodwill, prior to accumulated amortization, of $9,026,000, which is net of
$1,392,000 of reductions related to utilization of pre-merger net operating loss
NOL carryforwards and reversal of related deferred tax assets, related to
the FMP-RG Merger see Note 1, is being amortized over 20 years. At May 31,
2000, accumulated amortization of goodwill was $1,397,000.
LONG-LIVED ASSETS The Company reviews long-lived assets and certain identifiable intangible assets
to be held and used or disposed of for impairment whenever events or changes in
circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be
recoverable. Impairment losses are recognized when the undiscounted future cash
flows, excluding interest costs, exceed the carrying value of the related
assets.
The Company evaluates the goodwill asset for impairment by reviewing the
estimated future cash flows of the acquired operations on a quarterly basis. As
of May 31, 2000, the Company believes no impairment exists.
INCOME TAXES The Company accounts for income taxes in accordance with Statement of Financial
Accounting Standards SFAS No. 109, Accounting for Income Taxes. This
statement requires the Company to recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities
for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in
the Company financial statements or tax returns. Under this method, deferred
tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the difference between the
financial statement carrying amounts and tax bases of assets and liabilities and
tax NOL carryforwards available for tax reporting purposes, using applicable tax
rates for the years in which the differences are expected to reverse. A
valuation allowance is recorded on deferred tax assets unless realization is
more likely than not.
STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION The Company accounts for stock-based compensation for employees under Accounting
Principles Board Opinion No. 25 and has elected the disclosure-only alternative
under SFAS No. 123, Accounting for Stock Based Compensation.
REVENUE RECOGNITION Revenue is recorded upon the passage of title to the customers which generally
occurs upon shipment.
RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT The Company expenses costs of research and development as incurred. Research and
development expense was approximately $07 million, $06 million and $05
million for the years ended May 31, 2000, 1999 and 1998, respectively.
ADVERTISING The Company expenses production costs of advertising the first date the
advertisements take place. Advertising and marketing costs were approximately
$23 million, $16 million and $17 million for the years ended May 31, 2000,
1999 and 1998, respectively. As of May 31, 2000, deferred production and prepaid
advertising costs totaling $115,000 are included in other current assets related
to television commercials which had not yet aired.
20
NET EARNINGS LOSS PER SHARE The Company accounts for earnings loss per share in accordance with SFAS No.
128, Earnings Per Share. Basic earnings loss per share are based on the
average number of common shares outstanding during the year. Diluted earnings
loss per share assumes, in addition to the above, a dilutive effect of common
share equivalents during the year. Common share equivalents represent dilutive
stock options using the treasury stock method.
For the years ended May 31, 2000, 1999 and 1998, options to purchase
approximately 620,000, 147,000 and 437,000 shares of common stock, respectively,
were excluded from the computation of diluted earnings per share because the
exercise prices of those options were greater than the average market price of
the Company common stock. Loss per share for the years ended May 31, 1999 and
1998 were not affected by stock options because their effect was anti-dilutive.
COMPREHENSIVE INCOME Under SFAS No. 130, Reporting Comprehensive Income, the Company is required to
report comprehensive income loss and its components in its consolidated
financial statements in addition to net income loss. Comprehensive loss is
included in the accompanying consolidated statements of stockholders' equity.
RECLASSIFICATIONS Certain prior year balances have been reclassified to conform with the current
year presentation.
NEW ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS In June 1998, the Financial Accounting Standards Board FASB issued SFAS No.
133 as amended by SFAS No. 138, Accounting for Derivative Instruments and
Hedging Activities, which requires that an entity recognize all derivatives as
either assets or liabilities in the statement of financial position and measure
those instruments at fair value. In June 1999, the FASB issued SFAS No. 137
which deferred the effective date of SFAS No. 133. The Company will be required
to adopt SFAS No. 133, as amended, during the fiscal year ending May 31, 2001.
The Company does not anticipate any material impact resulting from the adoption
of SFAS No. 133, as amended.
In December 1999, the Securities and Exchange Commission SEC issued Staff
Accounting  Bulletin SAB No. 101, Revenue  Recognition in Financial
Statements, which was subsequently updated by SAB 101A. SAB 101 and SAB 101A
summarize certain of the SEC views in applying accounting principles generally
accepted in the United States to revenue recognition in financial statements.
The Company is required to adopt SAB 101 no later than the fourth quarter of its
fiscal year ending May 31, 2001. The Company is currently evaluating the impact
of the adoption of SAB 101 on its results of operations and financial position.
3. DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS In March 1999, the operating assets of Roxxi were disposed of through two
separate transactions. Roxxi sold its trade name, customer list, design database
and related computer software and hardware for a royalty of 16% of the buyer
net sales of Roxxi-licensed products for the two-year period beginning May 1,
1999. Roxxi also sold its manufacturing equipment, finished goods inventory and
raw materials to another company for $03 million and a royalty of 2% of the
buyer net sales until the buyer has paid an additional $02 million.
Subsequently, Roxxi name was changed to Royal Grip Headwear Company.
In fiscal 1999, the Company recorded a loss on disposal of assets of Roxxi of
$08 million, net of a tax benefit of $04 million. This expense represents a
$11 million write-down of the excess of the carrying value of inventory and
fixed assets over the cash received and $01 million for estimated transaction
costs and estimated operating expenses to be incurred during the phase-out
period of this business segment. The Company is accounting for royalties as
income is earned during the two year period beginning May 1, 1999. For the years
ended May 31, 2000 and 1999, royalties of $151,000 and $20,000 were recorded,
respectively, and are reflected as other income in the accompanying consolidated
statements of operations.

thousands                           2000       1999
Raw materials                 $ 525      $ 471

5. MANUFACTURING SUPPLY CONTRACTS In December 1996, RG and Acushnet Rubber Company Acushnet entered into a
manufacturing and supply agreement whereby RG outsourced the manufacturing of
its golf club grips to Acushnet. Additionally, the two parties entered into an
agreement resulting in the transfer of RG manufacturing equipment to Acushnet
under a capital lease. Since January 1997, RG has purchased the majority of its
supply of non-cord, injected grips from Acushnet. During the first calendar
quarter of 1997, Acushnet experienced startup delays in the production of grips
and was unable to satisfy its obligation under the contracts. In light of these
difficulties, RG and Acushnet renegotiated their manufacturing and supply
agreement, and Acushnet provided RG with purchase credits totaling $472,000 to
be applied against current and future amounts owed to Acushnet for the
production of grips. RG recorded $472,000 during the year ended May 31, 1998 as
a reduction in golf club grips cost of sales when these credits were not earned
back by Acushnet under certain provisions of the amended contract.
In May 1999, RG and Acushnet executed a mutual release agreement terminating
their manufacturing and supply agreement and capital lease agreement the
Termination Agreement. Pursuant to the Termination Agreement, RG received
$15 million in cash and $10 million in purchase credits from Acushnet.
Additionally, Acushnet obligation to make additional payments to RG under the
capital lease was terminated but Acushnet was required to continue producing
grips through February 2000 at which time RG received the manufacturing
equipment which was previously leased to Acushnet. RG recognized an aggregate
gain of $865,000 during the fiscal year ended May 31, 1999 as a result of the
Termination Agreement. At May 31, 2000, the manufacturing equipment returned to
RG is classified as equipment held for sale.
The Company believes that its current inventory of grips is sufficient to
satisfy customer demand through December 31, 2000. The Company is currently
purchasing grips from various suppliers and believes it has an adequate source
of supply to meet its current and anticipated future customer needs. However,
there can be no assurance that the transition to new suppliers will not result
in production delays or the loss of sales and key customers which would have a
material adverse effect on the Company financial condition and results of
operations.
FMP uses one vendor to supply primarily all of the strip steel utilized in the
manufacture of steel golf club shafts, but has no supply contract with the
vendor. Should the vendor fail to deliver steel, there may be a disruption of
operations at FMP until an alternate supplier is procured. The vendor provides
steel from two separate plant locations. If one plant becomes unable to fill the
necessary requirements, orders could be filled from the alternate location.
Although FMP has elected to use this vendor as its primary supplier of strip
steel, management believes that there are other acceptable supply sources at
comparable prices and that the loss of the supplier would not have a significant
adverse impact on the Company.

6. TERMINATED MERGER AGREEMENT In February 1999, the Company and Coyote Sports, Inc. Coyote entered into a
merger agreement pursuant to which RP would become a wholly-owned subsidiary of
Coyote the RP-Coyote Merger. In June 1999, the RP-Coyote Merger agreement
was terminated at the request of the Company due to a material change in the
business of Coyote resulting in an inability to obtain suitable long-term
financing. The Company incurred professional fees of $10 million related to the
RP-Coyote Merger which have been reflected as terminated merger expenses in the
accompanying consolidated statement of operations for the year ended May 31,
1999.
7. LONG-TERM DEBT AND CAPITAL LEASE OBLIGATIONS FMP has a credit facility  consisting of a term loan and a revolving
line-of-credit. The FMP term loan of $27 million at May 31, 2000 is due in
monthly principal installments of $65,000 until its maturity in September 2002.
The amount available for borrowings under the revolving line-of-credit is based
upon the levels of eligible FMP accounts receivable and inventories, as defined,
subject to a maximum borrowing of $50 million. As of May 31, 2000, FMP had $37
million outstanding under its revolving  line-of-credit and $11 million
available for additional borrowings. The FMP line-of-credit expires in September
2002.
RG has a credit  facility  consisting of a term loan and a revolving
line-of-credit. The RG term loan of $04 million at May 31, 2000 is due in
monthly principal installments of $10,500 until its maturity in September 2002.
The amount available for borrowings under the revolving line-of-credit is based
upon the levels of eligible RG accounts receivable and inventories, as defined,
subject to a maximum borrowing of $15 million. As of May 31, 2000, RG had $01
million outstanding under its revolving  line-of-credit and $08 million
available for additional borrowings. The RG line-of-credit expires in September
2002.
Borrowings under the term loans and revolving lines-of-credit of both credit
facilities bear interest at a rate per annum equal to the prime rate 95% at
May 31, 2000 plus 075% and 025%, respectively,  and are secured by
substantially all of the Company assets.
The FMP and RG credit facilities contain certain financial and other covenants
which, among other things, limit annual capital expenditures and dividends and
require the maintenance of minimum monthly and quarterly earnings or maximum
monthly and quarterly losses, and minimum quarterly debt service coverage
ratios, as defined. The Company was in compliance with all financial loan
covenants at May 31, 2000.
Total indebtedness of the Company as of May 31, 2000 and 1999 consisted of the
following in thousands                               2000     1999
FMP:
Line-of-credit                    $ 3,740   $ 3,103

As of May 31, 2000 and 1999, the carrying value of the line-of-credit and term
loans approximated their fair market value since the obligations bear interest
at a variable rate of interest.

The Company has computed the pro forma disclosures required under SFAS No. 123
for all of the options it has using the Black Scholes option pricing model as
prescribed by SFAS No. 123. The weighted average assumptions used are as follows
for the years ended May 31, 2000 and 1999                          2000      1999

The only options granted during the year ended May 31, 1998 were also cancelled.
Since the Company accounts for cancellations on an actual basis for SFAS No. 123
disclosure purposes, the grant and cancellation had no effect on net loss for
the year ended May 31, 1998. Had compensation cost for the Company stock plan
been determined consistent with SFAS No. 123, the Company net income loss
and basic and diluted net income loss per share would have been the following
pro forma amounts for the years ended May 31, 2000 and 1999 in thousands,

During March 2000, the FASB issued Interpretation 44, Accounting for Certain
Transactions Involving Stock Compensation--an Interpretation of APB Opinion No.
25 FIN 44, which among other issues, addresses repricing and other
modifications made to previously issued stock options. The Company will be
required to adopt FIN 44 in the first quarter of its fiscal year ending May 31,
2001. As of May 31, 2000, there are outstanding options to purchase 170,583
shares at an exercise price of $319 per share which will be subject to variable
plan accounting until they are exercised or expire in January 2004.

As of May 31, 2000, the Company has federal and state NOL carryforwards of
approximately $56 million of which $49 million relate to RG for periods prior
to the FMP-RG Merger Pre-Merger NOLs. The use of such Pre-Merger NOLs is
limited to $764,000 per annum under Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code. As
of May 31, 2000, approximately $11 million of Pre-Merger NOLs are available for
usage under Section 382. The NOLs, if unused, expire in 2009 through 2019.
As of May 31, 1998, a valuation allowance of $2,821,000 was recorded to fully
offset NOL carryforwards and other net deferred tax assets as of such date, due
to uncertainty of their realization. During fiscal 1999, the Company utilized
approximately $942,000 of Pre-Merger NOLs and also determined that approximately
$970,000 of Pre-Merger NOLs were realizable. As such, the Company reduced the
valuation allowance by an aggregate of $650,000 see Note 2. The effect of this
benefit, as well as any future reductions in the valuation allowance related to
the Pre-Merger NOLs, was recorded as a reduction of goodwill. During the year
ended May 31, 1999, the Company also increased the valuation allowance on
certain other deferred tax assets by approximately $478,000, resulting in a
valuation allowance of $2,649,000 as of May 31, 1999.
During fiscal 2000, the Company utilized approximately $437,000 of Pre-Merger
NOLs and also determined that approximately $19 million of Pre-Merger NOLs were
realizable. The Company accordingly reduced the valuation allowance by $742,000
and recorded a corresponding reduction of goodwill see Note 2. Subsequent
recognition of additional amounts of Pre-Merger NOLs would result in further
reductions of goodwill of up to $14 million. During fiscal 2000, the Company
also reduced the valuation allowance on other deferred income tax assets, not
related to the FMP-RG Merger, by approximately $162,000.
11. RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS In connection with the RP-Coyote Merger see Note 6, fees of approximately
$85,000 were paid to related parties during the year ended May 31, 1999 and in
connection with the FMP-RG Merger see Note 1, fees of approximately $607,000
were paid to related parties during the year ended May 31, 1998.
Professional and advisory fees and expense reimbursements of approximately
$291,000, $316,000 and $416,000 were paid to certain shareholders or their
affiliates during the years ended May 31, 2000, 1999 and 1998, respectively.
12. FOREIGN SALES The Company has export sales to customers located primarily throughout Japan,
Australia, the United Kingdom and Canada. Foreign sales were approximately 33 29% and 20% of the Company sales for the years ended May 31, 2000, 1999 and
1998, respectively. The following table summarizes the Company sales by major

13. BENEFIT PLANS 401k PLAN The Company maintains a defined contribution benefit plan under Section 401k
of the Internal Revenue Code. Each year, eligible participants may elect to make
salary reduction contributions on their behalf up to a maximum of the lesser of
15% of compensation or the annual maximum contribution established by the
Internal Revenue Service. Participants may also make voluntary after-tax
contributions to the defined contribution benefit plan. Employer contributions
are discretionary and, to date, the Company has not contributed to the defined
contribution benefit plan.
PENSION PLAN Approximately 70% of the Company work force is covered by a collective
bargaining agreement. FMP maintains the FM Precision Golf Manufacturing Corp.
Pension Plan for Represented Hourly Wage Employees the Union Plan for the
benefit of FMP union employees. The Company contributes such amounts as are
necessary on an actuarial basis to provide the Union Plan with assets sufficient
to meet the benefits to be paid to participants. Contributions are intended to
provide not only for benefits attributed to service to date but also for those
expected to be earned in the future.

as those described in the summary of significant accounting policies. The
Company evaluates the performance of these segments based on segment operating
income or loss and cash flows. The Company allocates certain administrative
expenses to segments. The amounts in this illustration are the amounts in

15. CONCENTRATION OF CREDIT RISK The Company is subject to a concentration of credit risk as a result of sales to
its significant customers including its exclusive Japanese distributor and an
original equipment manufacturer. These two largest customers each accounted for
more than 10% and in the aggregate accounted for 46%, 40% and 35% of the
Company net sales for the years ended May 31, 2000, 1999 and 1998,
respectively. The Japanese distributor purchases both golf club shafts and golf
club grips and accounted for 19%, 17% and 11% of shaft sales and 73%, 61% and
73% of grip sales during the years ended May 31, 2000, 1999 and 1998,
respectively. The outstanding receivable balances for this customer were
approximately $06 million and $07 million at May 31, 2000 and 1999,
respectively. The OEM customer purchases only golf club shafts and accounted for
22%, 18% and 18% of shaft sales during the years ended May 31, 2000, 1999 and
1998, respectively. The outstanding receivable balances for this customer were
approximately $08 million and $03 million at May 31, 2000 and 1999,
respectively. To reduce its credit risk, the Company requires letter of credit
agreements from its Japanese distributor.
16. COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES The Company is from time to time a party to various routine legal proceedings
which are incidental to the Company business. Management consults with legal
counsel on all such matters and believes that none of the current routing
proceedings will have a material adverse effect on the Company financial
condition or future operating results.
On November 2, 1999, R. R. Donnelley & Sons Company, Plaintiff, vs. Royal
Precision, Inc., Defendant, was filed in Superior Court, Maricopa County,
Arizona. In the matter, R. R. Donnelley & Sons Company Donnelley alleged
that the Company is liable under breach of contract for approximately $280,000
in  printing  costs  arising  from the  preparation  of a Joint  Proxy
Statement/Prospectus related to a proposed merger agreement between the Company
and Coyote Sports, Inc. which was terminated prior to the effective date of the
merger. On April 17, 2000, the court granted the Company motion to dismiss
this suit. However, the court has not yet signed a final judgment and it is
uncertain whether or not Donnelley will appeal the dismissal. Management
believes that the action is without merit and intends to defend any appeal
vigorously.
In May 1996, the Company acquired substantially all the assets of the golf club
shaft  manufacturing  business of Brunswick  Corporation  the Brunswick
Acquisition. Included in the acquired assets were land, buildings and
equipment at the Company Torrington, Connecticut manufacturing facility the
FMP plant. In conjunction with the Brunswick  Acquisition,  Brunswick
Corporation agreed to indemnify the Company from potential liability arising
from certain environmental matters and to remediate certain environmental
conditions which existed at the FMP plant on the date of acquisition. Brunswick
Corporation has engaged an environmental consulting firm to perform testing at
the FMP plant and is in the process of developing a plan of remediation. Failure
of Brunswick Corporation to fulfill its obligations under the asset purchase
contract could have a material adverse effect on the Company financial
condition and results of operations. The Company has retained legal counsel for
representation on various environmental matters related to the Brunswick
Acquisition. Total legal fees incurred related to these matters during the
fiscal year ended May 31, 2000 were approximately $01 million.
The Company received a notice of violation NOV from the State of Connecticut
Department of Environmental Protection DEP alleging violation of certain
provisions of a permit related to the discharge of treated wastewater at the FMP
plant. This permit was issued to the Company in February 1997 based on an
application prepared by Brunswick Corporation in April 1996. In April 2000, the
Company reached a settlement agreement with DEP discharging the Company from any
civil liability with respect to the allegations in the NOV, subject to
completion and approval of certain remedial measures at the FMP plant. The
Company incurred approximately $02 million in capital expense to complete these
remedial measures during the fiscal year ended May 31, 2000 and, in June 2000,
obtained a certification from DEP that the work was satisfactorily completed.
The Company is seeking reimbursement from Brunswick Corporation for the cost of
remediation and legal fees incurred in conjunction with this matter.
30
In April 2000, the Company received a request for information from the U.S.
Environmental Protection Agency EPA related to disposal and treatment of
waste materials from the FMP plant during a period from 1982 to 1997. The EPA is
currently conducting an investigation  regarding the former National Oil
Services, Inc. Superfund site in West Haven, Connecticut. National Oil Services,
Inc. was, prior to its bankruptcy, a contractor used by the Company and
Brunswick Corporation to treat and dispose non-hazardous waste oils from the FMP
plant. EPA has not issued any demands for reimbursement or performance of work
from the Company relating to this matter and there is not sufficient information
at this time to determine what, if any, action EPA may pursue and what, if any,
effect it may have on the Company financial condition and results of
operations.
