CSK AUTO CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARY NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CSK Auto Corporation is a holding company. At February4,
2001, CSK Auto Corporation had no business activity other than
its investment in CSK Auto, Inc. Auto, a
wholly-owned subsidiary. On a consolidated basis, CSK Auto
Corporation and subsidiary are referred to herein as the
Company. Auto is a specialty retailer of automotive aftermarket parts and
accessories. At February4, 2001, the Company operated
1,152 stores in 19 Western and Northern Plains states as a fully
integrated company and single business segment under three brand
names: Checker Auto Parts, founded in 1969 and operating in the
Southwestern, Rocky Mountain and Northern Plains states;
Schucks Auto Supply, founded in 1917 and operating in the
Pacific Northwest; and Kragen Auto Parts, founded in 1947 and
operating primarily in California.
Note 1 Summary of Significant Accounting
Policies
Principles of Consolidation The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of
CSK Auto Corporation and Auto for all years presented. In
addition, the accounts of Automotive Information Systems, Inc.
AIS are included in the accompanying financial
statements from September7, 1999, the date of acquisition
see Note4. All intercompany accounts and transactions
are eliminated in consolidation.
Fiscal Year The Companys fiscal year end is on the Sunday nearest to
January31 of the following calendar year. The fiscal year
ended February4, 2001 fiscal 2000 consists
of 53weeks, while the fiscal years ended January30,
2000 fiscal 1999 and January31, 1999
fiscal 1998 each consisted of 52weeks.
Revenue Recognition The Company recognizes sales upon the delivery of products to
its customers, which generally occurs at the Companys
retail store locations. For commercial customers, the Company
also delivers products to customer locations. All retail and
commercial sales are final upon delivery of products. However,
as a convenience to the customer and as typical of most
retailers, the Company will accept merchandise returns. The
Company generally limits the period of time within which
products may be returned to 30days and requires returns to
be accompanied by original packaging and a sales receipt. The
accompanying financial statements include an allowance for sales
returns, which has been estimated by management based upon
historical activity.
Cash Equivalents Cash equivalents consist primarily of certificates of deposit
with maturities of three months or less when purchased.
Receivables Receivables are primarily comprised of amounts due from vendors
for rebates or allowances, and amounts due from commercial sales
customers.
Concentration of Credit Risk Financial instruments that potentially subject the Company to
concentration of credit risk consist principally of cash and
cash equivalents and trade receivables. As of February4,
2001, the Company had cash and cash equivalents on deposit with
a major financial institution that were in excess of FDIC
insured limits. Historically, the Company has not experienced
any loss of its cash and cash equivalents due to such
concentration of credit risk.
30 Table of Contents CSK AUTO CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARY NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
Continued The Company does not hold collateral to secure payment of its
trade accounts receivable. However, management performs ongoing
credit evaluations of its customers financial condition
and provides an allowance for estimated potential losses.
Exposure to credit loss is limited to the carrying amount.
Inventories and Cost of Sales Inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market, cost
being determined utilizing the last-in, first-out method. Cost
of sales includes product cost, net of earned vendor rebates,
discounts and allowances. The Company recognizes vendor rebates,
discounts and allowances based on the terms of the underlying
agreements. Such amounts may be amortized over the life of the
applicable agreements or recognized as inventory is sold.
Certain operating and administrative costs associated with
purchasing and handling of inventory are capitalized in
inventories. The amounts of such costs included in inventories
as of February4, 2001 and January30, 2000 were
approximately $317 million and $318 million, respectively. In
addition, the Company increases cost of sales and reduces
inventory by an estimate of purchase discounts and volume
rebates that are unearned at period end, based upon inventory
turnover rates. Such capitalized purchase discounts totaled
$236 million and $235 million as of February4, 2001 and
January30, 2000, respectively. The replacement cost of
inventories approximated $5394 million and $5483 million at
February4, 2001 and January30, 2000, respectively.
Property and Equipment Property, equipment and purchased software are recorded at cost.
Depreciation and amortization are computed for financial
reporting purposes utilizing primarily the straight-line method
over the estimated useful lives of the related assets, which
range from 5 to 25 years, or for leasehold improvements and
property under capital leases, the base lease term or estimated
useful life, if shorter. Maintenance and repairs are charged to
earnings when incurred.
Store Preopening Costs During the first quarter of fiscal 1999, the Company adopted
Statement of Position SOP 98-5, Reporting on
the Cost of Start-up Activities. SOP98-5 requires
that store preopening costs, consisting primarily of incremental
labor, supplies and occupancy costs directly related to the
opening of specific stores, be expensed as incurred. Previously,
the Company capitalized such costs as prepaid expenses and other
current assets and expensed them during the month in which the
store was opened. See Note2.
Internal Software Development Costs During the first quarter of fiscal 1999, the Company adopted
SOP98-1 Accounting for the Cost of Computer Software
Developed or Obtained for Internal Use. SOP98-1
provides for the capitalization of certain internal software
development costs and amortization over the life of the related
software. Previously, internal software development costs,
consisting primarily of incremental internal labor costs and
benefits, were expensed as incurred. Amounts capitalized during
fiscal 2000 and fiscal 1999 were $26 million and $17 million,
respectively. Accumulated amortization as of February4,
2001 and January30, 2000 was $07 million and $02
million, respectively. Total amounts charged to operations,
prior to adoption of SOP98-1, for fiscal 1998 were
approximately $16 million.
Leasehold Interests Leasehold interests represent the discounted net present value
of the excess of the fair rental value over the respective
contractual rent of facilities under operating leases acquired
in business combinations. Amortization expense is computed on a
straight-line basis over the respective lease terms. Accumulated
amortization totaled $103 million and $166 million as of
February4, 2001 and January30, 2000, respectively.
31 Table of Contents CSK AUTO CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARY NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
Continued
Goodwill The cost in excess of net assets acquired is amortized on a
straight-line basis over periods ranging from 20 to 30 years,
depending on the business acquired. Management estimates such
periods using factors such as entry barriers in certain regions,
operating rights and estimated lives of other operating assets
acquired. The realizability of goodwill and other intangibles is
evaluated periodically when events or circumstances indicate a
possible inability to recover the carrying amount. Such
evaluation is based on cash flow and profitability projections
that incorporate the impact of existing Company businesses. The
analyses necessarily involve significant management judgment to
evaluate the capacity of an acquired business to perform within
projections. Accumulated amortization as of February4,
2001 and January30, 2000 was $67 million and $19
million, respectively.
Store Closing Costs The Company provides an allowance for estimated costs and losses
to be incurred in connection with store closures and losses on
the disposal of store-related assets, which is net of
anticipated sublease income. Such costs are recognized when a
store is specifically identified, costs can be estimated and
closure is planned to be completed within the next twelve
months. See Note13.
Advertising The Company expenses all advertising costs as such costs are
incurred. Amounts due under vendor cooperative advertising
agreements are recorded as receivables until their collection.
Advertising expense for fiscal 2000, 1999 and 1998 totaled $186
million, $165 million and $219 million, net of vendor funded
cooperative advertising, respectively.
Assets Held for Sale Assets held for sale consist of newly acquired land, buildings
and store fixtures owned by the Company which the Company
intends in the next twelve months to sell to and lease back from
third parties under lease arrangements.
Long-lived Assets The Company applies Statement of Financial Accounting Standards
SFAS No121, Accounting for the
Impairment of Long-Lived Assets and for Long-Lived Assets to be
Disposed Of, which requires that long-lived assets and
certain identifiable intangible assets to be held and used or
disposed of by an entity be reviewed for impairment whenever
events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying
amount of an asset may not be recoverable. In the event assets
are impaired, losses are recognized based on the excess carrying
amount over the estimated fair value of the asset. SFAS
No121 also requires that assets to be disposed of be
reported at the lower of the carrying amount or the fair market
value less selling costs. The Company evaluates the carrying
value of long-lived assets on a quarterly basis to determine
whether events or changes in circumstances indicate that the
carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable and an
impairment loss should be recognized. Such evaluation is based
on the expected utilization of the related asset and the
corresponding useful life.
Income Taxes Deferred income taxes are recognized for the tax consequences in
future years of differences between the tax basis of assets and
liabilities and their financial reporting amounts
temporary differences at each year end based on
enacted tax laws and statutory rates applicable to the period in
which the temporary differences are expected to affect taxable
income. Valuation allowances are established, when necessary, to
reduce
32 Table of Contents CSK AUTO CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARY NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
Continued deferred tax assets to the amount expected to be realized.
Income tax expense includes both taxes payable for the period
and the change during the period in deferred tax assets and
liabilities.
Stock-Based Compensation SFAS No123, Accounting for Stock-Based
Compensation, encourages but does not require companies to
record compensation cost for stock-based employee compensation
plans at fair value. The Company has chosen to continue to
account for stock-based compensation using the intrinsic value
method prescribed in Accounting Principles Board Opinion
No25, Accounting for Stock Issued to
Employees and related interpretations thereof.
Accordingly, compensation cost for stock options is measured as
the excess, if any, of the market price of the Companys
stock at the date of grant over the amount an employee must pay
to acquire the stock. See Note10.
Earnings per Share Basic earnings per share is based on the weighted average
outstanding common shares. Diluted earnings per share is based
on the weighted average outstanding shares adjusted for the
effect of stock options. Calculation of shares used in computing per share amounts is
summarized as follows Fiscal Year Ended February 4 January 30 January 31 2001 2000 1999 Common stock outstanding Beginning of period 27,834,574 27,768,832 19,113,388 End of period 27,841,178 27,834,574 27,768,832 Issued during period 6,604 65,742 8,655,444 Weighted average number of shares basic 27,839,348 27,815,160 26,722,322 Effects of dilutive securities 811,616 917,777 Weighted average number of shares diluted 27,839,348 28,626,776 27,640,099 Use of Estimates The preparation of financial statements in conformity with
generally accepted accounting principles requires management to
make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts
of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets
and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the
reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting
period. Actual results could differ from these estimates. Note2 Recent Accounting Pronouncements and Cumulative Effect of
Change in Accounting Principle In March2000, the FASB issued FASB Interpretation
No44, Accounting for Certain Transactions Involving
Stock Compensation: An Interpretation of APBOpinion
No25. The interpretation became effective
July1, 2000. The adoption of the pronouncement did not
have a material impact on the Companys financial position
or the results of operations. In December1999, the staff of the Securities and Exchange
Commission issued Staff Accounting Bulletin No101
SAB101, Revenue Recognition in Financial
Statements. SAB101 summarizes some of the
staffs interpretations of the application of generally
accepted accounting principles to revenue recognition. In
June2000, the SEC staff issued SAB101B which delays
the implementation date of SAB101 until no later
33 Table of Contents CSK AUTO CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARY NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
Continued than the fourth fiscal quarter of fiscal years beginning after
December15, 1999. The adoption of the pronouncement did
not have an impact on the Companys financial position or
the results of operations. In April1998, the Accounting Standards Executive Committee
of the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants issued
SOP98-5, Reporting on the Cost of Start-up
Activities. The SOP broadly defines start-up activities as
those one-time activities related to opening a new facility,
introducing a new product or service, conducting business in a
new territory, or commencing some new operation. The SOP
requires that the costs of start-up activities be expensed as
incurred and is effective for financial statements for fiscal
years beginning after December15, 1998, with earlier
application encouraged. The Companys historical accounting
policy with respect to the cost of start-up activities store
preopening expenses was to defer such costs for the
approximately three month period of time that it takes to
develop a new store facility and to expense such costs during
the month that the new store opens. The Company adopted
SOP98-5 in the first quarter of fiscal 1999, which
required the Company to change its accounting policy to expense
start-up costs as incurred. Upon adoption, the Company expensed
approximately $741,000, net of an income tax benefit of
$468,000, of preopening expenses that had been deferred as of
January31, 1999. Such expense is reflected in the
accompanying consolidated statement of operations as the
cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle.
Note 3 Investment in Joint Venture On March1, 2000, the Company participated in the formation
of a new joint venture, PartsAmerica.com PA, with
Advance Auto Parts Advance and Sequoia Capital. PA
engages in the sale of automotive parts and accessories via
e-commerce. PA operates independently from its partners and
utilizes both Autos and Advances existing logistic
systems to support its web-based operations. In exchange for approximately 37% of the outstanding equity of
PA, the Company has contributed assets and incurred costs of
approximately $32 million, which include associated transaction
costs. The Company is accounting for its investment in PA under
the equity method and, accordingly, recognizes its proportionate
share of PAs net income or loss. During fiscal 2000, the
Company incurred non-cash charges of $32 million to recognize
its proportionate share of PAs net loss and to write off
our remaining investment in the joint venture. Accordingly, as
of February4, 2001, the Company has no remaining
investment in PA recorded in the accompanying consolidated
balance sheets. Auto is not obligated to support PA financially
beyond the extent of its original investment. See Note5.
Note 4 Business Acquisitions
AllCar On April27, 2000, the Company acquired substantially all
of the assets of All-Car Distributors, Inc.
AllCar, an operator of 22 stores in Wisconsin and
Michigan. Under the terms of the agreement, the Company paid
approximately $711,000 in cash, which includes associated
transaction costs, for the assets of AllCar and assumed vendor
accounts payable and certain indebtedness and accrued expenses.
In August2000, the Company made a payment of approximately
$206,000 pursuant to a purchase price adjustment formula
contained in the original agreement. In addition, the Company is
subject to an additional payment of approximately $215,000 upon
the satisfaction of certain conditions. The AllCar stores are serviced out of the Companys Mendota
Heights Distribution Center and have been converted to the
Checker name and store format and integrated into the
Companys operations. In connection with the integration of
the AllCar stores, the Company incurred one-time transition and
integration expenses of approximately $30 million, consisting
primarily of grand opening advertising, training and
re-merchandising costs. In addition, the Company incurred
capital expenditures of approximately $31
34 Table of Contents CSK AUTO CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARY NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
Continued million, consisting primarily of expenditures related to
equipment, store fixtures, signage and the installation of the
Companys store-level information systems in the AllCar
stores. The AllCar Acquisition was accounted for under the purchase
method of accounting. Accordingly, the results of operations of
these stores are included in the consolidated operating results
of the Company from April28, 2000, the first day of
operations subsequent to the acquisition. The financial
statements reflect the preliminary allocation of the purchase
price, based on estimated fair values at the date of
acquisition. Approximately $50 million was allocated to
inventory and fixed assets. The excess of the purchase price
over the estimated fair value of the assets acquired resulted in
goodwill of approximately $43 million and is being amortized on
a straight-line basis over 30years.
SuperAuto On June19, 2000, the Company acquired one store in
California for $10 million. The Company converted this store to
the Kragen name and store format and integrated the store into
the Companys operations. No significant transition and
integration costs were incurred relating to this acquisition.
Als and Grand Auto Supply On October1, 1999, the Company acquired the common stock
of Als and Grand Auto Supply, Inc. AGA,
formerly known as PACCAR Automotive, Inc., which operated 194
stores under the trade names of Als Auto Supply and Grand
Auto Supply collectively, the AGA stores in
Washington, California, Idaho, Oregon, Nevada and Alaska. The
Company has substantially converted these stores to the
Schucks and Kragen names and store formats and integrated
these stores into the Companys operations. The Company paid approximately $1456 million in cash for the
stock of AGA and associated transaction costs. The acquisition
was funded with proceeds from the Senior Credit Facility. In
connection with the acquisition, the Company amended and
restated the Senior Credit Facility to provide an additional
$1500 million of senior term loan borrowing ability. There are
no contingent payments, options or commitments associated with
the acquisition. In connection with the integration of the AGA stores, the
Company incurred one-time transition and integration expenses of
approximately $157 million and $213 million during fiscal 2000
and 1999, respectively. These expenses consisted primarily of
grand opening advertising, training and re-merchandising costs.
In addition, the Company incurred one-time capital expenditures
of approximately $56 million and $20 million during fiscal
2000 and 1999, respectively. These expenditures consisted
primarily of equipment, store fixtures, signage and the
installation of the Companys store-level information
systems in the AGA stores. As a result of the AGA acquisition, the Company has analyzed its
store locations in California and the Pacific Northwest. The
Company has closed or relocated 39 of the formerly owned AGA
stores based on several factors including: 1market
saturation; 2store profitability; and 3store
size and format. Costs associated with these closures consist of
future rents to be paid over the remaining terms of the lease
agreements for the stores net of estimated sublease
recoveries. In addition, the Company finalized a store closure
plan for its own stores that overlap with AGA stores, which
resulted in a pretax charges of approximately $25 million
during the fourth quarter of fiscal 1999 and $37 million during
the second quarter of fiscal 2000. The charges consisted of two
components: 1future rents to be paid over the remaining
lease terms of the lease agreements for the stores net of
estimated sublease rentals; and 2a write-down in the
carrying amounts of leasehold improvements and other fixed
assets associated with the affected stores. These charges were
included in store closing costs in the accompanying Consolidated
Statement of Operations. See Note13. The AGA acquisition was accounted for under the purchase method
of accounting. Accordingly, the results of operations of these
stores are included in the consolidated operating results of the
Company from

Continued October2, 1999, the first day of operations subsequent to
the acquisition. The financial statements reflect the final
allocation of the purchase price, based on estimated fair values
at the date of acquisition. Approximately $1277 million was
allocated to inventory, leasehold improvements, fixed assets and
favorable lease rights. The final allocation also includes an
estimated liability for the cost of closing the 39 acquired
stores described above. The excess of the purchase price over
the estimated fair value of the assets acquired resulted in
goodwill of approximately $633 million and is being amortized
on a straight-line basis over 30years.
Automotive Information Systems On September7, 1999, the Company acquired all of the
common stock of Automotive Information Systems, Inc.
AIS. AIS, based in St. Paul, Minnesota, is a
leading provider of diagnostic vehicle repair information to
automotive technicians, automotive replacement parts
manufacturers, automotive test equipment manufacturers, and the
do-it-yourself consumer. The Company paid approximately $103
million in cash for AIS and funded the acquisition through its
Senior Credit Facility. There are no contingent payments,
options or commitments associated with the acquisition. The AIS acquisition was accounted for under the purchase method
of accounting. Accordingly, the results of operations are
included in the consolidated operating results of the Company
from September7, 1999, the first day of operations
subsequent to the acquisition. The financial statements reflect
the final allocation of the purchase price, based on fair values
at the date of acquisition. The excess of the purchase price
over the fair value of the assets acquired resulted in goodwill
of approximately $92 million and is being amortized on a
straight-line basis over 20years.
Big Wheel On June30, 1999, the Company acquired substantially all of
the assets of APSCO Products Company dba Big Wheel/Rossi
Big Wheel, the leading retailer of auto parts in
the Northern Plains states. Big Wheel operated 86 stores in
Minnesota, North Dakota and Wisconsin along with a distribution
center in Minnesota. The Company has converted these stores to
the Checker name and store format and integrated these stores
into the Companys operations. The Company paid approximately $627 million in cash for
substantially all the assets and assumed certain current
liabilities and indebtedness of Big Wheel. The acquisition was
funded with proceeds from the Senior Credit Facility. In
connection with the acquisition, the Company amended and
restated the Senior Credit Facility to provide an additional
$1250 million of senior term loan borrowing ability. There are
no contingent payments, options or commitments associated with
the acquisition. In connection with the integration of the Big Wheel stores, the
Company incurred one-time transition and integration expenses of
approximately $52 million and $89 million during fiscal 2000
and 1999, respectively. These costs consist primarily of grand
opening advertising, training and re-merchandising costs. In
addition, the Company incurred one-time capital expenditures of
approximately $15 million and $30 million during fiscal 2000
and 1999, respectively. These costs consist primarily of
equipment fixtures, signage and the installation of the
Companys store-level information systems in the Big Wheel
stores. The Big Wheel acquisition was accounted for under the purchase
method of accounting. Accordingly, the results of operations of
these stores are included in the consolidated operating results
of the Company from July1, 1999, the first day of
operations subsequent to the acquisition. The financial
statements reflect the final allocation of the purchase price,
based on fair values at the date of acquisition. Approximately
$195 million was allocated to inventory, leasehold improvements
and fixed assets. The excess of the purchase price over the
estimated fair value of the assets acquired resulted in goodwill
of approximately $600 million and is being amortized on a
straight-line basis over 30years.

MO Auto Parts On January6, 1999, the Company acquired two stores in
Alaska from MO Auto Parts for $09 million. The Company has
converted these stores to the Schucks name and store
format and integrated these stores into the Companys
operations. No significant transition and integration costs were
incurred relating to this acquisition. The Big Wheel and AGA Acquisitions were accounted for under the
purchase method of accounting. Prior financial statements
reflected the preliminary allocation of the purchase prices,
based on estimated fair values at the date of the respective
acquisition. During fiscal 2000, the Company made adjustments to
reflect the final determination of certain acquired balances.
Significant changes in the allocation of acquired balances
include: 1a lower accounts receivable valuation
primarily relating to acquired accounts payable debit balances
for vendors with which the Company does not conduct business;
2a revised inventory allocation representing aa
lower inventory valuation on core and warranty returns as a
result of excessive acquired inventory levels; and ba
lower valuation on non-returnable inventory lines not carried by
the Company; 3a leasehold rights allocation representing
the discounted net present value of the excess of the fair
market rental value over the respective contractual rent of
stores under operating leases acquired; 4an accounts
payable adjustment as a result of an adjustment to acquired bank
overdrafts; and 5a revised closed store reserve
reflecting the final costs of closing or relocating previously
identified stores. The final allocations of the fair value of
the assets and liabilities recorded as a result of the Big Wheel

Note 5 Transactions and Relationships with
Related Parties The Carmel Trust Carmel is a trust governed under
the laws of Canada. Carmel is an affiliate of the Company. In October 1989, the Company entered into a nine year lease the
Initial Lease for its corporate headquarters in
Phoenix, Arizona, with an unaffiliated landlord. During January
1994, Missouri Falls Holdings Corp., an affiliate of Carmel,
acquired an interest in the partnership Missouri Falls
Partners which acquired the building and assumed the
lease between the Company and the former landlord. In October
1996, the Company extended the Initial Lease through October
2006. The lease relates to approximately 78,577 square feet and
provides for a current base rent of approximately $1,490,000 per
year. In April 1995, the Company assumed a lease the Subsequent
Lease between a former tenant and Missouri Falls Partners
for approximately 11,683 square feet of additional office space
at its corporate headquarters. In October 1996, the Company
extended the Subsequent Lease through October 2006. At its
originally scheduled termination as of April 1998, rent under
the Subsequent Lease increased to the same per square foot as is
charged under the Initial Lease to a total annual rent of
$221,510. Under multiple agreements that expire in October 2006, the
Company leases approximately 24,000 square feet of additional
space at the above premises from Missouri Falls Partners for an
annual rent of approximately $510,000. The Company also leases a parking lot adjacent to its corporate
headquarters for an annual rental of $62,506 under a separate
lease which expires in October 2006 from MFP Holdings, LLC, an
affiliate of Carmel. From time to time, the Company has entered into sale-leaseback
or other financing arrangements with related parties.
38 Table of Contents CSK AUTO CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARY NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
Continued Beginning in October 1995, the Company entered into a series of
sale-leaseback transactions with Transatlantic Realty, Inc.
Realty, another affiliate of Carmel, for various
real property and fixtures. The total funding provided by Realty
in these transactions through January30, 2000 was
approximately $331 million of which $273 million was for real
property and $58 million was for fixtures. This amount
represented the Companys cost of such assets. The Company
has replaced approximately $273 million of the real property
sale-leasebacks and certain of the fixture sale-leasebacks with
similar arrangements with unrelated third parties. As of
February4, 2001, there were approximately $02 million of
payments remaining under this facility. Beginning in October 1996, the Company entered into a series of
sale-leaseback transactions with Transatlantic Leasing, Inc.
Leasing, another affiliate of Carmel, for certain
real property. In November 2000, the last lease under this
facility was terminated. In October 1997, the Company
established a new sale-leaseback facility and the Company
terminated the facility with Leasing. The Company believes that the terms of the transactions with
affiliated parties described above in this Note were no less
favorable to it than terms that may have been available from
independent third parties at the time of the applicable
transaction. In connection with his engagement as Chief Executive Officer,
the Company loaned Mr.Jenkins $550,000, which he used to
finance the purchase of the new home required as a result of his
relocation. This loan was to mature in 1999 and bear interest at
a rate of 4545%. This loan was authorized by the Board of
Directors prior to the commencement of Mr.Jenkins
employment. In September 1999, the Company agreed to forgive
$300,000 principal amount of the loan on November1, 1999
and $250,000 principal amount, together with approximately
$18,000 accrued and unpaid interest thereon on February1,
2000, provided that Mr.Jenkins remained employed on such
date unless his failure to remain employed was caused by the
Companys termination of his employment. On March1, 2000, the Company participated in the formation
of PA, a new joint venture see Note3. During fiscal
2000, the Company contributed assets and incurred costs of
approximately $32 million, which include associated transaction
costs. The Company also incurred non-cash charges of $32
million to recognize its proportionate share of PAs net
loss and to write off our remaining investment in the joint
venture. In addition, during fiscal 2000, the Company recorded
sales to PA of approximately $05 million and incurred
reimbursable costs of $03 million. As of February4, 2001,
the Company had a receivable from PA of approximately $04
million, which includes reimbursable costs and advances.

Senior Credit Facility after previously amending and restating
the Facility to provide additional funding for the consummation
of the AGA and Big Wheel Acquisitions in fiscal 1999. As amended
and restated, as of February4, 2001, the Senior Credit
Facility includes the following significant provisions The due date of the revolving credit commitment has been
extended from October 31, 2001 to October31, 2002 Interest and commitment fees at variable rates as provided
within a pricing grid with the rates commencing at LIBOR plus 3 on the revolving credit commitment and commitment fees of 05 of undrawn availability Easing of previously existing financial covenant requirements including capital expenditure levels, and EBITDA and interest
coverage ratios. Borrowings under the Senior Credit Facility are collateralized
by a first priority security interest in substantially all of
the personal property of Auto, subject to certain permitted
liens. The Company also issued a guarantee of such borrowings
under the Senior Credit Facility, which guarantee is
collateralized by a pledge by the Company of all issued and
outstanding capital stock of Auto. In addition, the revolving
credit portion allows for the issuance of letters of credit that
reduce revolver availability. Letters of credit outstanding were
$41 million and $29 million at February4, 2001 and
January30, 2000, respectively. After considering the
letters of credit outstanding, there was $109 million in
undrawn availability at February4, 2001.

Continued The Senior Credit Facility prohibits, with certain limited
exceptions, the optional or mandatory prepayment or other
defeasance of Autos 11% Senior Subordinated Notes. The
Senior Credit Facility further requires that, under certain
circumstances, Auto make prepayments of the term loan
outstanding thereunder with i50% of any Excess Cash Flow
as defined therein; and ii50% of the Net Proceeds as
defined therein from certain offerings of the Companys
voting stock. In addition, a change of control
allows the lenders to accelerate the loans. A change of control
occurs under any of the following circumstances:
ianyone, other than the Initial Shareholders as defined
therein, acquires the power to vote at least 30% of the common
stock, on a fully diluted basis as defined; iicertain
changes in the composition of the Board of Directors; and
iiiany sale of the common stock of Auto. Commitment fees on available funds under the Revolving Credit
Commitment are payable quarterly in arrears on the average daily
unused amount of the total commitment. Commitment fees totaling
$81,000 and $103,000 were incurred in fiscal 2000 and 1999,
respectively. The terms of the Senior Credit Facility include restrictions on
investments, capital expenditures, dividends and certain other
payments and require the Company to meet certain financial
covenants. The Company believes it was in compliance with all
such covenants at February4, 2001.
11% Senior Subordinated Notes Due 2006 On October30, 1996, Auto issued and sold in a private
placement $1250 million aggregate principal amount of 11%
Senior Subordinated Notes due 2006 the Old 11%
Notes pursuant to an indenture, between Auto and The Bank
of New York as successor to Wells Fargo Bank, N.A., as
Trustee. On March13, 1997, Auto offered to exchange up to
all outstanding Old 11% Notes for a like principal amount of its
11% SeriesA Senior Subordinated Notes due 2006 the
11% Senior Subordinated Notes issued pursuant to
the Indenture in a transaction registered under the Securities
Act of 1933, as amended. Auto consummated the exchange offer on
June18, 1997, with all of the Old 11% Notes being
exchanged for the 11% Senior Subordinated Notes. In April1998, 35% of the aggregate principal amount of the
11% Senior Subordinated Notes was redeemed at a redemption price
of 110% of the principal amount thereof, plus accrued and unpaid
interest thereon, to the redemption date, with the net proceeds
of an initial public offering of Common Stock. See Note9. The indenture potentially restricts Auto from making additional
borrowings under its Revolving Credit Commitment that, when
added to the aggregate amount of outstanding borrowings under
the Senior Credit Facility including term loans, exceed $2000
million. This restriction does not apply if the new borrowings
are of a type specifically permitted by the indenture, or, if
after giving pro forma effect to such new borrowings the ratio
of Autos consolidated EBITDA to fixed charges as such
terms are defined in the indenture exceeds 225 to 1.
Accordingly, the Company has been able to exceed the potential
restriction and does not anticipate that it will limit access to
further borrowings under the Senior Credit Facility. The indenture also provides that upon a change of
control, as defined therein, each holder of 11% Senior
Subordinated Notes will have the right to require Auto to
repurchase all or any part of such holders notes at a
purchase price in cash equal to 101% of the principal amount
plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to the date of
purchase. The 11% Senior Subordinated Notes bear interest at 11% per year,
payable semiannually in arrears on each May 1 and
November1, and mature on November1, 2006. The 11%
Senior Subordinated Notes are general, unsecured senior
subordinated obligations. The 11% Senior Subordinated Notes are
required to be guaranteed fully, unconditionally and jointly and
severally by most future United States subsidiaries of Auto, on
a senior subordinated basis.

Note 8 Leases The Company leases its office and warehouse facilities, all but
three of its retail stores, and a majority of its equipment.
Generally, store leases provide for minimum rentals and the
payment of utilities, maintenance, insurance and taxes. Certain
store leases also provide for contingent rentals based upon a
percentage of sales in excess of a stipulated minimum. The
majority of lease agreements are for base lease periods ranging
from 15 to 20 years, with three to five renewal options of five
years each. Until December31, 2000, the Company also had access to an
off-balance sheet operating lease facility that was used to
finance new store construction. As of February4, 2001 96 million had been utilized under this facility. Under a
similar agreement that expired on May31, 1999 with respect
to the addition of new stores, approximately $809 million was
used to finance new store construction. The Company is currently
negotiating a new lease facility.

Note 9 Capital Stock and Initial Public
Offering On March17, 1998, the Company completed an initial public
offering the IPO of approximately 86 million
shares of its common stock, generating proceeds of approximately
$1591 million, net of offering expenses. The offering proceeds
were used to retire the Companys 12% Subordinated Notes
and other indebtedness as more fully described in Note7.
Upon retirement of the 12% Subordinated Notes, all of the
outstanding preferred stock of Auto was cancelled. In connection with the IPO, the Companys Board of
Directors and stockholders approved a 17105 to 1 stock split
effected in the form of a stock dividend. Accordingly, all share
and option information contained herein has been adjusted to
give retroactive effect to such stock split. In addition, under
the terms of the Companys restated Certificate of
Incorporation in effect at the time of the IPO, each share of
each class of issued and outstanding capital stock of the
Company automatically converted to common stock upon the
consummation of the IPO on March17, 1998. In March1998, the Company amended its Certificate of
Incorporation to eliminate all classes of stock other than
common stock and increase the total common stock authorization
to 50 million shares.
Note 10 Employee Benefit Plans The Company provides various health, welfare and disability
benefits to its full-time employees which are funded primarily
by Company contributions. The Company does not provide
post-employment or post-retirement health care or life insurance
benefits to its employees.

1996 Stock Option Plans On October30, 1996, the Company awarded options to
purchase shares of common stock under its Associate Stock Option
Plan the Associate Plan and its Executive Stock
Option Plan the Executive Plan and together with
the Associate Plan, the Plans in order to provide
incentives to store managers and salaried corporate and
warehouse employees of the Company. In October1996 and
February1997, the Companys Board of Directors
approved the Associate Plan and the Executive Plan,
respectively. The Compensation Committee of the Board of
Directors has been appointed to administer the Plans. Options to purchase up to an aggregate of 1,026,300 shares of
common stock may be granted under the Associate Plan. On
April30, 1999, the Board of Directors amended and restated
the Executive Plan, increasing the maximum number of shares for
which options may be granted by 60,000 to a total of 744,200
shares of common stock. Options granted under the Plans may be
options intended to qualify as incentive stock options under
Section422 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as
amended, or options not intended to so qualify. In the event of
a sale of more than 80% of the outstanding shares of capital
stock of the Company or 80% of its assets, as defined, all
options under the plan are vested. All options expire on the
seventh anniversary of the date of grant or, under certain
circumstances, 30days later. As a result of the IPO, each then outstanding option granted
under the Plans became exercisable upon vesting. Options granted
under the Associate Plan vest in three equal installments on the
second, third and fourth anniversaries of the date of their
grant, assuming the associates employment continues during
this period Four Year Vesting. Options granted
under the Executive Plan are subject to the Four Year Vesting as
to 84% of such options and performance vesting over the same
four years as to the remaining 16%. The performance vesting
criteria is based upon achieving specified operating results.
Partial vesting of options subject to performance vesting occurs
if the Company achieves less than 95% of the specified operating
results. Any portion of options granted under the Executive Plan
which are subject to performance vesting and which do not vest
during the four years will automatically vest 90days prior
to the end of the options term. If the specified operating
results are exceeded for any year by at least 10%, the executive
will receive options for up to an additional 5% 20% on a
cumulative basis of his or her original option grant at an
exercise price equal to that of the original grant. As a result
of exceeding the specified results, additional option grants of
approximately 15,000, 18,000 and 8,700 were granted in
April2001, 2000 and 1999, respectively. As of February4, 2001, the Company has granted options to
purchase 905,873 shares under the Associate Plan and 602,252
shares under the Executive Plan, net of cancellations and
exercises. Except for 96,062 options granted under the Executive
Plan see Employment Agreements below, the exercise
prices represent the fair market value at the date of grant
based upon the price paid for such shares and other valuation
analyses performed by the Company, or actual market prices as
determined by trades reported by the New York Stock Exchange
subsequent to the IPO, as applicable.

1999 Stock Option Plan On April30, 1999, the Company adopted the 1999 Employee
Stock Option Plan the 1999 Plan in order to
attract, retain and motivate qualified individuals to serve as
employees of the Company. The 1999 Plan is administered by the
Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors of the Company,
which has broad authority in administering and interpreting the
plan. Options to purchase up to an aggregate of 750,000 shares of
common stock may be granted under the 1999 Plan. Options granted
under the 1999 Plan may be options intended to qualify as
incentive stock options under Section422 of the Internal
Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, or options not intended to so
qualify. In the event of a sale of more than 80% of the
outstanding shares of capital stock of the Company or 80% of its
assets, as defined, all options under the plan are vested. All
options expire on the tenth anniversary of the date of grant
or, under certain circumstances, 30days later. As of February4, 2001, the Company has granted options to
purchase 530,186 shares under the 1999 Plan, net of
cancellations and exercises. The exercise prices represent the
fair market value at the date of grant based upon actual market
prices as determined by trades reported by the New York Stock
Exchange. Options granted under the 1999 Plan vest and become
exercisable as determined by the Board of Directors.
Directors Stock Plan Directors who are currently associated with the Investcorp Group
or the Carmel Group do not currently receive any compensation
for serving as directors. In June1998, the Companys
Board of Directors adopted a non-employee director compensation
plan, which was approved in June1999. The plan provides
for an aggregate of up to 50,000 shares in the form of
restricted stock grants or stock options. The Board of Directors
has adopted a policy which provides the two non-employee
directors who are not associated with the Investcorp Group or
the Carmel Group with an annual stipend of $25,000, of which at
least $10,000 must be paid in the form of restricted stock
grants. Pursuant to this Plan, two Directors were granted a
total of 1,854, 1,534 and 1,516 shares of restricted stock
during fiscal years 2000, 1999 and 1998, respectively.
Employment Agreements Auto has entered into an employment agreement with its Chairman
pursuant to which he is paid a fixed base salary and is eligible
for a bonus based upon earnings per share. The agreement does
not contain a stated termination date, but rather is terminable
at will by either party. If Auto were to terminate the
employment of the Chairman without cause, or if he terminates
his employment for good reason, Auto has agreed to pay to the
Chairman his base salary and performance bonus for a period of
24months. The Chairman also received a loan of $550,000
from the Company, bearing interest at 4545%. In consideration
of the Chairmans efforts regarding the Companys
acquisitions see Note4, $300,000 in principal amount of
this loan was forgiven during the fourth quarter of fiscal 1999,
with the remaining balance including accrued and unpaid
interest forgiven during the first quarter of fiscal 2000. Auto
had entered into an employment agreement with its then President
pursuant to which he was paid a base salary and a bonus based
upon earnings per share. The agreement was terminated effective
April1, 2000 in connection with the Presidents
retirement from day-to-day operations. In connection with the commencement of his employment, the
Company agreed to pay the Chairman $10 million which, in turn,
was used by the Chairman to purchase 83,079 shares of common
stock from a member of the Investcorp Group, reflecting a share
value of $1204, the fair market value at the date of the
agreement. The Company also loaned the Chairman approximately
$440,000 to pay the income tax consequences of the award. The
loan bears interest at the rate applicable to borrowings under
the Revolving Credit Commitment. This loan was paid in full in
December1998.
46 Table of Contents CSK AUTO CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARY NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
Continued In connection with the execution of his employment agreement,
the Companys Chairman received options for 401,967 shares
of common stock, exercisable at $1204 per share. As of
February4, 2001, these options were fully vested. The
Companys Chairman received options for 39,940 shares of
common stock, exercisable at $1204 per share, effective as of
February1, 1998. These options will vest and become
exercisable in four equal annual installments beginning in
April1999. In connection with the issuance of these
options, the Company will recognize a charge to earnings of
approximately $02 million over the vesting period for the
difference between the exercise price and the fair market value
of the common stock at the date of grant. In connection with the
IPO, the Companys Chairman received options for 216,635
shares of common stock, exercisable at $2000 per share, the
fair market value at the date of grant based on the IPO. These
options will vest and become exercisable in three equal annual
installments beginning in April2000. The Company also has a supplemental retirement plan agreement
with the Chairman which provides supplemental retirement
benefits for a period of ten years beginning the earlier of
February1, 2006 or the first anniversary of the date of
termination of his employment, provided he is terminated without
Cause as defined in such retirement plan agreement. The
benefit amount payable to the Chairman under this agreement is
based on the percentage of the benefit vested as of the date of
termination of his employment, not to exceed $600,000 per annum. In connection with the execution of his employment agreement,
the Companys former President received an option for
299,337 shares of common stock, exercisable at $1204 per share.
As of February4, 2001, these options were fully vested.
Management Stock Purchase Agreements and
Loan Plans In December1997, the Company entered into stock purchase
agreements with certain executives of the Company. Under the
terms of the agreements, the Company agreed to issue a total of
180,600 shares of its common stock at a price of $1204 per
share. In addition, the Company granted certain executives
non-qualified options to purchase 96,058 shares of its common
stock, also at a price of $1204 per share. The options contain
similar terms and vesting provisions as existing options under
the Companys Executive Stock Option Plan. In addition, in
the fourth quarter of fiscal 1997, the Company recorded deferred
compensation of approximately $05 million to reflect the
difference between the exercise price and the fair market value
of stock associated with the options granted to certain
executives. The deferred compensation will produce a charge to
earnings over the vesting period of the options. Of the total consideration paid to the Company of $22 million
in connection with the purchase of the Companys common
stock by certain executives, approximately $10 million was
loaned by the Company to certain executives to purchase 84,542
of the shares the Stock Loans. In addition, the
Company loaned $02 million to certain executives during fiscal
2000 to purchase additional shares. The Stock Loans are
collateralized by the stock under pledge agreements, provide
full recourse to the executive, bear interest at the average
rate paid by the Company under the revolving portion of its
Senior Credit Facility, and mature in December2003.

Continued The Company has recorded deferred tax assets of approximately
$112 million as of February4, 2001 reflecting the benefit
of federal and state tax loss carryforwards approximating $307
million and $110 million, which begin to expire in 2013 and
2006, respectively. Realization is dependent on generating
sufficient taxable income prior to expiration of the loss
carryforwards. Utilization of certain of the net operating loss
carryforwards may be limited under Section382 of the
Internal Revenue Code. Although realization is not assured,
management believes it is more likely than not that all the
deferred tax assets will be realized. Accordingly, the Company
believes that no valuation allowance is required for deferred
tax assets in excess of deferred tax liabilities. The amount of
the deferred tax assets considered realizable, however, could be
reduced in the near term if estimates of future taxable income
during the carryforward period are reduced.
Note 13 Store Closing Costs The Company provides an allowance for estimated costs and losses
to be incurred in connection with store closures. For stores to
be closed, such costs are recognized when a store is
specifically identified, costs can be estimated and closure is
planned to be completed within the next twelve months prior to
January31, 1999, eighteen months. For stores to be
relocated, such costs are recognized when an agreement for the
new location has been reached with a landlord and site plans
meet preliminary municipal approvals. The allowance for store
closing costs is included in accrued expenses in the
accompanying financial statements, and consists primarily of
future rents to be paid over the remaining terms of the master
lease agreement for stores, net of estimated sub-lease
recoveries. Future rents will be incurred through the expiration
of the non-cancelable leases, the longest of which run through
March2018. Activity in the provision for store closings and the related
store closing costs for the three years ended February4,
2001, is as follows in thousands Fiscal Year 2000 1999 1998 Balance, beginning of year 4,802 2,670 8,379 Store closing costs Store closing costs, gross 6,101 5,252 1,925 Adjustments to prior year plans 41 387 620 Revisions in estimates 35 970 Store closing costs, net 6,060 4,900 335 Purchase accounting adjustments Big Wheel 98 Als and Grand Auto Supply 2,744 4,080 Total purchase accounting adjustments 2,744 4,178 Payments 12,054 6,946 6,044 Balance, end of year 1,552 4,802 2,670 During the period that they remain open for business, the rent
and other operating expenses for the stores to be closed
continue to be reflected in normal operating expenses. As a
result of the AGA acquisition, the Company analyzed store
locations in California and the Pacific Northwest. The Company
closed or relocated 39 of the former AGA stores of which 37
were closed as of January30, 2000 based on several
factors including: 1market saturation; 2store
profitability; and 3store size and format. Costs
associated with these closures have been considered in the final
purchase price allocation see Note 4. In addition, the Company
finalized a store closure plan for CSK owned stores that overlap
with AGA stores, which resulted in pretax charges of
approximately $37 million and $25 million during fiscal 2000
and 1999, respectively. The charges consist of two components:
1future rents to be paid over the remaining terms of the
master lease
51 Table of Contents CSK AUTO CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARY NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
Continued agreements for the stores net of estimated sub-lease
recoveries; and 2write-down of leasehold improvements
and other fixed assets associated with the stores. As part of the purchase price allocation for the AGA and Big
Wheel stores see Note4, the Company recorded an
allowance for the costs of closing or relocating certain stores. Adjustments to prior plans relate to costs for store closures
that were accrued in prior years but withdrawn from the
Companys store closure plan in the period of adjustment.
Such withdrawals are due to subsequent improvements in the
underlying economics of the stores performance or in the
case of store relocation because the Company was unable to
secure a previously identified site upon acceptable lease terms.
The Company had significant adjustments to prior year plans in
1998 because of changes resulting from improved performance at
certain stores scheduled for closure in 1998. Further
significant changes to the strategic plan are not considered
likely. All relocations and store closings are anticipated to be
completed within twelve months of accrual and only after costs
can be estimated. Other cost revisions are comprised of changes in expected future
rental costs for vacant or sub-leased store locations, which are
due largely to early terminations of lease agreements. On a store count basis, activity and the remaining number of
stores to be closed are summarized as follows Number of Stores to be Closed Store Count by Beginning Plan Balance to Fiscal Year Balance Stores Added Amendments Stores Closed be Closed 1997 56 36 15 29 48 1998 48 24 10 33 29 1999 29 87 11 77 28 2000 28 24 1 42 9 At February4, 2001, there were 9 stores remaining to be

filed against the Company in the Superior Court in San Diego,
California. The case was brought by two former store managers
and a former senior assistant manager. It purported to be a
class action for all present and former California store
managers and senior assistant managers and sought overtime pay
for a period beginning in May 1995 as well as injunctive relief
requiring overtime pay in the future. The Company was also
served with two other lawsuits purporting to be class actions
filed in California state courts in Orange and Fresno Counties
by thirteen other former and current employees. The Company has
finalized a settlement of all of these lawsuits. The final
amount of the settlement was approximately $88 million which
includes plaintiffs attorneys fees and costs and
other miscellaneous expenses. The Company was served on March8, 2000 with a complaint
filed in Federal Court in the Eastern District of New York by
the Coalition for a Level Playing Field, L.L.C. and 250
individual auto parts dealers alleging that the Company and
seven other auto parts dealers AutoZone, Inc., Wal-Mart Stores,
Inc. 52 Table of Contents CSK AUTO CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARY NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
Continued Advance Stores Company, Inc., Discount Auto, Inc., The Pep
Boys Manny, Moe and Jack, Inc., OReilly
Automotive, Inc., and Keystone Automotive Operations, Inc.
violated the Robinson-Patman Act. Only 14 of the individual
plaintiffs asserted claims against the Company. The complaint
alleges that the Company and other defendants knowingly either
induced or received discriminatory prices from large suppliers,
allegedly in violation of Section2a and 2f of the
Robinson-Patman Act, as well as received compensation from large
suppliers for services not performed for those suppliers,
allegedly in violation of Section2c of the
Robinson-Patman Act. The complaint seeks injunctive relief
against all defendants and seeks treble damages on behalf of the
individual auto parts dealers who are plaintiffs, plus
attorneys fees. The complaint alleges that the estimated
average damage amount per plaintiff is $1,000,000 and more for
those plaintiffs that are wholesale distributors and not simply
jobbers before trebling. The Company believes the suit is
without merit and plans to vigorously defend it. The Company,
with other defendants, has filed a motion to dismiss and certain
other procedural motions. A decision on these motions is not
anticipated until the second or third quarter of fiscal 2001.
The Company does not currently believe that this complaint will
result in liabilities material to its consolidated financial
position, results of operations or cash flows. The Company currently and from time to time is involved in other
litigation incidental to the conduct of its business. The
damages claimed in some of this litigation are substantial.
Although the amount of liability that may result from these
matters cannot be ascertained, the Company does not currently
believe that, in the aggregate, they will result in liabilities
material to its consolidated financial position, results of
operations or cash flows.
