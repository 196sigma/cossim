ARIS CORPORATION
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
DECEMBER 31, 1996, 1997 AND 1998
1. ORGANIZATION, OPERATIONS AND SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
Organization and operations
ARIS Corporation ARIS provides a range of information technology
services including database management, enterprise resource planning, custom
applications development and packaged applications implementation, and
training to clients worldwide, with offices in Bellevue and Renton,
Washington; Beaverton, Oregon; Denver, Colorado; Dallas, Texas; Fairfax,
Virginia; Tampa and West Palm Beach, Florida; Bloomington, Minnesota; New
York, New York; Oak Brook, Illinois; Columbia, South Carolina; Oxford,
Birmingham, Reading and London, England; and Heidelberg, Germany. ARIS also
develops niche software programs which it has licensed worldwide. ARIS
utilizes the significant accounting policies summarized below in preparing its
financial statements.
Consolidation
The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of ARIS and its
wholly owned subsidiaries. All significant intercompany balances and
transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.
Estimates
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally
accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and
assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and
disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial
statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the
reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.
Cash and cash equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents include short-term investments with an original
maturity of three months or less.
Investment securities
ARIS' investment securities at December 31, 1997 and 1998 are classified as
available-for-sale and are recorded at fair value. Fair value is based upon
quoted market prices. The increase or decrease in market value from period to
period relating to available-for-sale marketable securities, net of deferred
income tax, is included as a separate component of shareholders' equity. Cost
of securities sold is determined using the specific identification method.
Property and equipment
Property and equipment are stated at cost. Expenditures for maintenance and
repairs are charged to income as incurred. Additions, improvements and major
replacements are capitalized. For financial reporting purposes, depreciation
is provided using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of
depreciable assets. Estimated useful lives of computers, equipment and
software range from three to eight years and lives of building and
improvements range from 15 to 39 years.
Intangible assets
Intangible assets include the cost of business acquisitions allocated to
capitalized software, non-compete agreements and goodwill which are amortized
over approximately three years for capitalized software,
28
ARIS CORPORATION
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS--Continued
December 31, 1996, 1997 and 1998
approximately two years for non-compete agreements and fifteen years for
goodwill. Capitalized software amortization is computed as described below
while the straight-line method is used for other intangible assets. The
carrying value of intangible assets is assessed for any permanent impairment
by evaluating the operating performance and future undiscounted cash flows of
the underlying assets. Adjustments are made if the sum of the expected future
net cash flows is less than book value in accordance with Statement of
Financial Accounting Standards No. 121, Accounting for the Impairment of
Long-Lived Assets and for Long-Lived Assets to be Disposed of which requires
that long-lived assets be reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes
in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of assets may not be
recoverable.
Software development costs
Software development costs incurred in conjunction with product development
are charged to product development expense until technological feasibility is
established. Thereafter, through general release of product, all software
product development costs are capitalized and reported at the lower of
unamortized cost or net realizable value of each product. The establishment of
technological feasibility and the on-going assessment of the recoverability of
costs require considerable judgment by ARIS with respect to certain external
factors, including, but not limited to, anticipated future gross product
revenues, estimated economic life and changes in the software and hardware
technology. After consideration of the above factors, ARIS amortizes
capitalized software costs at the greater of the amount computed using a the
ratio of current revenues for a product to the total of current and
anticipated future revenues, or b the straight-line method over the
remaining estimated economic life of the product.
Research and development
Expenditures relating to the development of new products and processes,
including significant improvements and refinements to existing products, are
expensed as incurred. The costs of business acquisitions allocated to in-
process research and development are expensed immediately. The Company
expensed no in-process research and development in 1997 and 1998.
Revenue recognition
Time and material consulting contracts
ARIS recognizes revenue as services are rendered.
Fixed-price consulting contracts
Revenues from fixed-price contracts are recognized on the percentage-of-
completion method, measured by the cost incurred to date and cost to complete
compared to estimated total costs for the contract. This method is used
because management considers expended costs together with estimates of
remaining costs to be the best available measure of contract performance.
Contract costs include all direct labor, material and any other costs related
to contract performance. Selling, general and administrative costs are charged
to expense as incurred. Provisions for estimated losses on uncompleted
contracts are made in the period in which such losses are determined. Changes
in job performance, job conditions and estimated profitability, including
those arising from contract penalty provisions, and final contract settlements
may result in revisions to costs and income and are recognized in the period
in which the revisions are determined.
29
ARIS CORPORATION
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS--Continued
December 31, 1996, 1997 and 1998
Education and training
Tuition revenue is recognized ratably throughout the period that classes are
held.
Software
ARIS accounts for software revenues in accordance with the American
Institute of Certified Public Accountants' Statement of Position 97-2,
Software Revenue Recognition. Revenues earned under software license
agreements with end users are generally recognized when the software has been
shipped, collectibility is probable, and there are no significant obligations
remaining.
ARIS initially defers revenue on the sale of extended software service
contracts which is then recognized on a straight-line basis over the life of
the contract period.
Income taxes
Provision for income taxes has been recorded in accordance with Statement of
Financial Accounting Standards No. 109, Accounting for Income Taxes SFAS
109. Under the liability method of SFAS 109, deferred tax assets and
liabilities are determined based on differences between financial reporting
and tax bases of assets and liabilities and are measured using enacted tax
rates and laws that will be in effect when the differences are expected to be
recovered or settled.
Advertising costs
Advertising costs are expensed as incurred. Advertising expenses amounted to
$212,000, $600,000 and $495,000 in 1996, 1997 and 1998, respectively.
Foreign currency translations
The financial statements of ARIS' foreign subsidiaries have been translated
into U.S. dollars in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting
Standards No. 52, Foreign Currency Translation SFAS 52. Under the
provisions of SFAS 52, all assets and liabilities in the balance sheet of the
foreign subsidiaries, whose functional currencies is the U.K. Pound Sterling,
are translated at year-end exchange rates, profit and loss accounts are
translated at average exchange rates prevailing during the period and
translation gains and losses are accumulated in a separate component of
shareholders' equity.
Fair value of financial instruments
The carrying amount of cash and cash equivalents and other current assets
and liabilities such as accounts receivable, accounts payable and accrued
liabilities as presented in the consolidated financial statements approximates
fair value based on the short-term nature of these instruments. Investments in
marketable securities are carried at fair value in the accompanying
consolidated balance sheet.
Stock-based compensation
Stock-based compensation is accounted for by following Financial Accounting
Standards Board FASB issued Statement No. 123, Accounting for Stock-Based
Compensation. Under the provisions of this Statement, employee stock-based
compensation expense is measured using either the intrinsic-value method as
prescribed by Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 25 or the fair value
method described in Statement
30
ARIS CORPORATION
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS--Continued
December 31, 1996, 1997 and 1998
No. 123. Companies choosing the intrinsic-value method are required to
disclose the pro forma impact of the fair value method on net income. ARIS has
elected to continue accounting for its employee stock-based compensation under
the provisions of Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 25. Stock-based
awards granted to other than employees are valued at fair market value on the
date of grant.
Net income per share
Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 128 SFAS 128 was issued
in February 1997. This pronouncement modifies the calculation and disclosure
of earnings per share and was adopted by ARIS during 1997. Under the
provisions of SFAS 128, basic earnings per share is calculated as income
available to common stockholders divided by the weighted-average number of
common shares outstanding during the periods. Diluted earnings per share is
based on the weighted-average number of shares of Common Stock and Common
Stock equivalents outstanding during the periods, including options and
warrants computed using the treasury stock method. All earnings per share
amounts from prior periods have been restated to reflect the adoption of
SFAS 128.
New Accounting Pronouncements
The FASB issued SFAS No. 130, Reporting Comprehensive Income, in June
1997. This statement establishes new standards for reporting and displaying
comprehensive income in the financial statements and was adopted by ARIS
during the quarter ended March 31, 1998. SFAS No. 130 requires
reclassification of prior periods financial statements to reflect application
of the provisions of this statement. In addition to net income, comprehensive
income includes charges or credits to equity that are not the result of
transactions with shareholders.
The following reflects the composition of accumulated other comprehensive
income at December 31, 1995, 1996, 1997 and 1998:

In June 1997, the FASB issued SFAS No. 131, Disclosures about Segments of
an Enterprise and Related Information. SFAS No. 131 establishes standards for
the way that public business enterprises report information about operating
segments in annual financial statements and requires that those enterprises
report selected information about operating segments in interim financial
reports issued to shareholders. It also establishes

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS--Continued
December 31, 1996, 1997 and 1998
standards for related disclosures about products and services, geographic
areas, and major customers. The Company has adopted SFAS No. 131 and has
provided the disclosures needed to conform with its requirements.
In June 1998, FASB issued SFAS No 133, Accounting for Derivative
Instruments and Hedging Activities SFAS 133. FAS 133 establishes
accounting and reporting standards for derivative instruments and for hedging
activities. If adopted by the Company, the Company expects that SFAS 133 will
have no material impact on its financial statements.
2. Pooling of Interest with Barefoot Computer Training Limited and InTime
Systems International, Inc.
On February 28, 1998, ARIS completed a merger with Barefoot Computer
Training Limited Barefoot, a company that provides information technology
training services in London, England. Under the terms of the merger, ARIS
issued 278,611 shares of Common Stock in exchange for all of the outstanding
shares of Barefoot common stock. The acquisition was accounted for as a
pooling-of-interest and, accordingly, all periods included in these
consolidated financial statements have been restated to give effect to the
merger.
Barefoot had a November 30 year end and, accordingly, the Barefoot balance
sheet at November 30, 1997 has been combined with the balance sheet of ARIS at
December 31, 1997, and Barefoot statements of income for the years ended
November 30, 1996 and 1997 have been combined with ARIS' statements of income
for the years ended December 31, 1996 and 1997, respectively. In order to
conform Barefoot year end to ARIS' year end, Barefoot financial statements
for the month of December 1997 are not included in the statements of income or
cash flows for 1997. Barefoot net loss for December 1997 decreases retained
earnings as of January 1, 1998.
On June 30, 1998, the Company completed a merger with InTime Systems
International, Inc. InTime, a Delaware corporation having its principal
offices in West Palm Beach, Florida. InTime, now a division of the Company,
provides information technology and human resource management systems
consulting services focusing primarily on Oracle and PeopleSoft technologies.
The acquisition was accounted for as a pooling-of-interests, in which the
Company issued 786,710 shares of Common Stock in exchange for all of the
outstanding shares of InTime common stock and warrants the Warrants to
purchase 718,997 shares of Common Stock in exchange for all of the outstanding
warrants to purchase shares of InTime common stock. Accordingly, all periods
included in the financial information furnished herein have been restated to
give effect to the merger.
A reconciliation of amounts of revenue and earnings for the years ended
December 31, 1996 and 1997 and the three months ended March 31, 1998,
previously reported by ARIS to the combined amounts presented herein follows:

reflect the recording of deferred tax assets of InTime in the total
amount of $412,000 as of December 31, 1995 which could be offset with
future reversals of deferred tax liabilities of ARIS upon the merger of
InTime into ARIS effective June 30, 1998.
3. Restructuring and other expense
In December, 1998, the Company restructured its training operations to gain
efficiency and profitability. Incident to the restructuring, the Company
incurred expenses aggregating $2,185,000 including $873,000 for employees
severances, $559,000 for equipment and asset abandonment, $593,000 for
anticipated lease disposition costs and $160,000 associated with other aspects
of the restructuring. At December 31, 1998, $1,280,000 of the amount accrued
was paid. The Company fully expects to complete the restructuring and utilize
all accrued costs by June 30, 1999.
In addition to the restructuring, the Company settled a litigation claim and
expensed $759,000. Management believes that a portion of the litigation
settlement cost may be recovered from insurance proceeds.
4. Acquisitions
ARIS has embarked upon an acquisition program that included the acquisition
of three companies during 1996, four companies during 1997 and two companies
during 1998, which have been accounted for by the purchase method of
accounting. Accordingly, the purchase price has been allocated to the assets
acquired and liabilities assumed based on management estimates, arms-length
negotiations with the sellers and in some cases, independent appraisals. The
common stock issued as consideration in these acquisitions has been recorded
at its estimated fair value at the date the acquisition was announced. The
results of operations of the acquired companies have been included in
consolidated results of operations of ARIS from the date of the acquisitions.
The following is a description of the terms of the various acquisitions:
1996
On May 1, 1996, ARIS acquired the stock of SQLSoft, Inc., a training company
based in Bellevue, Washington in exchange for 707,900 shares of unregistered
Common Stock.
On October 1, 1996, ARIS acquired the assets and liabilities of SofTeach
Corporation, a training company based in Denver, Colorado in exchange for
42,000 shares of unregistered Common Stock and a combination of notes payable

software development company which develops software modules which interface
with Oracle database applications software in exchange for 40,000 shares of
unregistered Common Stock and cash.

At December 31, 1998, ARIS had a $10,000,000 line of credit that was
collateralized by substantially all of ARIS' assets. All of this line was
available at December 31, 1998. Borrowings against the line of credit bear
interest at the lender prime rate.
10. Commitments and Contingencies
Lease commitments
ARIS rents office space under non-cancelable operating leases with initial
terms in excess of one year. Future minimum rental commitments under operating
leases for years ending December 31 are as follows:

Rent expense for 1996, 1997 and 1998 was $995,000, $2,159,000 and
$3,907,000, respectively.
Legal proceedings
ARIS is involved in certain legal proceedings that have arisen in the normal
course of business. Based on the advice of legal counsel, management does not
anticipate that these matters will have a material effect on ARIS'
consolidated financial position or results of operations.

11. Shareholders' Equity
In June 1997, ARIS completed an initial public offering of 2,300,000 shares
of Common Stock with net proceeds of approximately $31,242,000.
The Company initiated on January 1, 1998, the 1998 Employee Stock Purchase
Plan the ESPP. Under the ESPP, employees may elect to set aside up to 10%
of their gross compensation to purchase shares of Common Stock annually at a
15% discount to market price. The ESPP is a two year plan expiring on January
1, 2000. Executive officers other than the Chief Executive Officer may
participate in the ESPP on the same terms as eligible, non-executive
employees.
12. Earnings Per Share
The difference between the weighted-average number of common shares
outstanding used to calculate basic earnings per share and the weighted-
average number of common and common equivalent shares outstanding used to
calculate diluted earnings per share is the incremental shares attributed to
outstanding options and warrants to purchase Common Stock computed using the
treasury stock method.
Year Ended December 31,
1996    1997    1998
Weighted-average number of common shares
8,337,000 9,803,000 11,115,000
Effect of dilutive securities:
3,000   68,000
160,000  726,000  717,000

Weighted-average number of common and common
equivalent shares outstanding. 8,497,000 10,532,000 11,900,000
Options to purchase shares of Common Stock were outstanding in 1997 and
1998, but were not included in the computation of diluted earnings per share
because the options' exercise price was greater than the average market price
of the common shares.
13. Stock Options and Warrants
Prior to January 1995, ARIS from time to time granted non-qualified stock
options to key employees. These grants were not part of any formal plan.
In January 1995, ARIS adopted the ARIS Corporation 1995 Stock Option Plan
the 1995 Plan which provides for the granting of qualified or non-
qualified stock options to employees, directors, officers and certain non-
employees of ARIS as determined by the Plan Administrator. ARIS authorized
1,600,000 shares of its Common Stock for issuance under the 1995 Plan. The
date of grant, option price, vesting period and other terms specific to
options granted under the 1995 Plan are to be determined by the Plan
Administrator. The option price for stock options granted is based on the fair
market value of ARIS' stock on the date of grant. Options granted under the
1995 Plan expire seven years from the date of grant and vest over periods of
up to four years. ARIS ended grants under the 1995 Plan in March 1997.
In March 1997, ARIS adopted the ARIS Corporation 1997 Stock Option Plan the

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS--Continued

non-employee directors of ARIS as determined by the Plan Administrator. ARIS
authorized 2,000,000 shares of its Common Stock for issuance under the 1997
Plan, subject to certain adjustments, reduced by the number of shares that
have been granted and have not subsequently become available for grant under
the 1995 Plan. The 1997 Plan provides for automatic, non-discretionary grants
of 5,000 non-qualified stock options to non-employee directors for each year
of service. For all other grants under the 1997 Plan, the date of grant,
option price, vesting period and other terms specific to options granted under
the 1997 Plan are to be determined by the Plan Administrator. The option price
for stock options granted is based on the fair market value of ARIS' stock on
the date of grant. Options granted under the 1997 Plan expire ten years from
the date of grant and vest over periods of up to four years. On April 28,
1998, the shareholders of the Company approved an increase in the number of
shares of Common Stock available for issuance under the 1997 Plan to 2,000,000
shares.
In connection with the acquisition of Enterprise as discussed in Note 4,
ARIS issued warrants to purchase 20,844 shares of Common Stock with an
exercise price of $23988 and a fair value of $895 during 1997. Additionally,
during 1997 ARIS issued warrants to purchase 4,000 Shares of Common Stock with
an exercise price of $1000 to certain consultants of ARIS.
In connection with the acquisition of InTime as discussed in Note 3, ARIS
issued warrants to purchase 718,997 shares of Common Stock as consideration to
the former holders of warrants of InTime. The warrants commenced trading on
the Nasdaq National Market on July 16, 1998. Each of these warrants entitle
the holder to purchase one share of the Company Common Stock at an exercise
price of $2298. The warrants expire on February 15, 2000.
On December 15, 1998, the Company completed its voluntary stock option
exchange with existing employees holding options granted under the Company
1997 Stock Option Plan. Senior management was precluded from participating in
that exchange. Eligible employees electing to participate in the exchange
surrendered their existing options and received new options to purchase 20%
fewer shares of the Company Common Stock at an exercise price of $975 per
share, upon a modified vesting schedule.
A summary of the activity for non-qualified stock options granted prior to
1995, the 1995 Plan, and the 1997 Plan is presented below:

ARIS applies Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 25, Accounting for
Stock Issued to Employees, and related Interpretations in accounting for stock
options issued to employees. Had compensation cost for the 1995 Plan and the
1997 Plan been determined based upon the fair value at the grant date
consistent with the methodology prescribed under Statement of Financial
Accounting Standards No. 123, Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation, ARIS'
net income and net income per share would have been as follows:
Year Ended December 31,
1996    1997    1998
Net income as reported. $2,234,000 $5,899,000 $1,400,000

Basic earnings per share pro forma.   $026   $057   $006
Diluted earnings per share pro forma.   $025   $053   $006
The fair value of each stock option granted in 1996, 1997 and 1998 was
estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes single option method.
The following weighted average assumptions were used for grants in 1996, 1997
and 1998:
Year ended December 31,
1996    1997    1998

14. Profit Sharing Plan
ARIS maintains a qualified defined contribution profit sharing 401k plan
which covers full time employees with at least one month of service. There

period ended December 31, 1998 in conformity with generally accepted
accounting principles. These financial statements are the responsibility of
the Company management; our responsibility is to express an opinion on these
financial statements based on our audits. We did not audit the financial

November 30, 1997, and total revenues of $5,326,000 and $7,419,000 for the
years ended November 30, 1996 and 1997, respectively. Those statements were
audited by other auditors whose report thereon has been furnished to us, and
our opinion expressed herein, insofar as it relates to the 1996 and 1997
amounts included for Barefoot Computer Training Limited is based solely on the
report of the other auditors. We conducted our audits of these statements in
accordance with generally accepted auditing standards which require that we

statement presentation. We believe that our audits and the report of other
