NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2000, 1999 AND 1998
1   ORGANIZATION

presentment and payment software to financial institutions that want to provide
their own remote banking services. The Company also serves as an Application
Service Provider ASP by providing Internet hosting and service bureau

headquarters in Reston, Virginia. There are operating facilities in Charleston,

2   SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
a Principles of Consolidation - The consolidated financial statements include
the accounts of the Company and its wholly owned subsidiaries after elimination
of  all  material  inter-company  balances  and  transactions.  Certain
reclassifications have been made to the 1999 and 1998 financial statements to
conform to the 2000 financial statement presentation.
b Accounting Estimates - The preparation of financial statements in conformity
with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make
estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and
liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of
the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses
during the period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.
c Revenue Recognition - Beginning in 1998, the Company sold integrated
solutions that bundle software products with customization, installation and
training services. These arrangements are recognized using the percentage of
completion method of accounting.
Starting late in 2000, the Company entered into contracts for which the
products do not require significant customization and for which revenue is
recognized in accordance with Statement of Position SOP 97-2, Software Revenue
Recognition.  SOP 97-2  requires that revenue  recognized  from software
arrangements be allocated to each element of the arrangement based on the
relative fair values of the elements, such as software products, upgrades,
enhancements, post contract customer support, installation or training. Under
SOP 97-2, the determination of fair value is based on objective evidence that is
specific to the vendor. If evidence of fair value for each element of the
arrangement does not exist, all revenue from the arrangement is deferred until
such time as evidence of fair value does exist or until all elements of the
arrangement are delivered.   In December 1998, the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants
issued SOP 98-9, Modification of SOP 97-2, Software Revenue Recognition with
Respect to Certain Transactions. SOP 98-9 amends SOP 97-2 to require the entity
to recognize revenue for multiple element arrangements using the residual
method when: 1 there is vendor-specific evidence of the fair values of all of
the undelivered elements; 2 vendor-specific evidence of fair value does not
exist for one or more of the delivered elements; and 3 the revenue recognition
criteria of SOP 97-2 are satisfied. SOP 98-9 was adopted by the Company and did
not have a material effect on the Company consolidated results of operations,
financial position or cash flows.
License revenue is recognized when there is persuasive evidence of an
arrangement and delivery to the customer has occurred, the fee is fixed and
determinable, and collectibility is considered probable. Advance payments are
recorded as deferred revenue until the products are shipped, services are
delivered and all obligations are met.
Maintenance contracts generally require the Company to provide technical
support and software updates and upgrades to customers. Revenue from maintenance
contracts is recognized ratably over the term of the maintenance contract, on a
straight-line basis. Consulting service revenue,  consisting primarily of
consulting and implementation, is generally recognized at the time the service
is performed. Revenue from transactional services, which includes hosting and
service bureaus, is recognized as transactions are processed.
Lease revenue is recorded based on the units in service at the end of the
prior month since these leases are cancelable at any time.
d Cash and Cash Equivalents - The Company considers all non-restricted, highly
liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less to be cash
equivalents. Cash and cash equivalents are stated at cost, which approximates
their fair market value.
e Investments - The Company reports its investments in marketable securities
as available-for-sale with any unrealized holding gains and losses, net of the
related income tax effect, excluded from earnings and reported as a separate
component of stockholders' equity until such gains or losses are realized.
Dividends and interest income are recognized when earned. Realized gains or
losses are included in earnings and are derived using the first-in, first-out
method for determining cost of securities sold.
f Property and Equipment - Property and equipment is stated at cost.
Depreciation of property and equipment is calculated using the straight-line
method over the estimated useful lives of the assets, which are generally in the
range of three to seven years.
g Net Liabilities of Discontinued Operations - Under various disposal plans
adopted in 1997, 1998, and 2000, the Company has completed the divestiture of
all of its telecommunications, interactive services businesses and the Caller ID
adjunct leasing activities.
h Deferred Revenues - The Company received $5 million from Visa in the fourth
quarter of 1997, as a result of an agreement whereby the Company surrendered the
right to certain future royalty payments. The cash payment was recorded in
deferred revenues and was recognized in other revenues over the two-year period of the arrangement. Other deferred
revenues represent cash received for services to be provided. i Income Taxes - Income taxes are accounted for in accordance with the asset
and liability method. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the
future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial
statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their
respective tax bases. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using
enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which
those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect
on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in
income in the period that includes the enactment date. Valuation allowances are
established against deferred tax assets when it is deemed, based on available
evidence, that it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the
deferred tax asset will not be realized.
j Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation - The Company accounts for employee
stock options in accordance with Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 25 APB
25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees. Under APB 25, the Company
recognizes no compensation expense related to employee stock options, as no
options are granted at a price below the market price on the day of grant. The
Company accounts for stock options issued to non-employees in accordance with
the provisions of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123 SFAS
123, Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation.
SFAS 123 prescribes the recognition of compensation expense based on the
fair value to options on the grant date and allows companies to continue
applying APB 25 if certain pro forma disclosures are made assuming hypothetical
fair value method application. The Company has elected to continue to apply the
provisions of APB 25 for options granted to employees and provide the pro forma
disclosures pursuant to SFAS 123.
k Net Income Loss Attributable to Common Stockholders per share - Basic and
diluted loss per common share is computed by dividing net income loss, after
deducting preferred stock dividend  requirements and amortization of the
discounts on the preferred stock that was issued in 1999 by the weighted average
number of shares of common stock outstanding during the year. The effects of
stock options were not included in the loss per share computations in 1999 and
1998 because they would have been anti-dilutive.
l Fair Value of Financial Instruments - The carrying values of the Company
financial instruments such as cash and cash equivalents, investments in common
stock and bonds, accounts receivable, and accounts payable approximate their
fair values.
m New Accounting Pronouncements - In June, 1998, the FASB issued Statement of
Financial Accounting Standards No. 133, Accounting for Derivative Instruments
and Hedging Activities SFAS 133, which establishes accounting and reporting
standards for derivative instruments and for hedging activities by requiring
that all derivatives be recognized in the balance sheet and measured at fair
value. As amended by SFAS 137, SFAS 133 is effective for fiscal years beginning
after June 15, 2000.   SFAS 133 requires that all derivative financial instruments, such as
forward currency exchange contracts and interest rate swaps, be recognized in
the financial statements and measured at fair value regardless of the purpose or
intent for holding them. Changes in the fair value of derivative financial
instruments are either recognized periodically in income or shareholders' equity
as a component of comprehensive income, depending on whether the derivative is
being used to hedge changes in fair value or cash flows. The Company adoption
of this pronouncement, effective January 1, 2001, will not have a material
effect on the Company financial statements.
The carrying value of financial instruments approximates fair value and is
generally determined by reference to market values resulting from trading on a
national securities exchange or in an over-the-counter market. In cases where
quoted market prices are not available, fair value may be based on estimates
using present value or other valuation techniques.
In December 1999, the Securities and Exchange Commission issued Staff
Accounting Bulletin No. 101, Revenue Recognition in Financial Statements,
which provides guidance on the recognition, presentation and disclosure of
revenue in financial statements. The Company application of this pronouncement
did not have a material effect on the Company financial statements.
n Long-Lived Assets - The Company evaluates its long-lived assets for
impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the
carrying  amount of such assets or intangibles may not be recoverable.
Recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the
carrying amount of an asset to future undiscounted net cash flows expected to be
generated by the asset. If such assets are considered to be impaired, the
impairment to be recognized is measured by the amount by which the carrying
amount of the assets exceeds the fair value of the assets.
o Concentration Of Credit Risk - Financial instruments that potentially
subject the Company to credit risk consist principally of trade receivables. The
Company sells its products primarily to financial institutions in the United
States. The Company believes that the concentration of credit risk in its trade
receivables is substantially  mitigated by the Company on-going credit
evaluation process. The Company does not generally require collateral from
customers. The Company establishes an allowance for doubtful accounts based upon
factors surrounding the credit risk of specific customers, historical trends and
other information.
p Segment Reporting - The Company maintained operations in two primary
operating segments: Internet banking and leasing. As discussed in Note 4, the
Company has discontinued its leasing segment and all related  financial
information has been reclassified to reflect the results of operations as
discontinued operation.
3   INVESTMENTS
On January 20, 2000, Home Financial Network, Inc. HFN, a company in
which InteliData held approximately a 25% ownership interest, merged with
Sybase, Inc. InteliData accounted for its investment in HFN using the equity
method. As of the merger date, such investment carrying value was zero. In
exchange for its portion of ownership in HFN InteliData received approximately $5,867,000 in cash and approximately 1,770,000
shares of Sybase stock. The Company also held warrants to purchase HFN common
stock. As part of the merger agreement, such warrants were converted into
warrants to purchase Sybase common stock. The Company received 640,000 warrant
units with an exercise price of $260 per warrant unit. Upon exercise of each
warrant unit, the Company is entitled to receive $1153448 in cash and 034794
share of Sybase common stock. InteliData recognized a gain of approximately
$42,604,000 on this transaction during the first quarter of 2000.
An escrow account was established to provide Sybase, Inc. indemnity
protection against possible claims that might arise against HFN. Approximately
133,000 shares of Sybase common stock owned by InteliData were put in escrow,
along with approximately $440,000 of cash. In March 2001, the Company received
the escrow payments less approximately $127,000 for miscellaneous claims under
the escrow provision.
Additionally, the Company acquired approximately $251,000 of marketable
securities during 2000. The Company considers all of its investments to be
available-for-sale under the provisions of Statement of Financial Accounting
Standards No. 115, Accounting for Certain Investments in Debt and Equity
Securities, and as such, included within stockholders' equity as of December 31,
2000 is $494,000 of unrealized gain on investments net of taxes, which
represents the increase in the fair market value of the investment holdings from
the acquisition price to December 31, 2000. As discussed in Note 1, effective
January 1, 2001, the Company investment in the Sybase warrants will be
accounted for in accordance with SFAS 133.
As of December 31, 2000, the Company has classified all investments as
available-for-sale, including the above-mentioned investment held in escrow. The
amortized cost, gross unrealized holding gains, gross unrealized holding losses
and fair value of the securities were as follows in thousands              Cost or     Gross     Gross

Total           $ 9,713    $  514     $ 10    $10,217   All fixed income securities are due after five years.
As of December 31, 2000, approximately $3,541,000 of the equity securities
represented the warrants to purchase Sybase common stock. The fair value of the
warrants  described above was estimated on December 31, 2000 using the
Black-Scholes model using the following: no dividend yield, expected volatility
of 60%, life of 12 months, and a risk free interest rate of 610% per annum. 4   DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS
The Company leased Caller ID adjunct units under an agreement with US West,
whereby the Company leased Caller ID units directly to US West customers. The
leasing program enabled subscribers to pay a monthly fee for the equipment. In
1996, US West ceased leasing new Caller ID adjunct units under the program.
Notwithstanding the termination of this program, previously existing leases
remained in effect. The number of active records in the Company installed
lease base historically decreased at a rate of approximately 30% per year.
During 2000, US West notified the Company that US West would no longer
permit InteliData to include the lease billing on the US West telephone bills.
As such, InteliData has discontinued billing its legacy customers for Caller ID
adjunct unit leases in the US West telephone service territory, because the cost
of individually billing and pursuing collections for the leases would have made
it impractical and uneconomical for the Company to continue the lease program.
Accordingly, the results of operations from leasing activities have been
reported as discontinued operations.
During the second quarter of 1998, the Company adopted a plan to dispose of
its various telecommunications divisions through sale and liquidation. The
Company Caller ID adjunct inventory was sold in May 1998. The Company Plexus
inventory was sold in December 1998. The Company IPS and Landmark inventory
was sold in February 1999.
As of December 31, 2000, the Company had $755,000 in remaining liabilities
related to the discontinued operations. During the year, the Company sold the
only remaining asset it had in the discontinued operations -- the building in
New Milford, Connecticut. Liabilities remaining in the discontinued operations
include a reserve for potential environmental clean-up at the New Milford
location, costs for legal shut-down of former operating subsidiaries, potential
warranty and royalty costs, and potential settlements with telecom customers and
others. The Company is working with its professional advisors and insurer to
manage its exposure to liability for the potential environmental clean-up.
Management does not believe that the resolution of this matter will be likely to
have a material adverse effect on the Company financial condition or results
of operations.

Summary of Discontinued Operations
In 2000, the Company experienced a loss of $262,000 in discontinued
operations, while there was a gain of $5,805,000 in 1999. The loss in 2000 was
solely related to the Caller ID business and was primarily the result of the
Company write-off of the remaining accounts receivable. The gain of $5,805,000
in 1999 is divided into $2,579,000 from the Caller ID leasing business and
$3,226,000 from the telecommunications and interactive services divisions. All
of the above results are net of applicable income taxes.
The gain on disposal of the telecommunications and interactive services
divisions net of income taxes was $3,226,000 in 1999 compared to a loss of
$16,174,000 for the year ended December 31, 1998. The gain of $3,226,000 is
attributable to specific events that occurred during the year including:
favorable settlements with former telecommunications customers, the success of
other settlements with vendors and negotiated expense settlements, aggressive
collection efforts, and experiencing lower than anticipated shut-down costs such
as warranty and customer service expenses associated with closing down the
discontinued operations.
During 1998, the loss from operations of telecommunications and interactive
services divisions net of income taxes of $18,049,000 included $13,784,000 in
inventory adjustments and $4,265,000 of other activity, while there was a gain
of $3,306,000 from the Caller ID leasing business. The loss on disposal of
telecommunications and interactive service divisions consisted of $2,696,000 in
expected sales returns, $3,539,000 in property adjustments, $3,010,000 in
provisions for doubtful customer accounts, and $6,929,000 in actual and expected
losses from operations from the measurement date through the date of disposal.

7   STOCKHOLDERS' EQUITY
a   Issuance and Subsequent Conversion of Preferred Stock and Warrants
On July 22, 1999, the Company issued 600 shares of 4% Convertible Preferred
Stock, for net proceeds of $5,670,000. A portion of the proceeds was allocated
to warrants to purchase 120,000 shares of InteliData common stock and to the
beneficial conversion feature of such preferred stock, with the resulting
discount on the preferred stock being amortized as dividends. In the fourth
quarter of 1999, all of the preferred stock was converted to common shares.
The fair value of these 120,000 warrants, which expire five years from the
issuance date and have an exercise price of $453, was estimated as of the grant
date using the Black-Scholes model. The following assumptions were used: no
dividend yield, expected volatility of 129%, life of 5 years, and a risk free
interest rate of 400% per annum.  Accordingly,  the Company  allocated
approximately $369,000 to these warrants and the charge was amortized over the
period that the preferred stock was outstanding. As of December 31, 2000,
104,000 warrants remained outstanding.
b   Stock Options
The Company sponsors several stock option plans that cover substantially
all employees and directors. Options granted under such plans typically vest
monthly over periods ranging from one to five years and generally expire in
eight and ten years, although some grants provide for vesting in annual
increments or allow for accelerated vesting based upon reaching performance
milestones. Most options granted under the plans allow the purchase of stock at
the fair value of such common stock at the respective grant dates.
In June 1998, employees other than the then President and Chief Executive
Officer were given the opportunity to cancel their options and have them
replaced with options with strike prices equal to the common stock fair value
on those dates option repricing.     A summary of stock option activity for each of the Company stock
option plans is as follows                     Exercise Prices

The Company applies the intrinsic value method of Accounting Principles
Board Opinion No. 25 and related interpretations in accounting for its stock
plans. In connection therewith, during 1998, the Company recognized $18,000 of
compensation expense in connection with option grants at exercise prices below
fair market value on the dates of the grant.
Had compensation cost been determined based on the fair value method of
Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123, the Company results of
operation would have been as follows in thousands, except for per share data
for the years ended December 31                          2000    1999    1998
Net income loss             $18,836  $ 7,679 $38,437
Basic earnings loss per common share   $ 049  $ 023 $ 122
Diluted earnings loss per common share  $ 046  $ 023 $ 122
The weighted average fair value of options granted during 2000, 1999,
and 1998 was $685, $153, and $115 per share, respectively. The fair value of
options granted was estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes
option-pricing model. For 2000 year-end,  the following weighted average
assumptions were used: no dividend yield, expected volatility of 134%, and a
risk free interest rate of 516% per annum. For 1999 year-end, the following
weighted average assumptions were used: no dividend yield, expected volatility
of 156%, and a risk free interest rate of 55% per annum. For 1998 year-end, the
following weighted average assumptions were used: no dividend yield, expected
volatility of 136%, and a risk free interest rate of 528% per annum.     The Company has options outstanding and exercisable in varying price
ranges. The schedule below details the Company options by price range                        Options Outstanding       Options Exercisable

c   Employee Stock Purchase Plan
Under the Employee Stock Purchase Plan, approved in 1996, the Company is
authorized to issue up to 500,000 shares of common stock to its full-time
employees, nearly all of who are eligible to participate. Under the terms of the
Plan, employees can choose each period to have up to twenty percent of their
annual base earnings withheld to purchase the Company common stock. The
purchase  price  of the  stock  is 85  percent  of the  lower of its
beginning-of-period or end-of-period market price. During the years ended
December 31, 2000, 1999, and 1998 the Company issued 20,079, 33,498, and 44,307
shares of stock under the plan, respectively.
d   Treasury Stock
In 2000, the Company paid $59,000 to acquire an additional 9,212 shares of
its own common stock. These shares were surrendered by employees of the Company
to satisfy tax-withholding obligations associated with the vesting of certain
restricted stock awards. As of December 31, 2000, the Company had a total of
690,712 common shares in treasury at an aggregate cost of $2,123,000.
e   Stockholder Rights Plan
In January 1998, the Company Board of Directors adopted a Stockholder
Rights Plan. This plan was amended on May 24, 2000. The rights are designed to
assure that all the Company stockholders receive fair and equal treatment in
the event of any proposed takeover of the Company and to guard against partial
tender offers, open market accumulations and other tactics to gain control of
the Company without paying all stockholders a control premium.
Terms of the Stockholder Rights Plan provide for a dividend distribution of
one right for each share of common stock to holders of record at the close of
business on February 6, 1998. Shareholders will be able to exercise the rights
only in the event, with certain exceptions, an acquiring party accumulates 20
percent or more of the Company voting stock, or if a party an acquiring
person announces an offer to acquire 20 percent or more without prior approval
of the Company Board of Directors. The rights will expire on January 21, 2008.
Each right initially will entitle the holder to buy one one-thousandth of a
share of a new series of preferred stock at a price of $4250.   In addition, upon the occurrence of certain events, holders of the rights
will be entitled to purchase either the Company common stock or shares in an
acquiring person at half of market value. Further, at any time after a person or
group acquires 20 percent or more of the Company outstanding voting stock, the
board of directors may, at its option, exchange part or all of the rights other
than rights held by the acquiring person, which will become void for shares of
the Company common stock on a one-for-one basis. The rights will therefore
cause substantial dilution to a person or group that acquires 20 percent or more
of the Company common stock on terms not approved by the board.
f   Stock Warrants   In 2000, the Company entered into a five-year agreement with an unrelated
party, whereby the Company issued warrants to this entity in exchange for the
entity becoming a premier reference site for InteliData service bureau
offering. As a premier reference site, the entity would make its facility and
personnel reasonably accessible for InteliData, InteliData potential clients,
analysts, and industry publication reporters, in order to demonstrate or answer
questions regarding a service bureau environment and InteliData capabilities.
On June 30, 2000, InteliData issued five-year, fully-vested warrants to purchase
50,000 share of InteliData common stock at an exercise price of $475 per share.
The fair value of these warrants was estimated as of the grant date using the
Black-Scholes model. The following assumptions were used: no dividend yield,
expected volatility of 143%, life of 2 years, and a risk free interest rate of
644% per annum. Accordingly, the Company recorded approximately $419,000 of
deferred compensation that is being amortized over the term of this agreement.
As of December 31, 2000, all of these warrants were still outstanding. 8   EMPLOYEE 401k SAVINGS PLAN

responsibility of the Company management. Our responsibility is to express an
opinion on these consolidated financial statements based on our audits.
We conducted our audits in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted

perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial

significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall
financial statement presentation.  We believe that our audits provide a
reasonable basis for our opinion.
In our opinion, such consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all
material respects, the financial position of InteliData Technologies Corporation
