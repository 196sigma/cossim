DESCRIPTION OF THE BUSINESSKnoll,Inc. and its subsidiaries the Company or Knoll are engaged in the design, manufacture and sale of furniture products and accessories, modern outdoor furniture, as well as the sale of fine leather, textiles, and felt, focusing on the middle to high-end segments of the market. The Company has primary operations in the United States U.S., Canada, and Europe and sells its products primarily through its direct sales representatives and independent dealers2. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIESPrinciples of ConsolidationThe consolidated financial statements of the Company include the accounts of the Company and its wholly owned subsidiaries and any partially owned subsidiaries that the Company has the ability to control. Control generally equates to ownership percentage, whereby investments that are more than 50% owned are generally consolidated investments in affiliates of 50% or less but greater than 20% are generally accounted for using the equity method, and investments in affiliates of 20% or less are accounted for using the cost method. Intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated in consolidation.The results of the European subsidiaries are reported and included in the consolidated financial statements on a one-month lag to allow for the timely preparation of consolidated information. The effect of this presentation is not material to the financial statements.Use of EstimatesThe preparation of the consolidated financial statements in conformity with United States generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. Actual results may differ from such estimates.Restatement of Previously Reported Financial InformationIn conjunction with the year-end financial statement close process, an error was identified in the historical accounting for income taxes during the annual and quarterly periods from 2007 through 2014. The error resulted from the failure to identify the income tax ramifications associated with the non-timely settlement of sales transactions between the Company Canadian subsidiary, Knoll North America Corp., and Knoll, Inc. The errors resulted in improperly stated deferred tax assets and liabilities, uncertain tax positions, other comprehensive income, and income tax expense. Consequently, the Company has restated certain prior period amounts for these errors. The Company has also corrected certain other identified immaterial errors, including the recognition of certain sales and cost of sales in the incorrect fiscal periods.The impact of these prior period errors were not material to the Company in any of those prior periods. However, the aggregate amount of the prior period errors of $39 million, if corrected in 2014, would have been material to the Company current year consolidated statement of operations and comprehensive income. The Company has corrected the prior period errors for all periods presented, including each of the quarters ended in 2014 and 2013, by restating the consolidated financial statements and other financial information included herein. See Notes 23 and 24 for the impact of these corrections on previously reported amounts.Cash and Cash EquivalentsCash and cash equivalents include cash on hand and highly liquid investments with maturities of threemonths or less at the date of purchase50Table of ContentsKNOLL,INC.NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS ContinuedDECEMBER 31, 20142. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES continuedRevenue RecognitionThe Company recognizes revenue when the earnings process is complete. This occurs when risk and title transfers, collectibility is reasonably assured and pricing is fixed and determinable. Accordingly, revenue is recognized when risk and title are transferred to the client, which primarily occurs at the time of shipment. Taxes on revenue producing transactions are not included in sales. Based on historical experience, accruals are made at the time of sale to estimate for sales returns. Customer ReceivablesThe Company maintains allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of its customers to make required payments. The allowance is determined through an analysis of the aging of accounts receivable and assessments of risk that are based on historical trends and an evaluation of the impact of current and projected economic conditions. The Company evaluates the past-due status of its customer receivables based on the contractual terms of sale. If the financial condition of the Company customers were to deteriorate, resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments, additional allowances may be required. Accounts receivable are charged off against the allowance for doubtful accounts when the Company determines that recovery is unlikely. InventoriesInventories are stated at the lower of cost or market. Cost is determined using the first-in, first-out method. The Company reserves for inventory that, in its judgment, is impaired or obsolete. Obsolescence may be caused by the discontinuance of a product line, changes in product material specifications, replacement products in the marketplace and other competitive influences.Property, Plant, and EquipmentProperty, plant, and equipment are stated at cost, less accumulated depreciation. Depreciation is computed using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets. The useful lives are as follows: 45years for buildings and 2to 12years for machinery and equipment.The Company reviews the carrying values of its property and equipment for possible impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable based on undiscounted estimated cash flows expected to result from its use and eventual disposition. The factors considered by the Company in performing this assessment include current operating results, trends and other economic factors. In assessing the recoverability of the carrying value of the property and equipment, the Company must make assumptions regarding future cash flows and other factors. If these estimates or the related assumptions change in the future, the Company may be required to record an impairment loss for these assets.Goodwill and Intangible AssetsThe Company records the excess of purchase price over the fair value of the tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired as goodwill. Goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives are tested for impairment at least annually and whenever events or circumstances occur indicating that a possible impairment may have been incurred. Intangible assets with finite lives are amortized over their useful lives. The Company assesses whether goodwill impairment exists using both the qualitative and quantitative assessments. The qualitative assessment involves determining whether events or circumstances exist that indicate it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, including goodwill. If based on this qualitative assessment the Company determines it is not more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount or if the Company elects not to perform a qualitative assessment, a quantitative assessment is performed using a two-step approach to determine whether a goodwill impairment exists at the reporting unit. 51Table of ContentsKNOLL,INC.NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS ContinuedDECEMBER 31, 20142. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES continuedThe first step of the quantitative test is to compare the carrying amount of the reporting unit assets to the fair value of the reporting unit. If the fair value exceeds the carrying value, no further work is required and no impairment loss is recognized. If the carrying amount exceeds the fair value, then the second step is required to be completed, which involves allocating the fair value of the reporting unit to each asset and liability, with the excess being applied to goodwill. An impairment loss occurs if the amount of the recorded goodwill exceeds the implied goodwill. The determination of the fair value of the reporting units is based, among other things, on estimates of future operating performance of the reporting unit being valued. When performing the two-step quantitative impairment test, the Company methodology includes the use of an income approach, which discounts future net cash flows to their present value at a rate that reflects the Company cost of capital, otherwise known as the discounted cash flow method DCF. These estimated fair values are based on estimates of future cash flows of the reporting units. The Company also incorporates market multiples for comparable companies in determining the fair value of the reporting units. Any such impairment would be recognized in full in the reporting period in which it has been identified. The Company assesses whether indefinite-lived intangible assets impairment exists using both the qualitative and quantitative assessments. The qualitative assessment involves determining whether events or circumstances exist that indicate it is more likely than not that the fair value of an indefinite-lived intangible asset is less than its carrying amount. If based on this qualitative assessment, the Company determines it is not more likely than not that the fair value of an indefinite-lived intangible asset is less than its carrying amount or if the Company elects not to perform a qualitative assessment, a quantitative assessment is performed to determine whether an indefinite-lived intangible asset impairment exists. The Company tests the indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment by comparing the carrying value to the fair value based on current revenue projections of the related operations, under the relief from royalty method. Any excess of the carrying value over the amount of fair value is recognized as an impairment. Finite-lived assets such as customer relationships, non-compete agreements, and licenses are amortized over their estimated useful lives. The Company reviews the carrying values of these assets for possible impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable based on undiscounted estimated cash flows expected to result from its use and eventual disposition. The Company continually evaluates the reasonableness of the useful lives of these assets.Business CombinationsThe purchase price of an acquired company is allocated between tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed from the acquired business based on their estimated fair values, with the residual of the purchase price recorded as goodwill. The results of operations of the acquired business are included in the Company operating results from the date of acquisition.Deferred Financing FeesFinancing fees that are incurred by the Company in connection with the issuance of debt are deferred and amortized to interest expense over the life of the underlying indebtedness.Shipping and HandlingAmounts billed to clients for shipping and handling of products are classified as sales. Costs incurred by the Company for shipping and handling are classified as cost of sales.Research and Development CostsResearch and development expenses, which are expensed as incurred and included as a component of selling, general, and administrative expenses, were $192 millionfor 2014, $178 millionfor 2013, and $153 millionfor 201252Table of ContentsKNOLL,INC.NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS ContinuedDECEMBER 31, 20142. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES continuedIncome TaxesThe Company accounts for income taxes using the asset and liability approach, which requires deferred tax assets and liabilities be recognized using enacted tax rates to measure the effect of temporary differences between book and tax bases on recorded assets and liabilities. Valuation allowances are recorded to reduce deferred tax assets, if it is more likely than not some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be recognized. The need to establish valuation allowances against deferred tax assets is assessed quarterly. The primary factors used to assess the likelihood of realization are forecasts of future taxable income and available tax planning strategies that could be implemented to realize the net deferred tax assets.With respect to accounting for uncertainty in income taxes, the Company evaluates tax positions to determine whether the benefits of tax positions are more likely than not of being sustained upon audit based on the technical merits of the tax position. For tax positions that are more likely than not of being sustained upon audit, the Company recognizes the largest amount of the benefit that is greater than 50% likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement. For tax positions that are not more likely than not of being sustained upon audit, the Company does not recognize any portion of the benefit. If the more likely than not threshold is not met in the period for which a tax position is taken, the Company may subsequently recognize the benefit of that tax position if the tax matter is effectively settled, the statute of limitations expires, or if the more likely than not threshold is met in a subsequent period. The Company recognizes tax related interest and penalties in income tax expense and accrues for interest and penalties in other noncurrent liabilities. Fair Value of Financial InstrumentsThe Company uses the following valuation techniques to measure fair value for its financial assets and financial liabilities:Level1Inputs are unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.Level2Inputs are quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in an active market, quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not active, inputs other than quoted prices that are observable and market-corroborated inputs which are derived principally from or corroborated by observable market data.Level3Inputs are derived from valuation techniques in which one or more significant inputs or value drivers are unobservable.Fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date an exit price. The Company and its subsidiaries use, as appropriate, a market approach generally, data from market transactions, an income approach generally, present value techniques and option-pricing models, and/or a cost approach generally, replacement cost to measure the fair value of an asset or liability. These valuation approaches incorporate inputs such as observable, independent market data and/or unobservable data that management believes are predicated on the assumptions market participants would use to price an asset or liability. These inputs may incorporate, as applicable, certain risks such as nonperformance risk, which includes credit risk.Derivative Financial InstrumentsFrom time to time, the Company enters into foreign currency hedges to manage its exposure to foreign exchange rates associated with short-term operating receivables of a Canadian subsidiary that are payable by the U.S. operations. The terms of these contracts are typically less than a year. 53Table of ContentsKNOLL,INC.NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS ContinuedDECEMBER 31, 20142. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES continuedThe Company does not hold or issue derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes. The Company recognizes derivatives as either assets or liabilities in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet and measures those instruments at fair value. Changes in the fair value of such contracts are reported in earnings as a component of Other income expense, net.Commitments and ContingenciesThe Company establishes reserves for the estimated cost of environmental and legal contingencies when such expenditures are probable and reasonably estimable. A significant amount of judgment and use of estimates is required to quantify the ultimate exposure in these matters. The Company engages outside experts as deemed necessary or appropriate to assist in the evaluation of exposure. From time to time, as information becomes available regarding changes in circumstances for ongoing issues as well as information regarding emerging issues, the potential liability is reassessed and reserve balances are adjusted as necessary. Revisions to the estimates of potential liability, and actual expenditures related to environmental and legal contingencies, could have a material impact on the results of operations or financial position.WarrantyThe Company generally offers a warranty for its products. The specific terms and conditions of those warranties vary depending upon the product sold. The Company estimates the costs that may be incurred under its warranties and records a liability in the amount of such costs at the time product revenue is recognized. Factors that affect the Company liability include historical product-failure experience and estimated repair costs for identified matters for each specific product category. The Company periodically assesses the adequacy of its recorded warranty liabilities and adjusts the amounts as necessary. Concentration of Credit RiskThe Company accounts receivables are primarily due from a network of independent dealers and direct customers. The Company monitors and manages the credit risk associated with the individual dealers and direct customers. The independent dealers are responsible for assessing and assuming credit risk of their customers and may require their customers to provide deposits or other credit enhancement measures. Historically, the Company has had a concentration of federal and local government receivables, however, they carry minimal credit risk.Foreign Currency TranslationResults of foreign operations are translated into U.S. dollars using average exchange rates during the year, while assets and liabilities are translated into U.S. dollars using the exchange rates as of the balance sheet dates. The resulting translation adjustments are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income loss.Transaction gains and losses resulting from exchange rate changes on transactions denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of the applicable subsidiary are included in the Consolidated Statements of Operations, within other income expense, net, in the year in which the change occurs.Stock-Based CompensationThe Company measures the cost of employee services received in exchange for an award of equity instruments based on the grant-date fair value of the award. Forfeitures are estimated based on historical experience54Table of ContentsKNOLL,INC.NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS ContinuedDECEMBER 31, 20142. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES continuedStock OptionsThe fair value for stock options is estimated at the date of grant using an option pricing model, which requires management to make certain assumptions based on both historical and current data. The assumptions include expected term of the options, risk-free interest rate, expected volatility, and dividend yield. The expected term represents the expected amount of time that options granted are expected to be outstanding, based on historical and forecasted exercise behavior. The risk-free rate is based on the rate at grant date of zero-coupon U.S. Treasury Notes with a term equal to the expected term of the option. Expected volatility is estimated based on the historical volatility of the Company stock price. The Company dividend yield is based on historical data.  The Company recognizes compensation expense over the applicable vesting period using the graded vesting attribution method, which treats each option grant as multiple grants each with its own requisite service period.Restricted Stock and Restricted Stock UnitsThe fair value of restricted stock and restricted stock units, excluding the market-based restricted stock units discussed below, is based upon the closing market price of the Company common stock on the date of grant. The Company recognizes compensation expense using the straight-line method over the vesting period.The fair value of the market-based restricted stock units is estimated at the date of grant using a lattice pricing model, which requires management to make certain assumptions based on both historical and current data. These awards vest based upon the performance of the Company stock price relative to a peer group. The assumptions included in the model include, but are not limited to, risk-free interest rate, expected volatility of the Company and the peer group stock prices, and dividend yield. The risk-free rate is based upon the applicable U.S. Treasury Note rate. Expected volatility is estimated based on the historical volatility of the Company and peer group stock prices. The Company dividend yield is based on historical data. Earnings per ShareBasic earnings per share excludes the dilutive effect of icommon shares that could potentially be issued due to the exercise of stock options, and iiunvested restricted stock and restricted stock units, and is computed by dividing net earnings attributable to Knoll, Inc. stockholders by the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding for the period. Diluted earnings per share includes the effect of shares and potential shares issued under the stock incentive plans. Pension and Other Postretirement BenefitsThe Company sponsors two defined benefit pension plans and two other postretirement benefit plans. Several statistical and other factors, which attempt to anticipate future events, are used in calculating the expense and liability related to the plans. Key factors include assumptions about the expected rates of return on plan assets, discount rates, and health care cost trend rates, as determined by us, within certain guidelines. The Company considers market conditions, including changes in investment returns and interest rates, in making these assumptions.The Company determines the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets based on aggregating the expected rates of return for each component of the plan asset mix. The Company uses historic plan asset returns combined with current market conditions to estimate the rate of return. The expected rate of return on plan assets is a long-term assumption and generally does not change annually. The discount rate reflects the market rate for high-quality fixed income debt instruments as of our annual measurement date and is subject to change each year. Unrecognized actuarial gains and losses are recognized over the expected remaining service life of the employee group. Unrecognized actuarial gains and losses arise from several factors, including experience and assumption changes with respect to the obligations and from the difference between expected returns and actual returns on plan assets. These unrecognized gains and losses are systematically recognized as a change in future net periodic pension expense in accordance with the appropriate accounting guidance relating to defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans55Table of ContentsKNOLL,INC.NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS ContinuedDECEMBER 31, 20142. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES continuedKey assumptions used in determining the amount of the obligation and expense recorded for postretirement benefits other than pensions OPEB, include the assumed discount rate and the assumed rate of increases in future health care costs. In estimating the health care cost trend rate, the Company considers actual health care cost experience, future benefit structures, industry trends and advice from our actuaries. The Company assumes that the relative increase in health care costs will generally trend downward over the next several years, reflecting assumed increases in efficiency and cost-containment initiatives in the health care system.In accordance with the appropriate accounting guidance, the Company recognized in the consolidated balance sheet the funded status i.e.,the difference between the fair value of plan assets and the projected benefit obligation of the defined benefit pension and postretirement benefit plans. To record the unfunded status of the plans, the Company recorded an additional liability and an adjustment to accumulated other comprehensive income, net of tax.The actuarial assumptions the Company used in determining the pension and OPEB retirement benefits may differ materially from actual results due to changing market and economic conditions, higher or lower withdrawal rates, or longer or shorter life spans of participants. While the Company believes that the assumptions used are appropriate, differences in actual experience or changes in assumptions may materially affect the financial position or results of operations.Segment InformationAccounting Standards Codification 280, Segment Reporting, defines that a segment for reporting purposes is based on the financial performance measures that are regularly reviewed by the Chief Operating Decision Maker to assess segment performance and to make decisions about a public entity allocation of resources. Based on this guidance, the Company reports its segment results based on the following reportable segments: iOffice; iiStudio; and iiiCoverings. The Office segment serves corporate, government, healthcare, retail and other customers in the United States and Canada providing a portfolio of office furnishing solutions including systems, seating, storage, and KnollExtra ergonomic accessories, and other products. The Studio segment includes KnollStudio, Knoll Europe which sells primarily KnollStudioproducts, and Holly Hunt Enterprises, Inc. The KnollStudioportfolio includes a range of lounge seating; side, caf and dining chairs; barstools; and conference, dining and occasional tables. HOLLY HUNTproduces and showcases custom made product including indoor and outdoor furniture, lighting, rugs, textiles and leathers. The Coverings segment includes, KnollTextiles, Spinneybeck, and EdelmanLeather.These businesses serve a wide range of customers offering high-quality textiles, felt, and leather.New Accounting PronouncementsIn May 2014, the FASB issued ASU No2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers. This ASU supersedes the revenue recognition requirements in Accounting Standards Codification 605, Revenue Recognition, and most industry-specific guidance throughout the Accounting Standards Codification. The standard requires that an entity recognizes revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the company expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. This ASU is effective for fiscal years beginning after December15, 2016, and for interim periods therein. The guidance permits the use of either a full retrospective or modified retrospective transition method. The Company has not yet selected a transition method and is currently evaluating the impact of the amended guidance on the consolidated financial position, results of operations and related disclosures56Table of ContentsKNOLL,INC.NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS ContinuedDECEMBER 31, 20143. ACQUISITIONSOn February3, 2014, the Company acquired Holly Hunt Enterprises, Inc HOLLY HUNT. The acquisition advances the Company strategy of building its global capability as a resource for high-design workplaces and homes, including the commercial contract, decorator to-the-trade and consumer markets. The aggregate purchase price for the acquisition was $950 million, plus certain contingent payouts of up to $160 millionin the aggregate based on the future performance of the business. The purchase price was funded from borrowings under the Company revolving credit facility. The Company recorded the acquisition of HOLLY HUNT using the acquisition method of accounting and recognized the assets acquired and liabilities assumed at their fair values as of the date of the acquisition. The results of operations of HOLLY HUNT have been included in the Company Studio segment beginning February 3, 2014.The amount of sales and net earnings that resulted from the acquisition and attributable to Knoll, Inc. stockholders included in the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income during the twelve months ended December31, 2014were as follows in thousands:Sales$102,572Net earnings attributable to Knoll, Inc. stockholders$6,291The following table summarizes the preliminary fair values assigned to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed as of the February 3, 2014 acquisition date in thousands:Working Capital 1$14,376Property, plant and equipment5,995Intangible assets41,786Contingent  interests218Other liabilities604Fair value of net acquired identifiable assets and liabilities$45,335Purchase Price$95,000Less: Fair value of net acquired identifiable assets and  Working capital accounts include cash, customer receivables, inventories, prepaid expenses and other current assets, accounts payable, and  other current liabilities.These above amounts are reflective of adjustments made during the fourth quarter of 2014, which include a $06 millionreduction to working capital and an offsetting increase to goodwill. Additionally, these amounts are determined based on certain valuations and studies that have yet to be finalized, and accordingly, the assets acquired and liabilities assumed, as detailed above, are subject to adjustment once the detailed analyses are finalized. The goodwill recorded is deductible for income tax purposes. 57Table of ContentsKNOLL,INC.NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS ContinuedDECEMBER 31, 20143.

INCOME TAXESIn conjunction with the year-end financial statement close process, an error was identified in the historical accounting for income taxes during the annual and quarterly periods from 2007 to 2014. The error resulted from the failure to identify the income tax ramifications associated with the non-timely settlement of sales transactions between the Company Canadian subsidiary, Knoll North America Corp., and Knoll, Inc. The errors resulted in improperly stated deferred tax assets and liabilities, uncertain tax positions, other comprehensive income, and income tax expense. Consequently, the Company has restated certain prior period amounts. The Company has also corrected certain other identified errors, including the recognition of certain sales and cost of sales in the incorrect fiscal periods. See Notes 23 and 24 for the impact of these corrections on previously reported amounts.

LEASESThe Company has commitments under operating leases for certain machinery and equipment as well manufacturing, warehousing, showroom and other facilities used in its operations. Some of the leases contain renewal provisions and generally require the Company to pay certain operating expenses, including utilities, insurance and taxes, which are subject to escalation. At times the Company enters into lease agreements which contain a provision for cash abatements related to certain leasehold improvements. These abatements are recognized on a straight-line basis as a reduction to rent expense over the lease term. The unamortized portions as of December31, 2014and 2013were $92 millionand $81 million, respectively. Total rent expense for 2014, 2013, and 2012was $288 million, $188 million, and $159 million, respectively. Future minimum rental payments required, excluding maintenance and other miscellaneous charges, under those operating leases are as follows in thousands:Future Minimum Rental  years39,571Total minimum lease payments$134,95117. PENSION AND OTHER POSTRETIREMENT BENEFITSThe Company has two domestic defined benefit pension plans and twoplans providing for other postretirement benefits, including medical and life insurance coverage. Oneof the pension plans and oneof the other postretirement benefit plans cover eligible U.S. nonunion employees while the other pension plan and other postretirement benefits plan cover eligible U.S. union employees. The Company uses a December31 measurement date for both of these plans.Both the pension plans and the other postretirement benefit plans were modified during the year ended December31, 2011. Participants who had 70or more points age plus completed years of service could elect to stay in the pension and accrue additional benefits or receive the Company 401K match which was reinstated as of January1, 2012. Those with less than 70points were phased-out from the pension plan and do not accrue any additional benefits after December31, 2011. However, these individuals may receive the Company 401K matching contributions. The Company other postretirement benefit plans are in the process of being eliminated. During 2014, the Company offered a one-time lump sum payment option to terminated vested participants in exchange for the right to receive future pension payments. As a result, the Company settled $302 millionof benefit obligations and recorded a $61 millionsettlement charge during the year ended December 31, 201469Table of ContentsKNOLL,INC.NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS ContinuedDECEMBER 31, 201417.

The net actuarial gain of $531 millionin 2013 was mainly due to higher discount rates as compared to 2012 and a gain on plan assets held during the year.The estimated net actuarial loss for the defined benefit pension plans included in accumulated other comprehensive income and expected to be recognized in net periodic pension cost during the fiscal year ended December31, 2015 are $87 million.The following table sets forth the components of the net periodic benefit cost for the Company pension and other postretirement benefit plans in thousands:Pension BenefitsOther    return on plan  of prior service cost  actuarial  and curtailment related expense6,060449Net periodic benefit  the year ended December 31, 2014, $73 millionof pension expense was recorded in cost of sales and $53 millionwas recorded in selling general, and administrative expenses.Assumptions used to determine net periodic benefit cost for the years ended December31, 2014, 2013, and 2012were as follows:Pension BenefitsOther  rate510 - 518%430 - 440%510 - 515%269 - 505%225 - 425%340 - 505%Expected return on plan  of compensation  of ContentsKNOLL,INC.NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS ContinuedDECEMBER 31, 201417. PENSION AND OTHER POSTRETIREMENT BENEFITS continuedThe expected long-term rate of return on assets is based on management expectations of long-term average rates of return to be earned on the investment portfolio. In establishing this assumption, management considers historical and expected returns for the asset classes in which the plan assets are invested.For purposes of measuring the benefit obligation associated with the Company other postretirement benefit plans as of December31, 2014, as well as the assumed rate for 2015, an annual rate increase of 775%to 825%in the per capita cost of covered health care benefits was assumed and a 70%annual rate of increase in the per capita cost of covered prescription drug benefits was assumed. The rates were then assumed to decrease to an ultimate rate of 50%for 2022 and thereafter. For purposes of measuring the net periodic benefit cost for 2014associated with the Company other postretirement benefits plans, an 80%to 85%annual rate of increase in the per capita cost of covered medical benefits was assumed and a 725%annual rate of increase in the per capita cost of covered presciption drug benefits was assumed. The rate was then assumed to decrease to an ultimate rate of 50%for 2022 for both the medical plan and prescription drug plan and thereafter. Increasing the assumed health care cost trend rate by 10%would increase the benefit obligation as of December31, 2014by $343,000and increase the aggregate of the service and interest cost components of net periodic benefit cost for 2014by $11,000. Decreasing the assumed health care cost trend rate by 10%would decrease the benefit obligation as of December31, 2014by $336,000and decrease the aggregate of the service and interest cost components of net periodic benefit cost for 2014by $10,000.The Company pension plans' weighted-average asset allocations as of December31, 2014and 2013, by asset category were as follows:Plan Assets atDecember31,20142013Asset Category:Temporary investment funds4%4%Equity investment funds6163Fixed income funds3533Total100%100%The Company pension plans' investment policy includes an asset mix based on the Company risk posture. The investment policy states a target allocation of 60%equity funds and 40%fixed income funds. Inclusion of the fixed income funds is to provide growth through income and these funds should primarily invest in fixed income instruments of the U.S. Treasury and government agencies and investment-grade corporate bonds. The equity fund investments can consist of a broadly diversified domestic equity fund, an actively managed domestic equity fund and an actively managed international equity fund. The purpose of these funds is to provide the opportunity for capital appreciation, income, and the ability to diversify investments outside the U.S. equity market. Mutual funds are used as the plans' investment vehicle since they have clearly stated investment objectives and guidelines, offer a high degree of investment flexibility, offer competitive long-term results, and are cost effective for small asset balances.The Company does not expect to contribute to its pension plans in 2015. The Company expects to contribute approximately $10 millionto its other postretirement benefit plans in 2015.

RESTRUCTURING AND OTHER CHARGESDuring 2013, the Company approved certain restructuring activities. These restructuring activities primarily related to headcount reductions in the Office segment as part of the Company previously announced strategic supply chain initiatives and headcount reductions in the Studio segment associated with factory overhead consolidations. During 2014, the Company approved additional restructuring actions. These actions primarily included reductions in headcount in the Office and Coverings segments, the exiting of certain showrooms within our Coverings segment, and charges related to improvements to better utilize the Company manufacturing capacity. The Company does not expect any additional charges related to these restructuring actions in the future. The Company anticipates that the majority of the remaining liability will be paid during the first quarter of 2015.

FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTSFinancial InstrumentsThe fair values of the Companys cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, and accounts payable approximate carrying value due to their short maturities.The fair value of the Companys long-term debt approximates its carrying value, as it is variable rate debt and the terms are comparable to market terms as of the balance sheet dates, and are classified as Level 2.Assets and Liabilities Recorded at Fair Value on a Recurring BasisThe following table represents the assets and liabilities, measured at fair value on a recurring basis as of December31, 2014 and the basis for that measurement in thousands:Liabilities:Level 1Level 2 Level 3TotalContingent purchase price payments related to the acquisition of HOLLY HUNT 16,000$16,000Pursuant to the agreement governing the acquisition of HOLLY HUNT, the Company may be required to makeannual contingent purchase price payments in 2015, 2016 and 2017. The payouts are based upon HOLLY HUNT reaching annual sales targets in 2014, 2015, and 2016, and are paid out by February 15 of the following year. The Company classifies these contingent purchase price payments as a Level 3 measurement and is required to remeasure this liability at fair value on a recurring basis. The fair value of such contingent purchase price payments was determined based upon net sales projections for HOLLY HUNT for 2014, 2015, and 2016. Based on sales achievement made by HOLLY HUNT during 2014, $50 millionof the $160 millioncontingent purchase price was paid by February 15, 2015. Excluding the initial recognition of the liability for the contingent purchase price payments and payments made to reduce the liability, any changes in the fair value will be included within selling, general and administrative expenses80Table of ContentsKNOLL,INC.NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS ContinuedDECEMBER 31, 201422.

The Company used a royalty rate of 50%based on comparable market rates and a discount rate of 127%.Based on the results of the 2013 annual impairment test, the Company determined that the Edelman Leather tradename was impaired as the estimated fair value of the tradename was less than its respective carrying amount due to a 100-basis-point increase in the assumed discount rate and a reduction in expected future revenue growth rates. As a result, the carrying amount of the Edelman Leather tradename was reduced from $261 millionto its estimated fair value of $172 million, resulting in a non-cash pre-tax impairment charge of $89 millionduring the fourth quarter of 2013.

As described below, management has identified a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting, which is an integral component of our disclosure controls and procedures. As a result of the material weakness, our principal executive officer and principal financial officer have concluded that the Disclosure Controls were not effective at December 31, 2014 in reaching a reasonable level of assurance that iinformation required to be disclosed by us in the reports that we file or submit under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the Securities and Exchange Commission rules and forms and iiinformation required to be disclosed by us in the reports that we file or submit under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our principal executive and principal financial officers, or persons performing similar functions, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure92Table of ContentsINTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTINGManagement annual report on internal control over financial reporting.Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as defined in Rule13a-15f under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, for the Company. Internal control over financial reporting is a process to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of our financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Internal control over financial reporting includes without limitation, maintaining records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect our transactions, providing reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary for preparation of our financial statements, providing reasonable assurance that receipts and expenditures of company assets are made in accordance with management authorization, and providing reasonable assurance that unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of company assets that could have a material effect on our financial statements would be prevented or detected on a timely basis. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting is not intended to provide absolute assurance that a misstatement of our financial statements would be prevented or detected.Our management assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting based on the framework in Internal ControlIntegrated Frameworkissued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission 2013 framework. Our evaluation of internal control over financing reporting did not include the internal controls of Holly Hunt Enterprises, Inc., which was acquired on February 3, 2014, and is included in our 2014 consolidated financial statements and constituted approximately 168% of total assets as of December 31, 2014 and 98% and 135% of sales and net earnings, respectively, for the year then ended. Due to the material weakness described below, management has concluded the Companys internal control over financial reporting was not effective as of December 31, 2014.A material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the Companys annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. Management concluded that the Company did not maintain effective internal controls as of December 31, 2014 related to accounting for income taxes. Specifically, the following material weakness was identified:In conjunction with the financial statement close process, it was determined that the income tax accounts were not maintained appropriately, including giving proper consideration to the income tax consequences of foreign source income required to be recognized in the Company U.S. federal and state income tax returns. The error resulted in the understatement of income tax expense and the overstatement and understatement of other comprehensive income in the annual and interim periods from 2007 through 2014. These errors were not prevented or detected in a timely manner as a result of deficiencies in the design and operation of a combination of review controls associated with the Company income tax process. Accordingly, the Company did not maintain effective controls to ensure the accuracy of the provision for income taxes. Specifically, the Company did not maintain a sufficient complement of tax resources with the required proficiency to identify, evaluate, review, and report complex tax accounting matters.The effectiveness of the Companys internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2014 has been audited by Ernst Young LLP, the Companys independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in their report included in Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.Management plans for remediation.The Company has begun to implement a number of remediation steps to address the material weakness discussed above and to improve its internal control over income tax accounting. Specifically, the following have been, are being or are planned to be implemented: dedicating additional internal and external personnel resources with the appropriate level of proficiency to identify, evaluate, and review complex tax accounting matters; organizational structure changes which better integrate the tax accounting and finance functions; enhancement of our processes and procedures for determining, documenting and calculating our income tax provision; and increasing the level of certain tax review activities during the financial statement close process.The measures described above should remediate the material weakness identified and strengthen our internal controls over income tax accounting. Management is committed to improving the Companys internal control process. As the Company continues to evaluate and improve its internal control over income tax accounting, additional measures to address the material weakness or modifications to certain of the remediation procedures described above may be identified. The Company expects to complete the required remedial actions during 201593Table of ContentsChanges in internal control over financial reporting.There has been no change in our internal control over financial reporting during the period covered by this report that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting94Table of ContentsReport of Independent Registered Public Accounting FirmThe Board of Directors and Stockholders of Knoll, Inc. We have audited Knoll, Inc.s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2014, based on criteria established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission 2013 framework the COSO criteria. Knoll, Inc.s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying Managements annual report on internal control over financial reporting.Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the companys internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board United States. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.A companys internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A companys internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that 1 pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; 2 provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and 3 provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the companys assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.As indicated in the accompanying Managements annual report on internal control over financial reporting, managements assessment of and conclusion on the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting did not include the internal controls of Holly Hunt Enterprises, Inc., which is included in the 2014 consolidated financial statements of Knoll, Inc. and constituted 168% of total assets as of December 31, 2014 and 98% and 135% of sales and net earnings, respectively, for the year then ended. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting of Knoll, Inc. also did not include an evaluation of the internal control over financial reporting of Holly Hunt Enterprises, Inc.A material weakness is a deficiency, or combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the companys annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. Management has identified a material weakness associated with the design and operation of a combination of review controls associated with the Company income tax process. We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board United States, the consolidated balance sheets of Knoll, Inc. as of December 31, 2014 and 2013, and the related consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income, equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2014. This material weakness was considered in determining the nature, timing and extent of audit tests applied in our audit of the 2014 consolidated financial statements, and this report does not affect our report dated March 2, 2015, which expressed an unqualified opinion on those financial statements. 95Table of ContentsIn our opinion, because of the effect of the material weakness described above on the achievement of the objectives of the control criteria, Knoll, Inc. has not maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2014, based on the COSO criteria. /s/ Ernst Young LLPPhiladelphia, PennsylvaniaMarch 2, 201596Table of ContentsItem 1B.UNRESOLVED STAFF COMMENTSNoneItem 2 relating to directors, director nominees and executive officers of the registrant is incorporated by reference from the information under the captions Board of Directors, Election of Directors, Executive Officers, Board Meetings and Committees, Code of Ethics, and Section16a Beneficial Ownership Reporting Compliance contained in our Proxy Statement for our 2015 Annual Meeting of Stockholders the Proxy Statement.The information relating to the identification of the audit committee, audit committee financial expert and director nomination procedures of the registrant is incorporated by reference from the information under the caption Board Meetings and Committees contained in our Proxy Statement.Our Board of Directors has adopted a code of ethics for all employees.
