Item 8 hereof for financial information
about the Company foreign and domestic operations and export sales required
by this Item.                    6   The Company uses a process of integrated lead qualification and sales
demonstration. Once a customer opportunity is identified, the Company employs a
team-based sales approach involving inside and outside sales personnel who are
supported by application engineers.
The Company employs a variety of marketing techniques, including direct
mail, trade shows, and advertising in trade journals, and proactively seeks
publicity opportunities for customer testimonials. Management believes that
word-of-mouth advertising from the Company existing customers provides an
important marketing advantage. The Company also has a computerized sales and
marketing software system with telemarketing, lead tracking and analysis, as
well as customer support capabilities. Each of the Company sales offices is
linked electronically to the Company headquarters.
In June 1996, the Company entered into an Original Equipment Manufacturer
OEM agreement with Mitutoyo Corporation Mitutoyo, a Japanese company that
is the world largest manufacturer of metrology tools. Mitutoyo markets the
FAROArmR in Japan under the name SPINARMR. The agreement, which grants
Mitutoyo non-exclusive distribution right in Japan, expires in June 2000 and is
renewable for successive one-year terms.
In March 1999, the Company entered into an OEM agreement with Brown &
Sharpe Manufacturing Company Brown & Sharpe, a North Kingstown, Rhode Island
company that is a world leader in the manufacture of traditional CMMs and other
metrology products. Brown & Sharpe will market the FAROArmR worldwide under
the name GAGE 2000 A. The agreement, which grants Brown & Sharpe non-exclusive
distribution right worldwide, expires in March 2001, and is renewable for
successive one-year terms.
RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT
The Company believes that its future success depends on its ability to
achieve technological leadership, which will require ongoing enhancements of
its products and the development of new applications and products that provide
3-D measurement solutions. Accordingly, the Company intends to continue to make
substantial investments in the development of new technologies, the
commercialization of new products that build on the Company existing
technological base and the enhancement and development of additional
applications for its products.
The Company research and development efforts are directed primarily at
enhancing the functional adaptability of its current products and developing new
and innovative products that respond to specific requirements of the emerging
market for 3-D measurement systems. The Company research and development
efforts have been devoted primarily to mechanical hardware, electronics and
software. The Company engineering development efforts will continue to focus
on the FAROArmR and the family of CAM2 products. Significant efforts are also
being directed toward the development of new measurement technologies and
additional features for existing products. See Technology.                    7   At December 31, 1999, the Company employed 49 scientists and technicians
in its research and development efforts. Research and development expenses were
approximately $38 million in 1999 as compared to $26 million in 1998 and $11
million in 1997. Research and development activities, especially with respect
to new products and technologies, are subject to significant risks, and there
can be no assurance that any of the Company research and development
activities will be completed successfully or on schedule, or, if so completed,
will be commercially accepted.
TECHNOLOGY
The primary measurement function of the FAROArmR is to provide
orientation and position information with respect to the probe at the end of the
FAROArmR. This information is processed by software and can be compared to the
desired dimensions contained in the CAD data of a production part or assembly to
determine whether the measured data conforms to such dimensional specifications.
To accomplish this measurement function, the FAROArmR is designed as an
articulated arm with six or seven joints. The arm consists of aluminum links and
rotating joints that are combined in different lengths and configurations,
resulting in human arm-like characteristics. Each joint is instrumented with a
rotational transducer, a device used to measure rotation, which is based on
optical digital technology. The position and orientation of the probe in three
dimensions is determined by applying trigonometric calculations at each joint.
The position of the end of a link of the arm can be determined by using the
angle measured and the known length of the link. Through a complex summation of
these calculations at each joint, the position and orientation of the probe is
determined.
The Company products are the result of a successful integration of
state-of-the-art developments in mechanical and electronic hardware and
applications software. The unique nature of the Company technical
developments is evidenced by the Company numerous U.S. and international
patents. The Company maintains low cost product design processes by retaining
development responsibilities for all electronics, hardware and software.
MECHANICAL HARDWARE. The FAROArmR is designed to function in diverse
environments and under rigorous physical conditions. The arm monitors its
temperature to adjust for environments ranging from -10 degrees to +50 degrees
Celsius. The arm is constructed of pre-stressed precision bearings to resist
shock loads. Low production costs are attained by the proprietary combination of
reasonably priced electromechanical components accompanied by the optimization
and on-board storage of calibration data. Many of the Company innovations
relate to the environmental adaptability of its products. Significant features
include integrated counter-balancing, configuration convertibility and
temperature compensation.                    8   ELECTRONICS. An on-board computer that is designed to handle complex
analyses of joint data as well as communications with a variety of host
computers processes the rotational information for each joint. The Company
electronics are based on digital signal processing and surface mount
technologies. The Company products meet all mandatory electronic safety
requirements. Advanced circuit board development, surface mount production and
automated testing methods are used to ensure low cost and high reliability.
SOFTWARE. CAM2 is a Windows-based, 32-bit application family written for
the most recent PC-based technology. CAM2 has been entirely designed and
programmed by the Company utilizing field input and industry wide beta site
installations. CAM2 CAD AnalyserR is a family member for viewing, analyzing
and browsing CAD files. CAM2 DesignR is a family member primarily used for
reverse engineering and is written as an AutoCAD runtime extension ARX that is
the AutoCAD Application Programming Interface API. Family member CAM2
MeasureR is simplified version of Design for pure measurement applications
written entirely on the ACIS CAD development platform. Family member CAM2
AutomotiveR is a measurement software designed for large CAD files and
specific Automotive applications and is written using a proprietary graphics
display engine. Family member CAM2 SPC ProcessR is designed for plant wide
dimensional data acquisition and presentation in classical SPC Statistical
Process Control formats for plant-wide quality control.
All the CAM2 family members are written in the C++ development language
using Microsoft Foundation Class MFC standards. The software fully implements
UNICODE standards for worldwide translation allowing the Company to create
foreign language versions to enter international markets more effectively. The
software is developed with the cooperation of diverse user beta sites and a
well-developed system for tracking and implementing market demands.
INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY
The Company holds or has pending 30 patents in the United States, 19 of
which are also held or pending in other jurisdictions. The Company also has 12
registered trademarks in the United States, 18 foreign registered trademarks,
10 trademark applications pending in the United States and 11 foreign trademark
applications pending.
The Company relies on a combination of contractual provisions and trade
secret laws to protect its proprietary information. There can be no assurance
that the steps taken by the Company to protect its trade secrets and
proprietary information will be sufficient to prevent misappropriation of its
proprietary information or to preclude third-party development of similar
intellectual property.
Despite the Company efforts to protect its proprietary rights,
unauthorized parties may attempt to copy aspects of the Company products or
to obtain and use information that the Company regards as proprietary. The
Company intends to vigorously defend its proprietary rights against
infringement by third parties. However, policing unauthorized use                    9 of the Company products is difficult, particularly overseas, and the Company
is unable to determine the extent to which piracy of its software products
exists. In addition, the laws of some foreign countries do not protect the
Company proprietary rights to the same extent as the laws of the United
States.
The Company does not believe that any of its products infringe on the
proprietary rights of third parties. There can be no assurance, however, that
third parties will not claim infringement by the Company with respect to
current or future products. Any such claims, with or without merit, could be
time-consuming, result in costly litigation, cause product shipment delays or
require the Company to enter into royalty or licensing agreements. Such royalty
or licensing agreements, if required, may not be available on terms acceptable
to the Company or at all, which could have a material adverse effect upon the
Company business, operating results and financial condition.
MANUFACTURING AND ASSEMBLY
The Company manufactures its products primarily at its headquarters in
Lake Mary, Florida. Manufacturing consists primarily of assembling components
and subassemblies purchased from suppliers into finished products. The primary
components, which include machined parts and electronic circuit boards, are
produced by subcontractors according to the Company specifications. All
products are assembled, calibrated and tested for accuracy and functionality
before shipment. In limited circumstances, the Company performs in-house
circuit board assembly and part machining.
Quality has rapidly emerged as a new emphasis in commerce and industry,
and is a significant factor in international trade. The Company
manufacturing, engineering and design headquarters have been registered to the
ISO 9001 standard since July 1998. Three successive surveillance audits have
documented continuous improvement to this multinational standard. The Company
continues to examine its scope of registration as the business evolves, and has
chosen English as the standard business language for its operations. This
decision is expected to significantly influence the Company operations and
documentation globally. This has been done in concert with the ISO Standard
Registrar, and is expected to increase customer confidence in the Company
products and services worldwide.
COMPETITION
The broad market for measurement devices, which include hand-measurement
tools, test fixtures and conventional, fixed-base CMMs, is highly competitive.
Manufacturers of hand-measurement tools and traditional CMMs include a
significant number of well-established companies that are substantially larger
and possess substantially greater financial, technical and marketing resources
than the Company. There can be no assurance that these entities or others will
not succeed in developing products or technologies that will directly compete
with those of the Company. The market for measurement software to retrofit
traditional CMMs, and for statistical process control is also highly
competitive. The Company                    10 will be required to make continued investments in technology and product
development to maintain its technological advantage over its competition. There
can be no assurance that the Company will have sufficient resources to make
such investments or that the Company product development efforts will be
sufficient to allow the Company to compete successfully as the industry
evolves. The Company products compete on the basis of portability, accuracy,
application features, ease-of-use, quality, price and technical support.
The Company only significant direct competitor for its FAROArmR and
related software is a joint venture of Romer SRL France and Romer, Inc.
California. The Company is aware of a direct competitor in Germany, two direct
competitors in Italy, and a direct competitor in the United Kingdom, each of
which the Company believes currently has negligible sales. The Company also has
an established, indirect competitor in Japan that markets a measuring device
that is mobile but not portable. There can be no assurance that such companies
will not devote additional resources to the development and marketing of
products that compete with those of the Company.
The worldwide trend toward CAD-based factory floor metrology has resulted
in the introduction of CAD-based inspection software and statistical process
control for conventional CMMs by most of the large CMM manufacturers. Certain
CMM manufacturers are miniaturizing, and in some cases increasing the mobility
of, their conventional CMMs. Nonetheless, these CMMs still have small
measurement volumes, lack the adaptability typical of portable, articulated arm
measurement devices and lose accuracy outside the controlled environment of the
metrology lab.

OF OPERATIONS.
THE FOLLOWING INFORMATION SHOULD BE READ IN CONJUNCTION WITH THE
CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS OF THE COMPANY, INCLUDING THE NOTES THERETO,
INCLUDED ELSEWHERE IN THIS DOCUMENT.
OVERVIEW
The Company designs, develops, markets and supports portable,
software-driven, 3-D measurement systems that are used in a broad range of
manufacturing and industrial applications. In May 1998 the Company acquired CATS
Computer Aided Technologies, GmbH CATS, a German company which develops and
markets CAD-based inspection and statistical process control SPC software.
The Company principal products are the FAROArmR articulated measuring device
and its multi-faceted CAM2 formerly AnthroCamR software which provides for
CAD-based inspection on portable and fixed-base CMMs, and factory-level
statistical process control. Together, these products integrate the measurement
and quality inspection function with CAD, CAM and computer-aided engineering
CAE technology to improve productivity, enhance product quality and decrease
rework and scrap in the manufacturing process. The Company products bring
precision measurement, quality inspection and specification conformance
capabilities, integrated with leading CAD software, to the factory floor. The
Company is a pioneer in the development and marketing of 3-D measurement
technology in manufacturing and industrial applications and currently holds or
has pending 30 patents in the United States, 19 of which also are held or
pending in other jurisdictions. The Company products have been purchased by
more than 1,500 customers worldwide, ranging from small machine shops to such
large manufacturing and industrial companies as General Motors,
Daimler-Chrysler, Ford, Boeing, Lockheed Martin, General Electric, Westinghouse
Electric, Caterpillar and Komatsu Dresser.
From its inception in 1982 through 1992, the Company focused on providing
computerized, 3-D measurement devices to the orthopedic and neurosurgical
markets. During this period, the company introduced a knee laxity measurement
device, a diagnostic tool for measuring posture, scoliosis and back
flexibility, and a surgical guidance device utilizing a six-axis articulated
arm.
In 1992, in an effort to capitalize on a demand for 3-D portable
measurement tools for the factory floor, the Company made a strategic decision
to target its core measurement technology to the manufacturing and industrial
markets. In order to focus on manufacturing and industrial applications of its
technology, the Company phased out the direct sale of its medical products and
entered into licensing agreements with two major neurosurgical companies for
its medical technology. In 1995, the Company made a strategic decision to
target international markets. The Company established sales offices in France
and Germany in 1996 and Great Britain in 1997. International sales represented
343% of sales in 1997 and 464% of sales in 1998, and 466% of sales in 1999.                    16   The Company derives revenues primarily from the sale of the FAROArmR, its
six-axis articulated measuring device, and its multi-faceted CAM2 software.
Revenue related to these products is recognized upon shipment.
Revenue growth has resulted from increased unit sales due to an expanded
sales effort that included the addition of sales personnel at existing offices,
the opening of new sales offices, expanded promotional efforts and the
acquisition of CATS. In September 1998 the Company announced the introduction
of a new product line consisting of two additional FAROArm models, and the
addition of 3 new software components to the CAM2 family, from the CATS
acquisition.
In addition to providing a one-year basic warranty without additional
charge, the Company offers its customers one, two and three-year extended
maintenance contracts, which include on-line help services, software upgrades
and hardware warranties. In addition, the Company sells training and technology
consulting services relating to its products. The Company recognizes the
revenue from extended maintenance contracts proportionately as costs are
projected to be incurred.
Cost of sales consists primarily of material, production overhead and
labor. Selling expenses consist primarily of salaries and commissions to sales
and marketing personnel, and promotion, advertising, travel and
telecommunications. General and administrative expenses consist primarily of
salaries for administrative personnel, rent, utilities and professional and
legal expenses. Research and development expenses represent salaries, equipment
and third-party services.
Accounting for wholly owned foreign subsidiaries is maintained in the
currency of the respective foreign jurisdiction and, therefore, fluctuations in
exchange rates may have an impact on intercompany accounts reflected in the
Company consolidated financial statements. Although the Company has not
historically engaged in any hedging transactions to limit risks of currency
fluctuations, it intends to do so in the future.                    17 RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

1999 COMPARED TO 1998
SALES. Sales increased $56 million, or 204%, from $275 million in 1998
to $331 million in 1999. The increase resulted from increases in the U.S.
$30 million, or 204%, from $147 million to $177 million, the three
European countries with a direct Company presence $21 million, or 247%, from
$85 million to $106 million and the remainder of the world an increase of
$05 million, or 116%, from $43 million to $48 million.
GROSS PROFIT. Gross profit increased by $27 million, or 167%, from $162
million in 1998 to $189 million in 1999. The increase resulted from the
increase in sales, partially offset by unusual charges of $06 million related
to excess and obsolete inventory $05 million and warranties $01 million.
Excluding the unusual charges, gross profit was $195 million, or 589%, the
same gross margin percentage as 1998.
SELLING EXPENSES. Selling expenses increased $21 million, or 210%, from
$100 million in 1998 to $121 million in 1999. The increase primarily resulted
from selling expenses in Germany, which increased by $14 million, with a full
year of expenses in 1999                    18 from the German acquisition, compared to seven and a half months in 1998, and
an increase in the number of sales and marketing employees in Europe. Selling
expenses also increased by $04 million, resulting from an unusual write-down
of demonstration inventory, which was identified during a thorough worldwide
physical inventory. U.S. salaries, commissions, advertising and trade shows
also increased and were partially offset by lower spending on other promotions.
GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES. General and administrative expenses
increased by $18 million, or 563%, from $32 million in 1998 to $50 million
in 1999. The increase primarily resulted from general and administrative
expenses in Germany, which increased by $11 million, with a full year of
expenses in 1999 compared to seven and a half months in 1998. General and
administrative expenses also increased due to higher salaries, outside
services, and professional and legal expenses, and unusual third quarter
charges $02 million, primarily for write-offs of doubtful accounts and
residual costs related to the German acquisition, partially offset by lower
bonuses and a $01 million unusual credit.
DEPRECIATION AND AMORTIZATION EXPENSES. Depreciation and amortization
expenses increased by $17 million, or 607%, from $28 million in 1998 to $45
million in 1999. The increase primarily resulted from $10 million of unusual
expenses $07 million of amortization of software development costs, $02
million of depreciation of property and equipment and $01 million of
amortization of patents with no remaining economic value. These unusual
expenses resulted from a review of the Company assets, which determined that
certain patents and capitalized research and development costs should be
written off due to changes in technology. Additionally, a full year of
amortization of the intangible assets resulting from the German acquisition
increased amortization expense in 1999 by $03 million.
RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT EXPENSES. Research and development expenses
increased by $12 million, or 462%, from $26 million in 1998 to $38 million
in 1999. The increase primarily resulted from an increase in the number of U.S.
research and development employees $06 million, a full year of research and
development expenses in Germany in 1999, compared to seven and a half months of
expenses in 1998 $04 million, and an unusual charge $02 million to
write-off capitalized research and development costs for products no longer
sold by the Company.
EMPLOYEE STOCK OPTION EXPENSES. Employee stock option expenses decreased
by $3,000, or 17%, from $172,000 in 1998 to $169,000 in 1999. This decrease
was a result of a reduction in the amortized deferred compensation expense
related to stock options issued in 1995 and 1997. For all options issued in
1999, no compensation expense was recorded, as the exercise price of the
options was equal to the market price on the day of the grant.
IMPAIRMENT LOSS ON ACQUIRED INTANGIBLE ASSETS. An unusual impairment loss
of $31 million was recorded in 1999 to reflect an impairment of the intangible
assets resulting from the German acquisition on May 15, 1998. The impairment
resulted from the Company revised forecast of the cash flows expected from
the developed and core software                    19 technology acquired with the German acquisition. Amortization expenses in 2000
will drop by approximately $850,000 at present exchange rates as a result of
the impairment loss.
OTHER INCOME. Other income increased by $04 million, or 4000%, from $01
million in 1998 to $05 million in 1999. The increase resulted principally from
an increase in royalty income from an increase in licensing fees for the
Company medical technologies in 1999.
INTEREST INCOME. Interest income decreased by $04 million, or 364 from $11 million in 1998 to $07 million in 1999. The decrease primarily
resulted from a reduction in the Company cash invested after the acquisition
of the German company, which reduced the Company cash invested for twelve
months in 1999, but only seven and a half months in 1998. In addition, more
cash was invested in lower-yielding tax exempt municipal bonds during 1999.
INCOME TAX BENEFIT EXPENSE. Income tax benefit increased by $16
million, from a $05 million expense in 1998 to a $11 million benefit in 1999.
The benefit resulted from the Company U.S. operation taxable loss. The
deferred tax benefit on the Company foreign loss, including the impairment
loss, was offset by a $31 million valuation allowance.
NET LOSS. The Company net loss increased by $25 million, or 510%, from
$49 million in 1998 to $74 million in 1999. The increase resulted primarily
from the unusual impairment loss on acquired intangible assets $31 million,
with no offsetting tax benefit on the intangible assets resulting from the
acquisition in Germany. Other unusual operating charges $23 million and
higher recurring general and administrative and research and development
expenses as a percentage of sales also contributed to the higher net loss,
partially offset by a $16 million increase in the income tax benefit. The net
loss includes $25 million of amortization of intangibles related to the German
acquisition, an increase of $03 million from 1998.
1998 COMPARED TO 1997
SALES. Sales increased $40 million, or 170%, from $235 million in 1997
to $275 million in 1998. The increase was a result of increases in sales in
Europe $54 million and Canada $06 million, offset by decreases in sales
in Asia $10 million and the United States $08 million.
GROSS PROFIT. Gross profit increased $23 million, or 167%, from $139
million in 1997 to $162 million in 1998. This increase was a result of a
proportional increase in sales in 1998, at a gross margin of 590%, virtually
unchanged from 591% in 1997.
SELLING EXPENSES. Selling expenses increased $43 million, or 755%, from
$57 million in 1997 to $100 million in 1998. This increase was primarily the
result of a 100% increase in the number of sales and marketing staff, and their
resulting sales activities. The number of sales and marketing employees grew
from 34 at December 31, 1997 to 68 at December 31, 1998. The cost per sales
employee was higher in 1998 in part as a result of the greater proportion
primarily as a result of the CATS acquisition of European employees and the
higher cost of payroll benefits and travel costs in Europe.                    20   GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES. General and administrative expenses
increased $17 million, or 1133% from $15 million in 1997, to $32 million in
1998. This increase resulted primarily from the increased number of
administrative personnel both at the Company headquarters and from the
acquisition of CATS.
DEPRECIATION AND AMORTIZATION EXPENSES. Depreciation and amortization
expenses increased $25 million or 8333%, from $03 million in 1997 to $28
million in 1998. This increase was primarily due to $22 million in
amortization expenses related to the intangible assets associated with the
Company acquisition of CATS.
RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT EXPENSES. Research and development expenses
increased $15 million, or 1364%, from $11 million in 1997 to $26 million in
1998. This increase was a result of an increase in the number of research and
development employees from 14 at December 31, 1997 to 43 at December 31, 1998.
EMPLOYEE STOCK OPTIONS. Employee stock option expenses decreased $02
million or 500%, from $04 million in 1997 to $02 million in 1998. This
decrease was a result of a reduction in the amortized deferred compensation
expense relating to stock options issued in 1995 and 1997. For all options
issued in 1998, no compensation expense was recorded, as the exercise price of
the options was equal to the market price at the day of the grant.
IN-PROCESS RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT RESULTING FROM ACQUISITION. On May 15,
1998 the Company acquired CATS for $5 million and 916,668 shares of the
Company Common Stock and the assumption of certain liabilities. The $32
million portion of the purchase price that was attributed to in-process
research and development and was expensed immediately.
INTEREST INCOME. Interest income increased $07 million or 1750%, from
$04 million in 1997 to $11 million in 1998. This increase was a result of a
full year of interest in 1998 on the remaining portion of the proceeds from the
Company initial public offering in September 1997, compared to approximately
three months of interest on the portion of these proceeds which were invested
in 1997.
INCOME TAX EXPENSE. Income tax expense decreased $16 million or 762%
from $21 million in 1997 to $05 million in 1998. The income tax provision in
1998 results primarily from the Company U.S operations being in a taxable
position, and the deferred tax benefit of the Company foreign loss being
offset by a $3 million valuation allowance.
NET INCOME LOSS. The Company net income loss for 1998 decreased $81
million, from net income of $32 million in 1997 to a net loss of $49 million
in 1998. This decrease was a result of a one-time in-process research and
development charge $32 million, amortization costs related to the CATS
acquisition $22 million, and higher sales, general and administrative, and
research and development expenses as a percentage of sales.                    21 LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES
In September 1997, the Company completed an initial public offering of
Common Stock that provided net proceeds of $317 million. Total marketable
securities cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments and investments
at December 31, 1999 were $169 million, compared to $182 million at December
31, 1998.
For the year ended December 31, 1999, net cash provided by operating
activities was $15 million compared to net cash used by operating activities
of $31 million in 1998. Net cash provided by operating activities in 1999,
increased primarily due to non-cash depreciation and amortization $45
million and the impairment loss $31 million and increases in accounts
payable and accrued liabilities $24 million, partially offset by the net
loss $74 million and increases in accounts receivable $10 million.
Net cash excluding short-term investments and investments provided by
investing activities primarily conversions of investments into cash and cash
equivalents, which yielded equivalent interest rates at year end for the year
ended December 31, 1999 was $53 million, compared to net cash used in
investing activities of $252 million in 1998. Net cash provided by investing
activities increased in 1999 primarily due to decreases in investments $68
million, partially offset by purchases of property and equipment $11
million and payments for intangible assets $03 million.
Net cash used in financing activities for the year ended December 31, 1999
was $03 million, compared to net cash provided by financing activities of $03
million in 1998. The Company invests excess cash balances in short-term
investment grade securities, such as money market investments, obligations of
the U.S. government and its agencies, and obligations of state and local
government agencies.
Exchange rate changes resulted in a $11 million impact on the Company
cash.
In April 1997, the Company obtained a one-year secured $10 million line
of credit that bears interest at the 30-day commercial paper rate plus 265%
per annum. The line of credit has been extended twice for additional one-year
terms. There were no outstanding borrowings under this loan agreement at
December 31, 1999.
The Company principal commitments at December 31, 1999 were leases on
its headquarters and regional offices. There were no material commitments for
capital expenditures at that date. The Company believes that its cash,
investments, cash flows from operations and funds available from its credit
facilities will be sufficient to satisfy its working capital and capital
expenditure needs at least through 2000.                    22 FOREIGN EXCHANGE EXPOSURE
Sales outside the United States represent a significant portion of the
Company total revenues. At present, the majority of the Company revenues
and expenses are invoiced and paid in U.S. dollars. In the future, the Company
expects a greater portion of its revenues to be denominated in foreign
currencies. Fluctuations in exchange rates between the U.S. dollar and such
foreign currencies may have a material adverse effect on the Company
business, results of operations and financial condition, particularly its
operating margins, and could also result in exchange losses. The impact of
future exchange rate fluctuations on the results of the Company operations
cannot be accurately predicted. Historically, the Company has not managed the
risks associated with fluctuations in exchange rates, but intends to undertake
transactions to manage such risks in the future. To the extent that the
percentage of the Company non-U.S. dollar revenues derived from international
sales increases in the future, the risks associated with fluctuations in
foreign exchange rates will increase. The Company at present is evaluating, and
may use foreign exchange contracts with foreign currency options to hedge these
risks.
INFLATION
The Company believes that inflation has not had a material impact on its
results of operations in recent years and does not expect inflation to have a
material impact on its operations in 2000.
YEAR 2000
During fiscal 1999, the Company completed its company-wide program to
prepare the Company computer systems for year 2000 compliance. The year 2000
issue relates to computer systems that use the last two digits rather than four
to define a year and whether such systems would properly and accurately process
information when the year changed to 2000.
At the date of this report, the Company had not experienced any material
problems related to the year 2000. The Company has not become aware of any
significant year 2000 issues affecting the Company major customers or
suppliers. The Company does not anticipate any material complaints regarding
any year 2000 issues related to its products.
Year 2000 related costs through December 31, 1999 were limited to
employees' time and were expensed as incurred. The remaining estimated cost to
address any additional year 2000 problems is deemed immaterial. No significant
information system projects were deferred to accommodate the year 2000 issues.                    23 ITEM 8. FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA.

24 INDEPENDENT AUDITORS' REPORT To the Board of Directors and Shareholders
of FARO Technologies, Inc.   We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of FARO
Technologies, Inc. and subsidiaries as of December 31, 1999 and 1998, and the
related consolidated statements of operations, shareholders' equity and cash
flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 1999. These
financial statements are the responsibility of the Company management. Our
responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on
our audits.
We conducted our audits in accordance with auditing standards generally
accepted in the United States of America. Those standards require that we plan
and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the
financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes
examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in
the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting
principles used and significant estimates made by management as well as
evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our
audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
In our opinion, such consolidated financial statements present fairly, in
all material respects, the financial position of FARO Technologies, Inc. and
subsidiaries as of December 31, 1999 and 1998, and the results of their
operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended
December 31, 1999, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted
in the United States of America. DELOITTE & TOUCHE LLP

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 1999, 1998 AND 1997
1. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS -- FARO Technologies, Inc. and subsidiaries
develops, manufactures, markets and supports Computer Aided Design CAD-based
quality assurance products and CAD-based inspection and statistical process
control software. The Company has three wholly-owned subsidiaries: FARO
Worldwide, Inc.; FARO Europe GmbH & Co. KG, a German company, and Antares LDA,
a Portuguese company.
PRINCIPLES OF CONSOLIDATION -- The consolidated financial statements
include the accounts of FARO Technologies, Inc. and all wholly-owned
subsidiaries collectively, the Company. All significant intercompany
transactions and balances have been eliminated. The financial statements of the
foreign subsidiaries are translated into U.S. dollars using exchange rates in
effect at period end for assets and liabilities and average exchange rates
during each reporting period for results of operations. Adjustments resulting
from translation of financial statements are reflected as a separate component
of comprehensive loss income.
REVENUE RECOGNITION, PRODUCT WARRANTY AND EXTENDED MAINTENANCE CONTRACTS
- -- Revenue related to the Company 3-D measurement equipment and related
software is recognized upon shipment as the Company considers the earnings
process substantially complete as of the shipping date. Revenue from sales of
software only is recognized when no further significant production,
modification or customization of the software is required and where the
following criteria are met: persuasive evidence of a sales agreement exists,
delivery has occurred, and the sales price is fixed or determinable and
collectible. Revenues resulting from sales of comprehensive support, training
and technology consulting services are recognized as such services are
performed. Extended maintenance plan revenues are recognized proportionately as
maintenance costs are projected to be incurred. Prior to November 1, 1997, such
revenues were recognized ratably over the contract term. The change in estimate
with respect to the recognition of such revenues more accurately matches
revenues with costs incurred. The Company warrants its products against defects
in design, materials and workmanship for one year. A provision for estimated
future costs relating to warranty expenses is recorded when products are
shipped. Costs relating to extended maintenance plans are recognized as
incurred.
CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS -- The Company considers cash on hand and
amounts on deposit with financial institutions which have original maturities
of three months or less to be cash and cash equivalents.
30          FARO TECHNOLOGIES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS--CONTINUED
1. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES--CONTINUED
All short-term investments in debt securities which have maturities of
three months or less are included in cash and cash equivalents and classified
as trading securities, which are carried at their fair value based upon the
quoted market prices of those investments at December 31, 1999 and 1998.
Accordingly, net realized and unrealized gains and losses on trading securities
are included in other income in the consolidated statements of operations.
Total trading securities included in cash and cash equivalents were $4,694,451
and $145,437 at December 31, 1999 and 1998, respectively. The gross unrealized
gain or loss on all trading securities was an unrealized loss of approximately
$18,000 at December 31, 1999, and an unrealized gain of approximately $3,000 at
December 31, 1998.
INVESTMENTS -- Short-term investments ordinarily consist of short-term
debt securities acquired with cash not immediately needed in operations. Such
amounts have maturities of less than one year. Investments ordinarily consist
of debt securities acquired with cash not immediately needed in operations.
Such amounts have maturities of at least one year none have maturities
exceeding eighteen months.
Management determines the appropriate classification of its short term
investments and investments in debt securities at the time of the purchase and
reevaluates such determinations at each balance sheet date. All investments in
debt securities are classified as held to maturity as the company has the
positive intent and ability to hold the securities to maturity. Held to
maturity securities are stated at amortized cost. The amortized cost of debt
securities is adjusted for amortization of premiums and accretion of discounts
to maturity. Such amortization and interest are included in other income in the
consolidated statements of operations. The Company investments in debt
securities are diversified among high credit quality securities in accordance
with the Company investment policy. The gross unrealized gain or loss on all
held to maturity debt securities was an unrealized loss of approximately
$83,000 at December 31, 1999, and unrealized loss of approximately $40,000 at
December 31, 1998.
INVENTORIES -- Inventories are stated at the lower of average cost or net
realizable value. In order to achieve a better matching of production costs
with the revenues generated in production, certain fixed overhead costs and
certain general and administrative costs that are related to production are
capitalized into inventory when they are incurred and are charged to cost of
sales as product costs at the time of sale. Such amounts are not material to
the consolidated financial statements.
Sales demonstration inventory is comprised of measuring devices utilized
by sales representatives to present the Company products to customers. These
products remain in sales demonstration inventory for six to twelve months and
are subsequently sold at prices that produce slightly reduced gross margins.
31          FARO TECHNOLOGIES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS--CONTINUED
1. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES--CONTINUED
PROPERTY AND EQUIPMENT -- Property and equipment are recorded at cost.
Depreciation is computed using the straight-line and declining-balance methods
over the estimated useful lives of the various classes of assets as follows     Machinery and equipment..  2 to 10 years
Furniture and fixtures..  5 to 10 years
Leasehold improvements are amortized on the straight-line basis over the
lesser of the life of the asset or the term of the lease.
INTANGIBLES -- Goodwill represents the excess of purchase price over the
fair value of businesses acquired and is amortized on a straight-line basis
over 5 years.
Other acquired intangibles principally include core technology, existing
product technology, workforce in place and customer relationships that arose in
connection with the acquisition of CATS. Other acquired intangibles are
recorded at fair value at the date of acquisition and are amortized over their
estimated useful lives of primarily 3 to 5 years.
Product design costs incurred in the development of products after
technological feasibility is attained are capitalized and amortized using the
straight-line method over the estimated economic lives of the related products,
not to exceed 3 years. The Company considers technological feasibility to be
established when the Company has completed all planning, designing, coding and
testing activities that are necessary to establish design specifications
including function, features and technical performance requirements.
Capitalization of product design costs ceases and amortization of such costs
begins when the product is available for general release to customers.
Patents are recorded at cost. Amortization is computed using the
straight-line method over the lives of the patents, which is 17 years.
Other intangibles are amortized over periods ranging from 3 to 5 years.
RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT -- Research and development costs incurred in the
discovery of new knowledge and the resulting translation of this new knowledge
into plans and designs for new products, prior to the attainment of the related
products' technological feasibility, are recorded as expenses in the period
incurred.
INCOME TAXES -- The Company utilizes the asset and liability method to
measure and record deferred income tax assets and liabilities. Deferred tax
assets and liabilities reflect the future income tax effects of temporary
differences between the consolidated financial statement carrying amounts of
existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases
32          FARO TECHNOLOGIES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS--CONTINUED
1. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES--CONTINUED
and are measured using enacted tax rates that apply to taxable income in the
years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or
settled. Deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance when, in the
opinion of management, it is more likely than not that some portion or all of
the deferred tax assets will not be realized.
FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS -- The Company financial instruments
include cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments, accounts receivable,
investments, accounts payable and liabilities to banks. The carrying amount of
long-term debt to banks approximates fair value based on interest rates that
are currently available to the Company for issuance of debt with similar terms
and remaining maturities. The carrying amounts of other financial instruments
approximate their fair value because of their short-term maturities.
EARNINGS PER SHARE -- Basic earnings per share EPS is computed by
dividing earnings available to common shareholders by the weighted-average
number of common shares outstanding for the period. Diluted EPS reflects the
potential dilution of securities that could share in the earnings. A
reconciliation of the number of common shares used in calculation of basic and
diluted EPS is presented in Note 12.
CONCENTRATION OF CREDIT RISK -- Financial instruments which potentially
expose the Company to concentrations of credit risk consist principally of
operating demand deposit accounts. The Company policy is to place its
operating demand deposit accounts with high credit quality financial
institutions.
In June 1996, the Company entered into an Original Equipment Manufacturer
OEM agreement with Mitutoyo Corporation Mitutoyo, a Japanese company
which manufactures and markets metrology tools. Under the agreement, Mitutoyo
sells the Company products under the name SPINARM. The agreement, which
grants Mitutoyo a nonexclusive right to sales in Japan, originally expired in
June 1999 and was renewed for a successive one-year term in 1999.
In March 1999, the Company entered into an OEM agreement with Brown &
Sharpe Manufacturing Company Brown & Sharpe, a North Kingstown, Rhode
Island company that is a world leader in the manufacture of traditional CMMs
and other metrology products. Brown & Sharpe will market the FAROArm/registered
trademark/ worldwide under the name GAGE 2000 A. The agreement, which grants
Brown & Sharpe non-exclusive distribution right worldwide, expires in March
2001, and is renewable for successive one-year terms.
No customer represented 6% or more of the Company total sales for the
years ended December 31, 1999 and 1998.
33          FARO TECHNOLOGIES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS--CONTINUED
1. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES--CONTINUED
STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION -- In accordance with Statement of Financial
Accounting Standards SFAS No. 123, Accounting for Stock-Based
Compensation, SFAS No. 123, the Company has elected to continue to account
for its employee stock compensation plans under Accounting Principle Board
APB Opinion No. 25 with pro forma disclosures of net earnings and earnings
per share, as if the fair value based method of accounting defined in SFAS No.
123 has been applied. Under the intrinsic value based method, compensation cost
is the excess, if any, of the quoted market price of the stock at the grant
date or other measurement date over the amount an employee must pay to acquire
the stock. Under the fair value based method, compensation cost is measured at
the grant date based on the value of the award and is recognized over the
service period, which is usually the vesting period.
LONG-LIVED ASSETS -- Long-lived assets, including property and equipment
and certain intangible assets to be held and used by the Company are reviewed
for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the
carrying value of the assets may not be recoverable. Impairment losses are
recognized if expected future cash flows of the related assets are less than
their carrying values. Measurement of an impairment loss is based on the fair
value of the asset. Long-lived assets and certain identifiable intangibles to
be disposed of are reported at the lower of carrying amount or fair value less
cost to sell. See Note 2 regarding the impairment of certain developed and core
technology.
ESTIMATES -- The preparation of financial statements in conformity with
generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates
and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and
disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial
statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the
reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.
RECENTLY ADOPTED ACCOUNTING STANDARDS -- In June 1997, the Financial
Accounting Standards Board FASB issued SFAS No. 130, Reporting
Comprehensive Income SFAS No. 130, effective for fiscal years beginning
after December 15, 1997. SFAS No. 130 requires that all items that are required
to be recognized under accounting standards as components of comprehensive
income be reported in a financial statement that is displayed with the same
prominence as other financial statements. SFAS No. 130 does not require a
specific format for that financial statement but requires that an entity
display an amount representing total comprehensive income for the period in
that statement. SFAS No. 130 requires that an entity classify items of other
comprehensive income by their nature in a financial statement. For example,
other comprehensive loss income may include foreign currency and unrealized
gains and losses on certain investments in debt and equity securities. In
addition, the accumulated balance of other comprehensive income must be
34          FARO TECHNOLOGIES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS--CONTINUED
1. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES--CONTINUED
displayed separately from retained earnings and additional paid in capital in
the equity section of a statement of financial position. The Company adopted
this accounting standard on January 1, 1998, as required. Prior year financial
statements have been restated for comparative purposes.
In June 1997, the FASB issued SFAS No. 131, Disclosure About Segments of
an Enterprise and Related Information SFAS No. 131, effective for fiscal
years beginning after December 15, 1997. SFAS No. 131 establishes standards for
reporting information about operating segments in annual financial statements
and requires selected information about operating segments in interim financial
reports to shareholders. It also establishes standards for related disclosures
about products and services, geographic areas and major customers. Operating
segments are defined as components of an enterprise about which separate
financial information is available that is evaluated regularly by the chief
operating decision maker in deciding how to allocate resources and in assessing
performance. SFAS No. 131 requires reporting segment profit or loss, certain
specific revenue and expense items and segment assets. It also requires
reconciliations of total segment revenues, total segments profit or loss, total
segment assets, and other amounts disclosed for segments to corresponding
amounts reported in the financial statements.
In October 1997 the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants
issued Statement of Position 97-2, Software Revenue Recognition SOP 97-2.
SOP 97-2 provides guidance on applying generally accepted accounting principles
in recognizing revenue on software transactions and is effective for
transactions entered into in fiscal years beginning after December 15, 1997.
The Company adopted SOP 97-2 on January 1, 1998, as required. Adoption of this
SOP 97-2 did not have a material effect on the financial statements.
NEW ACCOUNTING STANDARDS -- The FASB recently issued SFAS No. 137,
Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities-Deferral of
Effective Date of FASB Statement No. 133 SFAS No. 137. SFAS No. 137 defers
for one year the effective date of SFAS No. 133, Accounting for Derivative
Instruments and Hedging Activities SFAS No. 133. The rule now will apply
to all fiscal quarters of all fiscal years beginning after June 15, 2000. SFAS
No. 137 permits early adoption as of the beginning of any fiscal quarter after
its issuance. SFAS No. 133 will require the Company to recognize all
derivatives on the balance sheet at fair value. Derivatives that are not hedges
must be adjusted to fair value through income. If the derivative is a hedge,
depending on the nature of the hedge, changes in the fair value of derivatives
will either be offset against the change in fair value of the hedged assets,
liabilities, or firm commitments through earnings or recognized in other
comprehensive income until the hedged item is recognized in earnings.

1. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES--CONTINUED
The ineffective portion of a derivative change in fair value will be
immediately recognized in earnings. The Company has not completed its
evaluation of the impact of SFAS No. 133 on the financial statements.
RECLASSIFICATIONS -- Certain prior year amounts have been reclassified to
conform to current year presentation.
2. ACQUISITION OF CATS
On May 15, 1998, the Company acquired CATS GmbH CATS for total
consideration of $16,069,000 consisting of $5 million in cash, 916,668 shares
of Common Stock and the assumption of certain outstanding liabilities of CATS.
The purchase price includes direct costs of the acquisition in the amount of
$674,000.
In addition, 333,332 shares of Common Stock were placed in escrow to be
issued provided CATS met certain sales performance goals within an
eighteen-month period following the acquisition. These sales goals were not met
by November 15, 1999. The 90-day period for registering disputes expired on
February 13, 2000 with no claims. The 333,332 shares held by the escrow agent
are being returned to the Company.
The acquisition agreement provided that the Company would provide a loan
to the two former shareholders of CATS to fund their tax liability in
connection with the shares of FARO Common Stock that they received in the
acquisition. The former CATS shareholders remain key employees of the Company.
Pursuant to a Loan Agreement dated August 2, 1999 with each of the former CATS
shareholders, the Company has agreed to loan to the former CATS shareholders an
amount equal to their tax obligation to the German tax authorities in
connection with the acquisition of CATS. The aggregate amount of the loans is
estimated to be approximately $2 million. The Company is not obligated to
provide the loans until the German tax authorities request payment for the tax
from the former CATS shareholders, which has not yet occurred. Moreover, the
loan commitment will cease if the Company share price rises to $1134 per
share the price establishing the tax liability for several consecutive days.
If the loans are made, they will be for a term of three years, at an interest
rate of approximately 43%, with an option for the borrower to extend the term
for an additional three years. As collateral for the loans, the former CATS
shareholders will pledge to the Company the number of shares of Company Common
Stock equal to the amount of the loan divided by 6375. If the amount of the
loans is $2 million, the loans will be secured by 313,725 shares. The loans
will be a non-recourse obligation of the former CATS shareholders.

2. ACQUISITION OF CATS--CONTINUED
The acquisition was recorded under the purchase method of accounting and
the final allocation among tangible and intangible assets and liabilities is as
follows   Tangible assets including cash of $5,618..  $ 1,522,000
Intangible assets:
Developed and core technology..   8,940,000
Workforce in place     550,000
Customer relations     590,000
Goodwill    2,871,000
In-process technology..   3,210,000
Liabilities assumed   1,614,000
$16,069,000
The valuation of CATS was based on management estimates of after tax net
cash flows and gives explicit consideration to the Security and Exchange
Commission SEC recent views on in-process research and development in
purchase transactions. In making the allocation of purchase price, the Company
considered the present value of cash flows and income, the status of projects,
completion costs and project risk. Specifically, the Company considered 1 the
value of core technology and ensured that the relative allocations to core
technology and in-process technology were consistent with the relative
contributions of each of the final products and 2 the stage of completion of
the individual projects and ensured that the value considered only the efforts
completed as of the transaction date.
The amount allocated to in-process research and development of $32
million was expensed upon acquisition, as it was determined that the underlying
projects had not reached technological feasibility, had no alternative future
use and successful future development was uncertain.
In the fourth quarter of 1999, the Company recorded a write-down of
developed and core technology of approximately $3,073,000 in the Consolidated
Statement of Operations. This write-down was in accordance with SFAS No. 121,
Accounting for Impairment of Long-Lived Assets SFAS No. 121. Developed
and core technology was determined to have been impaired because the
anticipated future cash flows resulting from the software products acquired
from CATS GmbH indicate that the recoverability of a portion of the developed
and core technology is not reasonably assured. The estimated fair value of the
developed and core technology was determined by calculating the present value
of the estimated future cash flows.

In April 1997, the Company obtained a one-year unsecured $10 million line
of credit which bears interest at the 30-day commercial paper rate plus 265%
per annum. The line of credit was extended in 1998 and 1999 and expires on

December 31, 1999 and 1998.
A subsidiary has a standby line of credit for $20,000 with a German bank
to secure the remaining lease obligation on the former German headquarters. A
3% fee is charged annually on the amount of the line of credit.
In December 1998, the Company had available with two financial
institutions short-term revolving lines of credit aggregating $445,000. Under
these lines, a subsidiary could borrow funds for operations. These lines of
credit were personally guaranteed by certain shareholders. The total amount
outstanding on these lines at December 31, 1998 was approximately $296,000. The
average interest rates in such borrowings at December 31, 1998 was 9%. The

various proceedings, lawsuits and other claims. Such matters are subject to
many uncertainties, and outcomes are not predictable with assurance. While
these uncertainties could affect future operations, the Company believes that
after final disposition, any monetary liability or financial impact would not
be expected to have a materially adverse effect on the Company Consolidated
Financial Statements.
11. STOCK OPTION PLANS
The Company has three stock option plans that provide for the granting of
stock options to key employees and non-employee members of the Board of
Directors. The 1993 Stock Option Plan 1993 Plan and the Amended and
Restated 1997 Employee Stock Option Plan 1997 Plan provide for granting
incentive stock options and nonqualified stock options to officers and key
employees of the Company. The Non-Employee Director Plan provides for granting
nonqualified stock options and formula options to non-employee directors.
43          FARO TECHNOLOGIES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS--CONTINUED 11. STOCK OPTION PLANS--CONTINUED
The Company is authorized to grant options for up to 1,000,000 shares of
Common Stock under the 1993 Plan, of which 295,997 and 133,218 options have
been granted at exercise prices of $036 and $360, respectively. These options
vest over primarily 3 and 4 year periods.
The Company is authorized to grant options for up to 1,400,000 shares of
Common Stock under the 1997 Plan, of which 857,594 options have been granted at
exercise prices between $331 and $1430 for those meant to qualify for
treatment as incentive stock options. These options vest over a three-year
period. Subsequent to December 31, 1999, an additional 218,550 options were
granted.
The Company is authorized to grant up to 250,000 shares of Common Stock
under the Non-Employee Director Plan. Each non-employee director is granted
3,000 options upon election or reelection to the Board of Directors formula
options. Formula options granted to directors are generally granted upon the
same terms and conditions as options granted to officers and employees. These
options vest over a three-year period. Additionally in 1997, certain
non-employee directors were granted options to purchase 160,000 of Common Stock
in consideration for their prior service on the Board of Directors. These
options vested upon grant at an exercise price of $12.
Additionally, the Company 1997 Non-Employee Directors' Fee Plan permits
non-employee directors to elect to receive directors' fees in the form of
Common Stock rather than cash. Common Stock issued in lieu of cash directors'
fees is issued at the end of the quarter in which the fees are earned, with the
number of shares being based on the fair market value of the Common Stock for
the five trading days immediately preceding the last business day of the
quarter.
Compensation cost charged to operations associated with the Company
stock option plans was $168,912, $172,164 and $408,000 in 1999, 1998 and 1997,
respectively. Compensation cost was based on the difference between the value
of the stock, at date of grant, and its exercise price multiplied by the number
of shares vested in each year.
