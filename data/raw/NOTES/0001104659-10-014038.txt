of Contents AMERICAN STATES WATER COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Note 1 
Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Nature
of Operations:
American States Water Company AWR is the parent company of Golden State
Water Company GSWC, Chaparral City Water Company CCWC and American
States Utility Services,Inc. ASUS and its subsidiaries, Fort Bliss
Water Services Company FBWS, Terrapin Utility Services,Inc. TUS,
Old Dominion Utility Services,Inc. ODUS, Palmetto State Utility
Services,Inc. PSUS and Old North Utility Services,Inc. ONUS. AWR and its subsidiaries may be collectively
referred to herein as Registrant or
the Company. The subsidiaries of
ASUS may be collectively referred to herein as the Military Utility
Privatization Subsidiaries. GSWC
is a public utility engaged principally in the purchase, production,
distribution and sale of water in California serving approximately 255,000
water customers. GSWC also distributes electricity in several San Bernardino
Mountain communities serving approximately 23,000 electric customers. The
California Public Utilities Commission CPUC regulates GSWCs water and
electric business, including properties, rates, services, facilities and other
matters. CCWC is a public utility regulated by the Arizona Corporation
Commission ACC serving over 13,000 customers in the town of Fountain Hills,
Arizona and a portion of the City of Scottsdale, Arizona. ASUS performs water
and wastewater services and operations on a contract basis. Through its
wholly-owned subsidiaries, ASUS has entered into agreements with the U.S.
government to operate and maintain the water and/or wastewater systems at
various military bases pursuant to 50-year fixed price contracts, which are
subject to periodic price redeterminations and modifications for changes in
circumstances, changes in laws and regulations and changes in wages and fringe
benefits to the extent provided in each of the contracts. There is no direct
regulatory oversight by either the CPUC or the ACC of AWR or the operation or
rates of the contracted services provided by ASUS or any of its wholly owned
subsidiaries. AWRs assets, revenues and
operations are primarily those of GSWC. Basis
of Presentation: The consolidated financial statements and
notes thereto are being presented in a combined report being filed by two
separate Registrants: AWR and GSWC. References in this report to Registrant
are to AWR and GSWC, collectively, unless otherwise specified. The
consolidated financial statements of AWR include the accounts of AWR and its
wholly-owned subsidiaries and are prepared in conformity with accounting
principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Inter-company
transactions and balances have been eliminated in the AWR consolidated
financial statements. Investments in
partially-owned affiliates are accounted for by the equity method when
Registrants ownership interest exceeds 20%. The preparation of these
financial statements required the use of certain estimates by management in
determining Registrants assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses. Actual
results could differ from those estimates. Related
Party Transactions: AWRs subsidiaries provide and receive
various services to and from their parent, AWR, and among themselves. In addition, AWR has a $115 million
syndicated credit facility. AWR borrows under this facility and provides funds
to its subsidiaries, including GSWC, in support of its operations. Amounts owed
to AWR for borrowings under this facility represent the majority of GSWCs
inter-company payables on GSWCs balance sheets as of December31, 2009
and 2008. The interest rate charged to GSWC is sufficient to cover AWRs
interest cost under the credit facility. GSWC also allocates certain corporate
office administrative and general costs to its affiliates using agreed
allocation factors. AWR owns all of the outstanding common stock of GSWC, CCWC
and ASUS. ASUS owns all of the
outstanding common stock of the Military Utility Privatization Subsidiaries. Utility
Accounting: Registrants accounting policies conform to
accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America,
including the accounting principles for rate-regulated enterprises, which
reflect the ratemaking policies of the CPUC, ACC and the Federal Energy
Regulatory Commission FERC. The utility subsidiaries, GSWC and CCWC, have
incurred various costs and received various credits reflected as regulatory
assets and liabilities. Accounting for such costs and credits as regulatory
assets and liabilities is in accordance with the guidance for accounting for
the effects of certain types of regulation.
This guidance sets forth the application of accounting principles
generally accepted in the United States of America for those companies whose
rates are established by or are subject to approval by an independent
third-party regulator. Under
such accounting guidance, rate regulated entities defer costs and credits on
the balance sheet as regulatory assets and liabilities when it is probable that
those costs and credits will be recognized in the ratemaking process in a
period different from the period in which they would have been reflected in
income by an unregulated company. These deferred regulatory assets and
liabilities are then reflected in the income statement in the period in which
the same amounts are 89 Table
of Contents reflected in the rates
charged for service. The amounts included as regulatory assets and liabilities
that will be collected over a period exceeding one year are classified as
long-term assets and liabilities as of December31, 2009 and 2008. Property and
Depreciation: GSWC and CCWC
capitalize, as utility plant, the cost of additions, betterments and
replacements of retired units. Such cost includes labor, material and certain
indirect charges. Water systems acquired are recorded at estimated original
cost of utility plant when first devoted to utility service and the applicable
accumulated depreciation is recorded to accumulated depreciation. The
difference between the estimated original cost, less accumulated depreciation,
and the purchase price, if recognized by the regulator, is recorded as an
acquisition adjustment within utility plant. At December31, 2009, utility
plant includes a net credit acquisition adjustment of $88 million for GSWC,
which is generally being amortized over approximately 30 years as permitted by
the CPUC. Amortization of the acquisition adjustments totaled $374,000 for each
of the three years ended December31, 2009. Depreciation is computed on the straight-line,
remaining-life basis, based on depreciable plant as of the beginning of each
year in accordance with Registrants ratemaking process. The aggregate
provisions for depreciation for GSWC approximated 34% for its water
distribution unit, and approximately 37% for its electric unit for the years
2009, 2008 and 2007. The aggregate provision for depreciation for CCWC was
approximately 38% for 2009, 2008 and 2007. Expenditures for maintenance and
repairs are expensed as incurred. Replaced or retired property costs are
charged to the accumulated provision for depreciation. Property owned and depreciation recorded by
ASUS and its subsidiaries are not material to Registrants financial
statements. Estimated
useful lives of Registrants utility plant, as authorized by the CPUC, are as
follows

Impairment of Long-Lived Assets: Long-lived
assets are reviewed for impairment annually or whenever events or changes in
circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be fully
recoverable in accordance with accounting guidance for impairment or disposal
of long-lived assets. Registrant would
recognize an impairment loss only if the carrying value amount of a long-lived
asset is not recoverable from customer rates authorized by the CPUC and
ACC. Impairment loss is measured as the
excess of the carrying value over the amounts recovered in customer rates. During the year ended December31, 2007,
an impairment loss of approximately $53,000 was recorded in Other Operating
Expenses as a result of the disallowance of certain capital costs by the CPUC
and ACC. For the years ended December31, 2009 and 2008, no write-downs
were required. Goodwill: At December31, 2009, Registrant had
approximately $44 million of goodwill included in Other Property and Investments. Approximately $33 million of the goodwill
arose during Registrants acquisition of CCWC in October2000 and
represents the remaining difference between the aggregate purchase price and
the fair value of CCWCs net assets acquired.
CCWCs goodwill is reduced on an ongoing basis to reflect the total tax
benefit realized from amortizing, for tax purposes, the excess of tax over book
goodwill basis in accordance with guidance on accounting for income taxes. The remaining $11 million of the goodwill
arose from ASUS 2008 acquisition of a subcontractors business more fully
discussed in Note 19. In accordance with the accounting
guidance for goodwill and other intangibles, goodwill is tested for impairment
at least annually on December31 and more frequently if circumstances
indicate that it may be impaired. Goodwill impairment testing is performed at
the operating segment or reporting unit level. The goodwill impairment
model is a two-step process. First, it requires a comparison of the book
value of net assets to the fair value of the related operations that have
goodwill assigned to them.
Registrant uses the terminal multiple valuation method in estimating
fair value which assumes a business will be sold at the end of the projection
period at a specific terminal multiple.
Earnings and discounted cash flows were developed from Registrants
internal forecasts. Additionally,
management must make an estimate of a weighted average cost of capital to be
used as a discount rate, which takes into account certain risk and size
premiums, long-term bond yields, and the capital structure of the industry.
Changes in these projections or estimates could result in a reporting unit
either passing or failing the first step in the impairment model, which could
significantly change the amount of any impairment ultimately recorded. Registrant also
considers other qualitative and quantitative factors, including terminal
multiples used in the water industry, the regulatory environment in which the
reporting unit operates that can significantly impact future earnings and 90 Table
of Contents cash flows, and the effects of the volatile
current economic environment. If the fair value is determined to be less than
book value, a second step is performed to compute the amount of the
impairment. In this process, a fair value for goodwill is estimated,
based in part on the fair value of the applicable reporting units assets and
liabilities used in the first step, and are compared to its carrying value. The
fair values for the majority of such assets and liabilities are equal to their
carrying values; however, the fair values of the applicable debt are highly
dependent upon market conditions surrounding the measurement date. The amount by which carrying value exceeds
fair value represents the amount of goodwill impairment. During the fourth
quarter ended December31, 2008, based on a combination of factors,
including the recent economic downturn, as well as the current regulatory
environment in Arizona resulting in regulatory lags and lower than anticipated
rate increases, Registrant determined that its goodwill for CCWC was impaired
and recorded a charge of $77 million.
The current impairment analysis performed for 2009 did not indicate
impairment had occurred for the current amount of $33 million in goodwill for
CCWC or the $11 million in goodwill for ASUS.
The changes in the carrying amount of goodwill, as allocated between the
reporting units, for the years ended December31, 2009 and 2008 are
summarized as follows

Cash
and Cash Equivalents:
Cash and cash equivalents include short-term cash investments with an original
maturity of three months or less. At times, cash and cash equivalent balances
may be in excess of federally insured limits. The Companys cash and cash
equivalents are held with financial institutions with high credit standings. Accounts
Receivable: Accounts receivable is reported on the
balance sheet net of any allowance for doubtful accounts. The allowance for
doubtful accounts is Registrants best estimate of the amount of probable
credit losses in Registrants existing accounts receivable from its water and
electric customers, and is determined based on historical write-off experience
and the aging of account balances. Registrant reviews the allowance for doubtful
accounts quarterly. Account balances are written off against the allowance when
it is probable the receivable will not be recovered. When utility customers
request extended payment terms, credit is extended based on regulatory
guidelines, and collateral is not required. Other accounts receivable consist
of amounts due from third parties non-customers for various reasons including
amounts due from contractors, amounts due under settlement agreements, and
amounts due from the U.S. government pursuant to awarded contracts to operate
and maintain, and provide construction services for the water and/or wastewater
systems at military bases. The allowance for these other accounts receivable is
based on Registrants evaluation of the receivable portfolio under current
conditions and a review of specific problems and such other factors that, in
Registrants judgment, should be
considered in estimating losses.
Allowances for doubtful accounts are more fully disclosed in Note 17. Materials and Supplies: Materials and supplies are stated at the lower of cost or
market. Cost is computed using average cost. Interest: Interest incurred during the
construction of capital assets is generally not capitalized for financial
reporting purposes as such policy is not followed in Registrants ratemaking
process. Interest expense is generally recovered through the regulatory
process. Water
and Electric Operating Revenues: GSWC and CCWC record water and electric utility
operating revenues when the service is provided to customers. Revenues include
amounts billed to customers on a cycle basis based on meter reading for
services provided and unbilled revenues representing estimated amounts to be
billed for usage from the last meter reading date to the end of the accounting period.
The unbilled revenues are based on customer billings subsequent to year end
which are used to compile the actual unbilled consumption as of the year end
reporting period. Flat-rate customers
are billed in advance at the beginning of the service period and are reported
as deferred revenues. Revenue from flat-rate customers is deferred and
adjustments are calculated to determine the revenue related to the applicable
period. In addition, with the adoption of the Water Revenue Adjustment
Mechanism WRAM and the Base Revenue Requirement Adjustment Mechanism BRRAM
by the CPUC, GSWC began recording the difference between what is billed to its
regulated customers and that which is authorized by the CPUC. Other
Operating Revenues: Revenues from non-regulated operations and
maintenance agreements are recognized when services have been rendered to
companies, municipalities or the U.S. government under such agreements.
Revenues 91 Table
of Contents from fixed-price
construction contracts with the U.S. government are recognized on the
percentage-of-completion method of accounting and, therefore, take into account
the cost, estimated earnings, and revenue to date on contracts not yet
completed. The amount of revenue
recognized is based on costs expended to date and is measured by the percentage
of actual costs to-date to the estimated total cost for each contract. This
method is used because management considers it to be the best available measure
of progress on these contracts. Revenues from cost-plus-profit contracts are
recognized on the basis of costs incurred during the period plus the profit
earned, measured by the cost-to-cost method. Contract costs include all direct
material and labor costs charged by subcontractors and indirect costs related
to contract performance, such as indirect labor, supplies, and tools. The
factors considered in including such costs in revenues and expenses are that
ASUS: iis the primary obligor in these arrangements with the U.S.
government; iihas latitude in establishing pricing; and iiibears
credit risk in the collection of receivables from the U.S. government. Administrative and general costs are charged
to expense as incurred. Precontract
costs are generally expensed unless it is probable that ASUS will be awarded
the specific anticipated contract, in which case ASUS capitalizes precontract
costs incurred. Capitalized precontract
costs have been immaterial to date.
Provisions for estimated losses on uncompleted contracts are made in the
period in which such losses are determined. Changes in job performance, job
conditions, change orders and estimated profitability, including those arising
from contract penalty provisions and final contract settlements, may result in
revisions to costs and income and are recognized in the period in which the
revisions are determined. The asset, Costs
and estimated earnings in excess of billings on uncompleted contracts,
represents revenues recognized in excess of amounts billed. The liability, Billings
in excess of costs and estimated earnings on uncompleted contracts, represents
billings in excess of revenues recognized.
Amounts expected to be earned/collected in the next 12-months have been
classified as current. Debt
Issuance Costs and Redemption Premiums: Original debt issuance costs are capitalized and
amortized over the lives of the respective issues. Premiums paid on the early
redemption of debt, which is reacquired through refunding, are deferred and
amortized over the life of the debt issued to finance the refunding as
Registrant normally receives recovery of these costs in rates. Other
Credits and Liabilities: For GSWC, advances for
construction represent amounts advanced by developers for the cost to construct
water system facilities in order to extend water service to their properties.
Advances are generally refundable at rates ranging from 10% to 22% of the
revenue received from the installations for which funds were advanced or in
equal annual installments, generally over 40 years. In certain instances, GSWC
makes refunds on these advances over a specific period of time based on
operating revenues related to the main or as new customers are connected to
receive service from the main. For CCWC, advances for construction represent
amounts advanced by developers which are refundable over 10 to 20 years. Refund
amounts under the CCWC contracts are based on annual revenues from the
extensions, as authorized by the ACC. After all refunds are made, any remaining
balance is transferred to contributions-in-aid of construction. Utility plant funded by advances and
contributions is excluded from rate base. Generally, GSWC and CCWC depreciates
contributed property and amortizes contributions in aid of construction at the
composite rate of the related property. During 2009, 2008 and 2007,
approximately $11 million, $11 million and $26 million, respectively, of
advances that expired were transferred to contributions-in-aid of construction.
Contributions-in-aid of construction are similar to advances, but require no
refunding and are amortized over the useful lives of the related property. Fair
Value of Financial Instruments: For cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable,
accounts payable and short-term debt, the carrying amount is assumed to
approximate fair value due to the short-term nature of the amounts. The table
below estimates the fair value of long-term debt held by the utility subsidiaries.
Rates available to the utility subsidiaries at December31, 2009 and 2008
for debt with similar terms and remaining maturities were used to estimate fair
value for long-term debt. Changes in the assumptions will produce differing
results.

Registrant has two stock incentive plans for employees, the 2000 Stock
Incentive Plan, or 2000 Employee Plan, and the 2008 Stock Incentive Plan, or
2008 Employee Plan, and a stock incentive plan for directors, the 2003
Non-Employee Directors Stock Plan, or 2003 Directors Plan, which are described
more fully in Note 12. Registrant
applies the provisions in the accounting guidance for share-based payments in
accounting for all of its stock-based awards. See Note 12 for further
discussion. Sales
and Use Taxes: GSWC bills certain sales and use taxes levied
by state or local governments to its customers. Included in these sales and use
taxes are franchise fees, which GSWC pays to various municipalities based on
ordinances adopted by these municipalities in order to use public right of way
for utility purposes. GSWC bills these franchise fees to its 92 Table
of Contents customers based on a
CPUC-authorized rate. These franchise fees, which are required to be paid
regardless of GSWCs ability to collect from the customer, are accounted for on
a gross basis. GSWCs franchise fees billed to customers and recorded as
operating revenue were approximately $29 million, $26 million and $27
million the years ended December31, 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively.
When GSWC acts as an agent, and the tax is not required to be remitted if it is
not collected from the customer, the taxes are accounted for on a net basis. Depending
on the state in which the operations are conducted, ASUS and its subsidiaries
are also subject to certain state non-income tax assessments generally computed
on a gross receipts or gross revenues basis. These non-income tax assessments are required
to be paid regardless of ASUSs ability to be reimbursed by the U.S. government
under its 50-year contracts to operate and maintain the water and/or wastewater
systems at military basis. The
non-income tax assessments are accounted for on a gross basis and totaled
$726,000 and $715,000 during the years ended December31, 2009 and 2008,
respectively. Recently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements: In September2006, the Financial Accounting Standards Board FASB issued authoritative guidance on fair value measurements, defining fair value and establishing the framework for measuring fair value in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and expanding disclosures about fair value measurements. In 2008, FASB deferred the effective date of this guidance for certain nonfinancial assets and liabilities until January1, 2009. Accordingly, enhanced disclosures regarding nonfinancial assets such as Registrants goodwill as of December31, 2009 are disclosed in Note 1.In December2007, the FASB issued revised authoritative guidance on business combinations which establishes principles and requirements for how the acquirer in a business combination: irecognizes and measures in its financial statements the identifiable assets acquired, the liabilities assumed, and any non-controlling interest in the assets acquired, iirecognizes and measures the goodwill acquired in the business combination, and iiidetermines what information to disclose to enable users of the financial statements to evaluate the nature and financial effects of the business combination. In addition, this revised guidance also requires acquisition-related costs to be expensed in the period in which the costs are incurred and servic
es received instead of including such costs as part of acquisition price. The guidance was effective for the Company beginning January1, 2009 and did not have any impact on Registrants consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows. Any business combinations that Registrant may engage in subsequent to this date will be recorded and disclosed under the new guidance.
In December2007,
the FASB also amended authoritative guidance on non-controlling interests in
consolidated financial statements. The
objective of this guidance is to improve the relevance, comparability, and
transparency of the financial information that a reporting entity provides in
its consolidated financial statements by establishing accounting and reporting
standards for the non-controlling interest in a subsidiary and for the
deconsolidation of a subsidiary. The
amended guidance was effective for the Company beginning January1, 2009
and did not have any impact on Registrants consolidated financial position,
results of operations or cash flows. In March2008,
the FASB amended its guidance on disclosures about derivatives and hedging
activities. The amended guidance
requires qualitative disclosures about objectives and strategies for using
derivatives, quantitative disclosures about fair value amounts of gains and
losses on derivative instruments and disclosures about credit-risk-related
contingent features in derivative agreements. This guidance was effective
for the Company beginning January1, 2009 and did not have any impact on
Registrants consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash
flows. The adoption of the new guidance
did result in enhanced qualitative disclosure of Registrants derivative
instrument as discussed in Note 4. In December2008,
the FASB amended its guidance on disclosures about post-retirement benefit
plans to require additional disclosures about plan assets held in an employers
defined benefit pension or other post-retirement plan, and to provide users of
financial statements with an understanding of ihow investment
allocation decisions are made, including the factors that are pertinent to an
understanding of investment policies and strategies, iithe major
categories of plan assets, iiithe inputs and valuation techniques used
to measure the fair value of plan assets including the level within the fair
value hierarchy, using the guidance on fair value measurements, and ivsignificant concentrations of
risk within plan assets. The amended
guidance was effective for the Company beginning December31, 2009 and did
not have any impact on Registrants consolidated financial position, results of
operations or cash flows. The adoption of the new guidance did result in
enhanced disclosure of Registrants pension and post-retirement plans as
discussed in Note 11. In April2009,
the FASB issued guidance requiring disclosures beginning in the second quarter
of 2009 about the fair value of all financial instruments, for which it is
practicable to estimate that fair value, for interim and annual reporting
periods. Since this new guidance impacts disclosure only, the adoption of this
position did not have an impact on Registrants consolidated results of
operations, financial position or cash flows.
This enhanced disclosure was provided in Registrants interim reports. 93 Table of Contents In May2009,
the FASB issued guidance on subsequent events, establishing general standards
of accounting for and disclosures of events that occur after the balance sheet
date but before the financial statements are issued or are available to be
issued. The guidance requires disclosure of the date through which an entity
has evaluated subsequent events and the basis for that date, that is, whether
that date represents the date the financial statements were issued or available
to be issued. This guidance was effective beginning in the second quarter of
2009 and impacted disclosure only.
Registrant has performed an evaluation of subsequent events through March12,
2010, which is the date the financial statements were issued. In June2009,
the FASB issued guidance on the codification of generally accepted accounting
principles GAAP. This guidance was effective for the Company beginning in
the third quarter of 2009. The FASB
Accounting Standards Codification became the source of authoritative GAAP
recognized by the FASB to be applied by non-governmental entities. Rulesand
interpretive releases of the Securities and Exchange Commission SEC under
authority of federal securities laws are also sources of authoritative GAAP for
SEC registrants. On the effective date of this guidance, the Codification
superseded all then-existing accounting and reporting standards, other than rulesand
interpretative releases issued by the SEC. The adoption of the new guidance did
not have any impact on the Companys financial statements. Recently
Issued But Not Yet Adopted Accounting Pronouncements:
In June2009, the FASB issued revised guidance which enhances
information reported to users of financial statements by providing greater
transparency about transfers of financial assets and a companys continuing
involvement in transferred assets. Generally accepted accounting principles no
longer include the concept of qualifying special purpose entity. The revised guidance also changes the
requirements for derecognizing financial assets and requires additional
disclosures about a transferors continuing involvement in transferred
financial assets. This revised guidance is effective for the Company beginning January1,
2010 and is not expected to have any impact on Registrants consolidated
results of operations, financial position or cash flows. In June2009,
the FASB amended the guidance on consolidation for variable interest entities.
The new guidance requires a company to perform a qualitative analysis when
determining whether it must consolidate a variable interest entity. This guidance also amends how to determine
whether an entity is a variable interest entity. A company must now disclose
how its involvement with a variable interest entity affects the companys
financial statements and disclose any significant judgments and assumptions
made in determining whether it must consolidate a variable interest entity.
This guidance is effective for the Company beginning January1, 2010 and
is not expected to have any impact on the Registrants consolidated results of
operations, financial position or cash flows. Other
accounting standards that have been issued or proposed by the FASB or other
standards-setting bodies that do not require adoption until a future date are
not expected to have a material impact on Registrants consolidated financial
statements upon adoption. 94 Table
of Contents Note 2 Regulatory Matters In accordance with
accounting principles for rate-regulated enterprises, Registrant records
regulatory assets, which represent probable future revenue associated with
certain costs that will be recovered from customers through the ratemaking
process, and regulatory liabilities, which represent probable future reductions
in revenue associated with amounts that are to be credited to customers through
the ratemaking process. At December31, 2009, Registrant had approximately
$467 million of regulatory assets not accruing carrying costs. Of this amount 278 million relates to the underfunded positions of the pension and other
post-retirement obligations, $67 million relates to deferred income taxes
representing accelerated tax benefits flowed through to ratepayers, which will
be included in rates concurrently with recognition of the associated future tax
expense, $73 million relates to a memorandum account authorized by the CPUC to
track unrealized gains and losses on GSWCs purchase power contracts over the
life of the contract, and $15 million related to general rate case memorandum
accounts to be recovered within 12 months.
The remainder relates to other expenses that do not provide for recovery
of carrying costs that Registrant expects to recover in rates over a short
period. Regulatory assets, less
regulatory liabilities, included in the consolidated balance sheets are as

Supply Cost Balancing Accounts Electric Supply Cost Balancing AccountElectric power costs incurred by GSWCs
Bear Valley Electric Service BVES division continue to be charged to its
electric supply cost balancing account. The under-collection in the electric
supply cost balancing account is $131 million at December31, 2009. This balance is comprised of $93 million for
changes in purchased energy and power system delivery costs including interest,
further discussed below. The remaining
$38 million in the electric supply cost balancing account relates to the
tariff charged to GSWC by Southern California Edison Edison for the
abandonment of a transmission line upgrade, also discussed below. Changes in purchased
energy and power system delivery costs as compared to authorized rates have
impacted the electric supply cost balancing account by $93 million as of December31,
2009. The purchased energy costs that are recorded in the supply cost balancing
account are subject to a price cap by terms of a 2001 settlement which was
subsequently approved in a CPUC decision. The BVES division of GSWC is allowed
to include its actual recorded purchased energy costs up to a weighted annual
average cost of $77 per megawatt-hour MWh through August2011 in its
electric supply cost balancing account.
BVES began receiving power under a new purchased power contract on January1,
2009. The main product under the new
contract provides for 13 MWs of electric energy at a fixed price of $6375 per
MWh during 2009 as compared to $7465 per MWh during 2008. The reduction in the actual price of
purchased power helps decrease the under-collection balance in the electric
supply cost balancing account. To the
extent that the actual weighted average annual 95 Table
of Contents cost for power purchased
exceeds the $77 per MWh amount, GSWC will not be able to include these amounts
in its balancing account and such amounts will be expensed. There were no amounts expensed over the $77
per MWh cap during the years ended December31, 2009 and 2008. During the
year ended December31, 2007, the amount expensed was $29,000. Charges to GSWC by Edison
associated with the transportation of energy over Edisons power system and the
abandonment of a transmission line upgrade have increased under Edisons tariff
to levels that exceed the amounts authorized by the CPUC in BVES retail power
rates to its customers. The incremental cost increase to GSWC from the tariff
for the abandonment of a transmission line upgrade, which is not currently
included in rates, is $38,137 per month.
The incremental costs of $38 million at December31, 2009 not
included in rates have been included in the balancing account at December31,
2009 for subsequent recovery from customers, subject to CPUC approval. The power system delivery
costs are not subject to the $77 per MWh price cap referenced above. Other components, such as interest accrued on
the cumulative under-collected balance and power lost during transmission, also
affect the balance of the electric supply cost balancing account. The CPUC has authorized
GSWC to collect a surcharge from its customers of 22 per kilowatt hour
through August2011, to enable GSWC to recover an under-collection of
approximately $231million at the end of 2001 which had been incurred
during the energy crisis in late 2000 and 2001.
As a result of the surcharge, the $231 million under-collection
incurred during the energy crisis in late 2000 and 2001 has now been fully
recovered. This surcharge will continue
to decrease the electric supply cost balancing account through August2011. For the years ended December31,
2009, 2008 and 2007, the under-collection decreased by approximately $30
million, $22 million, and $16 million, respectively. Water Supply Cost Balancing AccountsAs permitted by the CPUC, Registrant
maintains water supply cost balancing accounts for GSWC to account for
under-collections and over-collections of revenues designed to recover such
costs. The supply cost balancing
accounts track differences between the current cost for supply items water,
power, and pump taxes charged by GSWCs suppliers and the cost for those items
incorporated into GSWCs rates. Under-collections recorded as regulatory
assets occur when the current cost exceeds the amount in rates for these items
and, conversely, over-collections recorded as regulatory liabilities occur
when the current cost of these items is less than the amount in rates. Typically, under-collections or over-collections,
when they occur, are tracked in the supply cost balancing accounts for future
recovery or refund through a surcharge in the event of an under-collection or
through a surcredit in the event of an over-collection on customers
bills. Registrant accrues interest on
its supply cost balancing accounts at the rate prevailing for 90-day commercial
paper. Registrant does not maintain a
supply cost balancing account for CCWC. For the years ended December31,
2009, 2008 and 2007, approximately $11 million, $51 million, and $27 million
of under-collections including interest, respectively, were recorded in the
water supply cost balancing accounts.
Amortization of surcharges that are in rates to recover
under-collections from customers and surcredits that are in rates to refund over-collections
to customers also increased or decreased the water supply cost balancing
accounts, as applicable. During the year
ended December31, 2009 and 2008, approximately $82 million and $18
million of surcharges were billed to customers to decrease the previously
incurred under-collection in the water supply cost balancing accounts. During the year ended December31,
2007, approximately $990,000 was credited to customers to decrease the
previously incurred over-collection in the water supply cost balancing
accounts. As of December31,
2009, there is an approximately $47 million net under-collection in the water
supply cost balancing accounts. Of this
amount, approximately $22 million relates to GSWCs Region III customer
service area. The remaining $25 million
net under-collection relates primarily to GSWCs Region I. Currently, there are surcharges in place at
each of the three regions to recover these under-collections over a 12 month
period. In addition, in January2010,
the CPUC approved a 36-month surcharge in one of Region Is ratemaking areas to
begin recovering the under-collection prospectively. When these surcharges expire, any unrecovered
balances will be included for recovery in a future filing. On August21, 2008,
the CPUC issued a final decision which approved a settlement agreement between
GSWC and the CPUCs Division of Ratepayer Advocates DRA regarding
conservation rate design. As a result of
this decision, GSWC is permitted to establish a Modified Cost Balancing Account
MCBA that will permit GSWC to recover supply costs related to changes in
water supply mix in addition to rate changes by GSWCs suppliers. GSWC
implemented this MCBA for Regions II and III in late November2008 and for
Region Is ratemaking areas in September2009. This account replaced the water supply cost
balancing account procedure for costs incurred after the modified supply cost
balancing account was implemented. See
further discussion below under WRAM. 96 Table
of Contents Water
Revenue Adjustment Mechanism WRAM and Modified Cost Balancing Account MCBA With the adoption of the
WRAM and the MCBA effective November25, 2008 for Regions II and III and September1,
2009 for Region Is ratemaking areas, GSWC began recording the difference
between what is billed to its regulated water customers and that which is
authorized by the CPUC. Under the WRAM, GSWC records the adopted level of
volumetric revenues as authorized by the CPUC for metered accounts adopted
volumetric revenues. While the WRAM
tracks volumetric-based revenues, the revenue requirements approved by the CPUC
include service charges, flat rate charges, and other items that are not
subject to the WRAM. The adopted volumetric revenues consider the seasonality
of consumption of water based upon historical averages. The variance between
adopted volumetric revenues and actual billed volumetric revenues for metered
accounts is recorded as a component of revenue with an offsetting entry to a
current asset or liability balancing account tracked individually for each
water region. The variance amount may be positive or negative and represents
amounts that will be billed or refunded to customers in the future. Under the MCBA, GSWC
began tracking adopted expense levels for purchased water, purchased power and
pump taxes, as established by the CPUC. Variances which include the effects of
changes in both rate and volume between adopted and actual purchased water,
purchased power, and pump tax expenses are recorded as a component of the
supply cost balancing account provision, as the amount of such variances will
be recovered from or refunded to GSWCs customers at a later date. This is
reflected with an offsetting entry to a current asset or liability balancing
account tracked individually for each water region. The balances in the WRAM
and MCBA assets and liabilities accounts will fluctuate on a monthly basis depending
upon the variance between adopted and actual results. The recovery or refund of
the WRAM is netted against the MCBA over- or under-collection for the
corresponding ratemaking area. These balances
bear interest at the current 90day commercial paper rate. When the net
amount for Region II, Region III or any of the Region I ratemaking areas
achieves a pre-determined level i.e., at least 25 percent over- or
under-recovery of the approved revenue requirement, GSWC will seek approval
from the CPUC to refund or collect the balance in the accounts. Account balances less than those levels may
be refunded or collected in GSWCs general rate case proceedings or aggregated
with future calendar year balances for comparison with the pre-determined
recovery level of 25 percent of adopted revenues. As of December31,
2009, GSWC has a net aggregate regulatory asset of $212 million, which is
comprised of a $239 million under-collection in the WRAM accounts and $27
million over-collection in the MCBA accounts.
In March2010, GSWC filed an advice letter with the CPUC for
recovery of the Region II and III WRAM, net of the MCBA and supply cost
balancing accounts, of $183 million. Costs
Deferred for Future Recovery In
1999, GSWC sued Aerojet-General Corporation Aerojet for contaminating the
Sacramento County Groundwater Basin, which affected certain GSWC wells. On a
related matter, GSWC also filed a lawsuit against the State of California the State.
The CPUC authorized memorandum accounts to allow for recovery, from customers,
of costs incurred by GSWC in prosecuting the cases against Aerojet and the
State, less any recovery from the defendants or others. On July21, 2005, the CPUC authorized
GSWC to collect approximately $213 million of the Aerojet litigation
memorandum account, through a rate surcharge, which will continue for no longer
than 20 years. Beginning in October2005, new rates went into effect to
begin amortizing the memorandum account over a 20-year period. A rate surcharge generating approximately
$990,000, $11 million, and $11 million was billed to customers during the
years ended December31, 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively. GSWC will keep the Aerojet memorandum account
open until the earlier of full amortization of the balance or
20years. However, no costs will be
added to the memorandum account, other than on-going interest charges approved
by the CPUC decision. Pursuant to the
decision, additional interest of approximately $53,000, $445,000, and $11
million was added to the Aerojet litigation memorandum account during the years
ended December31, 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively. Aerojet has also agreed
to reimburse GSWC $175million, plus interest accruing from January1,
2004, for GSWCs past legal and expert costs, which is included in the Aerojet
litigation memorandum account. The reimbursement of the $175million is
contingent upon the issuance of land use approvals for development in a defined
area within Aerojet property in Eastern Sacramento County and the receipt of
certain fees in connection with such development. On April7, 2006,
GSWC filed an advice letter with the CPUC to incorporate the Westborough
development in Sacramento County into the Rancho Cordova service area and to
provide water service to that new development. The Westborough development is
within the defined area in the Aerojet settlement agreement. The City of Folsom filed a protest of GSWCs
advice letter on April27, 2006. On January30, 2007, the CPUC
rejected the advice letter without prejudice, and invited GSWC to re-file the
advice letter once the City of Folsom protest was resolved, or file an
application for CPUC approval of the service territory expansion. In June2007, GSWC signed an agreement
with the City of Folsom and the City agreed not to contest GSWCs providing
water service to Westborough and relinquished all claims concerning GSWCs 97 Table of Contents providing water service
to the area. As compensation to the City of Folsom to resolve its claim, GSWC
has agreed to pay the City of Folsom $550,000. Aerojet has agreed to reimburse
GSWC for 50%, or $275,000, of the settlement payment. As of December31,2009,
GSWC has recorded an obligation of $550,000 to the City of Folsom and an
additional receivable of $275,000 from Aerojet for the amount to be
reimbursed. During the third quarter of
2007, GSWC filed a second advice letter after resolving the issue with the City
of Folsom. That advice letter was subsequently protested by the Sacramento
County Water Agency SCWA. During the second quarter of 2008, the
objections raised by SCWA in their protest were removed. GSWC intends to
file again with the CPUC to incorporate the Westborough development in
Sacramento County into the Rancho Cordova service area and to provide water
service to that new development upon completion of the development of a
regional water supply solution for the area. It is managements
intention to offset certain proceeds from the housing development by Aerojet in
the Westborough areas, pursuant to the settlement agreement, against the
balance in this litigation memorandum account.
At this time, management believes the full balance of the Aerojet
litigation memorandum account will be collected. Pensions
and Other Post-Retirement Obligations As more fully discussed
in Note 11, the fair value of the pension plan assets as of December31,
2009 increased by approximately 264% since December31, 2008. As a result, for the year ended December31,
2009, Registrants underfunded position decreased by $122 million to $291
million as compared to $413 million as of December31, 2008. There was a significant increase in the
underfunded status of the pension plan during 2008, partially due to an
increase in the projected benefit obligation in 2008 caused primarily from a
decrease in the discount rate, as well as a significant decrease in the fair
value of plan assets. In March2009, GSWC filed an advice letter with
the CPUC requesting authorization to establish a Pension Costs Memorandum
Account to track the difference between the pension costs authorized by the
CPUC and included in customer rates, and actual pension costs in 2009.
The CPUC denied this request indicating that amounts established in the
previous general rate case will remain in effect. GSWC also amended its
current rate case application to request a two-way balancing account to track
fluctuations in the forecasted annual pension expense adopted in rates and the
actual annual expense to be recorded by GSWC in 2010, 2011 and 2012 in
accordance with the accounting guidance for pension costs. If approved as
filed, GSWC will establish a regulatory asset or liability in those years, for
any shortfalls or excesses in this account. Pension expense historically is
included in rates based on an actuarial estimate. Management expects to
continue to recoup the full amount in rates. Electric
Transmission Line Abandonment Costs The
ability of GSWC to deliver purchased power to customers in its BVES customer
service area is limited by the ability of the transmission facilities owned by
Edison to transmit this power. GSWC filed a lawsuit against Edison in 2000 for
breach of contract as a result of delays in upgrading these transmission
facilities as well as for other reasons. In March2004, GSWC and Edison
agreed to settle this suit. Under the terms of the settlement agreement, GSWC
agreed to pay a $5 million project abandonment fee to Edison. Edison filed an
application with the FERC for approval to treat the entire $5 million
settlement payment as an abandoned project cost to be included in Edisons
wholesale tariff charged to GSWC. A liability to Edison with a corresponding
regulatory asset of $50 million was established at the time of settlement. GSWC
made an initial lump sum payment of $14 million to Edison during the first
quarter of 2004 and agreed to pay Edison the remaining $36 million over a 15
year term through 180 equal monthly payments of $38,137 to be included in
Edisons monthly tariff, discussed previously. Since the tariff was approved by
the FERC, the $14 million lump sum payment was recorded in the electric supply
cost balancing account, which decreased this regulatory asset balance. In
addition, monthly payments of $38,137 per month made to Edison during the years
ended December31, 2009, 2008 and 2007, as discussed previously, have also
been included in the electric supply cost balancing account, the principal of
which would also decrease the regulatory asset account. Management believes that it is probable that
the CPUC will permit GSWC to recover the rates authorized by and on file with
FERC in connection with the Edison settlement. Asset
Retirement Obligations As more fully discussed
in Note 3, effective January1, 2003, Registrant adopted authoritative
guidance for accounting for asset retirement obligations. Because retirement costs have historically
been recovered through rates at the time of retirement, upon implementing this
guidance, the cumulative effect was reflected as a regulatory asset. Registrant
will also reflect the gain or loss at settlement as a regulatory asset or
liability on the balance sheet. 98 Table of Contents Low
Income Balancing Accounts This
regulatory asset reflects primarily the costs of implementing and administering
the California Alternate Rates for Water program in GSWCs Regions and the
California Alternate Rate for Energy program in GSWCs BVES division. These
programs mandated by the CPUC provide a 15% discount for qualified low-income
water customers and 20% for electric customers. The low income balancing
account was established in May2002 to track all the discounts and costs
related to this program for future recovery in rates. The Company anticipates
that discounts for low income families will be incorporated in GSWCs base
rates to customers. GSWC accrues
interest on its low income balancing accounts at the prevailing rate for 90-day
commercial paper. In January2007,
the CPUC approved the recovery of $744,000 in Region IIIs low income balance
over a 12-month period effective January1, 2007. In August2008, the CPUC approved the
recovery of $27 million in Region IIs low income balancing account over a
12-month period effective August28, 2008.
During 2008, GSWC also implemented a low income rate program in Region I
in connection with its January2008 general rate case decision. As of December31, 2009, there is an
aggregate $48 million under-collection in the low income balancing
accounts. GSWC intends to file for
recovery of the remaining uncollected low income balances. General
Rate Case Memorandum Accounts On November16, 2007, the CPUC approved general
rate case increases for GSWCs Region II service area and additional rate
increases in Region II and III to recover general office expenses at the
corporate headquarters of GSWC. Due to
delays in issuing a decision on these applications, the CPUC had previously
approved an interim rate increase for Region II totaling $12 million that
became effective January1, 2007. Based on the decision issued by the CPUC
on November16, 2007, the approved revenue increase for 2007 totals
approximately $64 million and was retroactive to January1, 2007. Additionally, the decision also reflected a
rate increase of approximately $30 million for 2007 to recover corporate
headquarters expenses allocated to Region III.
Similar to Region II, the CPUC had previously approved an interim rate
increase for Region III, totaling $135,000, which became effective January1,
2007. As a result of these decisions, GSWC recorded
approximately $72 million as a non-yielding regulatory asset with a
corresponding increase to revenues during the fourth quarter of 2007 related to
additional revenues. This represents the revenue difference between the interim
rates implemented on January1, 2007 and the final rates authorized by the
CPUC for the period from January1 through December20, 2007, the
date when the new tariff rates were fully implemented. A surcharge was implemented February2008
to recover the retroactive revenues over 24 months. The decision also changed the revenue
requirement related to the adopted rates for Region II supply cost balancing
accounts, also retroactive to January1, 2007. At the time of the final
decision, an under-collection of $25 million which had been recorded in the
Region II supply cost balancing account throughout 2007 was reversed in November2007
reducing this regulatory asset. For GSWCs Region III
rate case approved by the CPUC on January12, 2006, GSWC also filed an
Application for Rehearing to request additional revenues, based on certain
corrections to the rate calculation. On July31,
2008, the CPUC adopted a stipulation jointly filed by GSWC and DRA. The stipulation addressed all of the pending
issues including proposing a 12-month surcharge enabling GSWC to recover
revenues of approximately $541,000 for the period January1, 2006 through Mayof
2008. As a result of the CPUCs approval, a regulatory asset of $541,000
was recorded in July2008 with a corresponding increase to income. As of December31,
2009, there is an aggregate $15 million in the general rate case memorandum
accounts. Santa Maria Adjudication Memorandum Accounts GSWC has incurred costs
of approximately $72 million as of December31, 2009, including legal and
expert witness fees, in defending its rights to the groundwater supply in the
Santa Maria Basin for use by its customers in Santa Barbara and San Luis Obispo
Counties. Such costs had been recorded in utility plant for future rate
recovery. In February2006,
GSWC filed an application with the CPUC for recovery of $55million of
these costs, representing the amount of the costs that had been incurred as of December31,
2005. In February2007, GSWC reached a settlement with the CPUCs Division
of Ratepayer Advocates DRA authorizing recovery of the $55million
requested in GSWCs application. The settlement deferred review of the
remaining legal costs pending final resolution of the lawsuit. In May2007,
the CPUC issued a decision that approved the settlement with the DRA. Pursuant
to the decision, GSWC was authorized to place in rate base $27million of
the $55million of previously incurred litigation costs in the Santa
Maria groundwater basin adjudication. GSWC was also authorized
to amortize, with interest, the remaining $28million of the $55million
in rates over a ten-year period. This amount has been transferred into a
separate memorandum account included within regulatory assets and a surcharge
has been implemented in the third quarter of 2007 for recovery of these costs.
A rate surcharge generating 99 Table of Contents approximately $309,000 325,000 and $237,000 was billed to customers during the years ended December31,
2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively. All litigation costs,
including interest that have been incurred since December31, 2005
totaling approximately $17million, have also been transferred from rate
base to a separate memorandum account, subject to a reasonableness review by
the CPUC in a subsequent phase of this proceeding or in a new proceeding. In April2008, the Administrative Law
Judge closed the proceeding without ruling on the stipulation or authorizing
recovery of the remaining costs. The ruling directed GSWC to file a new
application. In accordance with this ruling, GSWC filed a new application as
part of its Region I general rate case filed with the CPUC in January2010. Management believes that these additional
costs will be approved and that recovery of these costs through rates is
probable. Refund
of Water Right Lease Revenues In 1994, GSWC entered into a contract to lease
to the City of Folsom, 5,000 acre-feet per year of water rights from the
American River. GSWC included all associated revenues in a nonoperating income
account. In a decision issued on March16, 2004, the CPUC ordered GSWC to
refund 70 percent of the total amount of lease revenues received since 1994,
plus interest, to customers. Pursuant to the order, GSWC recorded a $62
million regulatory liability with a corresponding charge against non-operating
income, net of taxes, during the fourth quarter of 2003. A final amount of the
refund was approved by the CPUC in June2004 and GSWC adjusted its
estimate to the approved refund amount of $52 million. Refunds of approximately $554,000, $585,000,
and $620,000 were provided to customers during the years ended December31,
2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively. The refunds will be made over a 9-year
period which commenced in June2004. Pursuant to the March2004 CPUC order, the
apportionment of any lease revenues that GSWC collects commencing in January2004
was to be determined by a later decision. Pending that later decision and
beginning in the first quarter of 2004, all amounts billed to the City of
Folsom had been included in a regulatory liability account and no amounts were
recognized as revenue until uncertainties about this matter were resolved with
the CPUC. On April13, 2006, the CPUC authorized GSWC to reinvest all
lease revenues received from the City of Folsom since January2004,
inclusive of the balances in the regulatory liability accounts, in water system
infrastructure and to include such investments in the rate base upon which GSWC
earns a rate of return. As a result, GSWC transferred approximately $23
million of water rights lease revenues received from the City of Folsom in 2004
and 2005 from the regulatory liability account into other water revenues in the
first quarter of 2006. GSWC also recorded additional other water revenues of
approximately $14 million, $13 million, and $13 million reflecting lease
revenues from the City of Folsom for the years ended December31, 2009,
2008 and 2007, respectively. BVES Generation Facility Capital-Related Memorandum Account In April2005, new
customer rates went into effect related to the 84 megawatt MW natural
gas-fueled generation plant, which has resulted in an increase of approximately
$23million in annual revenue based on an estimated total capital-related
cost of $13million. The rates are subject to refund pending the CPUCs
final cost review. The CPUC also ordered GSWC to establish a Capital-Related
Memorandum Account CAPMA to track the capital-related costs of the
generation plant. If actual recorded costs in the memorandum account are less
than the costs authorized by the CPUC of $13million, the revenue
requirement for the difference is to be refunded to ratepayers. During the
third quarter of 2007, GSWC received vendor credits of approximately $851,000,
which reduced the actual recorded costs of the generation plant below
$13million. As a result of these
credits, GSWC began recording a regulatory liability with a corresponding
reduction in electric revenues due to this over-collection and probable refunds
to customers related to the 84 MW natural gas-fueled generation plant. As part of the settlement agreement reached
by the DRA and GSWC in the recent BVES general rate case, it was agreed that
the $436,000 revenue requirement for the difference be refunded to customers
via a surcredit over a four-month period from December1, 2009 through March31,
2010. The balance remaining at the end
of this period will be transferred to the BRRAM account. Refunds of approximately $60,000 were
provided to customers for the year ended December31, 2009. As of December31, 2009, approximately
$376,000 remained in the CAPMA account as a regulatory liability. Environmental Clean-Up and Remediation GSWC has included in
other regulatory assets as of December31, 2009 approximately $14 million
of additional estimated costs to remediate and clean-up two of its plant sites
for soil contamination. One site
contained an underground storage tank which was used to store gasoline. Amounts paid by GSWC in the past for this
site have been included in rate-base and approved by the CPUC for
recovery. The ultimate cost may vary as
there are many unknowns in remediation of underground gasoline leakage and this
is an estimate based on currently available information. At a separate plant site, hyrdrocarbon
contaminated soil was found where an abandoned water tank was demolished. The contamination appears to 100 Table of Contents be shallow and likely the
result of past corrosion control practices.
GSWC has contracted clean-up work to be performed, which is currently
estimated to be approximately $110,000.
Management believes it is probable that the estimated cleanup costs for
both sites will be approved for recovery in rates. Deferred
Rate Case Costs Included in GSWCs other
regulatory assets are deferred rate case costs totaling $36 million. These are
direct costs consisting primarily of outside consulting services, which have
been incurred in connection with the preparation and processing of a general
rate case. Historically, GSWC has deferred these costs as a regulatory
asset which are then recovered in rates and amortized over the term of a rate
case cycle once the new rates go into effect. In the current general rate
case for Regions II and III and the general office, the DRA is challenging GSWCs
historical practice of deferring these costs with subsequent recovery upon the
effective date of the new rates. Instead, DRA believes that rate case
costs should be projected for future periods and recovered prospectively.
Management believes that DRAs rationale and recommendations are
inconsistent with GSWCs historical practice of deferring and recovering rate
case expenses associated with the current GRC.
This practice has not been challenged by the CPUC in prior rate
cases. GSWC will vigorously defend its position. However, if DRA
prevails, GSWC may be required to write-off approximately $24 million as of December31,2009
related to the current water rate case. The final resolution of this
issue is expected in September2010 as part of the CPUCs final decision
in the Region II and III general rate case.
At this time, GSWC is unable to predict the outcome of this matter. La
Serena Plant Improvement Project In January2008, the
CPUC approved Region Is general rate case effective for years 2008, 2009, and
2010. On March3, 2008, the DRA
filed an application for rehearing of this decision on various legal
grounds. As permitted by the CPUC, GSWC
filed a response to DRAs application.
In September2008, the CPUC granted a limited rehearing in order to
consider whether it is reasonable to include in Region Is rate base
approximately $35 million of costs incurred in connection with the La Serena
Plant Improvement Project. The project
is currently in rate base and the earnings have been included in rates since January1,
2008. At this time, management believes it is probable that the costs of
this project will be allowed to remain in rate base. The final resolution of this issue is
expected in September2010 as part of the CPUCs final decision in the
Region II and III general rate case. CCWC Other Regulatory Assets/Liabilities Fountain Hills Sanitary District FHSD is a
political subdivision of the State of Arizona that provides sanitary sewer
service to customers residing within CCWCs water service area. In connection
with its sanitary system, FHSD constructed a recharge system whereby it
recharges treated effluent through multiple injection wells. In order for FHSD
to secure an Aquifer Protection Permit for its recharge system, FHSD requested
CCWC to permanently cease using one of its wells. As a possible replacement for
this well, FHSD constructed a new well adjacent to the community center Community
Center Well. However, this well was
not able to produce an equivalent amount of water to CCWCs well that was taken
out of production. Accordingly, in February2005,
CCWC entered into an agreement with FHSD whereby CCWC agreed to permanently
remove from service this well and in return CCWC received a settlement fee of
$1,520,000 from FHSD. Pursuant to the agreement, CCWC agreed to: ipermanently
remove from service and cap this well, and cap another well which had never
been used as a potable source of supply; iirelinquish any legal claim
or interest that CCWC may otherwise possess in the Community Center Well, and iiigrant
an option to FHSD to acquire one of the wells at a future date at fair market
value. The removal of these two wells from service did not have a significant
impact on CCWCs water supply. In 2005, CCWC recognized a net gain of $760,000
related to this settlement agreement and established a regulatory liability for
the remaining $760,000 pending ACC review of this matter. On October8, 2009, the ACC made a final
ruling ordering CCWC to treat the entire gain of $1,520,000 from the settlement
agreement with FHSD as a reduction to rate base. As a result, CCWC has recorded
a loss of $760,000 during the third quarter of 2009. This effectively reverses the original gain
recorded in 2005. In November2009,
CCWC filed an application for rehearing on several issues including the sharing
of this gain from the settlement proceeds.The ACC granted CCWCs
request to hold a rehearing on the issues. On January27, 2010, a
procedural conference was held with the judge and the staff of the ACC involved
in the rate case to address a schedule for the rehearing. The rehearing is now
scheduled for April9, 2010. 101 Table of Contents Other Regulatory Matters On February15,
2007, the CPUC issued a subpoena to GSWC in connection with an investigation of
certain work orders and charges paid to a specific contractor used by GSWC for
numerous construction projects totaling approximately $240 million. The CPUCs
investigation focuses on whether GSWC was overcharged for these construction
projects and whether these overcharges were approved in customer rates.
The construction projects completed by this specific contractor related
primarily to work on water treatment and pumping plants which have been placed
in service and are used and useful. In June2007, GSWC received
notification from the CPUC that it was instituting an audit. The purpose of the
audit was to examine for the period 1994 to the present, GSWCs policies,
procedures, and practices throughout all of its Regions regarding the granting
or awarding of construction contracts or jobs. GSWC is currently
responding to data requests submitted by the CPUC including recent data
requests which asked for information prior to 1994. Should the CPUC investigation result in a
proposed disallowance of certain previously capitalized costs, such costs, and
potentially any return earned on such costs, may be required to be refunded to
the customers upon settlement of the proposed disallowance, if any, resulting
in a charge to operating income. GSWC believes that the costs incurred
related to the aforementioned construction projects were prudent and
appropriately capitalized. Management cannot predict the outcome of the
investigation or audit at this time and is unable to reasonably estimate a
potential loss related to items under the aforementioned investigation, as no
formal claim has been made against GSWC to date. In January2009, the
ACC staff requested information regarding the CPUC subpoena and on-going
audit. GSWC has been working with the
ACC staff and has provided responsive materials that are relevant to CCWC. Management cannot predict the outcome of the
ACCs request. Although the ACC has
issued a decision in the CCWC general rate case, they have held the proceeding
open pending resolution of the staff review of the CPUC subpoena documents. GSWCs BVES division has
been regularly filing compliance reports with the CPUC regarding its purchases
of energy from renewable energy resources. The filings indicated that BVES had
not achieved interim target purchase levels of renewable energy resources and
thus, on its face, might be subject to a potential penalty. GSWC formally
contested the potential penalty reflected in the compliance report. The CPUC
considered the future timing and applicability of renewable energy resource
requirements as they apply to smaller energy utilities like BVES and on May30,
2008, the CPUC issued its final decision regarding the renewable
responsibilities of small utilities including BVES. The final decision affirmed the renewable
obligation targets for small utilities but also allowed small utilities to
defer compliance under the CPUCs flexible compliance rules. BVES is continuing its efforts to procure
renewable resources each year going forward, and where that may prove difficult
because the market for such resources is very constrained, BVES will be
required to describe in detail the problems that warrant further deferral, in
accordance with the CPUCs flexible compliance rules. Because the final
decision deferred BVES interim target purchase levels for the years 2004
through 2007, management believes that the CPUCs decision effectively
forecloses any exposure to financial penalties for the year 2007 and
earlier. For the 2009 and 2008 years,
BVES did not meet the interim targets and expects that the CPUC will waive any
potential fines in accordance with the flexible compliance rules.
Accordingly, no provision for loss has been recorded in the financial
statements as of December31, 2009 or 2008. In November2009,
GSWC entered into a ten-year contract to purchase renewable energy created from
landfill gas. The contract is subject to
CPUC approval. If approved, the contract
will provide up to 3 megawatts at a fixed price of $1100 per MWh. In November2009, GSWC also entered into
a ten-year contract to purchase biogas to power BVESs gas-fueled 84 MW
generation facility. This contract is
also subject to CPUC approval. 102 Table

Retirement Obligations Effective
January1, 2003, Registrant adopted accounting guidance for asset retirement
obligations, which requires businesses to record the fair value of a
liability for an asset retirement obligation in the period in which it is
incurred. When the liability is initially recorded, the entity capitalizes a
cost by increasing the carrying amount of the related long-lived asset. Over
time, the liability is accreted to its present value each period, and the
capitalized cost is depreciated over the useful life of the related asset. Upon
settlement of the liability, an entity either settles the obligation for its
recorded amount or incurs a gain or loss upon settlement. Registrants legal
obligations for retirement reflect principally the retirement of wells, which
by law need to be properly capped at the time of removal. As such, the
regulated subsidiaries of AWR incur asset retirement obligations. Retirement
costs have historically been recovered through rates at the time of retirement.
Accordingly, at implementation of the guidance for asset retirement
obligations, the cumulative effect was reflected as a regulatory asset.
Registrant will also reflect the gain or loss at settlement as a regulatory
asset or liability on the balance sheet. With regards to removal costs
associated with certain other long-lived assets, such as water mains,
distribution and transmission assets, asset retirement obligations have not
been recognized as the Company believes that it will not be obligated to retire
these assets. In 2005, FASB issued
accounting guidance for conditional asset retirement obligations, which had no
impact on Registrants asset retirement obligations. Amounts recorded for asset retirement obligations are subject to various assumptions and determinations, such as determining whether a legal obligation exists to remove assets, and estimating the fair value of the costs of removal, when final removal will occur and the credit-adjusted risk-free interest rates to be utilized on discounting future liabilities. Changes that may arise over time with regard to these assumptions will change amounts recorded in the future. Estimating the fair value of the costs of removal were determined based on third party costs.The following is a reconciliation of the beginning and ending aggregate carrying amount of the asset retirement obligations, which is included in Other Credits on the balance sheets as of December31, 2009 and 2008

Note 4 
Derivative Instruments Registrant had certain
block-forward purchase power contracts that are subject to the accounting
guidance for derivative instruments and hedging activities, as amended. A derivative financial instrument or other
contract derives its value from another investment or designated benchmark. Accounting guidance requires companies to
record derivatives on the balance sheet as assets and liabilities, and to
measure those instruments at their fair value. During 2002, GSWC became a party
to block-forward purchase power contracts that qualified as derivative instruments.
These contracts which became effective in November2002 had not been
designated as normal purchases and normal sales because they allowed for net
settlement for power not taken. Settlement of these contracts
occurred on a cash or net basis through 2006 and occurred by physical delivery
thereafter through the expiration of the contracts on December31, 2008. In October2008,
GSWC executed a new purchased power contract that permits GSWC to purchase
power at a fixed cost over three and five year terms depending on the amount of
power and period during which the power is purchased under the contract. The new contract is also subject to the
accounting guidance for derivatives and requires mark-to-market derivative
accounting. GSWC began receiving power under
this contract on January1, 2009. In May2009, the CPUC issued a
final decision approving the contract and authorized GSWC to establish a
regulatory asset and liability memorandum account to offset the entries
required by the accounting guidance. Accordingly,
all unrealized gains and losses generated from the new purchased power contract
will be deferred on a monthly basis into a non-interest bearing regulatory
memorandum account that will track the changes in fair value of the derivative
throughout the term of the contract. At December31,
2009 there was a $73 million cumulative unrealized loss which has been
included in the memorandum account. This
memorandum account does not impact GSWCs earnings. For the years ended December31,
2008 and 2007, $16 million and $21 million of unrealized gains, respectively,
on purchase power contracts were recorded to GSWCs earnings. 104 Table
of Contents On a monthly basis, the
related asset or liability is adjusted to reflect the fair market value at the
end of the month. Registrant adopted
accounting guidance for fair value measurements effective January1, 2008
for financial assets and liabilities measured on a recurring basis. This guidance applies to all financial assets
and financial liabilities that are being measured and reported on a fair value
basis. There was no impact in the adoption of this accounting guidance to the
consolidated financial statements. However, the accounting guidance requires
disclosure that establishes a framework for measuring fair value and expands
disclosure about fair value measurements. The guidance requires fair value
measurements to be classified and disclosed in one of the following three
categories Level 1: Unadjusted quoted prices in active
markets that are accessible at the measurement date for identical, unrestricted
assets or liabilities Level 2: Quoted prices in markets that are not
active, or inputs which are observable, either directly or indirectly, for
substantially the full term of the asset or liability, or
Level 3: Prices or valuation techniques that
require inputs that are both significant to the fair value measurement and
unobservable i.e., supported by little or no market activity. Registrants valuation
model utilizes various inputs that include quoted market prices for energy over
the duration of the contracts. The market prices used to determine the fair
value for this derivative instrument were estimated based on independent
sources such as broker quotes and publications that are not observable in or
corroborated by the market. Registrant
receives one broker quote to determine the fair value of its derivative
instrument. When such inputs have a
significant impact on the measurement of fair value, the instrument is
categorized in Level 3. Accordingly, the
valuation of the derivative on Registrants new purchased power contract has
been classified as Level 3 for all periods presented. The following table
presents changes in the fair value of GSWCs derivatives for the years ended December31,
2009 and 2008.

Military Privatization ASUS,
through its wholly-owned subsidiaries, has entered into agreements with the
U.S. government to operate and maintain the water and/or wastewater systems at
various military bases pursuant to 50-year fixed price contracts, subject to
periodic prospective price redeterminations and modifications for changes in
circumstances. Under
the economics of the agreements with the U.S. government, each of the Military
Utility Privatization Subsidiaries should recover 100% of its investment in the
assets of the water and wastewater systems acquired at the time of execution of
the operation and maintenance agreements for each of the bases under the terms
of the applicable 50-year service contract. A capital investment recovery
charge in an amount equal to the payments due under the purchase obligation is
paid to the Military Utility Privatization Subsidiaries by the U.S. government
as a result of the purchase of the systems. Accordingly, Registrant recorded
the purchase price obligation as a liability with an offsetting receivable of
the same amount recorded against the liability, therefore, not impacting
Registrants financial position. The
amounts charged by the Military Utility Privatization Subsidiaries for water
and wastewater services at the respective military bases are based upon the
terms of the 50-year contracts between the Military Utility Privatization
Subsidiaries and the U.S. government. Under the terms of these agreements, the
Military Utility Privatization Subsidiaries agreed to operate and maintain the
water and/or wastewater systems at the respective bases for a monthly net fixed
price for operation and maintenance, and for an amount to cover renewals and
replacements for the first two years of the contract. Under the terms of each of these contracts,
prices are to be redetermined at the end of the initial two year period and
every three years thereafter. In addition, prices may be equitably adjusted for
changes in law and other circumstances.
These adjustments can be retrospective and/or prospective. The Military Utility Privatization
Subsidiaries have experienced delays in obtaining readjustment of prices and
equitable adjustments as required by the terms of these contracts. 105 Table
of Contents The fixed price for
operation and maintenance is recorded in revenues on a monthly basis as the
services are performed. The fixed price
received monthly for renewals and replacements on the water and wastewater
systems includes a profit that is recognized on the percentage-of-completion
method of accounting as the individual capital projects are completed. From time to time, the U.S. government may
modify the original contract to include new construction projects including
capital upgrades. However, earnings and
cash flows from modifications to the original 50-year contracts with the U.S.
government for new construction projects may or may not continue in future
periods. Each of the contracts may be subject to termination,
in whole or in part, prior to the end of the 50-year term for convenience of
the U.S. government or as a result of default or nonperformance by the Military
Utility Privatization Subsidiary performing the obligation under the
contract. In either event, each of the
Military Utility Privatization Subsidiaries so impacted should be entitled to
recover the remaining amount of its capital investment pursuant to the terms of
a termination settlement with the U.S. government at the time of termination as
provided in each of the contracts. The
asset, Costs and estimated earnings in excess of billings on uncompleted
contracts, represents revenues recognized in excess of amounts billed. The
liability, Billings in excess of costs and estimated earnings on uncompleted
contracts, represents billings in excess of revenues recognized. Costs and
estimated earnings on uncompleted contracts and amounts due from the U.S
government as of December31, 2009 and 2008 are as follows in thousands

1Allowance for doubtful accounts was
$67,000 and $121,000 as of December31, 2009 and 2008, respectively. In March2009, ONUS
filed a request for equitable adjustment related to a joint inventory report
which indicated the quantity of the Fort Bragg infrastructure to be greater
than what was assumed under the original 50-year contract. On January22, 2010, the U.S. government
approved a $65 million equitable adjustment regarding this inventory. As a
result of this contract modification, ASUS will record $31 million of revenues
and operating income during the first quarter of 2010 approximately $28
million of which is retroactive from the commencement of the contract in March2008
to December31, 2009. The
remaining $34 million is related to construction funds, which will be recorded
as deferred revenue in the first quarter of 2010 to be recognized in revenues
when the construction work is performed. In March2008,
FBWS filed an REA as a claim with the U.S. government as a result of a
determination that the infrastructure at Fort Bliss is substantially more than
originally estimated by the U.S. government as part of its solicitation for
this contract. In January2010,
FBWS and the U.S. government entered into a settlement agreement pursuant to
which the U.S. government agreed to pay FBWS retroactive operation and
maintenance management fees and retroactive renewal and replacement fees from
the contract commencement date, October1, 2004. The payment of these funds is subject to
availability of funding by the U.S. government.
As such, no amounts will be recorded until an executed contract
modification is received from the U.S. government. In addition, the settlement agreement provides
that the first and second price redeterminations for FBWS required by the
contract be waived. 106 Table of Contents Note 6 
Earnings Per Share and Capital Stock In
accordance with the accounting guidance for participating securities and
earnings per share EPS, Registrant uses the two-class method of computing
EPS. The two-class method is an earnings allocation formula that determines
EPS for each class of common stock and participating security. AWR has
participating securities related to stock options and restricted stock units
that earn dividend equivalents on an equal basis with AWRs Common Shares the Common
Shares that have been issued under AWRs 2000 and 2008 Employee Plans and the
2003 Directors Plan. In applying the two-class method, undistributed earnings
are allocated to both common shares and participating securities. The following
is a reconciliation of Registrants net income and weighted average Common
Shares outstanding for calculating basic net income per share

2In applying the treasury stock method of
reflecting the dilutive effect of outstanding stock-based compensation in the
calculation of diluted EPS, 669,503 stock options and 87,233 restricted stock
units at December31, 2009 were deemed to be outstanding in accordance
with accounting guidance on earnings per share. During the year ended December31,
2009, Registrant issued 68,352 Common Shares under the Registrants Common
Share Purchase and Dividend Reinvestment Plan DRP and the 2000 and 2008
Employee Plans for $1,823,000. There are 571,851 and 251,353
Common Shares authorized for issuance directly by AWR but unissued under the
DRP and the 401kPlan, respectively, at December31, 2009. Shares reserved for the 401kPlan are
in relation to AWRs matching contributions and
investment by participants.
During the year ended December31, 2008, Registrant issued 41,810
Common Shares under the Registrants DRP and the 2000 and 2008 Employee Plans
for $1,173,000. During the year ended December31,
2007, Registrant issued 22,649 Common Shares under the Registrants DRP for $876,000.
There were no Common Shares issued under Registrants 401kPlan in
2007. In addition, during the years
ended December31, 2009 2008 and 107 Table of Contents 2007, Registrant issued
12,922, 28,196 and 155,771 Common Shares for approximately $309,000, $690,000
and $3,911,000, respectively, as a result of the exercise of stock
options. During 2009, 2008 and 2007, no
cash proceeds received by AWR as a result of the exercise of stock options were
distributed to any subsidiaries of AWR. In May2009,
AWR completed a public offering of 1,150,000 shares of its Common Shares,
including 150,000 shares issued upon exercise of an option granted to the
underwriters to cover over-allotments, at a price to the public of $31 per
share. The net proceeds from the offering were $340 million, after deductions
of underwriting commissions and discounts, and direct legal and accounting
fees. The Company used the proceeds of the offering to repay short-term debt. During
the years ended December31, 2009, 2008 and 2007, Registrant repurchased
in the open market 14,018, 36,509 and 9,449, respectively, Common Shares
underthe Registrants DRP and 401kPlan, which were used to
satisfy the requirements of these plans and programs. AWR
has a registration statement on file with the SEC for issuance, from time to
time, of Common Shares, Preferred Shares and/or debt securities. As of December31, 2009, $115 million
was available for issuance of additional securities under this registration
statement. GSWCs
outstanding common shares are owned entirely by its parent, AWR. To the extent GSWC does not reimburse AWR for
stock-based compensation awarded under various stock compensation plans, such
amounts increase the value of GSWCs common shareholders equity. In August2008, the Board of Directors
approved the issuance of 12 additional GSWC common shares to AWR for $300
million. GSWC used the proceeds to pay down debt owed to AWR. As of December31, 2009, GSWC has $100
million available for issuance of debt or equity securities under a
Registration Statement filed with the SEC. Note 7 
Dividend Limitations On February1,
2010, AWR declared a regular quarterly dividend of $026
per Common Share. The dividend, totaling approximately $48 million,
was paid on March1,
2010 to common shareholders of record at the close of business on February12,
2010. In 2009, 2008 and 2007, AWR paid
quarterly dividends to shareholders, totaling approximately $181 million or
$1010 per share, $173 million or $1000 per share, and $163 million or
$0955 per share, respectively. AWRs
ability to pay cash dividends on its Common Shares outstanding depends
primarily upon cash flows from GSWC. GSWC
is subject to contractual restrictions on its ability to pay dividends. GSWCs
maximum ability to pay dividends is restricted by certain Note Agreements to
the sum of $210 million plus 100% of consolidated net income from various
dates plus the aggregate net cash proceeds received from capital stock
offerings or other instruments convertible into capital stock from various
dates. Under the most restrictive of the Note Agreements, $2733 million was
available to pay dividends to AWR as of December31, 2009. GSWC is also
prohibited from paying dividends if, after giving effect to the dividend, its
total indebtedness to capitalization ratio as defined would be more than
06667 to 1. Dividends in the amount of $194 million, $132 million, and $172
million were paid to AWR by GSWC in 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively. The ability of AWR, ASUS and GSWC to pay dividends is also restricted by
California law. Under restrictions of the California tests, approximately
$1364 million of retained earnings for AWR was available to pay dividends to
common shareholders at December31, 2009. Approximately $1357 million was
available from the retained earnings of GSWC to pay dividends to AWR. At December31,
2009, ASUS was not allowed to pay dividends to AWR under the California tests. CCWC
is subject to contractual restrictions on its ability to pay dividends. CCWCs
maximum ability to distribute dividends is limited to the maintenance of no
more than 55% debt in the capital structure for the quarter immediately
preceding the distribution. The ability of CCWC to pay dividends is also
restricted by Arizona law. Under restrictions of the Arizona tests,
approximately $22 million was available to pay dividends to AWR at December31,
2009. There were no dividends distributed from CCWC to AWR in 2009, 2008 or
2007. Note 8 
Bank Debt AWR
established a syndicated credit facility that expires in June2010. On August25,
2008, AWR amended its $85 million syndicated credit facility, to increase the
aggregate bank commitments by $30 million to $115 million. Under the terms of
this facility, either AWR or GSWC may obtain letters of credit for up to an
aggregate of $20 million. GSWC has obtained letters of credit, in the aggregate
amount of $111 million, including: ia letter of credit with a fee of
0625%, which expires October5, 2010, in the amount of $63 million, in
favor of a trustee with respect to the variable rate obligation issued by the
Three Valleys Municipal Water District; iiletters of credit with a fee
of 0625%, which expire October, 2010 in an aggregate amount of $600,000 as
security for the Companys business automobile insurance policy; iiia
letter of credit with a fee of 0625%, which expires October5, 2010 in an
amount of $585,000 as security for the purchase of power, and ivan
irrevocable letter of credit in the amount of $36 million, which expires October5,
2010, pursuant to a settlement 108 Table of Contents agreement with Edison to
cover Registrants commitment to pay the settlement amount. There were no
compensating balances required. GSWC has
also agreed to issue up to $72 million in letters of credit to the State of
California, Department of Public Health in connection with obtaining up to
$9,000,000 of funds under the California Safe Drinking Water State Revolving
Fund and the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 for the construction
of water meters in Sacramento County. Loans
can be obtained at the option of Registrant and bear interest at rates based on
credit ratings and Euro rate margins. At December31, 2009, $174 million
was outstanding under this facility, $76 million of which was used to fund
GSWCs operations, $94 million was used to fund ASUS activities, and $04
million was used to fund CCWC activities. Registrants

All of
the letters of credit are issued pursuant to the syndicated revolving credit
facility. The syndicated revolving credit facility contains restrictions on
prepayments, disposition of property, mergers, liens and negative pledges,
indebtedness and guaranty obligations, transactions with affiliates, minimum
interest coverage requirements, a maximum debt to capitalization ratio, and a minimum debt rating. Pursuant
to the credit agreement, AWR must maintain a minimum interest coverage ratio of
325 times interest expense, a maximum total funded debt ratio of 065 to 100
and a minimum debt rating of Baa3 or BBB-.
As of December31, 2009, 2008 and 2007, the Company was in
compliance with these requirements. Note 9 
Long-Term Debt Registrants
long-term debt consists primarily of Notes and Debentures. The Company
summarizes its long-term debt in the Statements of Capitalization. GSWC
does not currently have any outstanding mortgages or other encumbrances on its
properties. GSWCs
leases and other similar financial arrangements are not material. Private placement notes issued by
GSWC in the amount of $28 million contain restrictions on the payment of
dividends, minimum interest coverage requirements, a maximum debt to
capitalization ratio and a negative pledge. Pursuant to the terms of these
agreements, GSWC must maintain a minimum interest coverage ratio of two times
interest expense. On
March10, 2009 a senior note was issued by GSWC to CoBank, ACB CoBank. Under the
terms of this senior note, CoBank purchased a 67% Senior Note due March10,
2019 in the aggregate principal amount of $400 million from GSWC. This note
bears interest at the rate of 67%.
Under the terms of the note, GSWC shares in the profits of CoBank under
a patronage arrangement. If CoBank
continues to pay the current amount of patronage, the annual cost of the note
will be at or below 60%. In
addition, on October11,
2005, CoBank, ACB CoBank, purchased a 587% Senior Note due December20,
2028 in the aggregate principal amount of $40,000,000 from GSWC. Under the
terms of the two senior notes issued to CoBank, GSWC may not incur any
additional debt or pay any distributions to its shareholders if, after giving
effect thereto, it would have a debt to capitalization ratio in excess of
06667 to 1 or a debt to earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and
amortization EBITDA ratio of more than 8 to 1. Redemption
of certain long-term debt issues outstanding as of December31, 2009 and
2008 can be made in whole or in part at the option of GSWC subject to
redemption schedules embedded in the agreements particular to each issue. With
the exception of the 956% Notes and the Senior Notes issued to Co-Bank, the
redemption premiums in effect for 2009 and 2008 range up to 63% of par value.
The 956% Notes are subject to a make-whole premium based on 55 basis points
above the applicable Treasury Yield if redeemed prior to 2021. After 2021, the
maximum redemption premium is 3% of par value. The Senior Notes are subject to
a make-whole premium based on the difference between Co-Banks cost of funds on
the date of purchase and Co-Banks cost of funds on the date of redemption,
plus 05%. CCWC
has outstanding obligations under Industrial Development Authority Bonds IDA
Bonds. Substantially all of the
utility plant of CCWC is pledged as collateral for its IDA Bonds. The Bond
Agreement, among other things: irequires CCWC to maintain certain
financial ratios; iirestricts CCWCs ability to incur additional debt,
make liens, sell, lease or dispose of assets, merge with another corporation,
and pay dividends, and iiirequires CCWC to establish a debt service
reserve fund held in trust for future payments, which totaled approximately
$656,000 as of December31, 2009 and 2008. 109 Table of Contents AWR - Annual maturities of all long-term
debt, including capitalized leases, amount to approximately $695,000, $722,000 668,000, $3,668,000, $6,591,000 and $294,217,000 for each fiscal year through December31,
2014 and thereafter, respectively. GSWC - Annual maturities of all long-term
debt, including capitalized leases, amount to approximately $365,000, $377,000 303,000, $3,277,000, $6,187,000 and $290,077,000 for each fiscal year through December31,
2014 and thereafter, respectively. Note 10 Taxes on Income Registrant provides deferred income
taxes for temporary differences under the accounting guidance for income taxes
for certain transactions which are recognized for income tax purposes in a
period different from that in which they are reported in the financial
statements. The most significant items are the tax effects of accelerated
depreciation, the supply cost balancing accounts, and advances for, and
The accounting guidance for income taxes also requires that
rate-regulated enterprises record deferred income taxes for temporary
differences given flow-through treatment at the direction of a regulatory
commission. The resulting deferred tax assets and liabilities are recorded at
the expected cash flow to be reflected in future rates. Given that the CPUC has
consistently permitted the recovery of flowed-through tax effects, GSWC has
established regulatory liabilities and assets offsetting such deferred tax
assets and liabilities Note 2. Deferred investment tax credits are amortized
ratably to deferred tax expense over the lives of the property giving rise to
the credits. GSWC
is included in AWRs consolidated federal income tax and combined California
state franchise tax returns. Consistent with the method adopted for regulatory
purposes, GSWCs tax expense is computed as if it were autonomous and filed
separate returns. As a
regulated utility,GSWC treatscertain temporary differences as
flow-through adjustments in computingitsincome tax expense
consistent with the income tax approach approved by the CPUC for ratemaking
purposes. Flow-throughadjustments increase or decreasetax
expense in one period, with an offsettingincrease or decrease occurring
in another period. Giving effect to these temporary differences as
flow-through adjustments typicallyresults in a greater
variancebetweenthe effective tax rate and the statutory federal
income tax rate in any given periodthan would otherwise exist if GSWC
were not required toaccount for its income taxes as a regulated
enterprise. The
significant components of the deferred tax assets and liabilities as reflected
in the balance sheets at December31, 2009 and 2008 were

For both AWR and GSWC,
there was no portion of the unrecognized-tax-benefit balance at December31,
2009 that would affect the effective tax rate if recognized. Registrants policy is to
classify interest on income tax over/underpayments in interest income/expense
and penalties in other operating expenses. AWR and GSWC recognized $154,000
and $175,000, respectively, of interest income from taxing authorities during
the year ended December31, 2007. Registrant recognized the reversal of
$39,000 of previously imposed income-tax related penalties during the year
ended December31, 2007. At December31, 2008,
AWR and GSWC included $898,000 and $888,000, respectively, of net interest
receivables from taxing authorities in other assets all as noncurrent. AWR
and GSWC recognized $530,000 and $494,000, respectively, of interest income
from taxing authorities during the year ended December31, 2008. At December31,
2008, Registrant had no accruals for income-tax-related penalties. Registrant
did not recognize any income-tax related penalties during the year ended December31,
2008. At December31,
2009, AWR and GSWC included $918,000 and $974,000, respectively, of net
interest receivables from taxing authorities in other assets all as
noncurrent. AWR and GSWC recognized $101,000 and $86,000, respectively, of
interest income from taxing authorities during the year ended December31,
2009. At December31, 2009, AWR included $10,000 in other current
liabilities for income-tax-related penalties.
At December31, 2009, GSWC had no accruals for income-tax-related
penalties. AWR recognized $5,000 of net income-tax-related penalties during the
year ended December31, 2009. GSWC
did not recognize any income-tax-related penalties during the year ended December31,
2009. Registrant files federal
and various state income tax returns. The U.S. federal filings for the years
1997 through 1999 and 2002 came under examination during the first quarter of
2007 as a result of Registrant having filed an amended 2002 return during the
third quarter of 2006 for which Internal Revenue Service IRS and
Congressional Joint Committee of Taxation JCT reviews are required. The
2002 return was amended primarily as a result of the IRS consenting to
Registrants request for approval to change a tax accounting method Consent.
During the second quarter of 2008, the IRS issued a Revenue Agents Report RAR
in connection with its examination of the 2002 tax year which resulted in
Registrant recognizing certain tax benefits in accordance with accounting
guidance for tax uncertainties.Upon receiving the RAR, Registrant filed a
protest with the IRSs Office of Appeals in which it requested a conference to
address Registrants disagreement with certain of the Agents adjustments. In
connection with the Consent, Registrant filed amended 2003 and 2004 amended
returns during the third quarters of 2007 and 2008, respectively. The 2003 and
2004 returns came under IRS examination during the fourth quarter of 2008.
Registrant is unable to anticipate when the appeals process, IRS examinations
and JCT reviews will be concluded. In relation to the Consent, Registrants
total amount of unrecognized tax benefits could significantly increase or
decrease within twelve months of December31, 2009. An estimate of the
range of the reasonably possible change cannot be made at December31,
2009. Registrants 2006 through
2008 tax years also remain subject to examination by the IRS and its 2005
through 2008 tax years remain subject to examination by state taxing
authorities. Registrant has filed
protective refund claims with the applicable state taxing authority for the
2002 through 2004 tax years, also in connection with the Consent. 112 Table
of Contents Change
in State Tax Law On February20,
2009, Californias governor signed two bills into law that amended and added
several new provisions to Californias Revenue and Taxation Code. One of the provisions in these bills changed
the manner by which most taxpayers may compute the portion of their income
derived from multiple jurisdictions that is subject to California
taxation. During the first quarter of
2009, AWR applied the change in tax law resulting from enactment of the bills
based on its understanding of the legislatures intent, which is to permit
taxpayers to apply an alternative apportionment method commencing with the 2011
tax year. On October11, 2009,
Californias governor signed a bill into law that conformed the new provisions
language to the legislatures intent, consistent with AWRs understanding of
that intent. As a result of managements
intention to apply the alternative method, AWR adjusted its deferred tax
balances during the first quarter of 2009 to reflect the expected amount at
which it will realize its California deferred taxes consistent with the change
in tax law, as well as refining certain related estimates. This resulted in the recording of a benefit
of approximately $918,000 during the first quarter of 2009, without a material
change through the end of 2009. While the effect of the tax law change will
continue to affect AWRs state taxes, the future effects may be beneficial or
detrimental depending on a combination of the profitability of AWRs
non-California activities as well as the relative proportion of the factorsapplied
by its apportionment method.
Periodically, management will assess its intention to apply the
alternative method and will adjust its deferred tax balances accordingly. GSWC continues to compute
its state tax expense as if it were autonomous and not a member of AWRs
unitary group. This approach is
consistent with the methodology used for ratemaking purposes. Given that 100 percent of GSWCs activities
are conducted within California, GSWCs state tax expense does not reflect apportionment
of its income; consequently, the change in California law has had no effect
upon GSWCs state taxes. Note 11 
Employee Benefit Plans Pension
and Post-Retirement Medical Plans Registrant
maintains a pension plan the Pension Plan that provides eligible employees
those aged 21 and older, with at least one year of service monthly benefits
upon retirement based on average salaries and length of service. The
eligibility requirement to begin receiving these benefits is 5 years of vested
service. The normal retirement benefit is equal to 2% of the five highest
consecutive years average earnings multiplied by the number of years of
credited service, up to a maximum of 40 years, reduced by a percentage of
primary social security benefits. There is also an early retirement option;
however, for terminations on or after January1, 2004, the early
retirement provisions were amended to increase benefits under the Pension Plan
for employees who retire prior to age 65. The eligibility requirements for
early retirement are age 55 and 5 years of vested service. The Pension Plan
amendment increased Registrants annual pension cost by approximately 5%.
Annual contributions are made to the Pension Plan, which comply with the
funding requirements of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act ERISA. Registrant
also provides post-retirement medical benefits for all active employees hired
before Februaryof 1995, through a medical insurance plan. Eligible
employees, who retired prior to age 65, and/or their spouses, were able to
retain the benefits under the plan for active employees until reaching age 65.
Eligible employees upon reaching age 65, and those eligible employees retiring
at or after age 65, and/or their spouses, receive coverage through a Medicare
supplement insurance policy paid for by Registrant subject to an annual cap
limit. Registrants post-retirement medical plan does not provide prescription
drug benefits to Medicare-eligible employees and is not affected by the
Medicare Prescription Drug Improvement and Modernization Act of 2003. At December31,
2009, Registrant had 923 participants in the Pension Plan of which 527 were
active, 214 were retired and 182 were disabled.
Approximately 83 active employees are subject to collective bargaining
arrangements. Also, at December31,
2009, Registrant had 374 participants in the post-retirement medical plan of
which 219 were active, 14 were disabled and 141 were retired. Average active participant age for the
pension plan was 47 years. In accordance with the guidance
for accounting for the effects of certain types of regulation, Registrant has
established a regulatory asset for underfunded positions of defined benefit
post-retirement plans, including pension plans that are expected to be
recovered through rates in future periods. The changes in actuarial gains and
losses, prior service costs and transition assets or obligations pertaining to
the regulatory asset are recognized as an adjustment to the regulatory asset
account as these amounts are recognized as components of net periodic pension
costs each year. Decreases in the fair
market value of plan assets during 2008 resulted in an increase to the
regulatory asset accounts with a corresponding increase to the pension
liability accounts. However, during 2009
the fair value of the pension plan assets increased by approximately 264%
since December31, 2008. 113 Table

70% for union plan,
42% for non-union, net of income taxes in 2009, 2008 and 2007. Plan Funded Status Registrants pension and
post-retirement plans were underfunded at December31, 2009 and 2008. However, there was a significant increase in
the underfunded status of the Pension Plan during 2008. This was partially due to an increase in the
projected benefit obligation in 2008 caused primarily from a decrease in the
discount rate from 655% to 615% and also due to the passage of time and the
use of updated mortality tables. The
underfunded status also increased due to a significant decrease in the fair
value of the plan assets in 2008.
Registrants market related value of plan assets is equal to the fair
value of plan assets. Volatile market conditions have affected the value of AWRs
trust established to fund its future long-term pension benefits. The market
value of the investments within the plan trust declined by approximately 25%
during the year ended December31, 2008. However, the fair value of the pension
plan assets increased by approximately 264% since December31, 2008. These benefit plan assets and related
obligations are remeasured annually using a December31 measurement date.
Changes in the plans funded status will affect the assets and liabilities
recorded on the balance sheet in accordance with accounting guidance on employers
accounting for defined benefit pension and other post-retirement plans. Due to Registrants regulatory recovery
treatment, the recognition of the funded status is offset by a regulatory asset
pursuant to guidance on accounting for the effects of certain types of regulation. 115 Table
of Contents Plan Assets The assets of the pension
and post-retirement medical plans are managed by a third party trustee. The
investment policy allocation of the assets in the trust was approved by
Registrants Administrative Committee the Committee for the Pension and
Retiree Medical Funds, which has oversight responsibility for all retirement
plans. The primary objectives underlying the investment of the pension
and post-retirement plan assets are: iattempt to maintain a fully
funded status with a cushion for unexpected developments, possible future
increases in expense levels, and/or a reduction in the expected return on
investments; iiseek to earn long-term returns that compare favorably to
appropriate market indexes, peer group universes and the policy asset
allocation index; iiiseek to provide sufficient liquidity to pay
current benefits and expenses; ivattempt to limit risk exposure through
prudent diversification, and vseek to limit costs of administering and
managing the plans. The Committee recognizes
that risk and volatility are present to some degree with all types of
investments. High levels of risk are
avoided through diversification by asset class, style of each investment
manager, and sector and industry limits.
Investment managers are retained to manage a pool of assets and allocate
funds in order to achieve an appropriate, diversified, and balanced asset mix.
The Committees strategy balances the requirement to maximize returns using
potentially higher return generating assets, such as equity securities, with
the need to control the risk versus the benefit obligations with less volatile
assets, such as fixed income securities. The Committee approves
the target asset allocations. Registrants
pension and post-retirement plan weighted-average asset allocations at December31,
2009 and 2008, by asset category are as follows

116 Table
of Contents As previously discussed
in Note 4, accounting guidance for fair value measurements establishes a
framework for measuring fair value and requires fair value measurements to be
classified and disclosed in one of three levels. As required by the accounting
guidance, assets and liabilities are classified in their entirety based on the
lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement. All equity investments in the pension and
post-retirement plans are Level1 investments in mutual funds. The fixed income category includes corporate
bonds and notes. The majority of fixed income investments ranges in maturities
from less than one to twenty years. The
fair values of these investments are based on quoted market prices in active
markets. The following tables set

Plan Contributions During 2009, Registrant
contributed $86 million and $570,000 to its pension and post-retirement
medical plans, respectively. Registrant currently expects to contribute $86
million and $575,000 to its pension and post-retirement medical plans in 2010,
respectively. In establishing the
contribution amount, Registrant is considering the potential impact of funding rulechanges
under the Pension Protection Act of 2006 which establishes new minimum funding
standards and prohibits plans underfunded by more than 20% from providing lump
sum distributions and adopting amendments that increase plan liabilities. Benefit Payments Registrants estimated future benefit payments at December31, 2009 for
the next ten years are as follows in thousands

of Contents Assumptions Certain actuarial
assumptions, such as the discount rate, long-term rate of return on plan assets
and the healthcare cost trend rate have a significant effect on the amounts
reported for net periodic benefit cost as well as the related benefit
obligation amounts. Discount
Rate The
assumed discount rate for pension and post-retirement medical plans reflects
the market rates for high-quality corporate bonds currently available.
Registrants discount rates were determined by considering the average of
pension yield curves constructed of a large population of high quality
corporate bonds. The resulting discount rate reflects the matching of plan
liability cash flows to the yield curves. Expected
Long-Term Rate of Return on Assets The long-term rate of return on plan assets represents
an estimate of long-term returns on an investment portfolio consisting of a
mixture of equities, fixed income, and other investments. To develop the
expected long-term rate of return on assets assumption for the pension plan,
Registrant considered the historical returns and the future expectations for
returns for each asset class, as well as the target asset allocation of the
pension portfolio. This resulted in the selection of the 70% long-term rate of
return on assets assumption for the Pension Plan. Registrants policy is to
fund the medical benefit trusts based on actuarially determined amounts as
allowed in rates. Registrant may invest such funds in qualified instruments to
achieve the desired return objective and minimize recovery through rates. Registrant has invested the funds in the
post-retirement trusts that will achieve a desired return and minimize amounts
necessary to recover through rates. The mix is expected to provide for a return
on assets similar to the Pension Plan and to achieve Registrants targeted
allocation. This resulted in the selection of the 70% long-term rate of return
on assets assumption for the union plan and 420% net of income taxes for the
non-union plan. Healthcare Cost Trend Rate 
A sliding scale for assumed health care cost increases was used for the periods
presented. In 2009, health care cost
increases started at 80% grading down to 50% in 10 years for those under age
65, and at 90% grading down to 50% in 10 years for those 65 and over. In 2008 and 2007, health care cost increases
started at 85% grading down to 50% in 10 years for those under age 65, and at
95% grading down to 50% in 10 years for 65 and over. Assumed health care cost trend
rates have a significant effect on the amounts reported for the health care
plans. A one-percentage-point change in assumed health care cost trend rates
would have the following effects

Supplemental
Executive Retirement Plan Registrant has a supplemental executive retirement
plan SERP that provides additional retirement benefits to certain key
employees and officers of the Company by making up benefits, which are limited
by Sections 415 and 401a17 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as
amended, and certain additional benefits.
In May2009, the Board of Directors approved the establishment of a
Rabbi Trust created for the SERP plan.
An amount of $842,000 was deposited in the Rabbi Trust during the year
ended December31, 2009, which has been included in Registrants other
property and investments. Assets in a
Rabbi Trust can be subject to the claims of creditors; therefore, they are not
considered as an asset for purposes of computing the SERPs funded status. In September2008,
GSWC entered into a Resignation Agreement and General Release of Claims with a
former officer. In connection with the
resignation, GSWC agreed to pay amounts that the former officer would have been
entitled to receive under the Companys SERP and Pension Plans if, as of the
effective date of resignation, the former officer had been fully vested in both
Plans, had earned two years of credited service for benefit purposes under the
Plans and had retired with deferred benefits under the Plans, payable in
monthly installments commencing at the age of 65. This agreement resulted in a special
termination benefit of $149,000 for the year ended December31, 2008. 118 Table

401kInvestment
Incentive Program Registrant has a 401kInvestment
Incentive Program under which employees may invest a percentage of their pay,
up to a maximum investment prescribed by law, in an investment program managed
by an outside investment manager. Registrants cash contributions to the 401kare
based upon a percentage of individual employee contributions and totaled $18
million, $15 million and $13 million for 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively. 120 Table
of Contents Note 12 Stock Compensation
Plans Summary
Description of Stock Incentive Plans AWR currently has three primary stock incentive plans: the
2000 Employee Plan and the 2008 Employee Plan for employees, and the 2003
Directors Plan for directors, each more fully described below. 2000 Employee Plan  AWR adopted the 2000 Employee Plan at the annual meeting of
shareholders in 2000 to provide stock-based incentive awards in the form of
stock options, and restricted stock to employees as a means of promoting the
success of the Company by attracting, retaining and more fully aligning the
interests of employees with those of shareholders generally. The 2000 Employee
Plan was amended in January2006 to also permit the grant of restricted
stock units. The 2000 Employee Plan is administered by the Compensation
Committee of the Board of Directors the Committee. For stock options, the Committee determined, among other
things, the date of grant, the form, term, option exercise price, vesting and
exercise terms of each option. Stock options granted by AWR have been in the
form of nonqualified stock options, expire ten years from the date of grant,
vest over a period of three years and are subject to earlier termination as
provided in the form of option agreement approved by the Committee. The option
price per share was determined by the Committee at the time of grant, but was
not be less than 100% of the fair market value of Common Shares on the date of
grant. For restricted stock, the Committee determined, among other
things, the dividend, voting and other rights prior to vesting and the
restrictions which may be based on performance criteria, passage of time or
other factors imposed on the shares. For restricted stock units, the Committee
determined, among other things, the vesting terms and form of pay-out. Each
employee who received a grant of a restricted stock unit was entitled to
dividend equivalent rights in the form of additional restricted stock units
until vesting of the restricted stock units. The restricted stock units are a
non-voting unit of measurement relative to one Common Share. There were 1,050,000 Common Shares reserved for issuance
under the 2000 Employee Stock Plan, 136,832 of which remain available for
awards as of December31, 2009. The
Board of Directors and shareholders approved an amendment to the 2000 Employee
Plan at the annual meeting of shareholders in May2008 to prohibit the
award of additional awards, other than pursuant to dividend equivalent rights
to AWRs executive officers for the restricted stock unit awards granted prior
to March31, 2008. 2008
Employee Plan  AWR
adopted the 2008 Employee Plan at the annual meeting of shareholders in May2008
in order to
enable the Committee to continue to make stock awards to eligible employees in
the same manner as under the 2000 Employee Plan. All new awards since April1, 2008
have been and will be granted under the 2008 Employee Plan. There were
1,100,000 Common Shares reserved for issuance under the 2008 Employee Plan, of
which 899,841 remain available for awards as of December31, 2009. 2003 Directors Plan  On May20, 2003, the Board of Directors adopted the
2003 Directors Plan, subject to shareholder approval. The shareholders approved
the 2003 Directors Plan at the May2004 Annual Meeting. The 2003 Directors
Plan provides the non-employee directors with supplemental stock-based
compensation and encourages them to increase their stock ownership in AWR.
There were 250,000 Common Shares reserved for issuance under the 2003 Directors
Plan, of which 139,622 remain available for awards as of December31,
2009. Pursuant to the 2003 Directors
Plan, non-employee directors received grants of options to purchase 1,000
common shares at AWRs annual meetings in 2003 and 2004 and 3,000 shares common
shares at AWRs annual meetings in 2005 and 2006. Non-employee directors received restricted stock units equal
to the annual retainer in lieu of stock options at the 2007 and 2008 annual
meetings of shareholders. In addition,
each non-employee director with no more than ten years of service with AWR
received additional restricted stock units at the annual meetings in 2007 and
2008 in an amount equal to the then current annual retainer payable by AWR to
each non-employee director divided by the fair market value of Common Shares on
the last trading day prior to the annual meeting. Commencing with AWRs 2009 annual meeting, all directors are
entitled to receive restricted stock units equal to two times the annual
retainer, regardless of their number of years of service on the board. All
stock options and restricted stock units have been granted with dividend
equivalent rights payable in the form of additional restricted stock units. The stock options granted under the 2003 Directors
Plan are 10-year nonqualified stock options. The exercise price of the stock
options must be 100% of the fair market value of Common Shares on the date of
grant. Stock options granted under the 2003 Directors Plan are fully vested and
exercisable upon the date of grant. Restricted stock units with respect to dividend
equivalent rights on stock options credited to the non-employee director are
payable in Common Shares on the 121 Table
of Contents earlier of the date on
which the stock option is exercised and three years from the date of grant of
the stock option. Restricted stock units granted at each annual meeting of
shareholders and restricted stock units with respect to dividend equivalent
rights with respect thereto are payable solely in Common Shares on the date that
the participant terminates service as a director. Restricted stock units credited to each non-employee directors account are at
all times fully vested and non-forfeitable. Effect of Stock-Based Compensation on Net Income The
Registrant recognizes compensation expense related to the fair value of
stock-based compensation awards. Share-based compensation cost is measured by
the Registrant at the grant date, based on the calculated fair value of the
award, and is recognized as an expense over the employees requisite service
period generally the vesting period of the equity grant. The following table presents share-based
compensation expenses for the years ended December31, 2009, 2008 and
2007. These expenses are included in
administrative and general expenses in AWR and GSWCs statements of income
resulting from stock options, restricted stock and restricted stock units

1 A net income tax benefit is not reflected for GSWC, as
its tax benefit recognition was fully offset by the recognition of a regulatory
liability as a result of the flow-through treatment of its compensatory
expenses for regulatory purposes. Equity-based compensation cost, capitalized as part of
utility plant for the year ended December31, 2009 was $226,000 and
$225,000, respectively, for AWR and GSWC. For the year ended December31,
2008, the equity-based compensation cost, capitalized as part of utility plant
was $242,000 and $241,000, respectively, for both AWR and GSWC. For the year ended December31, 2007,
the equity-based compensation cost, capitalized as part of utility plant was
$185,000 and $211,000, respectively, for both AWR and GSWC. For the year ended December31, 2007,
dividend equivalent rights paid in cash of $115,000 and $103,000 for AWR and
GSWC, respectively, were recognized as a reduction to retained earnings, net of
tax benefit of approximately $50,000 and $45,000, respectively. In 2009 and 2008, there were no similar cash
disbursements in dividend equivalent rights. Registrant amortizes stock-based compensation over the requisite vesting period for the entire award. Options issued pursuant to the 2000 Employee Plan and the 2008 Employee Plan vest and are exercisable in installments of 33% the first two years and 34% in the third year, starting one year from the date of the grant and expire 10 years from the date of the grant.
Valuation of Stock Options Registrant estimated the fair value of stock options
granted during the years ended December31, 2009, 2008 and 2007 using the
Black-Scholes valuation model. Key input assumptions used to estimate the fair
value of stock options include the exercise price of the award, the expected
option term, the expected volatility of the Registrants stock over the options
expected term, the risk-free interest rate over the options expected term, and
the Registrants expected annual dividend yield. Registrant believes that the
valuation technique and the approach utilized to develop the underlying
assumptions are appropriate in calculating the fair values of Registrants
stock options granted during the years ended December31, 2009, 2008 and
2007. Estimates of fair value are not intended to predict actual future events
or the value ultimately realized by persons who receive equity awards. The fair
value of stock units and restricted stock was determined based on the closing
trading price of Common Shares on the grant date. 122 Table

Summary of key assumptions The risk-free interest rate for
periods equal to the expected term of the share option was based on the U.S.Treasury
yield curve in effect at the time of grant. Dividend yield reflects the current
dividend rate at the date of grant. The stock volatility for each grant is
measured using the weighted average of historical monthly and daily price
changes of the Common Shares over the most recent period equal to the expected
option life of the grant. For the year ended December31, 2007, the option
term on the employee grants was determined using the simplified method for
estimating expected option life, which qualify as plain-vanilla options and
is derived from the average midpoint between vesting and the contractual term,
as described in SECs accounting bulletin on share-based payment. The options granted to directors did not
qualify as plain-vanilla and, therefore, the option term was determined using
historical data. Effective January1,
2008, Registrant adopted further SEC guidance on share-based payment which requires Registrant to develop expected option terms
by reviewing detailed external information about employee exercise
behavior. The simplified method is no
longer being permitted if such information is available. Accounting guidance also requires entities to
estimate the number of forfeitures expected to occur and record expense based
upon the number of awards expected to vest. Stock Options  A

The weighted-average grant-date fair value of options granted by
Registrant during the year ended December31, 2009 was $633. The aggregate intrinsic value in the table
above represents the total pretax intrinsic value i.e., the difference between
the closing price of the Common Shares on the last trading day of the 2009
calendar year and the exercise price, times the number of shares that would
have been received by the option holders had all option holders exercised their
option on December31, 2009. This
amount changes if the fair market value of the Common Shares changes. The total
intrinsic value of options exercised during the years ended December31,
2009, 2008 and 2007 was approximately $138,000, $417,000, and $2,173,000,
respectively. During the years ended December31, 2009, 2008 and 2007, Registrant
received approximately $309,000, $690,000, and $3,911,000, respectively, in
cash proceeds from the exercise of its stock options and realized approximately
$80,000, $150,000, and $835,000, respectively, of tax benefit for the tax
deduction from awards exercised. As of December31, 2009, approximately
$686,000 of total unrecognized compensation cost related to outstanding stock
options is expected to be recognized over a remaining period ranging from 013
to 282 years. Restricted Stock and Stock

Commitments Registrants
rate-regulated utility operations are engaged in supplying water and electric
service to the public. Registrant is required to provide service and grant
credit to customers within its defined service areas. Although Registrant has a
diversified base of residential, industrial and other customers, revenues
derived from commercial and residential water customers accounted for
approximately 90% of total water revenues in 2009, which is about the same
percentage as in 2008 and 2007. Registrant faces additional risks associated
with weather conditions, adequacy and quality of water supplies, regulatory
decisions, pronouncements and laws, water-related litigation, and general
business conditions. GSWCs
Water Supply GSWC obtains its water supply from its operating wells
and purchases from others, principally member agencies of the Metropolitan
Water District of Southern California MWD. The MWD is a public agency and
quasi-municipal corporation created in 1928 by a vote of the electorates of
several Southern California cities. MWDs primary purpose was and is to provide
a supplemental supply of water for domestic and municipal uses and purposes at
wholesale rates to its member public agencies.
There are 26 member public agencies of MWD, consisting of 14 cities, 11
municipal water districts, and one county water authority. Registrant has 58 connections to MWDs water
distribution facilities and those of other member water agencies. Its combined
MWD water purchases through 6 separate MWD member agencies total more than
75,000 acre feet annually. MWDs
principal sources of water are the State Water Project and the Colorado River. GSWC has contracts with MWD member
agencies, various governmental entities and other parties to purchase water or
water rights for an aggregate amount of $692 million as of December31,
2009 under purchase agreements with governmental entities. Contracts for $629 million expire on an
agreement by agreement basis commencing in 2011 through 2013. Each of these contracts contain minimum take or pay
provisions with the terms and conditions varying under each contract. GSWC plans
to continue to purchase and use at least the minimum water requirement under
the respective contracts in the future. The amount of the remaining obligations
was estimated based on current rates per acre-foot. These rates may be changed
annually. Also included in the $692 million is a remaining commitment of $24
million under an agreement with the City of Claremont the City to lease
water rights that were ascribed to the City as part of the Six Basins
adjudication. The initial term of the agreement expires in 2028. GSWC can
exercise an option to renew this agreement for 10 additional years. The
remaining amount of $39 million are commitments for purchased water with
various third parties which expire commencing in 2013 through 2038. GSWCs
estimated future minimum payments under these purchased water supply
commitments at December31, 2009 are as follows, in thousands

CCWCs
Water Supply CCWC
obtains its water supply from two operating wells and from Colorado River water
delivered by the Central Arizona Project CAP. The majority of CCWCs water
supply is obtained from its CAP allocation and well water is used for peaking
capacity in excess of treatment plant capability, during treatment plant
shutdown, and to keep the well system in optimal operating condition. CCWC has an assured water supply designation, by
decision and order of the Arizona Department of Water Resources stating that
CCWC has demonstrated the physical, legal and continuous availability of CAP
water and groundwater, in an aggregate volume of 11,759 acre-feet per year for
a minimum of 100 years. The 11,759 acre-feet is comprised of existing CAP
allocation of 8,909 acre-feet per year, 350 acre-feet per year groundwater
allowance, incidental recharge credits of 500 acre-feet per year, and a Central
Arizona Groundwater Replenishment District contract of 2,000 acre-feet per
year. 124 Table
of Contents CCWC has a long-term water supply contract with the
Central Arizona Conservation District the District through September2033,
and is entitled to take 8,909 acre-feet of water per year from CAP. In connection with this long-term water
supply contract, CCWC pays an annual charge based on its full allocation
regardless of amount of water delivered.
The rate for such charge is set by the District and is subject to annual
increases. Based on the Districts published new rate schedules, the estimated
remaining commitment under this contract is $240,000 as of December31,
2009. Notwithstanding an assured water supply designation,
CCWCs water supply may be subject to interruption or reduction, in particular
owing to interruption or reduction of CAP water. In the event of interruption
or reduction of CAP water, CCWC can currently rely on its well water supplies
for short-term periods. However, in any event, the quantity of water CCWC
supplies to some or all of its customers may be interrupted or curtailed,
pursuant to the provisions of its tariffs. CCWC also has the physical
capability to deliver water far in excess of that which is currently accounted
for in CCWCs assured water supply account. Bear
Valley Electric GSWC had a contract with Morgan Stanley Capital Group
for physical delivery of 15 MWs of power at $7465 per Mwh through the
expiration of the contract on December31, 2008. In October2008, GSWC executed a new purchased
power contract with Shell Energy North America US, LP Shell that began
providing power to BVES effective January1, 2009 at a fixed cost over
three to five year terms for different amounts of power over different time
periods under the contract. The new contract is subject to CPUC approval. The main product under the new contract with
Shell provides for 13 MWs of electric energy at an average fixed price of
$6715 per MWh beginning January1, 2009 through November30, 2013.
During the winter peak, another product under the Shell contract provides for 7
MWs of electric energy at an average fixed price of $6640 per MWh beginning January1,
2009 through December31, 2011.
GSWCs total commitment under this new agreement amounts to $409
million, of which $329 million remains outstanding as of December31,
2009. The average minimum load at GSWCs
BVES customer service area has been approximately 12 MWs. The average winter
load has been 18 MWs with a winter peak of 39 MWs when the snowmaking machines
at the ski resorts are operating. GSWC owns a natural gas-fueled 84 MW
generation facility that went on line during Augustof 2004, and assists
GSWC in controlling its spot market purchase prices. On July17, 2002,
the CPUC approved a settlement agreement reached among GSWC, all intervening
parties and the then Office of Ratepayer Advocates of the CPUC, which permits
GSWC to recover $77 per MWh of purchased power costs through rates. GSWC is
only allowed to include up to a weighted annual energy purchase cost of $77 per
MWh each year through August2011, in its balancing account. To the extent
GSWCs actual average annual weighted cost for purchased power is less than $77
per MWh, the differential recovers
amounts included in the electric supply balancing account. Conversely, to the
extent that actual average annual weighted costs for power purchased exceed the
$77 per MWh amount, GSWC will not be able to include these amounts in its
balancing account and such amounts will be expensed. In 2007, approximately
$29,000 was expensed. There was no expense in 2009 or 2008 over the $77 per MWh
cap. As a result of the settlement, GSWC is also permitted to collect a
surcharge of 22 per kilowatt hour from its customers for up to ten years
commencing August2001 to allow GSWC an opportunity to collect amounts
remaining in its electric cost balancing account, with interest, incurred by
GSWC. The ability of GSWC to deliver
purchased power to customers in its BVES service area is limited by the ability
of the transmission facilities owned by Edison to transmit this power. GSWC
filed a lawsuit against Edison in 2000 for breach of contract as a result of
delays in upgrading these transmission facilities as well as for other reasons.
As described in Note 2, GSWC and Edison agreed to settle this suit. Under the
terms of the agreement, GSWC agreed to pay a $5 million project abandonment fee
to Edison and made an initial lump sum payment of $14 million to Edison during
the first quarter of 2004. GSWC agreed to pay Edison an additional $36 million
over a 15-year term through 180 equal monthly payments of $38,137. All payments
made to Edison under this agreement are included in the electric supply cost
balancing account. 125 Table of Contents Operating Leases Registrant leases equipment and facilities primarily for
its Regional and District offices under non-cancelable operating leases with
varying terms, provisions, and expiration dates. Rent expense for leases that contain
scheduled rent increases are recorded on a straight-line basis. During 2009,
2008 and 2007, Registrants consolidated rent expense was approximately
$3,268,000, $3,371,000, and $2,912,000, respectively. Registrants future

Quality-Related Litigation Perchlorate and/or Volatile Organic Compounds VOC
have been detected in five wells servicing GSWCs South San Gabriel System.
GSWC filed suit in federal court, along with two other affected water purveyors
and the San Gabriel Basin Water Quality Authority WQA, against some of
those allegedly responsible for the contamination of two of these wells. Some
of the other potential defendants settled with GSWC, other water purveyors and
the WQA the Water Entities, on VOC related issues prior to the filing of
the lawsuit. In response to the filing of the lawsuit, the Potentially
Responsible Party PRP defendants filed motions to dismiss the suit or
strike certain portions of the suit. The judge issued a ruling on April1,
2003 granting in part and denying in part the PRPs motions. A key ruling of
the court was that the water purveyors, including GSWC, by virtue of their
ownership of wells contaminated with hazardous chemicals are themselves PRPs
under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act
CERCLA. GSWC has, pursuant to permission of the court, amended
its suit to claim certain affirmative defenses as an innocent party under
CERCLA. Registrant is presently unable to predict the outcome of this ruling on
its ability to fully recover from the PRPs future costs associated with the
treatment of these wells. In this same suit, the PRPs have filed
cross-complaints against the Water Entities, the MWD, the Main San Gabriel
Basin Watermaster and others on the theory that they arranged for and did
transport contaminated water into the Main San Gabriel Basin for use by GSWC
and the other two affected water purveyors and for other related claims. On August29, 2003, the US Environmental
Protection Agency EPA issued Unilateral Administrative Orders UAO
against 41 parties deemed responsible for polluting the groundwater in that
portion of the San Gabriel Valley from which the two impacted GSWC wells draw water.
GSWC was not named as a party to the UAO. The UAO requires that these parties
remediate the contamination. The judge in the lawsuit has appointed a special
master to oversee mandatory settlement discussions between the PRPs and the
Water Entities. EPA is also conducting settlement discussions with several PRPs
regarding the UAO. The Water Entities and EPA are working to coordinate their
settlement discussions under the special master in order to arrive at a
complete resolution of all issues affecting the lawsuit and the UAO.
Settlements have been reached between WQA and some PRPs. Settlements with a
number of other PRPs are being finalized; however, Registrant is presently
unable to predict the ultimate outcome of these settlement discussions. Condemnation of
Properties The laws of the State of California and the State of
Arizona provide for the acquisition of public utility property by governmental
agencies through their power of eminent domain, also known as condemnation,
where doing so is necessary and in the public interest. In addition, however,
the laws of California provide: ithat the owner of utility property may
contest whether the condemnation is actually necessary and in the public
interest, and iithat the owner is entitled to receive the fair market
value of its property if the property is ultimately taken. Although the City of Claremont, California the City
located in GSWCs Region III, has not initiated the formal condemnation process
pursuant to California law, the City has expressed various concerns to GSWC
about the rates charged by GSWC and the effectiveness of the CPUCs
rate-setting procedures. In 2004, the City hired consultants to perform an 126 Table
of Contents appraisal of the value of the Claremont water system. However, in recent meetings held in 2009, the
Claremont City Council stated that it will not actively pursue its activities
related to a potential condemnation of the Claremont water system at the
present time. The Town of Apple Valley
the Town abandoned its activities related to a potential condemnation of
GSWCs water system serving the Town in 2007. However, in April2009, the
Town announced that it will again consider a potential takeover of GSWCs Apple
Valley water systems as well as those of another privately-owned utility. The Town Council has directed staff to
research the costs associated with updating the previously prepared financial
feasibility study for the acquisition of GSWCs water system. The Stanton City Council recently decided to solicit
proposals to identify the process, potential costs and legal issues for
acquiring the water system owned by GSWC. Except for the Cities of
Claremont and Stanton and the Town of Apple Valley, Registrant has not been,
within the last three years, involved in activities related to the potential
condemnation of any of its water customer service areas or in its BVES customer
service area. No formal condemnation proceedings have been filed against any of
the Registrants service areas during the past three years. Santa Maria
Groundwater Basin Adjudication In
1997, the Santa Maria Valley Water Conservation District plaintiff filed a
lawsuit against multiple defendants, including GSWC, the City of Santa Maria,
and several other public water purveyors. The plaintiffs lawsuit sought an
adjudication of the Santa Maria Groundwater Basin the Basin. A stipulated
settlement of the lawsuit has been reached, subject to CPUC approval. The settlement, among other things, if
approved by the CPUC, would preserve GSWCs historical pumping rights and
secure supplemental water rights for use in case of drought or other reductions
in the natural yield of the Basin. GSWC, under the stipulation, has a right to
10,000 acre-feet of groundwater replenishment provided by the Twitchell
Project, a storage and flood control reservoir project operated by the Santa
Maria Valley Conservation District. A monitoring and annual reporting
program has been established to allow the parties to responsibly manage the
Basin and to respond to shortage conditions. If severe water shortage
conditions are found over a period of five years, the management area engineerwill
makefindings and recommendations to alleviate such
shortages.In the unlikely case that the Basin experiences severe
shortage conditions, thecourt has the authority to limitGSWCs
groundwater productionto10,248 acre-feet per year, based on developed
waterin the Basin. On
February11, 2008, the court issued its final judgment, which approves and
incorporates the stipulation. The judgment awards GSWC prescriptive
rights to groundwater against the non-stipulating parties. In addition,
the judgment grants GSWC the right to use the Basin for temporary storage and
to recapture 45 percentof the return flows that are generated from its
importation of State Water Project water. Pursuant to this judgment, the
court retains jurisdiction over all of the parties to make supplemental orders
or to amend the judgment as necessary.
On March20, 2008, the non-stipulating parties filed notices of
appeal. Registrant is unable to predict
the outcome of the appeal. Aerojet Note Receivable Pursuant to the settlement
agreement with Aerojet discussed in Note 2, GSWC has a note receivable, plus
accrued interest, guaranteed by Aerojet.
This note, plus interest on the unpaid balance, is scheduled to be paid
by Aerojet in installments over five years beginning in December2009. In January2009, Moodys Investors
Service downgraded the corporate family ratings of GenCorp Inc., Aerojets
parent, to B3 from B2 and its
probability of default rating to Caa1 from B2.
Obligations rated B by Moodys are considered speculative by Moodys
and are, in Moodys view, subject to high credit risk and have generally poor
credit quality. Obligations rated Caa1
are judged by Moodys to be of poor credit standing and are, in Moodys view,
subject to very high credit risk and have extremely poor credit quality. In January2010, Standard
Poors SP upgraded Gen Corp.s credit rating to B- from CCC+ with a
stable outlook. This is a non-investment
grade rating assigned by SP to companies whose financial situation varies. In
December2009, the Company received from GenCorp Inc. $26 million,
including interest, as payment of the first annual installment under the terms of the 2004
settlement agreement. As of December31,
2009, the unpaid portion of the note receivable is $82 million, comprised of
$64 million in principal and $18 million in accrued interest. At this time, management believes the note
receivable from Aerojet is fully collectible and has not provided a reserve for
uncollectible amounts as of December31, 2009. GSWC will continue to assess recoverability
of this note receivable. 127 Table
of Contents Environmental
Clean-Up and Remediation Chadron Plant: GSWC has been involved in environmental
remediation and clean-up at a plant site Chadron Plant that contained an
underground storage tank which was used to store gasoline for its vehicles.
This tank was removed from the ground in July1990 along with the
dispenser and ancillary piping. Since then, GSWC has been involved in various
remediation activities at this site.
Recent site assessments have been conducted which showed that there was more gasoline at higher
concentrations spread over a larger area than previously measured. Remediation is estimated to take two more years, followed by at least one
year of monitoring and reporting. As of December31,
2009, the total spent to clean-up and remediate GSWCs plant facility is
approximately $24 million, of which $15million has been paid by the
State of California Underground Storage Tank Fund. Amounts paid by GSWC have
been included in rate-base and approved by the CPUC for recovery. As of December31, 2009, GSWC has an accrued liability for the
estimated additional cost of $12 million to complete the clean-up at the site.
The ultimate cost may vary as there are many unknowns in remediation of
underground gasoline spills and this is an estimate based on currently
available information. Management also believes it is probable that the
estimated additional costs will be approved in rate base by the CPUC. Ballona Plant: During the first quarter of 2008,
hydrocarbon contaminated soil was found at a plant site Ballona Plant
located in GSWCs Southwest customer service area where an abandoned water tank
was demolished. An initial investigation
and characterization of the contaminated area has been conducted. The investigation report indicates that
contamination levels are below normal cleanup goals. GSWC submitted a clean-up action plan to the
local Certified Unified Program Agency, which approved the clean-up plan. GSWC has contracted the clean-up work to be
performed, which is currently estimated to be approximately $110,000. Historically, the cost for this type of
cleanup has been included in rates as approved by the CPUC. Contracted
Services On March4, 2008,
ASUS received a letter from the U.S. Army demanding payment of approximately
$75 million in liquidated damages for alleged failure at FBWS to make a good
faith effort to achieve its small business subcontracting goals. On February2, 2009, FBWS and the U.S.
government entered into a Settlement Agreement whereby the U.S. government
agreed not to pursue the liquidated damages claim and released FBWS from any
and all claims arising from this matter.
FBWS agreed to pay the U.S. government a nominal amount for
administrative expenses associated with the U.S. governments response to ASUSs
appeal of the liquidated damages claim. Other Litigation Two former officers of
GSWC filed a lawsuit against both AWR and GSWC alleging among other things, wrongful
termination and retaliation against the former officers. GSWC filed a
cross-complaint against the former officers. The lawsuits were filed on November15,
2007 in the Los Angeles Superior Court. On
February15, 2010, the parties agreed to mutually settle the matter and a
Settlement Agreement was executed.Among other things, the
Settlement Agreement releases Registrant from claims of the former
officers. The Settlement Agreement further provides that there was no
admission of liability by any of the parties and that each party denies any
liability to the other. As a result of this matter, Registrant recorded a
pre-tax charge of $38 million during the fourth quarter of 2009 for legal and
settlement costs. This charge has been reflected in administrative and general
expenses in the Statement of Income. Registrant is also subject to other ordinary routine
litigation incidental to its business. Management believes that rate recovery,
proper insurance coverage and reserves are in place to insure against property,
general liability and workers compensation claims incurred in the ordinary
course of business. Registrant is unable to predict an estimate of the loss, if
any, resulting from any pending suits or administrative proceedings. Note 15 - Construction Program GSWC maintains an ongoing
water distribution main replacement program throughout its customer service
areas based on the priority of leaks detected, fire protection enhancement and
an underlying replacement schedule. In addition, GSWC upgrades its electric and
water supply facilities in accordance with industry standards, local
requirements and CPUC requirements. As of December31, 2009, GSWC has
unconditional purchase obligations for capital projects of approximately $226
million. ASUS actively
seeks opportunities to own, operate and maintain water and/or wastewater
systems at U.S. government military installations, which may involve
significant capital commitments. The Military Utility Privatization
Subsidiaries have capital commitments that are being funded by the U.S.
government. In the event that ASUS needs to pre-fund capital projects for a
long period of time, a financing cost is charged to the U.S. government. ASUS is expected to incur 128 Table
of Contents capital expenditures in 2010, most of which will be
funded by the U.S. government. In certain circumstances, the government
may request that ASUS finance the cost of selected construction projects.
ASUS will consider financing such projects. The terms of any such
financing, including interest rates, will be determined on a case-by-case
basis. AWR has no
material capital commitments. 129 Table
of Contents Note 16 Business Segments AWR has three reportable
segments, water, electric and contracted services, whereas GSWC has two
segments, water and electric. Within the segments, AWR has three principal
business units: water and electric service utility operations conducted through
GSWC, a water-service utility operation conducted through CCWC, and a
contracted services unit conducted through ASUS and its subsidiaries. All
activities of GSWC are geographically located within California. All activities
of CCWC are located in the state of Arizona. Both GSWC and CCWC are
rate-regulated utilities. Activities of ASUS and
its subsidiaries have been conducted in California, Maryland, New Mexico, North
Carolina, South Carolina, Texas and Virginia.
ASUSs wholly-owned subsidiaries are regulated by the state in which the
subsidiary conducts water and/or wastewater operations. Fees charged for operation and maintenance
and renewal and replacement services are based upon the terms of the contracts
with the U.S. government which have been filed with the commissions in the
states in which ASUSs subsidiaries operate.
On a stand-alone basis, AWR has no material assets other than its
investments in its subsidiaries. The tables below set
forth information relating to GSWCs operating segments, CCWC, ASUS and its
subsidiaries, and other matters. Certain assets, revenues and expenses have
been allocated in the amounts set forth. The identifiable assets are net of
respective accumulated provisions for depreciation. Capital additions reflect
capital expenditures paid in cash and exclude property installed by developers
and conveyed to GSWC or CCWC.

Note 19 Business Acquisition ASUS, through certain of
its wholly-owned subsidiaries, had entered into subcontracts with a single
subcontractor pursuant to which the subcontractor agreed to provide wastewater
services to ASUS subsidiaries FBWS, ODUS, and TUS. On January31, 2008, ASUS and these
subsidiaries agreed to buy out all rights which this subcontractor had to
provide wastewater services at these bases and any future rights that the
subcontractor or any of its affiliates might have to provide wastewater
services as a subcontractor to ASUS or any of its subsidiaries at any other
bases for an aggregate purchase price of approximately $25 million. The purchase also included the acquisition of
substantially all assets used by the subcontractor in providing the wastewater
services, including most vehicles, tools, supplies, equipment and books and
records for approximately $611,000.The acquisition resulted in the
recording of approximately $11 million of goodwill, $571,000 of identifiable
intangible assets subject to amortization and a charge to income of $213,000
for settlement of the pre-existing relationship with the subcontractor. This acquisition was not material to
Registrants financial position or results of operations. 131 Table

of Contents Report
of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm To the Board of Directors and Shareholders of
American State Water Company In our opinion, the accompanying consolidated balance sheets,
statements of capitalization, and the related consolidated statements of
income, common shareholders equity, and cash flows present fairly, in all
material respects, the financial position of American States Water Company and
its subsidiaries the Company at December31, 2009 and December31,
2008, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the
three years in the period ended December31, 2009 in conformity with
accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. In addition, in our opinion, the financial
statement schedule listed in a2, presented fairly, in all material
respects, the information set forth therein when read in conjunction with the
related consolidated financial statements.
Also in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects,
effective internal control over financial reporting as of December31,
2009, based on criteria established in Internal Control -
Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring
Organizations of the Treadway Commission COSO. The Companys management is responsible for
these financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control over
financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal
control over financial reporting, included in Managements Report on Internal
Control over Financial Reporting appearing in Item 9A. Our responsibility is to express opinions on
these financial statements and on the Companys internal control over financial
reporting based on our integrated audits.
We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public
Company Accounting Oversight Board United States. Those standards require that we plan and perform
the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements
are free of material misstatement and whether effective internal control over
financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audits of the financial statements
included examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and
disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles
used and significant estimates made by management, and evaluating the overall
financial statement presentation. Our
audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an
understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk
that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and
operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such
other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe
that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions. A companys internal control over financial reporting is a process
designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial
reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in
accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A companys internal control over financial
reporting includes those policies and procedures that ipertain to the
maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly
reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; iiprovide
reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit
preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted
accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are
being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors
of the company; and iiiprovide reasonable assurance regarding
prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition
of the companys assets that could have a material effect on the financial
statements. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial
reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of
effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may
become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of
compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. s/ PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP Los Angeles, California
