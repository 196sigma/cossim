NOTE 1. BACKGROUND
In April 1995, the Board of Directors of Kimberly-Clark Corporation
Kimberly-Clark approved a plan providing for a distribution the
Distribution to its stockholders through a tax-free spin-off of its U.S.,
French and Canadian business operations that manufacture and sell
tobacco-related papers and other specialty paper products the Businesses.
In order to effectuate the spin-off of the Businesses, on August 21, 1995
and July 31, 1995, respectively, Schweitzer-Mauduit International, Inc. SWM
and Schweitzer-Mauduit Canada, Inc. SM-Canada were incorporated and
nominally capitalized. Prior to the Distribution, Kimberly-Clark transferred to
SWM the Transfer i the assets and liabilities of its U.S.-based specialty
products business; ii all of the issued and outstanding shares of SM-Canada
and of Schweitzer-Mauduit France, S.A.R.L., previously named Kimberly-Clark
France S.A.R.L., or S.A.R.L. a French corporation SMF; and iii 72
percent of the issued and outstanding shares of LTR Industries, S.A., a French
corporation LTRI. After the Transfer, the Company consisted of the operating
assets and liabilities of Kimberly-Clark U.S. specialty products business and
investments in SM-Canada 100 percent owned, SMF 100 percent owned and LTRI
72 percent owned. SMF, directly or indirectly, owns 100 percent of two
principal French operating subsidiaries, Papeteries de Mauduit S.A. PdM and
Papeteries de Malaucene S.A. PdMal, and a French holding company,
Schweitzer-Mauduit Enterprises S.A. SM-Enterprises. The Transfer was
accounted for at historical cost in a manner similar to that in pooling of
interests accounting as the entities were all under common control. As used
herein, the Company means SWM and/or one or more of its several subsidiaries, as
determined by the context.
In July 1995, the stockholders of SMF, then a wholly-owned subsidiary of
Kimberly-Clark, approved the conversion of $654 of receivables from an
affiliated company to an equity investment in such company. Such affiliated
company was one of two wholly-owned consumer and service products C
subsidiaries unrelated to the tobacco-related and specialty papers businesses
which were merged together, and the shares of the merged entity were distributed
to Kimberly-Clark prior to the Distribution. The conversion of receivables to an
equity investment was recorded as a return of capital to Kimberly-Clark,
reducing the par value of common stock of SMF by $371, with the $283 excess
recorded as a non-cash dividend reducing retained earnings. SMF remained part of
SWM to permit PdM and PdMal to utilize income tax loss carryforwards previously
generated by the French C operations.
On November 1, 1995, Kimberly-Clark announced that its Board of Directors
had approved the Distribution of all outstanding shares of common stock of SWM
to Kimberly-Clark stockholders. The Distribution was made on November 30, 1995
to stockholders of record on November 13, 1995. Effective at the close of
business on November 30, 1995 the Distribution Date, the Company became an
independent, publicly owned company as a result of the Distribution.
Pursuant to a Distribution Agreement, SWM and Kimberly-Clark entered into
various agreements that govern certain relationships between them, as well as
having provided an orderly transition to the status of two separate companies,
including a Tax Sharing Agreement, an Employee Matters Agreement, a Corporate
Services Agreement and a Transfer, Contribution and Assumption Agreement
Transfer Agreement.
The Distribution Agreement established and provided for the principal
corporate transactions necessary to effect the Distribution, including the
transfer of assets to the Company and assumption by the Company of liabilities
associated with the operation of the Businesses, as well as the cash payments to
Kimberly-Clark. Other ancillary agreements continue to govern the relationship
between Kimberly-Clark and the Company with respect to or in consequence of the
Distribution, including allocation of responsibility for certain pending legal
proceedings, indemnities between the two companies and certain post-Distribution
covenants.

U.S. $ IN MILLIONS, EXCEPT PER SHARE AMOUNTS
The Tax Sharing Agreement provides for, among other things, the treatment
of tax matters for periods prior to the Distribution Date and responsibility for
adjustments as a result of audits by taxing authorities and is designed to
preserve the status of the Distribution as a tax-free distribution.
Under the Corporate Services Agreement, Kimberly-Clark provided certain
administrative, technical, and other services for a limited period of time. It
has also provided, and will continue during 1998 to provide, certain limited
information systems support. Charges for such services have been equal to or
based on the cost of rendering such services. In addition, through January 31,
1996, Kimberly-Clark provided the Company tenancy services with respect to the
office and research space which the Company had occupied in Kimberly-Clark
Roswell, Georgia facilities.
The Employee Matters Agreement provides for the Company and
Kimberly-Clark respective obligations to employees and former employees who
are or were associated with the Businesses and for other employment and employee
benefit matters.
Under the Transfer Agreement, Kimberly-Clark assigned to the Company all
intellectual property rights such as patent and trademark rights, trade secrets
and know-how related to the operations of the Businesses, except for certain
rights which were retained by Kimberly-Clark and licensed to the Company on a
perpetual, non-exclusive, royalty-free and, in certain cases, non-transferable
basis. The Transfer Agreement also established time periods during which the
Company has agreed to comply with certain restrictions on its ability to compete
with certain Kimberly-Clark foreign affiliates in the countries such affiliates
currently sell cigarette paper, tipping paper and plug wrap paper used to wrap
various parts of a cigarette Cigarette Papers.
During 1997, the Company established and nominally capitalized
Schweitzer-Mauduit Spain, S.L. SM-Spain, a 100 percent owned holding company
organized under the Spanish holding company regime. SM-Spain is intended to be
used as a holding company for certain of SWM foreign investments, including
foreign investments acquired in the future.
NOTE 2. BASIS OF PRESENTATION AND PRO FORMA DATA
Basis of Presentation
These financial statements have been prepared in conformity with generally
accepted accounting principles, which require management to make estimates and
assumptions that affect amounts of assets and liabilities reported, disclosure
of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and
amounts of revenues and expenses reported for the periods. Actual results could
differ from these estimates. These financial statements include the accounts of
SWM and its majority-owned subsidiaries. All material intercompany and
interdivisional transactions are eliminated.
All of the 1997 and 1996 financial statements are presented on a
consolidated basis. The Statements of Income and Cash Flow for the year ended
December 31, 1995 include the combined results of operations and cash flows of
the Businesses under Kimberly-Clark for the eleven months prior to the
Distribution Date, as if the Businesses had been operating as a single entity
prior to the Distribution, and the consolidated results of operations and cash
flows of the Company for the one month period ended December 31, 1995. The
combined statements include historical information and reflect the net income
and cash flows of the Businesses, of which Kimberly-Clark U.S. business had
been reported as a division not a separate legal entity of Kimberly-Clark, the
Canadian business had been reported as a division of a Canadian subsidiary of
Kimberly-Clark, and the French businesses had been reported as consolidated
subsidiaries of Kimberly-Clark.
The French C operations have been excluded from the financial statements
of SWM prior to the Distribution because the Businesses and the French C
operations had been independently operated and
33
34
SCHWEITZER-MAUDUIT INTERNATIONAL, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS -- CONTINUED
U.S. $ IN MILLIONS, EXCEPT PER SHARE AMOUNTS
managed, had totally separate facilities, no common sales forces or purchasing
functions, no substantive intercompany transactions except in the ordinary
course of managing Kimberly-Clark intercompany financing activities, and no
other commonalities, in substance or in form. The accompanying financial
statements accordingly reflect the distribution of the French C subsidiaries
to Kimberly-Clark as of the beginning of the earliest period presented.
Pro Forma Data Unaudited
Pro forma net income is presented based on data prepared under assumptions
as to the effects on the Company financial statements of certain intercompany,
equity and operating transactions related to the Distribution as though these
transactions occurred at the beginning of the periods presented. The pro forma
financial data is unaudited, is presented for informational purposes only and
does not reflect the future earnings or results of operations of the Company or
what the earnings or results of operations of the Company would have been had
the Businesses been operated as a separate, independent company for the periods
presented. Pro forma net income per common share has been computed based on the
assumption that pro forma average shares outstanding for all periods prior to
the Distribution Date were the actual number of shares issued and distributed in
the Distribution. The number of shares outstanding from the Distribution date to
December 31, 1995 did not change.
The following summarizes the effects of the pro forma adjustments and the
pro forma weighted average common shares outstanding:
1995
Historical net     $368
Pro forma adjustments:
Incremental operating     45
Incremental interest     49
Reversal of interest expense and income to from
affiliates,     33
Net tax benefit of      49
Pro forma net     $290
Pro forma net income per common share -- Basic and
$181
Pro forma weighted average common shares outstanding. 16,051,109
-  
1 Estimated incremental information systems, administration and management
expense associated with being a stand-alone publicly-owned entity.
2 Estimated incremental interest expense associated with new debt issued and
debt assumed from Kimberly-Clark, and to adjust other interest expense for
the estimated effect of the pro forma adjustments.
3 Reversal of intercompany interest income and expense related to
inter-company receivables and liabilities attributable to Kimberly-Clark
European cash management program.
NOTE 3. SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
The Company accounting policies conform to generally accepted accounting
principles. Significant policies followed are described below.
Revenue Recognition
Sales are generally recognized upon shipment of the product to the
customer.

Foreign Currency Translation
Income and expense items attributable to the operations in Canada and
France are translated into U.S. dollars at average exchange rates prevailing
during the periods. The balance sheets of these operations are translated at
period-end exchange rates, and the differences from historical exchange rates
are reflected in stockholders' equity as unrealized currency translation
adjustments. Foreign currency gains and losses arising from settlement of
transactions in non-local currencies and remeasurement of non-local currency
denominated monetary assets and liabilities are included in other income
expense, net.
Earnings Per Share
In February 1997, the Financial Accounting Standards Board FASB issued
Statement of Financial Accounting Standards SFAS No. 128, Earnings Per
Share, which simplifies standards for computing earnings per share EPS
information. SFAS No. 128 replaces the presentation of primary and, when
required, fully diluted EPS with a presentation of basic and diluted EPS.
Basic net income per common share is computed based on net income divided by the
weighted average number of common shares outstanding. The average number of
common shares used in the calculation of basic net income per common share for
1997 and 1996 were 16,059,900 and 16,052,100, respectively. Diluted net income
per common share is computed based on net income divided by the weighted average
number of common and potential common shares outstanding. The average number of
common and potential common shares used in the calculation of diluted net income
per common share for 1997 and 1996 were 16,338,600 and 16,216,900, respectively.
The only potential common shares are those related to stock options outstanding
during the respective years. All earnings per share information for 1996, and
for interim periods of 1997, has been restated to conform to the requirements of
SFAS No. 128.
Cash and Cash Equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents include cash, time deposits, and readily
marketable securities with original maturities of three months or less. The
recorded amount reported in the balance sheet approximates fair value.
Inventories
Most U.S. inventories are valued at cost on the Last-In, First-Out LIFO
method. The balance of the U.S. inventories and inventories of operations
outside the U.S. are valued at the lower of cost, using the First-In, First-Out
FIFO and weighted average methods, or market.
Property and Depreciation
Property, plant and equipment are stated at cost. Depreciable property is
depreciated on the straight-line method for accounting purposes. When property
is sold or retired, the cost of the property and the related accumulated
depreciation are removed from the balance sheet, and any gain or loss on the
transaction is included in income. The depreciable lives for the principal asset
categories are as follows:
ASSET CATEGORY             DEPRECIABLE LIFE
Machinery and  5 to 20 years
20 to 40 years
Building  Lesser of 20 years or
remaining life of the
relevant building or
lease

SCHWEITZER-MAUDUIT INTERNATIONAL, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS -- CONTINUED
U.S. $ IN MILLIONS, EXCEPT PER SHARE AMOUNTS
Capitalized Software Costs
The Company capitalizes certain purchases of software and software design
and installation costs in connection with major projects for software
development for internal use. These costs are included in Deferred Charges and
Other Assets on the consolidated balance sheet and are amortized on the straight
line method for accounting purposes over the estimated useful life not to exceed
seven years. Costs associated with business process redesign, end-user training
and system start-up are expensed as incurred.
Impairment of Assets
The Company periodically assesses the likelihood of recovering the cost of
long-lived assets based on its expectation of future profitability and
undiscounted cash flow of the related operations. These factors, along with
management plans with respect to the operations, are considered in assessing
the recoverability of property and purchased intangibles.
Income Taxes
Prior to the Distribution, for United States federal and state income tax
return purposes, taxable income of the Businesses' U.S. operations was included
in the consolidated income tax returns of Kimberly-Clark. Prior to the
Distribution, for Canadian federal and provincial income tax purposes, taxable
income of the Businesses' Canadian operations was included in the income tax
returns of Canadian subsidiaries of Kimberly-Clark. In France, prior to the
Distribution, SMF, PdM, PdMal and SMF other subsidiaries, the French C
subsidiaries, were included in the consolidated income tax group of SMF, while
LTRI separately filed its own income tax returns. Subsequent to the
Distribution, the French C subsidiaries are no longer included in the
consolidated income tax group of SMF, and LTRI will continue to separately file
its own income tax returns. Income tax expense and deferred income tax assets
and liabilities attributable to these operations in the consolidated and
separate filings are determined under the asset and liability method. Deferred
income taxes have been provided on the differences between the financial
reporting and tax basis of assets and liabilities by applying enacted tax rates
in effect for the years in which the differences are expected to reverse.
Employee Benefits
Prior to the Distribution, most U.S. and Canadian employees of the Company
participated in employee benefit plans, including pension, savings, medical and
dental insurance, disability and other plans administered by Kimberly-Clark and
its Canadian subsidiaries. The Company was charged for its portion of the costs
of such plans, but Kimberly-Clark generally recorded the associated assets and
liabilities, with the exception of postretirement benefits other than pensions,
and did not allocate them to the Company. Subsequent to the Distribution, the
Company established substantially all the same employee benefit plans as those
previously provided by Kimberly-Clark. In connection with the Distribution,
Kimberly-Clark retained the employee benefit obligations for the Company
retired participants as of the Distribution Date, and the Company assumed the
benefit obligations for its active employees. As a result, certain of the
Company employee benefit liabilities were adjusted as of the Distribution
Date. The net amount of such assets and liabilities transferred in connection
with the Distribution was not significant.
Stock Compensation
SFAS No. 123, Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation defines a fair
value based method of accounting for stock compensation, including stock options
to employees. This statement provides entities a choice of recognizing related
compensation expense by adopting the fair value method or to measure
compensation using the intrinsic value method under Accounting Principles Board
APB Opinion No. 25. The Company has elected to continue to measure
compensation cost for stock options based on the intrinsic
36
37
SCHWEITZER-MAUDUIT INTERNATIONAL, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS -- CONTINUED
U.S. $ IN MILLIONS, EXCEPT PER SHARE AMOUNTS
value method under APB Opinion No. 25, Accounting for Stock Issued to
Employees See Note 8. Payments in the form of shares of the Company made to
third parties are recorded at fair value based on the market value of the
Company common stock at the time of payment.
Environmental Spending
Environmental spending related to current operations which qualifies as
property, plant and equipment, substantially increases the economic value or
extends the useful life of an asset is capitalized. All other such spending is
expensed as incurred. Environmental spending relating to an existing condition
caused by past operations is expensed. Liabilities are recorded when
environmental assessments or remedial efforts are probable, and the costs can be
reasonably estimated. Generally, timing of these accruals coincides with
completion of a feasibility study or commitment to a formal plan of action.
New Accounting Standards
In June 1997, the FASB issued two new statements, SFAS No. 130, Reporting
of Comprehensive Income and SFAS No. 131, Disclosures about Segments of an
Enterprise and Related Information, which will both be effective for the
Company 1998 Annual Report to Stockholders. These two new statements will
affect the Company financial statement disclosures. The Company is evaluating
how to implement these new disclosure requirements.

1 Amounts for 1995 represent income taxes paid by LTRI. In 1995 subsequent to
the Distribution, SWM and SM-Canada paid no income taxes. Prior to the
Distribution, the Businesses' U.S. and Canadian operations were divisions of
U.S. and Canadian corporations, respectively. Income tax payments related to
these divisions are not included in the amounts presented, because such
payments are not separately identifiable. Had income tax payments been made
equivalent to the current portions of the income tax provisions reflected in
the accompanying financial statements for these divisions, such payments
would have been $69 in 1995. The SMF consolidated tax group paid only
nominal amounts of minimum required income taxes in all periods presented
due to the net operating loss carryforwards retained in the Distribution.

NOTE 5. DEBT
On November 27, 1995, the Company, SMF and PdM Industries S.N.C. PdM
Industries, a subsidiary owned 99 percent by PdM and one percent by SMF,
entered into an unsecured credit agreement the Credit Agreement with a group
of banks to provide term and revolving loans totaling 375 million French francs
or approximately $63 at December 31, 1997 and $72 at December 31, 1996 to SMF
and PdM Industries the French Credit Facility and term and revolving loans
totaling $400 to the Company the U.S. Credit Facility and, together with the
French Credit Facility, the Credit Facilities. The French Credit Facility
consists of a five-year term loan to SMF in the amount of 250 million French
francs or approximately $42 at December 31, 1997 and $48 at December 31, 1996
the French Term Loan Facility and a renewable 364-day revolving credit
facility available to both SMF and PdM Industries in an amount of up to 125
million French francs or approximately $21 at December 31, 1997 and $24 at
December 31, 1996 the French Revolving Credit Facility. Borrowings under
the French Credit Facility are guaranteed by the Company. The U.S. Credit
Facility consists of a five-year term loan to the Company in the amount of $250
the U.S. Term Loan Facility, and, together with the French Term Loan
Facility, the Term Loan Facilities and a renewable 364-day revolving credit
facility available to the Company in an amount of up to $150 the U.S.
Revolving Credit Facility and, together with the French Revolving Credit
Facility, the Revolving Credit Facilities. The Revolving Credit Facilities
were renewed to extend the facilities to November 23, 1998. Loans under each of
the Term Loan Facilities are payable in three equal semi-annual installments
beginning four years following the making of the term loans thereunder.
The interest rates under the Term Loan Facilities are based, at the
election of the Company, on either a the sum of i either 0375 percent per
annum or 0300 percent per annum the Applicable Margin, determined by
reference to the Company Leverage Ratio as defined in the Credit Agreement
plus ii the London interbank offered rate LIBOR, or b an alternate base
rate. The interest rates under the Revolving Credit Facilities are based, at the
election of the Company, on either a the sum of i 0200 percent per annum
plus ii LIBOR, or b an alternate base rate.
The Credit Agreement contains representations and warranties which are
customary for facilities of this type and covenants and provisions that, among
other things, require the Company maintain certain defined financial ratios a
minimum Tangible Net Worth, a maximum Leverage Ratio and a minimum Fixed Charge
Coverage Ratio, all as defined in the Credit Agreement. Events of default under
the Credit Agreement include, among other things, termination of the Company
supply agreement with Philip Morris without entry into one or more suitable
replacement agreements.
On the Distribution date, the Company in the U.S. assumed $250 of
Kimberly-Clark debt, which it repaid with borrowings of the full amount under
the U.S. Term Loan Facility. In France, SMF retained $108 of Kimberly-Clark
debt outstanding which related to the French C operations of Kimberly-Clark.
In addition and immediately prior to the Distribution, SMF made a cash payment
to Kimberly-Clark of approximately $56, principally financed by borrowings of
the full amount by SMF under the French Term Loan Facility.
In January 1996, the Company entered into a six month interest rate hedge
agreement related to its French Term Loan Facility having a total notional
principal amount of 250 million French francs to fix the LIBOR rate at 44
percent, beginning July 30, 1996 and ending January 30, 1997. In December 1996,
the Company entered into a new interest rate hedge agreement to fix the LIBOR
rate at approximately 35 percent on a notional principal amount of 170 million
French francs or approximately $28 at December 31, 1997 and $32 at December 31,
1996 beginning January 30, 1997 and ending January 30, 1998. In December 1997,
the Company entered into a new interest rate hedge agreement to fix the LIBOR
rate at approximately 39 percent on a notional principal amount of 250 million
French francs beginning January 30, 1998 and ending July 30,

1998 and at approximately 41 percent on the same notional principal amount
beginning July 30, 1998 and ending January 30, 1999.
In January 1996, the Company entered into a six month interest rate hedge
agreement related to its U.S. Term Loan Facility having a total notional
principal amount of $250 to fix the LIBOR rate at 50 percent, beginning July
30, 1996 and ending January 30, 1997. In October 1996, the Company entered into
a new interest rate hedge agreement for the same notional amount to fix the
LIBOR rate at 61 percent beginning January 30, 1997 and ending January 30,
1998. In September 1997, the Company entered into a new interest rate hedge
agreement for the same notional amount to fix the LIBOR rate at 59 percent
beginning January 30, 1998 and ending July 30, 1998.
The effective interest rates on the Term Loan Facilities at December 31,
1997 and 1996 for France were 38 percent and 48 percent, respectively, and for
the U.S. were 64 percent and 54 percent, respectively.
At both December 31, 1997 and 1996, long-term debt other than the Term
Loans primarily consisted of obligations of the French operations related to
government mandated profit sharing. These amounts bear interest at the five year
treasury note rate in France 60 percent and 58 percent as of December 31,
1997 and 1996, respectively and are generally payable in the fifth year
subsequent to the year the profit sharing is accrued.

At December 31, 1997, the French and the U.S. operations of the Company had
approximately $21 and $150, respectively of Revolving Credit Facilities. These
facilities, which were unused at December 31, 1997, permit borrowing at
competitive interest rates and are available for general corporate purposes. The
Company pays commitment fees on the unused portion of these facilities at an
annual rate of 10 percent and may cancel the facilities without penalty at any
time prior to their expiration at November 23, 1998.
The Company also had another bank credit facility available in the U.S. of
$50, none of which was outstanding at December 31, 1997. Additionally, SMF had
approximately $8 of other bank credit facilities available, of which $05 was
outstanding at December 31, 1997. No commitment fees are paid on the unused
portion of these facilities.

At December 31, 1997 and 1996, the estimated fair value of the Company
long-term debt and short-term debt approximated the carrying amount. These fair
values were based on quoted market prices for the same or similar debt or on
current rates offered to the Company for obligations with the same maturities.
In early February 1998, the Company completed two previously announced
acquisitions see Note 16. In anticipation of these, the Company modified its
existing Credit Agreement in order to ensure sufficient funds for the
transactions and to retain availability of funds sufficient to meet its ongoing
cash requirements. The terms of the Amended and Restated Credit Agreement
entered into on January 30, 1998 are substantially the same as the prior Credit
Agreement, except that it i provides an additional $200 term loan to SM-
Spain, ii extends the maturities of the Term Loan Facilities by approximately
two years, and iii extends the expiration date of the Revolving Credit
Facilities to January 29, 1999.
NOTE 6. INCOME TAXES
An analysis of the provision benefit for income taxes for the years ended
December 31, 1997, 1996, and 1995 follows:

A reconciliation of income tax computed at the U.S. federal statutory
income tax rate to the provision for income taxes is as follows for the years
ended December 31, 1997, 1996 and 1995:

Provision for income taxes. $286   360%  $260   372%  $176   301%
The provision for income taxes in 1997 was impacted by an increase in the
effective statutory income tax rate enacted in France in November 1997 from
3667 percent to 4167 percent for 1997 and 1998, retroactive
41

to January 1, 1997, and to 4000 percent for 1999. The unfavorable effect on
current taxes of the tax rate increase, including a retroactive adjustment for
the eleven-month period ended November 30, 1997, was offset by the favorable
effect on the deferred provision for income taxes due to the increased value of
the tax benefits to be recognized from the net operating loss carryforwards
retained by SMF estimated to be realized during 1997, 1998 and 1999, the periods
of the higher income tax rates. The impact in 1997 attributable to deferred tax
assets, net of liabilities, was a favorable $20 on the deferred provision for
income taxes. Also impacting the 1997 provision for income taxes was the
enactment in France in December 1997 of a law that eliminated taxation of a
provision for the fluctuating value of raw materials that had been included in
French deferred taxes. Cancellation of this deferred tax liability reduced the
provision for income taxes by $21.
The provision for income taxes was higher in 1996 and lower in 1995
primarily due to an increase in the effective statutory income tax rate enacted
in France in July 1995 from 3333 percent to 3667 percent, retroactive to
January 1, 1995. The net effect of the tax rate increase was favorable for 1995
because it increased the value of the tax benefits to be recognized from the net
operating loss carryforwards retained by SMF. The impact in 1995 attributable to
deferred tax assets, net of liabilities, was a favorable $45 on the deferred
provision for income taxes, partially offset by an unfavorable impact on the
current provision for income taxes of $13, including a retroactive adjustment
for the six-month period ended June 30, 1995.
The Company considers the undistributed earnings of certain foreign
subsidiaries to be indefinitely reinvested or plans to repatriate such earnings
only when tax effective to do so. Accordingly, no provision for U.S. federal and
state income taxes has been made thereon. Upon distribution of those earnings in
the form of dividends, loans to the U.S. parent, or otherwise, the Company could
be subject to both U.S. income taxes subject to an adjustment for foreign tax
credits and withholding taxes payable to foreign tax authorities. Determination
of the amount of unrecognized deferred U.S. tax liability is not practicable
because of the complexities associated with its hypothetical calculation.
Deferred income tax assets liabilities as of December 31, 1997 and 1996
are comprised of the following:
1997   1996
Current deferred income tax assets attributable to:

In the above presentation, the net noncurrent deferred income tax assets
relate to the French tax jurisdiction, and the net noncurrent deferred income
tax liabilities relate to the U.S. and Canadian tax jurisdictions. Total
deferred income tax assets were $569 and $670 at December 31, 1997 and 1996,
respectively. Total deferred income tax liabilities were $464 and $430 at
December 31, 1997 and 1996, respectively.
Under French tax law, the net operating losses incurred through December
31, 1994 by the previously discussed C operations in France see Note 1 were
retained by SMF as of January 1, 1995. For the financial statements presented,
the tax benefits from these net operating losses were recorded as a noncurrent
deferred income tax asset and as a contribution to additional paid-in capital on
the balance sheet in the year such losses arose.
The following summarizes the changes in French net operating loss
carryforwards NOL and the related noncurrent deferred income tax asset and
valuation allowance for the years ended December 31, 1997, 1996 and 1995:

Currency translation   243   89   22   67
Amount at December 31,  $1602   $606  $164  $442
The 1995 French income tax rate increase effect of $60 on the deferred
income tax asset shown above was partially offset by the effect on the French
entities' net deferred income tax liabilities related to other items in arriving
at the net effect of $45 on the deferred provision for income taxes previously
mentioned. The valuation allowance of $42 was recorded to offset deferred
income tax assets arising from additional tax loss carryforwards of $114
generated in 1995 related to the Distribution transactions. In addition, the
Company 1995 French income tax returns, filed in April 1996, included tax net
loss carryforward amounts which were $409 greater than those which had
previously been reflected on the Company balance sheet. Thus, the Company
recorded $150 of additional deferred tax assets in 1996. There is uncertainty,
however, whether the benefit of these additional amounts will ultimately be
realized by the Company. Accordingly, an additional valuation allowance of $150
was recorded to fully offset the additional deferred tax asset, resulting in no
impact on net income for the year ended December 31, 1996.
In April 1997, upon filing the Company 1996 French income tax returns, an
adjustment was recorded for an additional $14 of 1996 NOL utilization. The
offset was a reduction to current income taxes payable related to 1996. The 1997
French income tax rate increase effect of $21 on the net deferred income tax
asset shown above was slightly offset by the effect on the French entities' net
deferred income tax liabilities related
43

SCHWEITZER-MAUDUIT INTERNATIONAL, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS -- CONTINUED
U.S. $ IN MILLIONS, EXCEPT PER SHARE AMOUNTS
to other items in arriving at the net effect of $20 on the deferred provision
for income taxes previously mentioned. The effect of the income tax rate
increase on the valuation allowance relates to the increased value of the gross
NOL for which it is more likely than not that such benefits will not be
realized. To the extent that the asset related to those NOL increased, the
valuation allowance was increased by the same amount.
Of the $1602 of NOL still available at December 31, 1997, $257 and
$267 will expire in 1998 and 1999, respectively, if not utilized against
taxable income. The remaining $1078 of NOL have no expiration date. Although
not assured, PdM and PdMal are expected to generate taxable income in the
future, as they have in the past, in amounts sufficient to permit utilization of
most of the NOL prior to their expiration. In addition, the Company intends to
elect to include the newly acquired French entities see Note 16 in the SMF
consolidated tax group, although this will not be effective until January 1,
1999 because of French income tax rules. After the effects of the increased
French income tax rates and currency exchange rate changes during the year,
valuation allowances totaled $164 as of December 31, 1997, reducing the net
asset to an amount which is estimated can be realized through utilization of the
NOL by the SMF consolidated income tax group. Although realization is not
assured, management believes it is more likely than not that the net deferred
tax asset will be realized. However, that amount could change if, among other
considerations, estimates of future taxable income, or income tax regulations or
interpretations, change during the carryforward period.
The SMF consolidated tax group has not paid income taxes, except nominal
amounts related to minimum required income taxes, in the periods presented in
the financial statements and is not expected to pay income taxes until the NOL
are utilized.
Along with numerous other companies and banks in France, PdM is subject to
a tax claim with respect to its purchase of certain bonds in 1988 which were
represented by the two selling banks as carrying specific tax benefits. The
French taxing authority is challenging the use by PdM of those benefits. The tax
claim against PdM by the French taxing authority is $19 as of December 31,
1997, including penalties for abuse of the law and late payment. A recent
court decision has held that another purchaser of the bonds was not liable for
abuse of the law, thus eliminating that portion of the claim. The amount of
penalties related to abuse of the law included in the tax claim against PdM is
approximately $08. If the same decision were applied to the tax claim against
PdM, PdM exposure as of December 31, 1997 would be reduced to approximately
$11. The Company is vigorously defending the claim based on the merits and has
filed claims against each bank on the basis of their misrepresentation of
certain facts. The Company claim against one of the banks was rejected by a
trial court in May 1996 and the Company has appealed this decision. In December
1997, the case against the other bank was stayed until the claim filed by the
French taxing authority against PdM has been resolved. A reserve of $10 was
established for this tax claim against PdM during the fourth quarter of 1997.
Based on information currently available, there exists a reasonable possibility
of an unfavorable outcome for this claim. Since the claim relates to a period
prior to PdM joining the consolidated tax group, any unfavorable outcome could
not be offset with the NOL of the SMF consolidated tax group.

NOTE 7. POSTRETIREMENT AND OTHER BENEFITS
North American Pension Benefits
Prior to the Distribution, substantially all of the U.S. and Canadian
employees of the Company were covered by defined benefit pension plans and
participated in pension plans covering employees of Kimberly-Clark and its
Canadian subsidiaries at various locations. The portion of Kimberly-Clark and
its Canadian subsidiaries' pension costs attributable to the Company U.S. and
Canadian employees and reflected in the accompanying income statements was $15
for the eleven months ended November 30, 1995.
Subsequent to the Distribution, the Company and its subsidiary in Canada
established defined benefit retirement plans covering substantially all
full-time employees. Retirees of the Company prior to the Distribution remained
participants of their respective Kimberly-Clark plans. Retirement benefits are
based on years of service and generally on the average compensation earned in
the highest five of the last 15 years of service, essentially the same as the
plans in which the employees had participated under Kimberly-Clark. Employees
retained credit for prior service while employees of Kimberly-Clark. The
Company funding policy is to contribute assets that, at a minimum, fully fund
the accumulated benefit obligation, subject to regulatory and tax deductibility
limits. Under the Distribution, Kimberly-Clark was required to transfer a
proportionate share of assets of its plans related to the employees who
transferred to the Company in the Distribution. The plan assets for the U.S. and
Canadian plans were transferred during 1997 from the Kimberly-Clark plans, in
which the employees had participated prior to the Distribution, to the Company
plans upon receiving favorable determination letters from the Internal Revenue
Service and Revenue Canada, respectively, qualifying the Company plans. Plan
assets are invested in a diversified portfolio consisting primarily of equity
and debt securities.
The components of net pension expense for U.S. employees for the years
ended December 31, 1997 and 1996, and for the one month ended December 31, 1995
subsequent to the Distribution, using estimated amounts related to assets to
be transferred to the Company plans from Kimberly-Clark plans as well as
estimates related to return on plan assets for the respective periods, were as

The assumed long-term rate of return on pension assets for purposes of

each of the years 1997, 1996 and 1995. Transition adjustments for these plans
are being amortized on the straight-line method over 14 to 18 years.

The discount rates used to determine the projected benefit obligation and

775 percent at December 31, 1997 and 1996, respectively. The assumed long-term
rates of compensation increases used to determine the projected benefit
obligations for these plans were 40 percent for both December 31, 1997 and
1996.
French Pension Benefits
In France, employees are covered under a government administered program.
In addition, the Company French operations sponsor retirement indemnity plans
which pay a lump sum retirement benefit to employees who retire from the
Company. The Company French operations also sponsor a supplemental executive
pension plan which is designed to provide a retirement benefit equal to between
50 and 65 percent of final earnings, depending upon years of service, after
considering other government and Company sponsored retirement plans. Plan assets
are principally invested in the general asset portfolio of a French insurance
company.
The Company net pension expense for the French pension plans was $11 10 and $09 for the years ended December 31, 1997, 1996 and 1995,
respectively. The assumed long-term rates of return on pension assets for
purposes of pension expense recognition for the French plans were 80 percent
for each of the years 1997, 1996 and 1995. Transition adjustments for these
plans are being amortized on the straight-line method over 19 to 20 years.
The Company prepaid pension cost for the French plans whose assets
exceeded accumulated benefits was $03 and $06 at December 31, 1997 and 1996,
respectively. The Company accrued pension cost for the French plans whose
accumulated benefits exceeded assets was $20 and $12 at December 31, 1997 and
1996, respectively. The discount rate used to determine the projected benefit
obligation and accumulated benefit obligation for the French plans was 80
percent at both December 31, 1997 and 1996. The assumed long-term
46

rates of compensation increases used to determine the projected benefit
obligation for these plans were approximately 40 percent at both December 31,
1997 and 1996.
Postretirement Health Care and Life Insurance Benefits
Prior to the Distribution, substantially all U.S. and Canadian retired
employees of the Company were covered by unfunded health care and life insurance
benefit plans of Kimberly-Clark or its Canadian subsidiaries. Eligibility for
such benefits was based on years of service and age at retirement. The plans
were principally noncontributory for current retirees, and were contributory for
most future retirees. The portion of Kimberly-Clark and its Canadian
subsidiaries' postretirement health care and life insurance benefits costs
attributable to the Company employees and reflected in the accompanying income
statements was $15 for the eleven months ended November 30, 1995.
Subsequent to the Distribution, the Company and its subsidiary in Canada
established unfunded health care and life insurance benefit plans which will
cover substantially all future retirees of the Company. Retirees of the
Businesses prior to the Distribution remained participants of their respective
Kimberly-Clark plans. Eligibility for benefits under the Company plans is
based on years of service and age at retirement, essentially the same as the
plans in which the employees participated under Kimberly-Clark. Employees
retained credit for prior service while employees of Kimberly-Clark. The
Company plans are noncontributory for certain long service employees when they
retire, but are contributory for most other future retirees.
The components of U.S. employee postretirement health care and life
insurance benefit costs were as follows for the years ended December 31, 1997
and 1996, and for the one month ended December 31, 1995 subsequent to the
Distribution:

The components of the U.S. employee postretirement health care and life

December 31, 1997 and 1996 are as follows:
1997   1996

The December 31, 1997 accumulated postretirement benefit obligation for
these plans was determined using an assumed health care cost trend rate of 775
percent in 1998, declining to 55 percent in 2000 and thereafter. The December
31, 1996 accumulated postretirement benefit obligation was determined using an
47
48
SCHWEITZER-MAUDUIT INTERNATIONAL, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS -- CONTINUED
U.S. $ IN MILLIONS, EXCEPT PER SHARE AMOUNTS
assumed health care cost trend rate of 9375 percent in 1997, declining to 600
percent in 2000 and thereafter. Discount rates of 725 percent and 775 percent
were used to determine the accumulated postretirement benefit obligations at
December 31, 1997 and 1996, respectively.
A one-percentage point increase in the healthcare cost trend rate would
increase accumulated postretirement benefit obligations by $01 at December 31,
1997 and would have a nominal effect on postretirement benefit expense for 1997.
Other Benefits
Prior to the Distribution, voluntary contributory investment plans were
provided to substantially all U.S. employees. Under the plans, Kimberly-Clark
matched a portion of employee contributions. The portion of Kimberly-Clark
costs under the plans attributable to the Company and reflected in the
accompanying income statements was $06 for the eleven months ended November 30,
1995.
Subsequent to the Distribution, substantially all U.S. employees have been
given the opportunity to participate in voluntary investment plans. Under the
plans, the Company matches a portion of employee contributions. The Company
costs under the plan reflected in the accompanying consolidated income
statements for the years ended December 31, 1997 and 1996, and for the one month
ended December 31, 1995 subsequent to the Distribution, were $10, $10 and
less than $01, respectively. At December 31, 1997 and 1996, 500,000 shares of
the Company Common Stock were reserved for issuance under these plans, none of
which had been issued as of December 31, 1997. The shares may, at the Company
option, be used by the Company to satisfy the Company liability for its
matching contributions.
NOTE 8. STOCKHOLDERS' EQUITY
As explained in Note 1, SWM was not capitalized with the net assets of the
Businesses until immediately before the Distribution. Stockholders' equity,
prior to the Distribution, therefore, consisted of the separately presented
Predecessors' Capital Stock the historical Common Stock amounts of SMF and
LTRI, the historical combined amounts of paid-in capital and retained earnings
for these corporations as adjusted to exclude operations unrelated to the
Businesses and to include the benefit of certain French tax net operating loss
carryforwards generated by such businesses and the combined division equity
amounts of the U.S. and Canadian tobacco-related and other specialty paper
businesses. The latter businesses were part of the operations of Kimberly-Clark
and one of its Canadian subsidiaries, and all aspects of cash management for
such divisions with respect to intercompany sales, receivables, accounts
payable, pensions, taxes, and similar corporate activities were controlled by
Kimberly-Clark and one of its Canadian subsidiaries.

subsidiary of Kimberly-Clark, respectively, on August 21, 1995 and August
17, 1995, respectively, solely for the purpose of effecting the Distribution

summary. $01 was attributable to LTRI and was unchanged during all the
periods presented through November 30, 1995.
2 In connection with the Distribution, the Company paid $560 to
Kimberly-Clark as a return of capital, in addition to the debt of
Kimberly-Clark which the Company assumed in the US. $250 and retained in
France $108, as well as a cash dividend from LTRI to Kimberly-Clark on
the Distribution Date of $82. The total of these items represents a
distribution of $1000 to Kimberly-Clark in connection with the spin-off.
3 Represents contributions to SMF equity by Kimberly-Clark which were, in turn
invested in whole or in part in the French C subsidiaries of SMF. The
investments in these subsidiaries have been retroactively reflected in the
accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements as having been distributed to
Kimberly-Clark. Accordingly, these additional C investments have been
shown as return of capital distributions to Kimberly-Clark or as dividends
to the extent the investment exceeded SMF available common stock amount.

The Company Certificate of Incorporation authorizes the issuance of up to
100,000,000 shares of Common Stock, par value $10 per share, and 10,000,000
shares of Preferred Stock, par value $10 per share. Each share of presently
outstanding Common Stock and each share of Common Stock issued after the date of
this report will have attached to it, one right to purchase from the Company one
one-hundredth 1/100 of a share of a series of Preferred Stock designated as
the Series A Junior Participating Preferred Stock the Series A Preferred
Stock a Right. Each Right entitles a shareholder to purchase from the
Company one one-hundredth 1/100 of a share of the Series A Preferred Stock at
a price of $65 per one one-hundredth 1/100 of a share, subject to certain
anti-dilution adjustments. The Rights, however, become exercisable only at such
time as a person or group acquires, or commences a public tender or exchange
offer for, 15 percent or more of the Company Common Stock. The Rights have
certain anti-takeover effects since they may cause substantial dilution to a
person or group that attempts to acquire the Company on terms not approved by
the Company Board of Directors. The Rights should not interfere with any
merger or other business combination approved by the Board of Directors since
they may be redeemed by the Company at $01 per Right at any time until a person
or group has obtained beneficial ownership of 15 percent or more of the voting
stock. The Rights will expire at the close of business on October 1, 2005,
unless redeemed earlier by the Company.
The Series A Preferred Stock will be non-redeemable and, unless otherwise
provided in connection with the creation of a subsequent series of preferred
stock, will be subordinate to any other series of the Company preferred stock.
Each share of Series A Preferred Stock will be entitled to receive when, as and
if declared, a quarterly dividend in an amount equal to the greater of $1 per
share or 100 times the cash dividends declared on the Company Common Stock. In
addition, the Series A Preferred Stock is entitled to 100 times any non-cash
dividends other than dividends payable in shares of Common Stock or a
subdivision of the outstanding shares of Common Stock declared on the Common
Stock, in like kind. In the event of a liquidation, the holders of the Series A
Preferred Stock will be entitled to receive a liquidation payment in an amount
equal to the greater of $100 per share or 100 times the payment made per share
of Common Stock. Each share of Series A Preferred Stock will have 100 votes,
voting together with the Common Stock. In the event of any merger, consolidation
or other transaction in which common shares are exchanged, each share of Series
A Preferred Stock will be entitled to receive 100 times the amount received per
share of Common Stock. The rights of the Series A Preferred Stock as to
dividends, liquidation and voting are protected by antidilution provisions.
The Company Equity Participation Plan the Plan, adopted on October
23, 1995 provides that eligible employees may be granted stock options which,
when exercised, give the recipient the right to purchase the Company Common
Stock at a price no less than the fair market value as defined in the Plan
of such stock at grant date. Options awarded under the Plan only become
exercisable after specified periods of employment after the grant thereof 30
percent after the first year, 30 percent after the second and the remaining 40
percent after the third year. Generally, such options expire ten years
subsequent to the date of grant.
The Company has adopted the expanded disclosures of SFAS No. 123. The
Company has elected to continue to apply the intrinsic value method of measuring
compensation under APB Opinion No. 25 in accounting for its stock-based
compensation awards to employees. No charge is made against earnings in the
Company financial statements for employee stock-based compensation awards
under its current Plan. Had compensation cost for the Plan been determined based

method of SFAS No. 123, the Company net income and earnings per share would

The valuation under SFAS No. 123 was based on the Black-Scholes option
pricing model with the market value of the stock equal to the exercise price, an
estimated volatility over the ten year option term of 30 percent for the 1997
awards and 32 percent for the 1996 and 1995 awards, a risk-free rate of return
based upon the zero coupon government bond yield, and an assumed quarterly
dividend of $015 per share. Certain grants awarded after the spin-off in 1995
were considered modifications of Kimberly-Clark stock options previously held by
employees of the Company. At both December 31, 1997 and 1996, 1,500,000 shares

NOTE 9. RESTRUCTURING CHARGE
In December 1995, the Company announced its decision to exit the U.S.
reconstituted tobacco leaf RTL product line and to restructure operations in
France, which resulted in a one-time restructuring charge against operating
profit in the amount of $73 $59 in the U.S. and $14 in France.
Approximately $47 of the reserve was utilized during 1996 for a non-cash
write-down of assets. The cash charges were primarily for severance related
costs in France and costs of mothballing the equipment of the U.S. RTL
operations. The plan was completed on schedule and the associated restructuring
reserve was closed out at the end of the third quarter, 1996. The Company
decision to exit the U.S. RTL product line had no impact on the Company U.S.
wrapper and binder business, its RTL business in France, or the Company
commitment to reconstituted tobacco worldwide.
During the fourth quarter of 1997, the U.S. RTL production line was
restarted to support the growth of the French RTL business while alternatives
for additional capacity are being considered.
NOTE 10. RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS
Prior to the Distribution, Kimberly-Clark was a related party and
subsidiaries of Kimberly-Clark were affiliates. For all periods presented,
Kimberly-Clark and affiliated companies have provided services to and incurred
costs on behalf of the Company. The costs of certain services, including, but
not limited to, property and casualty insurance coverage under the
Kimberly-Clark insurance program, administrative services, management
information services, employee benefits administration, environmental
consultation and administration, central purchasing, transportation services,
tax services, treasury services, accounting and reporting, and the
Kimberly-Clark Equity Participation Plan were allocated to the Businesses for
the period prior to the Distribution and billed to the Company after the
Distribution. The allocations and billings of costs and expenses for these
services were based on methods that management believes are reasonable including
use of time estimates, headcount and transaction statistics, and similar
activity-based data. The actual costs to be incurred by the Company in the
future to replace the services still provided by Kimberly-Clark and affiliated
companies may increase from currently billed amounts due to differences in
scale, organizational structure, management structure and other factors.
The costs allocated and other intercompany and interdivisional transactions
between Kimberly-Clark and affiliated companies and the Company were as follows
for the eleven months ended November 30, 1995 the period prior to the
Distribution:
1995
Operating expenses costs for services described above. $150
Interest   104
Interest   137
Purchases of wood   139
Prior to the Distribution, the Company participated in Kimberly-Clark and
certain affiliated companies' cash management programs, under which the
Company cash needs were funded by Kimberly-Clark and certain affiliates
thereof, and the Company excess cash was transferred to Kimberly-Clark and
such affiliates. In the U.S. and Canada, such advances and transfers prior to
the Distribution are shown as interdivisional transactions and were noninterest
bearing. In France, prior to the Distribution, SMF functioned as a cash
management and financing entity for other Kimberly-Clark affiliates, primarily
in France. The financial statements accordingly reflected affiliate loans, notes
payable, interest income and expense and stockholder equity transactions to
accomplish Kimberly-Clark financing objectives for the periods prior to the
Distribution.
The Company had sales to the minority shareholder of LTRI of $140, $184
and $150 in 1997, 1996 and 1995, respectively.

NOTE 11. FOREIGN CURRENCY
Foreign currency losses have arisen from settlement of transactions in
non-local currencies and the remeasurement of non-local currency denominated
monetary assets and liabilities into the currency of the country in which the
operation is domiciled. Such losses were primarily related to receivables from
and payables to affiliated companies unrelated to the Businesses prior to the
Distribution. Such losses included in other expense, net were nominal in 1997,
1996 and 1995.
Foreign currency risks arise from transactions and commitments denominated
in non-local currencies. In addition to affiliated company debt, these
transactions and commitments may include the purchase of inventories or
property, plant and equipment, the sale of products and the repayment of loans.
Management selectively hedges the Company foreign currency risks when it
is practicable and economical to do so. The instruments are purchased from
well-known money center banks, insurance companies or government agencies
counterparties. Usually the contracts extend for no more than 12 months,
although their contractual term has been as long as 18 months. Credit risks with
respect to the counterparties, and the foreign currency risks that would not be
hedged if the counterparties fail to fulfill their obligations under the
contracts, are minimal in view of the financial strength of the counterparties.
Gains and losses on instruments that hedge firm commitments are deferred
and included in the basis of the underlying hedged items. Premiums paid for
options are amortized ratably over the life of the option. All other gains and
losses are included in period income based on the period-end market price of the
instrument.
At December 31, 1997, there were outstanding forward contracts, which were
held for purposes other than trading, maturing at various dates in 1998, to
purchase $41 of various foreign currencies. These contracts have not given rise
to any significant net deferred gains or losses as of December 31, 1997.
NOTE 12. COMMITMENTS
Operating Leases
Future minimum obligations under non-cancelable operating leases having an
initial or remaining term in excess of one year as of December 31, 1997 are less
than $1 annually over the next five years. Rental expense under operating leases
was $40, $39 and $39 for the years ended December 31, 1997, 1996 and 1995,
respectively.
Other Commitments
The Company has entered into long-term contracts for the purchase of
certain raw materials. Minimum purchase commitments, at current prices, are
approximately $06 in 1998. These purchase commitments are not expected to
result in losses.
The Company has also entered into certain contracts for the purchase of
equipment and related costs in connection with its ongoing capital projects.
These commitments at December 31, 1997 totaled approximately $49.
NOTE 13. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS
Under the terms of the Distribution, the Company assumed liability for and
agreed to indemnify Kimberly-Clark from litigation arising out of the operation
of the Businesses, including the following cases:
- In January 1997, James E. McCune on behalf of himself and other nicotine
dependent West Virginia cigarette smokers filed, in the Circuit Court of
Kanawha County, West Virginia, a purported class action against several
tobacco companies, industry trade associations and consultants, tobacco

wholesalers and cigarette component manufacturers, including
Kimberly-Clark, seeking equitable relief and compensatory and punitive
damages in an unspecified amount for mental suffering and physical
injuries allegedly sustained as a result of having smoked cigarettes. The
nine-count complaint sets forth several theories of liability, including
intentional and negligent misrepresentation, negligence, product
liability, breach of warranty and conspiracy. Among other things, the
complaint alleges that nicotine is an addictive substance, that the
tobacco companies, by using reconstituted tobacco, are able to control the
precise amount of nicotine in their cigarettes and that LTRI specializes
in the reconstitution process to help the tobacco companies control
nicotine levels.
- On February 13, 1998, Cleo Huffman, on behalf of herself and her deceased
husband, filed a complaint in the Circuit Court of Kanawha County, West
Virginia, against several tobacco companies, industry trade associations
and consultants, tobacco wholesalers, Kimberly-Clark, LTRI and others,
seeking equitable relief, $20 in compensatory damages and $30 in
punitive damages allegedly sustained as a result of the death of her
husband which plaintiff contends was caused by his addiction to smoking
Camel cigarettes. The fourteen-count complaint sets forth several theories
of liability, including intentional and negligent misrepresentation,
breach of express and implied warranties, intentional infliction of
emotional distress, product liability, sale of an unreasonably dangerous
product and conspiracy.
As a component supplier, the Company believes that it has meritorious
defenses to each of these cases, but due to the uncertainties of litigation, the
Company cannot predict their outcome. The Company is unable to make a meaningful
estimate of the amount or range of loss which could result from an unfavorable
outcome of these actions. These cases will be vigorously defended.
Also, the Company is involved in certain other legal actions and claims
arising in the ordinary course of business. Management believes that such
litigation and claims will be resolved without a material effect on the
Company financial statements.
NOTE 14. ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS
The Company operations are subject to federal, state and local laws,
regulations and ordinances relating to various environmental matters. The nature
of the Company operations expose it to the risk of claims with respect to
environmental matters and there can be no assurance that material costs or
liabilities will not be incurred in connection with such claims. Based on the
Company experience to date, the Company believes that its future cost of
compliance with environmental laws, regulations and ordinances, and its exposure
to liability for environmental claims, will not have a material adverse effect
on the Company financial condition or results of operations. However, future
events, such as changes in existing laws and regulations, or unknown
contamination of sites owned, operated or used for waste disposal by the Company
including contamination caused by prior owners and operators of such sites or
other waste generators may give rise to additional costs which could have a
material adverse effect on the Company financial condition or results of
operations.
Prior to the Distribution, Kimberly-Clark was named a potentially
responsible party PRP under the provisions of the U.S. Comprehensive
Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act CERCLA, or analogous
state statutes, in connection with two waste disposal sites utilized by the
Company Spotswood, New Jersey mill and one site used by the Company former
Mt. Holly Springs, Pennsylvania mill. Prior to the Distribution, the Spotswood
mill also responded to an information request by the New Jersey Department of
Environmental Protection and Energy with respect to another landfill site
allegedly used by the Spotswood mill. The Company has assumed Kimberly-Clark
liabilities at each of these sites but does not believe that any of these
proceedings will result in the imposition of monetary sanctions or have a
material adverse effect on the Company business or financial condition.

In December 1997, the Company received notification from the Environmental
Protection Agency EPA that, pursuant to CERCLA, it may be named as a
potentially responsible party in connection with a 1986 shipment of transformer
oil containing polychlorinated biphenyl PCB for which the Company Lee
mills had contracted to have transported to a disposal site by a transporter.
The Company expects to be indemnified by the transporter for any liability
connected with such shipment.
The Company assumed responsibility to administer a consent order between
Kimberly-Clark and the Massachusetts Department of Environmental Protection
MDEP governing the post-closure care of the Willow Hill Landfill in Lee,
Massachusetts. The Company is obligated to maintain the integrity of the cover
and to sample groundwater by means of monitoring wells, in addition to other
long-term maintenance responsibilities for this former non-hazardous waste
disposal facility. Under the terms of a consent order signed on January 24, 1997
with MDEP resulting from a Comprehensive Site Assessment and a Corrective Action
Alternative Assessment CAAA submitted by the Company to MDEP, the Company
had until September 10, 1997 to correct a gas migration problem by means of a
passive gas venting system. Since the passive venting system did not bring the
site into compliance by mid-September 1997, the Company, as required by the
consent order, submitted to MDEP a revised compliance plan which employs an
active gas collection system. The Company expects that the required permits for
such system will be issued in the first quarter of 1998. The Company must
activate the system no later than 120 days after issuance of such permits. The
estimated total cost of such plan, including annual operating expenses, is $05,
which amount has been accrued as of December 31, 1997.
All of the Company U.S. facilities may be affected by revised air
emissions and wastewater discharge standards under rules commonly known as the
Cluster Rules. Although the EPA originally indicated that the proposed rules
would be finalized in 1996, final rules have just recently been issued.
However the final rules have not yet been published. The first phase of the
Cluster Rules would affect only wastewater discharges from the Ancram, New York
mill and the Lee mills and would require compliance within three years after the
issuance of the new rules. The Spotswood mill discharges its effluent to a
publicly-owned treatment works. Capital expenditures for compliance with the
first phase of the Cluster Rules at the Ancram and Lee mills are estimated to be
between $4 and $7 in the aggregate. However, due to uncertainty concerning
applicable requirements under the final Cluster Rules, the Company can give no
assurance that this estimate will accurately reflect the actual cost of
compliance. In addition, the later phases of the Cluster Rules and/or Title V
of the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990 may further regulate air emissions and
wastewater discharges from the Spotswood mill and require the Company to install
additional air pollution controls at its other U.S. facilities sometime after
the year 2000. Potential capital expenditures to comply with this subsequent
phase of the Cluster Rules and/or Title V of the Clean Air Act Amendments cannot
be estimated until after the EPA proposes applicable requirements, if any.
The Company incurs spending necessary to meet legal requirements and
otherwise relating to the protection of the environment at the Company
facilities in the United States, France and Canada, including the aforementioned
Cluster Rules. For these purposes, the Company incurred total capital
expenditures of $27 in 1997, and anticipates that it will incur approximately
$3 to $5 annually in 1998 and 1999. The major projects included in these
estimates include upgrading wastewater treatment facilities at various locations
and installation of equipment to treat volatile organic compound emissions in
France. Approximately $2 of the total environmental capital spending estimates
for 1998 and 1999 relate to projects anticipated as necessary to comply with the
wastewater discharge requirements of the initial phase of the Cluster Rules. The
balance of expenditures required for compliance with the initial phase of the
Cluster Rules is expected to occur in 2000. The foregoing capital expenditures
are not expected to reduce the Company ability to invest in capacity
expansion, quality improvements, capital replacements, productivity
improvements, or cost containment projects, and are not expected to have a
material adverse effect on the Company financial condition or results of
operations.

NOTE 16. ACQUISITIONS
On February 2, 1998, the Company wholly-owned subsidiary, SM-Spain, paid
approximately $620 in cash for 9997 percent ownership interest in Companhia
Industrial de Papel Pirahy Pirahy, a specialty paper manufacturer located
near Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. Pirahy provides the Company with a manufacturing
facility on a third continent. Pirahy is the largest supplier of tobacco-related
papers to South America. It also produces printing and writing papers as well as
papers for packaging and labeling applications.
In connection with the acquisition of Pirahy, the Company entered into a
bridge loan arrangement with a bank, which was in place at December 31, 1997, in
the amount of $200 in order to assure the sellers of its ability to finance the
purchase. Subsequent to December 31, 1997, the Company modified its existing
Credit Agreement to provide an additional $200 term loan to SM-Spain. SM-Spain
borrowed the remaining funds for the transaction from SMF, which in turn
utilized its existing cash balances and borrowings from the Revolving Credit
Facilities.
Additionally, on February 11, 1998, the Company second tier subsidiary,
SM-Enterprises paid 372 million French francs approximately $61 in cash and
assumed approximately $58 in existing debt for all of the outstanding shares of
Ingefico, S.A. and 971 percent of the outstanding shares of its pulp and
specialty paper manufacturing subsidiaries, Groupe SAPAM and Papeteries de la
Moulasse, located in St. Girons in the southwestern part of France. This
acquisition, while important to the strategic growth of the Company and its
ability to meet the demands of its customers, is not considered material to the
consolidated financial statements.

SCHWEITZER-MAUDUIT INTERNATIONAL, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES
REPORT OF INDEPENDENT AUDITORS
To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of Schweitzer-Mauduit International,
Inc.:
We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of
Schweitzer-Mauduit International, Inc. and subsidiaries as of December 31, 1997
and 1996, and the related consolidated statements of income and cash flow for
the years ended December 31, 1997, 1996 and 1995. These financial statements are
the responsibility of the Company management. Our responsibility is to express
an opinion on these financial statements based on our audits.
We conducted our audits in accordance with generally-accepted auditing
standards. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material
misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting
the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes
assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by
management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.
We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
In our opinion, such consolidated financial statements present fairly, in
all material respects, the consolidated financial position of Schweitzer-Mauduit
International, Inc. and subsidiaries as of December 31, 1997 and 1996, and the
consolidated results of their operations and their cash flows for the years
ended December 31, 1997, 1996 and 1995 in conformity with generally accepted
accounting principles.

MANAGEMENT'S RESPONSIBILITY FOR FINANCIAL REPORTING
The management of Schweitzer-Mauduit International, Inc. is responsible for
conducting all aspects of the business, including the preparation of the
financial statements in this annual report. The financial statements have been
prepared using generally accepted accounting principles considered appropriate
in the circumstances to present fairly the Company consolidated financial
position, results of operations and cash flows on a consistent basis. Management
also has prepared the other information in this annual report and is responsible
for its accuracy and consistency with the financial statements.
As can be expected in a complex and dynamic business environment, some
financial statement amounts are based on management estimates and judgments.
Even though estimates and judgments are used, measures have been taken to
provide reasonable assurance of the integrity and reliability of the financial
information contained in this annual report. These measures include an effective
control-oriented environment in which a company-wide internal control program
plays an important role, independent audits, and the establishment of an Audit
Committee of the Board of Directors which oversees the financial reporting
process. As part of that responsibility, the Audit Committee recommended to the
Board of Directors the selection of the Company independent public
accountants, Deloitte & Touche LLP.
One characteristic of a control-oriented environment is a system of
internal control over financial reporting and over safeguarding of assets
against unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition, designed to provide
reasonable assurance to management and the Board of Directors regarding
preparation of reliable published financial statements and such asset
safeguarding. The system is supported with written policies and procedures and
contains self-monitoring mechanisms. Appropriate actions are taken by management
to correct deficiencies as they are identified. All internal control systems
have inherent limitations, including the possibility of circumvention and
overriding of controls, and therefore, can provide only reasonable assurance as
to financial statement preparation and such asset safeguarding. Management
believes the Company system of internal control maintains an appropriate
cost-benefit relationship.
The Company has also adopted a code of conduct which, among other things,
contains policies for conducting business affairs in a lawful and ethical manner
in each country in which it does business, for avoiding potential conflicts of
interest, and for preserving confidentiality of information and business ideas.
Internal controls have been implemented to provide reasonable assurance that the
code of conduct is followed.
The financial statements have been audited by Deloitte & Touche LLP. During
their audits, the independent auditors were given unrestricted access to all
financial records and related data. Management believes that all representations
made to the independent auditors during their audits were valid and appropriate.
During the audits conducted by the independent auditors, management
received minor recommendations to strengthen or modify internal controls in
response to developments and changes. Management has adopted, or is in the
process of adopting, all recommendations which are cost-effective.
