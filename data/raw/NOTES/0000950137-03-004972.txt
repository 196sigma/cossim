To the Shareholders of
Bone Care International, Inc.   We have audited the accompanying balance sheets of Bone Care International,
Inc. as of June 30, 2003 and 2002, and the related statements of operations,
shareholders' equity, and cash flows for the years then ended. Our audits also
included the 2003 and 2002 financial statement schedules included in Item 14.
These financial statements and financial statement schedules are the
responsibility of the Company management. Our responsibility is to express an
opinion on the 2003 and 2002 financial statements and financial statement
schedules based on our audits. The financial statements and financial schedule
for the year ended June 30, 2001, before the inclusion of the transitional
disclosures required by Statement of Financial Accounting Standard SFAS No.
142 Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets discussed in Note 1 of the financial
statements, were audited by other auditors who have ceased operations. Those
other auditors expressed an unqualified opinion on those financial statements
and stated that such 2001 financial statement schedule, when considered in
relation to the 2001 basic financial statements taken as a whole, presented
fairly, in all material respects, the information set forth therein, in their
report dated August 1, 2001.
We conducted our audits in accordance with auditing standards generally
accepted in the United States of America. Those standards require that we plan
and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial
statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a
test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial
statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and
significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall
financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a
reasonable basis for our opinion.
In our opinion, the 2003 and 2002 financial statements present fairly, in
all material respects, the financial position of Bone Care International, Inc.
as of June 30, 2003 and 2002, and the results of its operations and its cash
flows for the years then ended in conformity with accounting principles
generally accepted in the United States of America. Also, in our opinion, the
2003 and 2002 financial statement schedules, when considered in relation to the
2003 and 2002 basic financial statements taken as a whole, present fairly, in
all material respects, the information set forth therein.
As discussed above, the financial statements of Bone Care International,
Inc. for the year ended June 30, 2001, were audited by other auditors who have
ceased operations. As described in Note 1, these financial statements have been
revised to include the transitional disclosures required by SFAS No. 142, which
was adopted by the Company as of July 1, 2001. Our audit procedures with respect
to the disclosures in Note 1 with respect to 2001 included i comparing the
previously reported net income to the previously issued financial statements and
the adjustments to reported net income representing amortization expense
including any related tax effects recognized in those periods related to
goodwill to the Company underlying records obtained from management, and ii
testing the mathematical accuracy of the reconciliation of adjusted net income
to reported net income and the related loss-per-share amounts. In our opinion,
the disclosures for 2001 in Note 1 are appropriate. However, we were not engaged
to audit, review, or apply any procedures to the 2001 financial statements of
the Company other than with respect to such disclosures and, accordingly, we do
not express an opinion or any other form of assurance on the 2001 financial
statements taken as a whole.
