54 48 Table of Contents Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm To the Board of Directors and Stockholders
Electro-Optical Sciences, Inc. We have audited the accompanying balance sheets of Electro-Optical Sciences, Inc. as of
December31, 2007 and 2008, and the related statements of operations, stockholders equity, and
cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended December31, 2008. These financial
statements are the responsibility of the Companys management. Our responsibility is to express an
opinion on these financial statements based on our audits. We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting
Oversight Board United States. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to
obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material
misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and
disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting
principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall
financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our
opinion. In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material
respects, the financial position of Electro-Optical Sciences, Inc., as of December31, 2007 and
2008, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the years in the three-year
period ended December31, 2008, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the
United States of America. We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting
Oversight Board United States, Electro-Optical Sciences, Inc.s internal control over financial
reporting as of December31, 2008, based on criteria established in Internal Control Integrated
Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission, and our
report dated February26, 2009 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon. s/ Eisner LLP New York, New York

In thousands, except for share and per share data 1. Principal Business Activities and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Organization and Business Electro-Optical Sciences, Inc., a Delaware corporation the Company, is focused on the
development of a non-invasive, point-of-care instrument for assisting in the early diagnosis of
melanoma. The Company has entered into a Protocol Agreement with the Food and Drug Administration
FDAwhich is an agreement for the conduct of the pivotal clinical trial and establishment of the
safety and effectiveness of the MelaFind device. On October12, 2006, the Company
announced that the FDA informed the Company that when submitted, the MelaFind premarket
approval, or PMA, application would receive expedited review. Expedited review means that upon
filing our PMA, the FDA will conduct a team review, prioritize the application, and allocate
sufficient resources toward a 180day review period. While the expedited review could shorten the
MelaFind FDA approval process, there can be no assurance that this will be the case.
The data accrual phase of the MelaFind pivotal trial was completed in the third quarter of 2008
and the image processing classification algorithms were finalized during the fourth quarter. At
year end 2008, the databases were undergoing third-party statistical validation and the
classification algorithms were undergoing software verification and validation. We are currently
working to complete our pre-market approval application. To date, the Company has not generated any revenues from MelaFind. All of the
Companys historical revenues have come from activities and products that have since been
discontinued, including the DIFOTI product, a non-invasive imaging device for the
detection of dental cavities. The Company discontinued all operations associated with its
DIFOTI product effective as of April5, 2005, in order to focus its resources on the
development and commercialization of MelaFind. As more fully described in Note 10, in
December2006, the Company sold and licensed its rights to the DIFOTI assets and does
not expect to have any significant continuing responsibility for the DIFOTI business or
products. At December31, 2008, the Company has an accumulated deficit of $608million and anticipates
that it will continue to incur net losses for the foreseeable future in the development and
commercialization of the Melafind device. From inception, the Company has financed
operations primarily through the sale of convertible preferred stock and subsequently sold common
stock as part of an initial public offering on October28, 2005, private placements in November
2006 and August2007, and a registered direct offering which closed August8, 2008 refer to Note
7, Stockholders Equity, for further details. With the exception of the additional funds that
will be needed in order to achieve significant commercialization of MelaFind, the
Company believes that the proceeds from these transactions will permit the Company to fund its
anticipated levels of operations through early 2010. The Company faces certain risks and
uncertainties which are present in many emerging medical device companies regarding future
profitability, ability to obtain future capital, protection of patents and property rights,
competition, rapid technological change, government regulations, changing health care marketplace,
recruiting and retaining key personnel, and third party manufacturing organizations. Business Segments The Companys operations are confined to one business segment: the design and development of
MelaFind. Cash and Cash Equivalents The Companys cash is held in a nationally-chartered bank and the amount the Company
currently maintains with this bank exceeds the current federal insurance limits provided by the
Federal Deposit Insurance Company. The Company has not experienced any loss of its cash or interest
income. Cash equivalents are highly liquid debt instruments with an original maturity of three
months or less at the date of acquisition. The carrying value of these instruments approximates
fair value. 54 Table of Contents Marketable Securities Marketable securities are classified in accordance with SFAS No115, Accounting for Certain
Investments in Debt and Equity Securities. Held-to-maturity marketable securities are reported at
amortized cost. Available for sale marketable securities are reported at fair value, with
unrealized gains and losses excluded from earnings, and reported in other comprehensive income.
Trading securities are reported at fair value, with unrealized gains and losses included in
earnings. The Company evaluates declines in fair value of its investments in available-for-sale
marketable securities to determine if these declines are other than temporary. When a decline in
value is determined to be other-than-temporary, an impairment charge would be recorded and a new
cost basis in the investment would be established. The Company adopted SFAS No157, Fair Value Measurements, on January1, 2008. SFAS No157,
among other things, defines fair value, establishes a consistent framework for measuring fair value
and expands disclosure for each major asset and liability category measured at fair value on either
a recurring or nonrecurring basis. SFAS No157 clarifies that fair value is an exit price,
representing the amount that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in
an orderly transaction between market participants. As such, fair value is a market-based
measurement that should be determined based on assumptions that market participants would use in
pricing an asset or liability. As a basis for considering such assumptions, SFAS No157
establishes a three-tier fair value hierarchy, which prioritizes the inputs used in measuring fair
value as follows   
Level 1:
Observable inputs such as quoted prices in active markets   
Level 2:
Inputs, other than the quoted prices in active markets, that are observable either
directly or indirectly; and   
Level 3:
Unobservable inputs in which there is little or no market data, which require the
reporting entity to develop its own assumptions. Property and Equipment Depreciation of property and equipment is provided for by the straight-line method over the
estimated useful lives of the related assets. Leasehold improvements are amortized over the lesser
of the assets useful lives or the remaining term of the lease. Patents Patents are carried at cost less accumulated amortization which is calculated on a
straight-line basis over a period of 15years. Revenue Recognition The Company has not received FDA approval for the sale of MelaFind and has had no
revenues from products other than from the sale of DIFOTI products. Income Taxes The Company accounts for income taxes under the provisions of SFAS No109, Accounting for
Income Taxes, which requires the use of the asset and liability method of accounting for deferred
income taxes see Note 11. The provision for income taxes includes federal, state and local income taxes currently
payable and deferred taxes resulting from temporary differences between the financial statement and
tax bases of assets and liabilities. Valuation allowances are recorded to reduce deferred tax
assets when it is more likely than not that a tax benefit will not be realized. In accordance with Accounting Standards Board FASB Interpretation No48 Accounting for
Uncertainty in Income Taxes an interpretation of FASB Statement No109 FIN 48, which became
effective for the Company as of January1, 2007, the Company would recognize the tax benefit from
an uncertain tax position only if it is more-likely-than-not that the tax position will be
sustained upon examination by the taxing authorities, based on the technical merits of the
position. The tax benefits to be recognized in the financial statements from such a position would
be measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than fifty percent likelihood of being
realized upon ultimate resolution. 55 Table of Contents The
Companys reassessment of its tax positions in accordance with FIN 48 did not have a material impact on
its results of operations and financial position. Estimates The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally
accepted in the US requires the use of estimates and assumptions by management that affect reported
amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date
of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting
period. The most significant estimates relate to stock-based compensation arrangements and accrued
expenses. Actual results could differ from these estimates. Long-lived Assets The Company reviews long-lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in
circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. An asset is
considered to be impaired when the sum of the undiscounted future net cash flows expected to result
from the use of the asset and its eventual disposition exceeds its carrying amount. The amount of
impairment loss, if any, is measured as the difference between the net book value of the asset and
its estimated fair value. Research and Development Research and development costs are expensed as incurred. Stock-Based Compensation The Company records compensation expense associated with stock options and other forms of
equity compensation in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No123 revised
2004, Share-Based Payment SFAS 123R, as interpreted by SEC Staff Accounting Bulletins No107
and No110. A compensation charge is recorded when it is probable that performance conditions will
be satisfied. The probability of vesting is updated at each reporting period and compensation is
adjusted via a cumulative catch-up adjustment or prospectively depending upon the nature of the
change. Options or warrants issued to non-employees for services are recorded at fair value and
accounted for in accordance with Emerging Issues Task Force EITFIssue No96-18, Accounting for
Equity Instruments That Are Issued to Other Than Employees for Acquiring, or in Conjunction with
Selling, Goods or Services. For equity instruments that are not immediately vested, compensation
cost is measured on the date such instruments vest or a performance commitment is reached, as
defined in EITF 96-18. Under this method of accounting, the Company estimates the total amount of
deferred compensation when the grant is issued for the entire option value based on the
Black-Scholes valuation model. Subsequently, the deferred compensation is adjusted each reporting
period until vesting occurs and the charge is taken. Compensation attributable to non-vested
options is not recorded until vesting occurs see Note 8. Financial Instruments The Companys financial instruments consist principally of cash and cash equivalents,
marketable securities and accounts payable. The Company believes the financial instruments
recorded values approximate current values because of their nature and respective durations. Net Loss per Common Share Net loss per share is presented in accordance with the provisions of SFAS No128, Earnings
Per Share EPS. Basic EPS excludes dilution for potentially dilutive securities and is computed
by dividing loss attributable to common stockholders by the weighted average number of common
shares outstanding during the period. Diluted EPS gives effect to dilutive options, warrants and
other potential common shares outstanding during the period. Diluted net loss per common share is
equal to basic net loss per common share since all potentially dilutive securities are
anti-dilutive for each of the periods presented. Potential common stock equivalents excluded
consist of stock options and warrants which are summarized as follows

marketable securities. Cumulative unrealized gains and losses on available-for-sale marketable
securities, if any, are reflected as accumulated other comprehensive loss in stockholders equity
on the Companys balance sheet. For the year ended December31, 2006, net loss was equal to
comprehensive loss as there were no unrealized gains or losses on available-for-sale marketable
securities at year end. For the year ended December31, 2007, comprehensive loss was $11,949 which
includes a net loss of $11,937 and an unrealized loss on available-for-sale marketable securities
of $12. For the year ended December31, 2008, comprehensive loss was $17,600 which includes a net
loss of $17,605 and an unrealized gain on available-for-sale marketable securities of $5. Recently
Adopted Accounting Pronouncements In February2007, the Financial Accounting Standards Board FASB issued SFAS No159, The
Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities, including an amendment to SFAS
No115 SFAS No159. This statement permits entities to choose to measure many financial
instruments and certain other items at fair value. The objective is to improve financial reporting
by providing entities with the opportunity to mitigate volatility in reporting earnings caused by
measuring related assets and liabilities differently without having to apply complex hedge
accounting provisions. This statement is expected to expand the use of fair value measurements,
which is consistent with the FASBs long-term measurement objectives for accounting for financial
instruments. SFAS No159 is effective for fiscal years beginning after November15, 2007. The
adoption of SFAS No159 did not have a material impact on the Companys financial statements. In September2006, the FASB issued SFAS No157, Fair Value Measurements SFAS 157. This
statement defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value, and expands
disclosures about fair value measurements. This statement relating to financial assets is effective
for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after November15, 2007. The adoption
of SFAS 157 did not have a material impact on the Companys financial statements. The provisions
of SFAS 157 related to other non-financial assets and liabilities will be effective for the Company
on January, 1, 2009, and will be applied prospectively. The Company is currently evaluating the
impact that these additional SFAS 157 provisions will have on the Companys financial statements. Recent
Accounting Pronouncements In June2008, the FASB issued Staff Position EITF 03-6-1, Determining Whether Instruments
Granted in Share-Based Payment Transactions Are Participating Securities FSP EITF 03-6-1, which
is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after December15, 2008.
FSP EITF 03-6-1 clarifies that share-based payment awards that entitle holders to receive
nonforfeitable dividends before they vest will be considered participating securities and included
in the basic earning per share calculation. The Company does not expect that the adoption of FSP
EITF 03-6-1 will have a material effect on the financial statements. In April2008, the FASB issued FSP FAS 142-3, Determination of the Useful Life of Intangible
Assets FSP FAS 142-3. FSP FAS 142-3 amends the factors an entity should consider in developing
renewal or extension assumptions used in determining the useful life of recognized intangible
assets under SFAS No142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets. This guidance for determining
the useful life of a recognized intangible asset applies prospectively to intangible assets
acquired individually or with a group of other assets in either an asset acquisition or business
combination. FSP FAS 142-3 is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal
years, beginning after December15, 2008, earlier adoption is prohibited. The Company does not
expect that the adoption of FSP FAS 142-3 will have a material effect on the financial statements. In March2008, the FASB issued SFAS No161 Disclosures about Derivative Instruments and
Hedging Activities SFAS 161. This new standard
enhances disclosure requirements for derivative instruments in order to provide users of financial statements with an enhanced understanding of i
how and why an entity uses derivative instruments, iihow derivative instruments and related
hedged items are accounted for under SFAS No133 Accounting for Derivative Instruments and
Hedging Activities and its related interpretations, and iiihow derivative instruments and
related hedged items affect an entitys financial position, financial performance, and cash flows.
SFAS 161 is to be applied prospectively for the first annual reporting period beginning on or after
November15, 2008. The Company believes that the adoption of SFAS 161 will not have a material
impact on the Companys financial statement disclosures since the Company does not currently have
any derivative instruments. 57 Table of Contents In December2007, the FASB issued SFAS No141R, Business Combinations SFAS 141R. SFAS
141R replaces FASB SFAS No141, and establishes principles and requirements for how the acquirer
of a business recognizes and measures in its financial statements the identifiable assets acquired,
the liabilities assumed, and any noncontrolling interest in the acquired company. SFAS 141R also
provides guidance for recognizing and measuring the goodwill acquired in the business combination
and determines what information to disclose to enable users of the financial statements to evaluate
the nature and financial effects of the business combination. SFAS 141R applies prospectively to
business combinations for which the acquisition date is on or after the beginning of the first
annual reporting period beginning on or after December15, 2008. The effect of the changes will be
applicable to acquisitions on or after January1, 2009. In December2007, the FASB issued SFAS No160, Noncontrolling Interests in Consolidated
Financial Statementsan amendment of ARB No51 SFAS 160. SFAS 160 amends ARB 51 to establish
accounting and reporting standards for the noncontrolling interest in a subsidiary and for the
deconsolidation of a subsidiary. It clarifies that a noncontrolling interest in a subsidiary is an
ownership interest in the consolidated entity that should be reported as equity in the consolidated
financial statements. In addition to the amendments to ARB 51, SFAS 160 amends FASB Statement No.
128, Earnings per Share, so that earnings-per-share data will continue to be calculated the same
way those data were calculated before SFAS 160 was issued. SFAS 160 is effective for fiscal years,
and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning on or after December15, 2008. The Company
believes the adoption of this pronouncement will not have a material impact on the Companys
financial statements. 2. Marketable Securities The Companys marketable securities consist of corporate debt securities with a weighted
average maturity not in excess of twelve months. The Company classifies its marketable securities
as available-for-sale, as defined by Statement of Financial Accounting Standards SFAS No115,
Accounting for Certain Investments in Debt and Equity Securities. Available-for-sale securities
are carried at fair value, with unrealized gains and losses reported as a component of
stockholders equity in accumulated other comprehensive loss. Interest income, realized gains and
losses, and declines in value of securities judged to be other-than-temporary are included in the
Companys statement of operations. As of December31, 2008, marketable securities consisted of

As described in Note 1, the Company adopted SFAS No157 on January1, 2008. SFAS No157,
among other things, defines fair value, establishes a consistent framework for measuring fair value
and expands disclosure for each major asset and liability category measured at fair value on either
a recurring or nonrecurring basis. SFAS No157 clarifies that fair value is an exit price,
representing the amount that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in
an orderly transaction between market participants. As such, fair value is a market-based
measurement that should be determined based on assumptions that market participants would use in
pricing an asset or liability. The fair values of the Companys marketable securities on hand at December31, 2008 were
measured using quoted prices in active markets for identical assets Level 1. 58 Table of Contents 3. Property and Equipment Property and equipment, at cost, consists of the following

$156 and $179 at December31, 2007 and 2008, respectively. In connection with the discontinuance of
DIFOTI operations in April2005, patents with a net book value of $71 had been
reclassified as assets held for sale, and were subsequently written off in connection with the
December2006 sale and licensing agreement with KaVo. Amortization expense related to all
non-DIFOTI patents was approximately $18, $22 and $23 for the years ended December31,
2006, 2007 and 2008, respectively. Amortization expense of currently held non-DIFOTI
patents is expected to amount to $15, $15, $15, $13 and $7 for the years ending December31,
2009, 2010, 2011, 2012 and 2013, respectively. 5. Commitments and Contingencies The Company is obligated under two non cancelable operating leases for office space expiring
June2009 and January2011. The leases are subject to escalations for increases in operating
expenses. The approximate aggregate minimum future payments due under these leases are as follows

years ended December31, 2006, 2007, and 2008, respectively. ASKION GmbH Askion, located in Gera Germany, which specializes in precision optics, has
become an integral member of our MelaFind development team and we expect to continue to
work with ASKION for the foreseeable future. ASKION produced the MelaFind hand-held
imaging devices used in our pivotal clinical trials and is currently building additional units and
performing other additional developmental activities. Beginning in August2006, the Company, primarily through ASKION, engaged Carl Zeiss Jena GmbH
Zeiss to build the lenses and assemblies, as well as provide certain technical consulting, for
the MelaFind units which have been used in the Companys pivotal clinical trials. This
work was performed during 2007 and 2008 and is expected to continue on commercial
MelaFind units throughout 2009. The Company has an employment agreement with its President and Chief Executive Officer Dr.
Joseph Gulfo, which provides for a base salary, stock options, and discretionary performance
bonuses. The agreement, which provides for automatic one year renewal terms, currently runs
through the end of 2009. Effective March1, 2008, the Companys Board of Directors increased Dr.
Gulfos annual base salary to $280 and awarded him a bonus of $65 see also Note 8. The Company is not currently subject to any material legal proceedings, nor to managements
knowledge is any material legal proceeding threatened against the Company. 59 Table of Contents 6. Employee Benefit Plan The Company has a SIMPLE IRA defined contribution plan covering all qualified employees. An
officer of the Company serves as trustee of the plan. The Company provides a matching contribution
of up to 3% of each employees salary. Company contributions to this plan amounted to approximately
$42, $38 and $72 for the years ended December31, 2006, 2007 and 2008, respectively. 7. Stockholders Equity In December2005, the Company issued a restricted common stock award of 11,488 shares to an
employee at the closing market price of the Companys stock on the date of grant, and compensation
expense in the amount of $63 for this award was recognized on a straight line basis over the
nontransferable period. For the year ended December31, 2006, $63 was charged to compensation
expense. On October31, 2006, the Company entered into securities purchase agreements and a
registration rights agreement with certain accredited investors for the private placement of
2,312,384 shares of the Companys common stock and warrants to purchase up to 346,857 shares of the
Companys common stock for aggregate gross proceeds of approximately $132million and net proceeds
of approximately $125million. Pursuant to the securities purchase agreements, for a purchase
price of $570 each investor received one share of the Companys common stock and a warrant to
purchase 015 of a share of the Companys common stock. The warrants are five-year warrants with an
exercise price of $670 per share. On July31, 2007, the Company entered into a securities purchase agreement and a registration
rights agreement with certain accredited investors for the private placement of 2,000,178 shares of
the Companys common stock and warrants to purchase up to 500,041 shares of the Companys common
stock for aggregate gross proceeds of approximately $115million and net proceeds of approximately
$107million. The private placement closed August3, 2007. Pursuant to the securities purchase
agreement, for a purchase price of $575 each investor received one share of the Companys common
stock and a warrant to purchase 025 of a share of common stock. The warrants are five-year
warrants with an exercise price of $800 per share. Both of the private placements were completed pursuant to an exemption from registration
provided by Section42 of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and/or RegulationD promulgated
thereunder. Pursuant to the terms of the registration rights agreements, the Company filed resale
registration statements covering the shares in both private placements, including the shares
issuable upon exercise of the warrants, with the SEC. In the unlikely event that the Company fails
to meet certain obligations, as described in the registration rights agreements, the holders would
be entitled to certain monetary damages. However, in no event is the Company obligated to make payments in excess of 10% of the
aggregate purchase price of the common shares. The Company has concluded that it is unlikely that
the Company would be required to remit any payments to its investors for failing to maintain its
effectiveness. The Companys resale registration statements on Form S-3 were declared effective by
the Securities and Exchange Commission Registration No333-139056 and Registration No333-145740
on February12, 2007 and September11, 2007, respectively. On June26, 2008, the Company filed a Form S-3 shelf registration statement for an
indeterminate number of shares of common stock, warrants to purchase shares of common stock and
units consisting of a combination thereof having an aggregate initial offering price not to exceed
$40million. The SEC declared the registration statement effective on July7, 2008 file#
333-151935. Management utilized this shelf registration statement to raise additional equity
capital by completing a registered direct offering of 2,088,451 shares of the Companys common
stock for aggregate gross proceeds of $119million $11million approximate net proceeds to the
Company at a per share offering price of $568. The offering closed on August8, 2008. The Company
will require additional funds to achieve significant commercialization of MelaFind. As of December31, 2008, the Company had 10,000,000 shares of $010 par value preferred stock
authorized and no shares issued and outstanding. 60 Table of Contents 8. Stock-Based Compensation and Warrants Stock Options The Company has one stock option plan under which the board of directors may currently grant
incentives to employees, directors, consultants and collaborating scientists in the form of
incentive stock options, nonqualified stock options and restricted stock awards. The Company also
has two other stock-based compensation plans pursuant to which stock options are outstanding but no
new grants may be made. Stock awards under the Companys stock option plans have been granted at prices which are no
less than the market value of the stock on the date of the grant. Options granted under the 2005
Stock Incentive Plan 2005 Plan, are generally time-based or performance-based options and vesting
varies accordingly. Options under this plan expire up to a maximum of ten years from the date of
grant. Since the Company adopted the 2005 Plan, awards may not be granted under the Companys
previous stock option plans. On October10, 2008, the formula based option, issued in 2004 to Dr.Gulfo, from the Companys
2003 Stock Incentive Plan for 743,283 shares, at an exercise price of $046 a share, was cancelled.
On October10, 2008, Dr.Gulfo was granted stock options for 900,000 shares of the Companys common
stock at an exercise price of $375 the closing price on the grant date; 380,000 shares from the
Companys 2005 Plan previously approved for issuance by the Compensation Committee of the Board of
Directors and the stockholders of the Company, and 520,000 shares from the Companys 2005 Plan
approved for issuance by the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors subject to
stockholder approval. The exercise of these 520,000 stock options is subject to the receipt of
stockholder approval of the availability of these shares for issuance under the 2005 Plan, which is
anticipated to be solicited in the Companys 2009 Proxy Statement, but are deemed to have been
granted outside the 2005 Plan until approved by the Companys stockholders. Of the 900,000 common shares underlying these stock options granted to D. Gulfo, 180,000
shares vested immediately, 540,000 shares vest upon the Company receiving FDA approval of its PMA
application for MelaFind; and 180,000 shares vest in four equal annual installments
commencing on the date of grant, the first anniversary of which is October10, 2009. These 900,000
options expire ten years from the date of grant. The compensation expense recognized in the Statement of Operations during 2006, 2007 and 2008
for stock options and restricted stock awards amounted to $1,036, $577 and $861, respectively.
Cash received from options exercised under all share-based payment arrangements for the years ended
December31, 2006, 2007,and 2008 was $88, $115 and $73, respectively. Details regarding the valuation and accounting for stock options are as follows The fair value of each option award granted after the adoption of SFAS 123R is estimated on
the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option valuation model and assumptions as noted in the
following table

The expected life of the options is based on the observed and expected time to full-vesting,
forfeiture and exercise. Groups of employees that have similar historical exercise behavior are
considered separately for valuation purposes. The expected volatility is based on implied
volatility from other publicly-traded options and other factors. The risk-free interest rate is
based on the continuous rates provided by the U.S. Treasury with a term equal to the expected life
of the option. The expected dividend yield is zero as the Company has never paid dividends and does
not currently anticipate paying any in the foreseeable future. 61 Table of Contents At December31, 2008, stock options to purchase 2,069,080 shares of common stock at exercise
prices ranging from $46 to $775 per share are outstanding and are exercisable at various dates
through 2018. The total number of options exercisable at December31, 2006, 2007, and 2008 was
588,284, 609,901and 768,403 respectively, with weighted average exercise prices of $247, $354 and

As of December31, 2008, of the total 2,069,080 options outstanding 1,300,677 have not vested.
Of this total unvested amount 980,152 will vest upon the attainment of certain milestones, and the
balance will vest over the requisite service period. There was $3,300 of total unrecognized
compensation cost related to unvested options, of which approximately $2,201 will be recognized
upon PMA approval, $473 upon achievement of other milestones and $626 upon completion of the
requisite service period over four years. The Company will be seeking stockholder approval for increasing the shares of common stock
available for issuance pursuant to grants made under the 2005 Plan by 1,500,000 option shares,
which includes 520,000 shares of common stock to cover the October10, 2008 stock option grant to
Dr.Gulfo. As of December31, 2008 there were 402,651 shares available for future grants under the
Companys 2005 Plan. 62 Table of Contents On March24, 2006, the Company issued to its then acting Chief Operating Officer and a member
of the Board, Dr.Gerald Wagner, stock option grants of 49,500 shares of the Companys common stock
which vested immediately and 50,000 shares which vested upon commencement of the pivotal trial for
MelaFind. Compensation expense of $162 was charged to operations in 2006. With the
start of the clinical trials in late January2007, the Company recorded a $140 charge to operations
in the first quarter of 2007. Warrants Warrants outstanding at December31, 2008 include a 5-year warrant to purchase 75,000 shares
of the Companys common stock at an exercise price of $700 per share issued to one of the
Companys consultants in 2004. Also outstanding at December31, 2008 are 5-year warrants to
purchase 52,646 shares of the Companys common stock at an exercise price of $452 per share, which
expire in 2009. These 52,646 warrants were converted from SeriesC preferred stock warrants upon
completion of the initial public offering. In connection with the Companys initial public offering in October2005, the Company issued
150,000 warrants to the underwriters to purchase shares of the Companys common stock at $625 per
share. These 5-year warrants became exercisable on October28, 2006. In addition, as previously discussed, in connection with the Companys private placements in
November2006 and August2007, the Company issued warrants to purchase up to 346,857 and 500,041
shares, respectively, of the Companys common stock. The warrants are exercisable for five years
at a price of $670 and $800 per share, respectively. 9. Related Party Agreements see Note 5 The Company has in place the following consulting agreements with related parties. Consulting Agreement with Breaux Castleman In June2003, the Company entered into a consulting agreement with Breaux Castleman, the
Chairman of the Companys Board of Directors, for consulting services related to the FDA approval
of MelaFind and the Companys business and financial strategy. Under this agreement,
Mr.Castleman receives compensation for each month of services rendered. The Company made payments
pursuant to this consulting agreement of $29 in 2006, $24 in 2007 and $99 in 2008. This consulting
agreement is terminable by either party on 30days written notice. Consulting Agreement with Marek Elbaum, Ph.D. Effective May31, 2005, the Company entered into a new consulting agreement with Marek Elbaum,
PhD, the Companys former President and Chief Science and Technology Officer. In consideration of
the services as Chief Scientist to be provided, the Company agreed to pay Dr.Elbaum a monthly fee
of $15. The term of this agreement extended for a period of two years and was automatically
renewable for an additional one year period. Dr.Elbaum and the Company entered into an amended
agreement effective June1, 2007. Under the terms of the amended agreement, Dr.Elbaum will be
paid a monthly fee of $9 through January2009. Dr Elbaums contract was completed in January2009. Consulting Agreement with Robert Friedman, M.D. During June2005, the Company retained the services of Robert Friedman, M.D., for an initial
term of one year as a consultant and medical advisor to the Companys Board of Directors. In
consideration for these services, Dr.Friedman will be paid at a rate of $5 per day. This
consulting agreement is automatically renewed for successive one-year terms unless either party
terminates the agreement at least 30days prior to the expiration of the agreement. The amounts
paid to Dr.Friedman amounted to $42 in 2006, $58 in 2007 and $63 in 2008. Consulting Agreement with Gerald Wagner, Ph.D. see also Note 8 Effective April1, 2006, the Company entered into an amended and restated consulting agreement
with Gerald Wagner, Ph.D., a member of the Companys Board of Directors and its former acting Chief Operating Officer. 63 Table of Contents Under this amended consulting agreement, the Company agreed to pay Dr.
Wagner the annual amount of $180 payable monthly over the term of the agreement. In addition, in
connection with his ongoing engagement as a consultant, Dr.Wagner received a stock option grant of
50,000 shares of the Companys common stock which vested upon commencement of the pivotal trial for
Melafind in January2007. In addition, on March24, 2006, Dr.Wagner received another
stock option grant of 49,500 shares of the Companys common stock which vested immediately. With the start of the pivotal clinical trial in January2007, Dr.Wagner transitioned out of
his role as acting Chief Operating Officer and entered into an amended and restated consulting
contract with the Company. Under the terms of the amended contract, Dr.Wagner is paid a monthly
retainer of $25 and will be paid $25 for each additional consulting day. This amended agreement
will end at the option of Dr.Wagner or the Company at any time, by providing fifteen days prior
written notice, or immediately upon the mutual agreement of the Company and Dr.Wagner. The amounts
paid to Dr.Wagner amounted to $180 in 2006, $425 in 2007 and $70 in 2008. 10. Other Income including gain on sale of discontinued operations During March2007, the Company entered into an agreement with LOreal to study the
feasibility of using the Companys novel multi-spectral imaging technology for the evaluation and
differentiation of pigmented skin lesions of cosmetic importance. EOS has granted LOreal an
option to acquire an exclusive license to use EOS technology in the field covered by the research,
on terms to be mutually agreed. The option was extended and now expires on June30, 2009. The
laboratory and clinical research will be funded by LOreal. Pursuant to the agreement, LOreal is
responsible for all costs and expenses incurred in connection with the Feasibility Program, and
will reimburse EOS for expenses incurred by EOS with respect to the Feasibility Program. During
the years ended December31, 2007 and 2008, the Company earned $59 and $141, respectively recorded
as other income, to offset expenses incurred by EOS under the Feasibility Program with LOreal.
Amounts received from LOreal in advance of being earned have been recorded as deferred income. During April2005, the Company discontinued all operations associated with its
DIFOTI product, in order to focus its resources and attention on the development and
commercialization of MelaFind. In accordance with the provisions of SFAS No144,
Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-lived Assets, the results of operations of the
DIFOTI business have been excluded from continuing operations and have been reported as
discontinued operations. During December2006, the Company entered into a sale and exclusive
licensing agreement with KaVo, a leading dental equipment manufacturer, which provides for KaVo to
further develop and commercialize DIFOTI. Upon execution of the agreement, KaVo paid
the Company $500, and made a second payment of $500 in July2007. Beginning in 2008, KaVo is
required to pay to the Company a royalty stream based upon the worldwide aggregate net sales of the
licensed product, as defined in the license agreement, or a set minimum royalty payment, whichever
is greater. Royalties, if any, will be recorded when earned. For the year ended December31,
2008, the Company recorded minimum royalty income of $10. For the year ended December31, 2006 the Company recorded a gain of $781 on the sale and
licensing of its remaining DIFOTI assets based upon the cash proceeds and the
discounted value of the second payment. For the year ended December31, 2007, the Company recorded a gain of $28 on the sale of its
discontinued operations. Costs associated with the 2006 transaction with KaVo were lower than
expected and the December31, 2006 accrual to capture these expenses was partially reversed in
2007. 11. Income Taxes Because the Company has incurred net losses, it has not provided for income taxes for the
years ended December31, 2006, 2007 and 2008. 64 Table of Contents The difference between the actual income tax benefit and that computed by applying the U.S.
federal income tax rate of 34% to pretax loss from continuing operations is summarized below

In assessing the realizability of deferred tax assets, the Company considers whether it is
more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. The
ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable
income during the periods in which those temporary differences become deductible. Based on the
Companys historical net losses, management does not believe that it is more likely than not that
the Company will realize the benefits of these deferred tax assets and, accordingly, a full
valuation allowance has been recorded against the deferred tax assets as of December31, 2007 and
2008. The Companys valuation allowance against its deferred tax assets increased by $4,548, $4,786
and $7,042 for the years ended December31, 2006, 2007 and 2008, respectively. The Company has net operating loss carryforwards of approximately $236million to offset
future taxable income. The Company has experienced certain ownership changes, which under the
provisions of Section382 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, result in annual
limitations on the Companys ability to utilize its net operating losses in the future. The Company
has conducted a study to determine the extent of the limitations. Based on the study, the Company
believes that these limitations will not materially impact the Companys ability to utilize its net
operating losses in the future. However, any future equity raise by the Company may limit the use
of these net operating loss carryforwards. In July2006, the FASB issued Interpretation No48, Uncertainty in Income Taxes FIN 48.
FIN 48 applies to all tax positions and clarifies the recognition of tax benefits in the financial
statements by providing for a two-step approach of recognition and measurement. The first step
involves assessing whether the tax position is more likely than not to be sustained upon
examination based upon its technical merits. The second step involves measurement of the amount to
recognize. Tax positions that meet the more likely than not threshold are measured at the largest
amount of tax benefit that is greater than 50% likely of being realized upon ultimate finalization
with the taxing authority. The Company adopted FIN 48 on January1, 2007. As a result of the implementation of FIN 48,
the Company recognized no material adjustment in the liability for unrecognized income tax
benefits. At the adoption date of January1, 2007, the Company did not have any unrecognized tax
benefits which would favorably affect the effective tax rate if recognized in future periods, or
accrued penalties and interest. If such matters were to arise, the Company would recognize interest
and penalties related to income tax matters in income tax expense. The earliest open tax year
subject to examination is 2005. 65 Table of Contents 12. Quarterly Operating Results Unaudited The following is a summary of operating results by quarter for the years ended December31,

PART II   Item5. Controls and Procedures. Evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures Our companys management, with the participation of our chief executive officer and our chief
financial officer, has evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as
defined in Rule13a-15e under the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934 as of December31, 2008. Based on such evaluation, our chief executive officer and our chief financial officer have
concluded that, as of December31, 2008, our disclosure controls and procedures were effective to
ensure that the information we are required to disclose in reports that we file or submit to the
SEC is 1recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified under the
rules and forms of the SEC and 2accumulated and communicated to our management, including our
chief executive officer and our chief financial officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions
regarding required disclosures. 66 Table of Contents Report of Management on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over
financial reporting and for the assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial
reporting. Under the rules of the SEC, ''internal control over financial reporting procedures is
defined as a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of our
financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance
with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Internal control over financial reporting includes maintaining records, that in reasonable detail,
accurately and fairly reflect our transactions and our dispositions of assets; provide reasonable
assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary for preparation of our financial statements
in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America;
provide reasonable assurance that receipts and expenditures of company assets are made only in
accordance with management authorization; and provide reasonable assurance regarding the prevention
or the timely detection of the unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of company assets that
could have a material effect on our financial statements. Because of its inherent limitations,
internal control over financial reporting may not provide absolute assurance that a misstatement of
our financial statements would be prevented or detected. Management conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial
reporting using the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway
Commission in Internal ControlIntegrated Framework. Based on this evaluation, management concluded
that the companys internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December31, 2008. Eisner LLP, the independent registered public accounting firm, have issued their report on our
internal control over financial reporting as of December31, 2008. Their report is included in this
