Financial Statements and Supplementary Data MANAGEMENTS REPORT ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL
REPORTING Management is responsible for establishing and maintaining
effective internal control over financial reporting of the
Company. This system is designed to provide reasonable assurance
regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the
preparation of financial statements for external purposes in
accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the
United States of America. The Companys internal control over financial reporting
includes those policies and procedures that 1pertain to
the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail,
accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions
of the assets of the Company; 2provide reasonable
assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit
preparation of financial statements in accordance with
accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of
America, and that receipts and expenditures of the Company are
being made only in accordance with authorizations of management
and directors of the Company; and 3provide reasonable
assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of
unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the
Companys assets that could have a material effect on the
financial statements. Because of its inherent limitations, a system of internal
control over financial reporting can provide only reasonable
assurance and may not prevent or detect misstatements. Further,
because of changes in conditions, effectiveness of internal
control over financial reporting may vary over time. Management assessed the effectiveness of the system of internal
control over financial reporting based on the framework in
Internal ControlIntegrated Framework issued by the
Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway
Commission. Based on this assessment, management determined that
the Companys system of internal control over financial
reporting was effective as of February24, 2006. BDO Seidman, LLP, the independent registered certified public
accounting firm that audited our financial statements included
in this Form10-K,
has also audited our managements assessment of the
effectiveness of the Companys internal control over
financial reporting, as stated in their report which is included
herein. 34 REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM STEELCASE INC. GRAND RAPIDS, MICHIGAN We have audited managements assessment, included in the
accompanying Managements Report on Internal Control Over
Financial Reporting, that Steelcase Inc. maintained effective
internal control over financial reporting as of
February24, 2006, based on criteria established in
Internal Control Integrated Framework issued by the
Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission
the COSO criteria. Steelcase Inc.s management is
responsible for maintaining effective internal control over
financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness
of internal control over financial reporting. Our responsibility
is to express an opinion on managements assessment and an
opinion on the effectiveness of the Companys internal
control over financial reporting based on our audit. We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the
Public Company Accounting Oversight Board United States. Those
standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control
over financial reporting was maintained in all material
respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of
internal control over financial reporting, evaluating
managements assessment, testing and evaluating the design
and operating effectiveness of internal control, and performing
such other procedures as we considered necessary in the
circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable
basis for our opinion. A companys internal control over financial reporting is a
process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the
reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of
financial statements for external purposes in accordance with
generally accepted accounting principles. A companys
internal control over financial reporting includes those
policies and procedures that 1pertain to the maintenance
of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly
reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the
company; 2provide reasonable assurance that transactions
are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial
statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting
principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company
are being made only in accordance with authorizations of
management and directors of the company; and 3provide
reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of
unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the
companys assets that could have a material effect on the
financial statements. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over
financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.
Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future
periods are subject to the risk that controls may become
inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree
of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. In our opinion, managements assessment that Steelcase Inc.
maintained effective internal control over financial reporting
as of February24, 2006, is fairly stated, in all material
respects, based on the COSO criteria. Also in our opinion,
Steelcase Inc. maintained, in all material respects, effective
internal control over financial reporting as of
February24, 2006, based on the COSO criteria. We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the
Public Company Accounting Oversight Board United States, the
accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Steelcase Inc. as of
February24, 2006 and February25, 2005, and the
related consolidated statements of income, changes in
shareholders equity and cash flows for each of the three
years in the period ended February24, 2006 and our report
dated April7, 2006 expressed an unqualified opinion. BDO SEIDMAN, LLP Grand Rapids, Michigan April7, 2006 35 REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM STEELCASE INC. GRAND RAPIDS, MICHIGAN We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of
Steelcase Inc. as of February24, 2006 and
February25, 2005 and the related consolidated statements
of income, changes in shareholders equity, and cash flows
for each of the three years in the period ended
February24, 2006. Our audits also included the financial
statement schedule for the three years in the period ended
February24, 2006 as listed in a. These
financial statements and schedule are the responsibility of the
Companys management. Our responsibility is to express an
opinion on these financial statements and schedule based on our
audits. We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the
Public Company Accounting Oversight Board United States. Those
standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements and
schedule are free of material misstatement. An audit includes
examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and
disclosures in the financial statements and schedule, assessing
the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by
management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of
the financial statements and schedule. We believe that our
audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred
to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial
position of Steelcase Inc. at February24, 2006 and
February25, 2005 and the results of their operations and
their cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended
February24, 2006, in conformity with accounting principles
generally accepted in the United States of America. Also, in our
opinion, the financial statement schedule presents fairly, in
all material respects, the information set forth therein. As discussed in Note2, the Company adopted FASB
Interpretation No46R, Consolidation of Variable
Interest Entities, in the year ended February27, 2004. We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the
Public Company Accounting Oversight Board United States, the
effectiveness of Steelcase Inc.s internal control over
financial reporting as of February24, 2006, based on
criteria established in Internal ControlIntegrated
Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring
Organizations of the Treadway Commission COSOand our
report dated April7, 2006 expressed an unqualified opinion
thereon. BDO SEIDMAN, LLP Grand Rapids, Michigan April7, 2006 36 STEELCASE INC. CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF INCOME in millions, except per share data

1.
NATURE OF OPERATIONS Steelcase Inc. is the worlds leading designer, marketer,
and manufacturer of office furniture. Founded in 1912, we are
headquartered in Grand Rapids, Michigan, with approximately
13,000 permanent employees and we operate manufacturing and
distribution facilities in 28 principal locations. We distribute
products through various channels including independent and
company-owned dealers in more than 800 locations throughout the
world and have led the global office furniture industry in
revenue every year since 1974. We operate under three reportable
segments: North America, Steelcase Design Partnership
SDP and International, plus an Other
category. Additional information about our reportable segments
is contained in Note14.   
2.
SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES   
Principles of Consolidation The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of
Steelcase Inc. and its majority-owned subsidiaries, except as
noted below in Majority-owned Dealer Transitions. Our
consolidation policy requires the consolidation of entities
where a controlling financial interest is obtained as well as
consolidation of variable interest entities in which we are
designated as the primary beneficiary in accordance with
Financial Accounting Standards Board FASB
Interpretation No46, Consolidation of Variable Interest
Entities FIN46R, as amended. We adopted
FIN46R in 2004 and recorded a $42net of tax
charge in cumulative effect of accounting change upon adoption.
All intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated
in consolidation. In Q1 2006, we began reporting the operating results from our
North America segment service activity on a gross basis in our
income statement. Previously, this activity was reported on a
net cost recovery basis in operating expenses since activities
such as asset management and related consulting were viewed as
an extension of product sales support. These activities have
gradually evolved into revenue generating businesses and are
expected to grow in the future as additional resources are
dedicated to these and other service activities. Accordingly, we
believe it is now appropriate to report revenues and related
costs from service activities on a gross basis. The 2006 impact
of this reporting change was an increase in revenue of $492, an
increase in cost of sales of $440 and an increase in operating
expenses of $52. This change has no impact on operating income,
but it does slightly reduce operating income as a percent of
sales.   
Fiscal Year Our fiscal year ends the last Friday in February with each
fiscal quarter including 13weeks. Each of the last three
fiscal years being presented, February24, 2006,
February25, 2005, and February27, 2004 consisted of
52weeks. Unless the context otherwise indicates, reference to a year
relates to a fiscal year rather than a calendar year.
Additionally, Q1, Q2, Q3, and Q4 2006 reference the first,
second, third, and fourth quarter of fiscal 2006, respectively.
All amounts are in millions, except per share data, data
presented as a percentage or unless otherwise indicated.   
Reclassifications Certain immaterial amounts in the prior years financial
statements have been reclassified to conform to the current
years presentation. 42 STEELCASE INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTSContinued   
Majority-owned Dealer Transitions From time to time, we obtain equity interests in dealers that we
intend to resell as soon as practicable dealer
transitions. We use the equity method of accounting for
majority-owned dealers with a transition plan in place and where
the nature of the relationship is one in which we do not
exercise participative control. In February 2004, we initiated a change in our participative
control of eight dealers where we hold a majority position in
the voting stock of the dealer. Accordingly, we consolidated the
balance sheets of these dealers as of February27, 2004 and
in subsequent periods. The consolidation of these dealers had
the effect of increasing our total assets and liabilities by
$109 at February27, 2004. The consolidation of these
dealers had the impact of increasing revenue by $762 and $801
in 2006 and 2005, increasing cost of sales by $467 and $533 in
2006 and 2005 and increasing operating expenses by $293 and
$290 in 2006 and 2005. There was no effect on net income for
those dealers previously accounted for using the equity method
of accounting since we have historically recognized our share of
income through Equity in income of unconsolidated
ventures. For those dealers where we do not share in the
earnings and losses, the consolidation of the dealers had no
impact on net income since the pretax earnings or losses were
eliminated in Other Income Expense, net.   
Foreign Currency Translation For most international operations, local currencies are
considered their functional currencies. We translate assets and
liabilities to United States dollar equivalents at exchange
rates in effect as of the balance sheet date. We translate
Consolidated Statements of Income accounts at average rates for
the period. Translation adjustments are not included in
determining net income but are disclosed and accumulated in
Other Comprehensive Income Loss within the Consolidated
Statements of Changes in Shareholders Equity until sale or
substantially complete liquidation of the net investment in the
International subsidiary takes place. Foreign currency
transaction gains and losses are recorded in Other Income
Expense, Net and included a net gain of $19 in 2006.   
Revenue Recognition Revenue consists substantially of product sales and related
service revenues. We also have finance revenue associated with
Steelcase Financial Services. Product sales are reported net of discounts and applicable
returns and allowances and are recognized when title and risks
associated with ownership have passed to the customer or dealer.
Typically, this is when the product ships. Service and finance
revenue are not material.   
Cash Equivalents Cash equivalents include demand bank deposits and highly liquid
investment securities with an original maturity of three months
or less at the time of purchase. Cash equivalents are reported
at cost, which approximates fair value, and were $1418 as of
February24, 2006 and $2102 as of February25, 2005.   
Short-term Investments Short-term investments represent auction rate securities which
are highly liquid, variable-rate debt securities. While the
underlying securities have maturities in excess of one year, the
interest rate is reset through auctions that are typically held
every 7 to 28days, creating short-term investments. The
securities trade at par on the auction dates. Interest is paid
at the end of each auction period. Because of the short interest
rate reset period, the book value of the securities approximates
fair 43 STEELCASE INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTSContinued value. In early 2006, we sold and converted all of our
short-term investments in auction rate securities to cash.   
Accounts and NotesReceivable The Company has accounts receivable for products sold to various
unconsolidated affiliates on terms generally similar to those
prevailing with unrelated third parties. Affiliates include
unconsolidated dealers and minority interests in unconsolidated
joint ventures. Accounts receivable from affiliates were not
material at February24, 2006 or February25, 2005. Notes receivable includes project financing, asset-based lending
and term financing with dealers. Notes receivable of $376 and
$573 as of February24, 2006 and February25, 2005
are included within Other Current Assets and Other
Assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. The allowance for
uncollectible notes receivable was $80 and $62 at
February24, 2006 and February25, 2005, respectively.
Notes receivable from affiliates were not material at
February24, 2006 or February25, 2005.   
Allowance for Credit Losses The allowance for credit losses related to accounts receivable,
notes receivable and our investments in leases is maintained at
a level considered by management to be adequate to absorb an
estimate of probable future losses existing at the balance sheet
date. In estimating probable losses, we review accounts that are
past due or in bankruptcy. We also review accounts that may have
higher credit risk using information available about the
customer or dealer, such as financial statements, news reports
and published credit ratings. We also use general information
regarding industry trends, the general economic environment and
information gathered through our network of field based
employees. Using an estimate of current fair market value of the
collateral and other credit enhancements, such as third party
guarantees, we arrive at an estimated loss for specific accounts
and estimate an additional amount for the remainder of the trade
balance based on historical trends. This process is based on
estimates, and ultimate losses may differ from those estimates.
Receivable balances are written off when we determine that the
balance is uncollectible. Subsequent recoveries, if any, are
credited to the allowance when received. We consider an accounts
receivable balance past due when payment has not been received
within the stated terms. We consider a note receivable past due
when any installment of the note is unpaid for more than
30days. There were no accounts past due over 90days
and still accruing interest as of February24, 2006.   
Inventories Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market. The North
America segment primarily uses the last in, first out method to
value its inventories. The SDP segment primarily uses the first
in, first out or the average cost inventory valuation methods.
The International segment values inventories primarily using the
first in, first out method.   
Property, Equipment and Other Long-lived Assets Property and equipment, including some internally-developed
internal use software, is stated at cost. Major improvements
that materially extend the useful life of the asset are
capitalized. Expenditures for repairs and maintenance are
charged to expense as incurred. Depreciation is provided using
the straight-line method over the estimated useful life of the
assets. We review the carrying value of our long-lived assets held and
used and assets to be disposed of using estimates of future
undiscounted cash flows. If the carrying value of a long-lived
asset is 44 STEELCASE INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTSContinued considered impaired, an impairment charge is recorded for the
amount by which the carrying value of the long-lived asset
exceeds its fair value. Due to the restructuring and plant consolidation activities over
the past several years, we are currently holding for sale
several facilities that are no longer in use. These assets are
stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value and are
included within Other Current Assets on the Consolidated
Balance Sheets since we expect them to be sold within one year.
See Note4 for further information.   
Operating Leases Rent expense for operating leases is recorded on a straight-line
basis over the lease term unless the lease contains an
escalation clause which is not fixed and determinable. The lease
term begins when we have the right to control the use of the
leased property, which is typically before rent payments are due
under the terms of the lease. If a lease has a fixed and
determinable escalation clause, the difference between rent
expense and rent paid is recorded as deferred rent and is
included in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Rent for operating
leases that do not have an escalation clause or where escalation
is based on an inflation index is expensed over the lease term
as it is payable.   
Long-Term Investments Long-term investments primarily include privately-held equity
securities. These investments are carried at the lower of cost
or estimated fair value. For these non-quoted investments, we
review the assumptions underlying the performance of the
privately-held companies to determine if declines in fair value
below cost basis are other-than-temporary. A series of historic
and projected operating losses by investees are considered in
the review. If a determination is made that a decline in fair
value below the cost basis is other-than-temporary, the
investment is written down to its estimated fair value. Gains on
these investments are recorded when they are realized. At
February24, 2006 and February25, 2005, the carrying
value of these investments was $61 and $58, respectively, and
was included within Other Assets on the Consolidated
Balance Sheets.   
Investment in Leases Steelcase Financial Services provides furniture leasing services
to end-use customers and showroom financing to dealers. Prior to
2004, we originated both direct financing and operating leases
and the remaining lease balance was recorded on our balance
sheet. In 2004, we implemented a new strategy in which we
originate leases for customers and earn an origination fee for
that service, but we use third parties to provide lease funding.
Our net investment in leases was $170 and $346 at
February24, 2006 and February25, 2005, respectively,
and was included within Other Current Assets and Other
Assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. This investment
has decreased over the past few years due to our new strategy as
the underlying lease schedules have run-off and certain leases
have been sold.   
Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets Goodwill represents the difference between the purchase price
and the related underlying tangible and intangible net asset
values resulting from business acquisitions. Annually, or more
frequently if conditions indicate an earlier review is
necessary, the carrying value of the goodwill of a reporting
unit is compared to an estimate of its fair value. If the
estimated fair value is less than the carrying value, goodwill
is impaired and is written down to its estimated fair value. 45 STEELCASE INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTSContinued Other intangible assets subject to amortization consist
primarily of proprietary technology, trademarks and non-compete
agreements and are amortized over their estimated useful
economic lives using the straight-line method. Other intangible
assets not subject to amortization are accounted for and
evaluated for potential impairment in a manner consistent with
goodwill.   
Self-Insurance We are self-insured for certain losses relating to workers
compensation claims and product liability claims. We have
purchased insurance coverage to reduce our exposure to
significant levels of these claims. Self-insured losses are
accrued based upon estimates of the aggregate liability for
uninsured claims incurred but not reported at the balance sheet
date using certain actuarial assumptions followed in the
insurance industry and our historical experience. Other accrued expenses in the accompanying Consolidated Balance
Sheets include a reserve for estimated future product liability
costs of $85 and $87 incurred as of February24, 2006 and
February25, 2005, respectively. Our accrual for
workers compensation claims included in the accompanying
Consolidated Balance Sheets was $343 and $317 as of
February24, 2006 and February25, 2005, respectively. We are also self-insured for the majority of domestic employee
and retiree medical benefits. On February28, 2005, we
terminated our Voluntary Employees Beneficiary Association
VEBA used to fund self-insured employee healthcare
costs which included medical, dental, and short-term disability
claims. In 2006, we began paying those claims directly from the
general assets of the Company. At February24, 2006 and
February25, 2005, the estimate for incurred but not
reported employee medical, dental, and short-term disability
claims was $21 and $35, respectively.   
Product Warranty We offer a lifetime warranty on most Steelcase and Turnstone
brand products delivered in the United States and Canada,
subject to certain exceptions. For products delivered in the
rest of the world, we offer a
15-year warranty for
most Steelcase brand products and a
10-year warranty for
most Turnstone brand products, subject to certain exceptions.
These warranties provide for the free repair or replacement of
any covered product, part or component that fails during normal
use because of a defect in materials or workmanship. For all
other brands, warranties range from one year to lifetime. The
accrued liability for warranty costs is based on an estimated
amount needed to cover future warranty obligations incurred as
of the balance sheet date determined by historical product data
and managements knowledge of current events and actions.

Environmental Matters Environmental expenditures related to current operations are
expensed or capitalized as appropriate. Expenditures related to
an existing condition allegedly caused by past operations, that
are not associated with current or future revenue generation,
are expensed. Liabilities are recorded when material
environmental assessments and remedial efforts are probable and
the costs can be 46 STEELCASE INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTSContinued reasonably estimated. Generally, the timing of these accruals
coincides with completion of a feasibility study or our
commitment to a formal plan of action. The accrued liability for
environmental contingencies included in other accrued expenses
in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets was $47 as of
February24, 2006 and $43 as of February25, 2005.
Based on our ongoing evaluation of these matters, we believe we
have accrued sufficient reserves to absorb the costs of all
known environmental assessments and the remediation costs of all
known sites.   
Product Related Expenses Research and development expenses, which are expensed as
incurred, were $474 for 2006, $411 for 2005 and $469 for 2004.   
Income Taxes Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are recognized for
the estimated future tax consequences attributable to temporary
differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of
existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases.
These assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax
rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which
the temporary differences are expected to reverse. The Company has net operating loss carryforwards available in
certain jurisdictions to reduce future taxable income. Future
tax benefits for net operating loss carryforwards are recognized
to the extent that realization of these benefits is considered
more likely than not. This determination is based on the
expectation that related operations will be sufficiently
profitable or various tax, business and other planning
strategies will enable us to utilize the operating loss
carryforwards. We cannot be assured that we will be able to
realize these future tax benefits or that future valuation
allowances will not be required. To the extent that available
evidence raises doubt about the realization of a deferred income
tax asset, a valuation allowance is established.   
Earnings Per Share Basic earnings per share is based on the weighted average number
of shares of common stock outstanding during each period. It
excludes the dilutive effects of additional common shares that
would have been outstanding if the shares under our stock
incentive plans had been issued and the dilutive effect of
restricted shares to the extent those shares have not vested
see Note10. Diluted earnings per share includes the effects of shares and
potential shares issued under our stock incentive plans.
However, diluted earnings per share does not reflect the effects
of 13million options for 2006, 45million options
for 2005, and 52million options for 2004 because those
shares or potential shares were not dilutive.

STATEMENTSContinued   
Stock-Based Compensation Our stock-based compensation consists of performance shares,
performance share units, restricted stock, restricted stock
units and non-qualified stock options. In December 2004, the
FASB issued SFASNo123R to expand and clarify
SFASNo123, Accounting for Stock-Based
Compensation, in several areas. The Statement requires
companies to measure the cost of employee services received in
exchange for an award of an equity instrument based on the
grant-date fair value of the award and is effective for awards
issued beginning in Q1 2007. Our policy is to expense
stock-based compensation using the fair-value based method of
accounting for all awards granted, modified or settled. Upon
adoption, SFASNo123R will not impact our
Consolidated Statements of Income because we currently expense
stock-based compensation in accordance with this Statement.
Currently, the aggregate market value of restricted shares at
the date of issuance is recorded as deferred compensation, a
separate component of shareholders equity, and is
amortized over the three-year vesting period of the grants. Upon
adoption in Q1 2007, Deferred compensation restricted
stock in the Consolidated Balance sheets will be eliminated
and amounts will be reclassified to ClassA Common
Stock. Restricted stock units, performance shares, and performance
units are credited to equity as they are expensed over their
vesting periods based on the current market value of the shares
to be granted. For stock options, fair value is measured on the
grant date of the related equity instrument using the
Black-Scholes option-pricing model and is recognized as
compensation expense over the applicable vesting period. However
no stock options were granted in 2006, 2005, or 2004. Prior to 2004, our stock-based compensation consisted only of
stock options, and we accounted for them under the recognition
and measurement principles of Accounting Principles Board
APB Opinion No25, Accounting for Stock
Issued to Employees, and related interpretations. Given the
terms of the Companys plans, no stock-based employee
compensation cost was recognized, as all options granted under
those plans had an exercise price equal to the market value of
the underlying common stock on the date of grant. The following table illustrates the effect on net income loss
and earnings loss per share if we had applied the fair value
recognition provisions of SFASNo123 Accounting
for Stock-Based Compensation to all outstanding awards.
Further disclosure of our stock incentive plans is presented in

STATEMENTSContinued   
Financial Instruments The carrying amount of our financial instruments, consisting of
cash equivalents, short-term investments, accounts and notes
receivable, accounts and notes payable, short-term borrowings
and certain other liabilities, approximate their fair value due
to their relatively short maturities. The carrying amount of our
long-term debt approximates fair value since the stated rate of
interest approximates a market rate of interest. We use derivative financial instruments to manage exposures to
movements in interest rates and foreign exchange rates. The use
of these financial instruments modifies the exposure of these
risks with the intention to reduce the risk or cost to the
Company. We do not use derivatives for speculative or trading
purposes. We recognize the fair value of all derivative instruments as
either assets or liabilities at fair value on our balance sheet.
Fair value is based on market quotes because the instruments
that we enter into are actively traded instruments. The
accounting for changes in the fair value of a derivative depends
on the use of the derivative. We formally document our hedging
relationships, including identification of the hedging
instruments and the hedged items, as well as our risk management
objectives and strategies for undertaking hedge transactions. On
the date that a derivative is entered into, we designate it as
one of the following types of hedging instruments, and we
account for the derivative as follows   
Cash Flow Hedge A hedge of a forecasted transaction or of the variability of
cash flows to be received or paid related to a recognized asset
or liability is declared as a cash flow hedge. A cash flow hedge
requires that the effective portion of the change in the fair
value of a derivative instrument be recognized in Other
Comprehensive Income Loss, net of tax, and reclassified
into earnings in the same line as the hedged item in the period
or periods during which the hedged transaction affects earnings.
Any ineffective portion of a derivative instruments change
in fair value is immediately recognized in earnings.   
Net Investment Hedge A hedge of a net investment in a foreign operation is declared
as a net investment hedge. A net investment hedge requires that
the effective portion of the change in fair value of a
derivative instrument be recognized in Other Comprehensive
Income Loss, net of tax, and reclassified into earnings in
the period in which the net investment is liquidated. We
determine if the hedge is effective if the net investment
balance exceeds the notional amount of the forward contracts.   
Natural Hedge A derivative used as a natural hedging instrument whose change
in fair value is recognized to act as an economic hedge against
changes in the values of the hedged item is declared as a
natural hedge. For derivatives designated as natural hedges,
changes in fair value are reported in earnings in the
Consolidated Statements of Income.   
Use of Estimates The preparation of financial statements in conformity with
accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of
America requires management to make estimates and assumptions
that affect the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated
financial statements and accompanying notes. Although these
estimates are based on historical data and managements
knowledge of current 49 STEELCASE INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTSContinued events and actions it may undertake in the future, actual
results may differ from these estimates under different
assumptions or conditions.

INVENTORIES Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market. The North
America segment primarily uses the last in, first out
LIFO method to value its inventories. The SDP
segment primarily uses the first in, first out
FIFO or the average cost inventory valuation
methods. The International segment values inventories using the
FIFO method.

America and International segments due to increased sales
volume, acquisitions see Note15, and additional finished
goods being produced and held at regional distribution centers
in North America as part of a strategy to improve customer
service.

The net book value of capitalized software was $191 and $285
as of February24, 2006 and February25, 2005,
respectively. The majority of capitalized software has an
estimated useful life of 50 STEELCASE INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTSContinued 3to 5years. Approximately 30% of the gross value of
capitalized software relates to the Companys core
enterprise resource planning system, which has an estimated
useful life of 10years. Depreciation expense on property and equipment approximated
$1107 for 2006, $1191 for 2005 and $1314 for 2004. The estimated cost to complete construction in progress as of
February24, 2006 was $125. Included in Other Current
Assets on our Consolidated Balance Sheets is property, plant
and equipment reclassified as real estate held for sale, which
totaled $158 as of February24, 2006 and $310 as of
February25, 2005. Of the $158 in property, plant and
equipment that is held for sale at February24, 2006, the
majority is related to the Grand Rapids complex which is
expected to be sold during 2007. Real estate that is held for
sale is stated at the lower of depreciated cost or fair market
value. During 2006, we reclassified $214 of property, plant and
equipment that we intend to sell in our International and North
America segments out of Other Current Assets to
Property and Equipment, net because we do not believe
that it will be sold within a year.

COMPANY-OWNED LIFE INSURANCE Investments in company-owned life insurance policies were made
with the intention of utilizing them as a long-term funding
source for post-retirement medical benefits, deferred
compensation and supplemental retirement plan obligations
aggregating $2392 as of February24, 2006 see
Note8 with a related deferred tax asset of approximately
$904. However, the assets do not represent a committed funding
source. They are subject to claims from creditors, and the
Company can designate them to another purpose at any time. The
policies are recorded at their net cash surrender values, as
reported by the four issuing insurance companies, whose
Standard Poors credit ratings range from BBB+
to AAA, and totaled $1966 as of February24, 2006 and
$1861 as of February25, 2005. Investments in company-owned life insurance consist of $953 in
traditional whole life policies and $1013 in variable life
insurance policies as of February24, 2006. In the
traditional whole life policies, the investments return a set
dividend rate that is periodically adjusted by the insurance
companies based on the performance of their long-term investment
portfolio. While the amount of the dividend can vary subject to
a minimum dividend rate, the cash surrender value of these
policies is not subject to market risk declines in that the
insurance companies guarantee a minimum dividend rate on these
investments. In the variable life policies, we are able to
allocate the investments across a set of choices provided by the
insurance companies. As of February24, 2006, the
investments in the variable life policies were allocated 52% in
fixed income securities and 48% in equity securities. The
valuation of these investments is sensitive to changes in market
interest rates and equity values. The annual net changes in
market valuation, normal insurance expenses and any death
benefit gains are reflected in the accompanying Consolidated
Statements of Income. The net effect of these changes in 2006
and 2005 resulted in pre-tax income of approximately $106 and
$90, respectively, recorded as 60% credits to cost of sales and
40% credits to operating expenses.   
6.
GOODWILL OTHER INTANGIBLE ASSETS Goodwill is assigned to and the fair value is tested at the
reporting unit level. Goodwill impairment exists if the net book
value of a reporting unit exceeds its estimated fair value. We
evaluated goodwill using five reporting unitsNorth
America, SDP, International, PolyVision and IDEO. PolyVision and
IDEO are included in the Other category for
reportable segment disclosure purposes. We evaluated goodwill during Q4 2006, and no impairment was
necessary for any reporting unit. 51 STEELCASE INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL

The senior notes, due in November 2006, are unsecured
unsubordinated obligations and rank equally with all of our
other unsecured unsubordinated indebtedness. We may redeem some
or all of the senior notes at any time at the greater of the
full principal amount of the notes being redeemed, or the
present value of the remaining scheduled payments of principal
and interest discounted to the redemption date on a semi-annual
basis at the treasury rate plus 35basis points, plus, in
both cases, accrued and unpaid interest. The original notes were
priced at 9948% of par. Although the coupon rate of these
senior notes is 64%, the effective interest rate is 63% after
taking into account the impact of this discount, offset by the
gain on interest rate locks related to the debt issuance, both
of which are amortized over the life of the notes.     2
Notes payable represents amounts payable to various banks and
other creditors, a portion of which is collateralized by the
underlying assets. Certain agreements relating to notes payable 53 STEELCASE INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTSContinued   
contain financial covenants that include, among others, a
minimum interest coverage ratio and a minimum debt ratio. As of
February24, 2006, we were in compliance with all covenants
under these agreements.   
The decrease in notes payable was primarily due to the
retirement for the debt related to our corporate aircraft.     
Approximately $33 of notes payable as of February24, 2006
and $63 of notes payable as of February25, 2005 are
collateralized by lease receivables.     3
During Q2 2006. we entered into a new $200 global committed bank
facility. The facility replaced the $250 unsecured revolving
credit facility that was originally scheduled to expire in July
2006. As of February24, 2006, we had no borrowings against
the new facility. As of February25, 2005, we had no
borrowings against our previous facility. Our obligations under
this new facility are unsecured and unsubordinated. The Company
may, at its option, and subject to certain conditions, request
to increase the aggregate commitment by up to $100million
by obtaining at least one commitment from one or more lenders.
We can use borrowings under this facility for general corporate
purposes, including friendly acquisitions. Maturities range from
overnight to six months as determined by us, subject to certain
limitations. Interest on borrowings of a term of one month or
greater is based on LIBOR plus a margin or a base rate, as
selected by us. Interest on borrowings of a term of less than
one month is based on prime rate plus a margin or a base rate.
This facility requires us to satisfy financial covenants
including a maximum debt ratio covenant and a minimum interest
coverage ratio covenant. As of February24, 2006, we were
in compliance with all covenants under this facility.     
Additionally, we have entered into agreements with certain
financial institutions, which provide for borrowings on
unsecured non-committed short-term credit facilities of up to
$366 of U.S.dollar obligations and $614 of foreign
currency obligations as of February24, 2006. Interest
rates are variable and determined by agreement at the time of
borrowing. These agreements expire within one year, and subject
to certain conditions may be renewed annually. Borrowings on
these facilities as of February24, 2006 were $49 and as
of February25, 2005 were $78.     4

Defined Contribution Retirement Plans Substantially all United States employees are eligible to
participate in defined contribution retirement plans, primarily
the Steelcase Inc. Retirement Plan the Retirement
Plan. Company contributions and 401k pre-tax employee
contributions fund the Retirement Plan. All contributions are
made to a trust, which is held for the sole benefit of
participants. For certain participating locations, the
Retirement Plan requires minimum annual Company contributions of
5% of eligible annual compensation. Additional Company
contributions for this plan are discretionary and declared by
the Compensation Committee at the end of each fiscal year. As of
February24, 2006, the Company-funded portion of the trust
had net assets of approximately $10billion. The
Companys other defined contribution retirement plans
provide for matching contributions and/or discretionary
contributions declared by management. Total expense under all defined contribution retirement plans
was $204 for 2006, $177 for 2005 and $187 for 2004. We expect
to contribute approximately $208 to our defined contribution
plans in 2007.   
Post-retirement Medical Benefits We maintain unfunded post-retirement benefit plans that provide
medical and life insurance benefits to certain North American
based retirees and eligible dependents. We accrue the cost of
post-retirement insurance benefits during the service lives of
employees based on actuarial calculations for each plan. These
plans are unfunded, but we have purchased company-owned life
insurance policies with the intention of utilizing them as a
long-term funding source for post-retirement medical benefits
and other obligations see Note5. However, it is likely
that over the next several years annual inflows from the
policies will not be sufficient to meet annual outflows for the
benefit plans. The difference will represent a use of cash. On December8, 2003, the Medicare Prescription Drug,
Improvement and Modernization Act of 2003 the Medicare
Act was signed into law. The Medicare Act entitles
employers who provide certain prescription drug benefits for
retirees to receive a federal subsidy beginning in calendar year
2006, thereby creating the potential for significant benefit
cost savings. We provide retiree drug benefits through our
U.S.post-retirement benefit plans that exceed the value of
the benefits that will be provided by Medicare PartD. We
remeasured our accumulated post-retirement benefit obligation as
of September1, 2004 based on the preliminary regulations
and on February25, 2005 for the final regulations because
we believe the value of our benefits is at least
actuarially equivalent to Medicare PartD
benefits. The impact of the remeasurement was a reduction of our
accumulated 55 STEELCASE INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTSContinued benefit obligation of $340. In 2006 and 2005, the Medicare Act
reduced pre-tax post-retirement expense by $50 and $12,
respectively. During 2004, the plans were amended limiting certain benefits.
These amendments resulted in the establishment of unrecognized
prior service gains that are being amortized over the remaining
service life of the affected plans participants. Due to
the workforce reductions in the past three years, curtailment
accounting rules were triggered, and we recognized plan
curtailment gains of $25 in 2006, $26 in 2005, and $38 in
2004. In the fourth quarter of 2006, we remeasured our accumulated
post-retirement benefit obligation as of November30, 2005,
due to a curtailment as defined in SFASNo88,
Employers Accounting for Settlements and Curtailments
of Defined Benefit Pension Plans and for Termination
Benefits, related to our workforce reduction. This
remeasurement resulted in a $163 decrease in the accumulated
benefit obligation. Additionally, during 2006, we were approved
for the Medicare Act subsidy and determined one additional plan
qualified for the subsidy. The impact of this additional plan
was included in the remeasurement and resulted in an additional
$123 reduction to the accumulated benefit obligation. The changes discussed above contributed to the reduction in
total post-retirement expense over the past three years. Total
expense under post-retirement medical benefit plans was $67 for
2006, $116 for 2005 and $148 for 2004.   
Defined Benefit Pension Plans Our defined benefit pension plans include various qualified
domestic and foreign retirement plans as well as non-qualified
supplemental retirement plans that are limited to a select group
of management or highly compensated employees. The accrued
benefit plan obligation for the non-qualified supplemental
retirement plan is primarily related to the Steelcase Inc.
Executive Supplemental Retirement Plan. This plan is unfunded,
but we have purchased company-owned life insurance policies with
the intention of utilizing them as a long-term funding source
for the plan and other post-retirement benefit plan obligations
see Note5. Our foreign plans are subject to currency
translation impacts. The funded status of our defined benefit
pension plans is as follows

We set the discount rate assumption annually for each of our
retirement-related benefit plans at their respective measurement
dates to reflect the yield of a portfolio of high quality,
fixed-income debt instruments matched against the timing and
amounts of projected future benefits. In evaluating the expected
return on plan assets, we have considered the expected long-term
rate of return on plan assets based on the specific allocation
of assets for each plan, an analysis of current market
conditions and the views of leading financial advisors and
economists. The assumed health care cost trend was 100% as of
February24, 2006, gradually declining to 45% in 2016 and
thereafter. At February25, 2005, the assumed health care
cost trend was 110 58 STEELCASE INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL

Deferred Compensation Plans and Agreements We have deferred compensation obligations to certain employees
who have elected to defer a portion of their salary each year
for a period of one to five years. These deferred compensation
obligations are unfunded, but we have purchased company-owned
life insurance policies, with the intention of utilizing them as
a future funding source for the deferred compensation obligation
and other post-retirement benefit plan obligations see further
discussion in Note5. We also maintain a deferred
compensation plan that is intended to restore retirement

Terms of ClassA Common Stock and ClassB Common
Stock The holders of Common Stock are generally entitled to vote as a
single class on all matters upon which shareholders have a right
to vote, subject to the requirements of applicable laws and the
rights of any outstanding series of Preferred Stock to vote as a
separate class. Each share of ClassA Common Stock entitles
its holder to one vote and each share of ClassB Common
Stock entitles its holder to 10 votes. The ClassB Common
Stock is convertible into ClassA Common Stock on a

STOCK INCENTIVE PLANS Our stock incentive plans include the Steelcase Inc. Employee
Stock Purchase Plan the Stock Purchase Plan and
the Steelcase Inc. Incentive Compensation Plan the
Incentive Compensation Plan. Awards currently
outstanding include restricted shares, restricted stock units,
performance shares, performance units and non-qualified stock
options. 60 STEELCASE INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTSContinued   
Stock Purchase Plan We reserved a maximum of 1,500,000shares of ClassA
Common Stock for use under the Stock Purchase Plan, which is
intended to qualify under Section423 of the Internal
Revenue Code of 1986, as amended the Code.
Pursuant to the Stock Purchase Plan, each eligible employee, as
of the start of any purchase period, is granted an option to
purchase a designated number of shares of ClassA Common
Stock. The purchase price of shares of ClassA Common Stock
to participating employees is designated by the Compensation
Committee but in no event shall be less than 85% of the lower of
the fair market values of such shares on the first and last
trading days of the relevant purchase period. However, no
employee may purchase shares under the Stock Purchase Plan in
any calendar year with an aggregate fair market value as
determined on the first day of the relevant purchase period in
excess of $25,000. As of February24, 2006,
454,721shares remain available for purchase under the
Stock Purchase Plan. The Board may at any time amend or
terminate the Stock Purchase Plan.   
Incentive Compensation Plan The Compensation Committee has full authority, subject to the
provisions of the Incentive Compensation Plan, to determine   
persons to whom awards under the Incentive Compensation Plan
will be made     
exercise price     
vesting     
size and type of such awards,and     
specific performance goals, restrictions on transfer and
circumstances for forfeiture applicable to awards. A variety of awards may be granted under the Incentive
Compensation Plan including stock options, stock appreciation
rights SARs, restricted stock, restricted stock
units, performance shares, performance units, cash-based awards,
phantom shares and other share-based awards. Outstanding awards
under the Incentive Compensation Plan vest over a period of
three to five years. Stock options granted under the Incentive
Compensation Plan may be either incentive stock options intended
to qualify under Section422 of the Code or non-qualified
stock options not so intended. The Board may amend or terminate
the Incentive Compensation Plan. In the event of a change of control, as defined in
the Incentive Compensation Plan   
all outstanding options and SARs granted under the Incentive
Compensation Plan will become immediately exercisable and remain
exercisable throughout their entire term     
any performance-based conditions imposed with respect to
outstanding awards shall be deemed to be fully earned and a pro
rata portion of each such outstanding award granted for all
outstanding performance periods shall become payable in shares
of ClassA Common Stock, in the case of awards denominated
in shares of ClassA Common Stock, and in cash, in the case
of awards denominated in cash, with the remainder of such award
being canceled for no value;and     
all restrictions imposed on restricted stock and restricted
stock units that are not performance-based shall lapse. We have reserved for issuance 21,000,000shares of
ClassA Common Stock see further discussion of stock-based
compensation in Note2 under our Incentive Compensation
Plan, as 61 STEELCASE INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTSContinued amended and restated March1, 2002. As of February24,
2006, there were 9,931,771shares remaining for future
issuances under our Incentive Compensation Plan.   
Restricted Stock Under the Incentive Compensation Plan, the Compensation
Committee approved the granting of restricted shares of
ClassA Common Stock and restricted stock units
RSUs during 2006 and 2005 to key employees.
Restricted shares and RSUs will be forfeited if a participant
leaves the Company for reasons other than retirement, disability
or death prior to the vesting date. These restrictions lapse
when the restricted shares and RSUs vest three years from the
date of grant. When RSUs vest, they will be converted to
unrestricted shares of ClassA Common Stock. The aggregate market value on the grant date of the restricted
shares issued during 2006 and 2005 totaled $30 and $37,
respectively. These amounts were recorded as common stock and
deferred compensation, a separate component of
shareholders equity, and are being expensed over the
three-year vesting period of the grants. RSUs are expensed and recorded in Additional paid-in
capital within the Consolidated Statements of Changes in
Shareholders Equity over the three-year vesting period
based on the value of the shares on the grant date. The amount
expensed in 2006 and 2005 was $05 and $02, respectively. At the time restricted stock or RSUs are forfeited, the expense
recognized to date is reversed in the current period. The total
compensation expense expected to be recognized through fiscal
year 2009 for non-vested restricted stock and RSUs is$39. Holders of restricted stock receive cash dividends equal to the
dividends that the Company declares and pays on the ClassA
Common Stock, which is included in Dividends paid in the
Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. Holders of RSUs receive
quarterly cash payments equal to the dividend that the Company
declares and pays on its ClassA Common Stock, which are
expensed as paid. Additionally, the Board of Directors and the Compensation
Committee have delegated to the Chief Executive Officer the
administrative authority to award restricted shares to employees
in amounts considered immaterial to the Incentive Compensation
Plan. The awards are subject to limitations and the provisions
of the Incentive Compensation Plan and are reviewed by the
Compensation Committee. The limitations include, but are not
limited to, the number of shares of restricted stock that may be
awarded in any plan year and the number of shares of restricted
stock that may be awarded to any individual in one plan year. The 2006 and 2005 activity for restricted shares of stock and
RSUs is as follows

STATEMENTSContinued   
Performance Shares In 2005 and 2006, the Company made awards of performance shares
and performance units PSUs under the Incentive
Compensation Plan. The performance measure for these awards is
based on a cumulative three-year cash flow calculation which
meets one of the definitions within the Incentive Compensation
Plan for performance-based compensation. After completion of the performance period for performance
shares, the number of the shares earned is determined and these
shares are issued as ClassA Common Stock. One-third of the
shares vest immediately and the remaining two-thirds vest over
the next two years. At the end of the performance period for PSUs, the number of
units earned is determined. One-third are issued as ClassA
Common Stock. The remaining two-thirds will vest and will be
issued as ClassA Common Stock over the next two years. The
total compensation expense expected to be recognized through
fiscal year 2010 for non-vested performance shares and PSUs
is$36. Performance shares and PSUs are expensed and recorded in
Additional paid in capital within the Consolidated
Statements of Changes in Shareholders Equity over the
five-year performance and vesting period based on the market
value on the grant date of the estimated number of shares to be
issued. The amount expensed in 2006 and 2005 was $16 and $09,
respectively. For both performance shares and PSUs, a dividend
equivalent is calculated on the basis of the actual number of
shares earned at the end of the three-year performance period.
The dividend equivalent is equal to the dividends that would
have been payable on the earned shares had they been held during
the entire performance period. The dividend equivalent on
performance shares and PSUs are expensed and accrued over
the three-year performance period. At the end of this period,
the dividend equivalents will be paid. The target awards granted
in 2006 and 2005 represented a total of 138,000 and 207,000
performance shares and PSUs, respectively. As of
February24, 2006, PSUs forfeited totaled 19,000. The
actual number of common shares that ultimately may be issued
ranges from zero to 652,000shares based on actual
performance levels. 63 STEELCASE INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL

Interest income increased in 2006 and 2005 primarily due to
higher cash and investment balances and higher interest rates. The unrealized gains on derivative instruments in 2006 relate to
interest rate lock derivative contracts. In anticipation of
refinancing our senior notes which mature in November 2006, we
entered into derivative contracts with a notional amount of
$2250 to effectively lock in the five-year treasury note
interest rate which is expected to be the base component of the
coupon rate for the debt. A gain on these derivatives was
recorded to adjust the contracts to fair market value at
February24, 2006. On March16, 2006, we designated
the interest rate locks as hedges. Therefore, beginning on the
designation date, all changes in the fair market value of the
contracts will be recorded in Other comprehensive income
loss. Although the designation date is later than the date
that the contracts were entered into, we expect the hedges to be
highly effective as required for hedge accounting. Our consolidated results include the results of several dealers
where either we own a majority interest in the dealer or we
maintain participative control but our investments are
structured such that we do not share in the profits or losses.
Elimination of minority interest in consolidated dealers
represents the elimination of earnings where either our class of
equity does not share in the earnings or the earnings are
allocated to the minority interest holder. These amounts were
previously included in Miscellaneous expense, net. Prior
year amounts have been reclassified. The increase in the current
year elimination is due to improved profitability of the dealers. Equity in income of unconsolidated ventures represents our
portion of the income from our joint ventures. During 2006, the gain on disposal of property and equipment
related to the sale of excess idle land in Morocco for net cash
proceeds and a pre-tax gain of $12. The gain in 2004 primarily
related to property sold in the United Kingdom for net cash
proceeds of $115 and a pre-tax non-operating gain of $70. This
facility had been idle for about three years prior to the sale
as a result of prior restructuring activities. The loss on dealer transitions recorded in 2006 relates to an
additional reserve against a lease that was retained as part of
a previous dealer transition. In 2005, we recorded a gain on
dealer transitions which represented an equity return related to
a previous international dealer transition and 65 STEELCASE INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTSContinued a recovery on dealer transition financing that was previously
reserved. The majority of the loss recorded in 2004 related to
an International dealer transition. The foreign exchange gain in 2006 primarily represents the gain
on derivative instruments related to our euro-denominated
intercompany loans. Miscellaneous, net includes items such as gains and losses on
the sale of venture investments and royalty income and expense.

of a completed IRS tax audit for years ended 1999, 2000 and 2001.

carryforwards. Future tax benefits for operating loss and tax
credit carryforwards are recognized to the extent that
realization of these benefits is considered more likely than
not. It is considered more likely than not that a benefit of
$1146 will be realized on these carryforwards. This
determination is based on the expectation that related
operations will be sufficiently profitable or various tax,
business and other planning strategies available to us will
enable us to utilize the carryforwards. We cannot be assured
that we will be able to realize these future tax benefits or
that future valuation allowances will not be required.

FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS, CONCENTRATIONS OF CREDIT RISK,
COMMITMENTS, GUARANTEES AND CONTINGENCIES   
Financial Instruments Financial instruments, which potentially subject us to
concentrations of investment and credit risk, primarily consist
of cash and equivalents, investments, accounts and notes
receivable, direct finance lease receivables, company-owned life
insurance policies, accounts payable and short-term borrowings
and long-term debt. We place our cash and equivalents with
high-quality financial institutions and invest in high-quality
securities and commercial paper. Under our investment policy, we
limit our exposure to any one debtor.   
Foreign Exchange Forward
Contracts A portion of our revenues and earnings are exposed to changes in
foreign exchange rates. We seek to manage our foreign exchange
risk in part through operational means, including matching same
currency revenues with same currency costs and same currency
assets with same currency liabilities. Foreign exchange risk is
also managed through the use of foreign exchange forward
contracts. These financial instruments serve to protect net
income, assets, and liabilities against the impact of the
translation into U.S.dollars of certain foreign exchange
denominated transactions. The principal currency that we hedge
through foreign exchange forward contracts is the European euro.
We recorded a net gain of $19 in 2006, in Other Income
Expense, net on the Consolidated Income Statements related
to these contracts. The notional amounts of all of the
outstanding foreign exchange forward contracts were $2252 at
February24, 2006 and $1718 at February25, 2005. The
fair value of these contracts was $128 and $07 at
February24, 2006 and February25, 2005, respectively,
and is recorded in Other current assets and Other
current liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.   
Net Investment Hedge In 2005 and 2006, we entered into currency contracts to hedge a
portion of our net investment in Steelcase Canada. This hedge
serves to protect our net investment in Canada from the impact
of translation into U.S.dollars. The notional amount of
the currency contracts was $784 and $367 as of
February24, 2006 and February25, 2005, respectively.
An unrealized currency translation adjustment of $40 from the
deferred losses on these contracts is recorded in cumulative
translation adjustment account within shareholders equity
as of February24, 2006. In the prior year, the amount
recorded in cumulative adjustment account was immaterial. There
was no hedge ineffectiveness in 2006 or 2005.   
Interest Rate Locks In anticipation of refinancing our senior notes which mature in
November 2006, we entered into derivative contracts to lock in
the five-year treasury note interest rate treasury
rate which is the base component of the coupon rate for
this debt. The notional amount of these interest rate lock 69 STEELCASE INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTSContinued derivative contracts derivative contracts was
$2250 at February24, 2006, and the fair value of these
derivative contracts was $21 at February24, 2006. We had
not designated these derivative contracts as hedging instruments
during 2006, and therefore we recorded a gain of $21 in
Other income expense in 2006 to record these derivative
contracts at fair value. On March16, 2006
designation date, we completed documentation to
designate the derivative contracts as hedges. When we issue the
new senior notes, the coupon rate will be based on the then
current treasury rate plus a credit spread. The gain or loss on
our derivative contracts will offset the movement in the
treasury rate from the designation date until the date that we
issue the new senior notes. We are still exposed to changes in
the credit spreads in the corporate bond market until the new
bonds are issued. The derivative contracts will expire at the
same time that the existing debt matures.   
Interest Rate Swaps In 2005 and Q1 2006, we had interest rate swap contracts to
effectively convert floating rate debt to a fixed rate. These
contracts were designated as hedges against possible changes in
the amount of future cash flows associated with interest
payments of the existing variable-rate obligations. The net
effect on our operating results was that interest expense on the
variable-rate debt that was hedged was recorded based on fixed
interest rates. As of February25, 2005, we had two of
these swap contracts in place. These contracts matured in Q1
2006 at the same time as the underlying debt. There was no
ineffectiveness in 2006 or 2005. Information regarding our interest rate swaps is summarized
below.

The notional amounts discussed above do not necessarily
represent amounts exchanged by the parties and, therefore, are
not a direct measure of our exposure from our use of
derivatives. The amounts exchanged are calculated by reference
to the notional amounts and by other terms of the derivatives,
such as interest rates, exchange rates or other financial
indices.   
Concentrations of Credit Risk Our trade receivables are primarily due from independent
dealers, who in turn carry receivables from their customers. We
monitor and manage the credit risk associated with individual
dealers. Dealers, rather than the Company, are responsible for
assessing and assuming credit risk of their customers and may
require their customers to provide deposits, letters of credit
or other credit enhancement measures. Some sales contracts are
structured such that the customer payment or obligation is
direct to the Company. In those cases, the Company assumes the
credit risk. Whether from dealers or customers, our trade credit
exposures are not concentrated with any particular entity. We also have net investments in lease assets related to
furniture leases originated and funded by Steelcase Financial
Services. Because the underlying net investment in leases
represents multiple orders from individual customers, there are
some concentrations of credit risk with certain customers. Our
three largest lease customers make up $76 of gross lease
receivables at the end of 2006 which represents 426% of our
total net investments in lease assets. Although we believe that
reserves are adequate in total, a deterioration of one of these
larger credit exposures would likely require additional charges
and reserves. 70 STEELCASE INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTSContinued   
Commitments We lease certain sales offices, showrooms and equipment under
non-cancelable operating leases that expire at various dates
through 2018. During the normal course of business, we have
entered into several sale-leaseback arrangements for certain
facilities. Accordingly, these leases are accounted for as
operating leases and any gains from the sale of the original
properties were recorded as deferred gains and are amortized
over the lease term. The deferred gains are included as a
component of Other Long-term Liabilities, and amounted to
$229 as of February24, 2006 and $252 as of
February25, 2005.

committed to make additional payments of $344 in 2007 and 2008.

We are party to performance bonds for certain installation or
construction activities for a limited number of Steelcase
dealers and joint ventures. Under these agreements, we are
liable to make financial payments if the installation or
construction activities are not completed under their specified
guidelines and claims are filed. Projects with performance bonds
have completion dates ranging from one to five years. Where we
have supplied performance bonds, we have the ability to step in
and cure performance failures thereby mitigating our potential
losses. No loss has been experienced under these performance
bonds; however, reserves totaling $02 are recorded as of
February24, 2006 to cover potential losses. 71 STEELCASE INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTSContinued We are contingently liable under guarantees to third parties for
the benefit of certain Steelcase dealers and joint ventures in
the event of default of a financial obligation. Reserves
totaling $03 are recorded as of February24, 2006 to cover
potential losses for guarantees. We occasionally provide guarantees of the performance of certain
of our dealers to third parties. These performance guarantees
typically relate to dealer services such as delivery and
installation of products. In the event that a dealer cannot
complete these services in a timely manner, we guarantee the
completion of these activities. It is not possible to estimate a
potential liability under these types of guarantees because of
the conditional nature of our obligations and the unique facts
and circumstances involved in each particular agreement.   
Contingencies We are party to sales contracts with various customers and
dealers. There are issues with certain of these contracts that
could give rise to claims against us. Based on our continued
analysis of available information, we have a reserve for these
contract-related contingencies of $33 at February24,
2006. The amount that may ultimately be required to settle any
potential obligation may be lower or higher than our estimated
reserve, which we will adjust as appropriate as additional
information becomes available. If actual settlements are
significantly lower or higher than our estimated reserve, our
results of operations may be materially affected. During 2006, we recorded restructuring charges as we began the
consolidation of our operations in the Grand Rapids, Michigan
area see Note17. We are in the process of marketing
several properties in the Grand Rapids complex and have recorded
an impairment charge during Q4 2006 for the difference between
the estimated net realizable value and the book value of these
assets. It is possible that as this project continues, the net
realizable value could change. We are involved in various tax matters. We establish reserves at
the time that we determine that it is probable that we will be
liable to pay additional taxes related to certain matters. We
adjust these reserves, including any impact of related interest
and penalties, in light of changing facts and circumstances,
such as the progress of tax audits. A number of years may elapse
before a particular matter, for which we have established a
reserve, is audited and finally resolved or when a tax
assessment is raised. The number of years with open tax audits
varies depending on the tax jurisdiction. While it is often
difficult to predict the final outcome or the timing of
resolution of any particular matter, we record a reserve when we
determine the likelihood of loss is probable and the amount of
loss is reasonably estimable. Such liabilities are recorded in
Income taxes payable on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.
Favorable resolution of tax matters that had been reserved would
be recognized as a reduction in our income tax expense when
known.   
Litigation We are involved in litigation from time to time in the ordinary
course of business. Based on known information, management
believes we are not currently a party to any material litigation.

REPORTABLE SEGMENTS We operate on a worldwide basis within three reportable
segments: North America, SDP and International plus an
Other category. The North America segment consists of sales and marketing
operations serving customers through a network of over 330
dealer locations in the United States and Canada. This segment
sells furniture, technology and architecture products under the
Steelcase and Turnstone brands. 72 STEELCASE INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTSContinued The SDP segment is comprised of five brands focused on higher
end design furniture products and niche applications. DesignTex
is focused on surface materials including textiles, wall
covering, shades, screens and surface imaging. Details designs
and markets ergonomic tools and accessories for the workplace.
Brayton, Vecta, and Metro each provide different furniture
products, including solutions for lobby and reception areas,
conference rooms, private offices, health care and learning
environments. The SDP segment markets and sells its products
through many of the same dealers as the North America segment. The International segment includes all sales and marketing
operations of the Steelcase and SDP brands outside the United
States and Canada. The International segment serves customers
through a network of approximately 470 dealer locations. In the past year, we continued to evolve towards a more
centralized organization structure for manufacturing, rather
than decentralized by segment. However, we primarily review and
evaluate gross margin and operating income by segment in both
our internal review processes and for external financial
reporting. Total assets by segment includes manufacturing assets
more closely associated with each segment. The Other category includes PolyVision, IDEO, and Steelcase
Financial Services subsidiaries and unallocated corporate
expenses. Steelcase Financial Services provides leasing services
to customers primarily in North America to facilitate the
purchase of our products and provides selected financing
services to our dealers. PolyVision designs and manufactures
visual communications products, such as static and electronic
whiteboards, for learning environments and office settings. IDEO
provides product design and innovation services. Approximately
83% of corporate expenses, which represent shared services, are
charged to the operating segments as part of a corporate
allocation. Unallocated expenses are reported within the Other
category.

ACQUISITIONS During 2006, the Company acquired a small technology services
company and three small international dealerships. In May 2005, we completed the acquisition of 100% of the net
assets of GroupComm Systems Inc. GroupComm for
$58 in cash plus incremental payments of $01 plus interest for
each of the next five years. As a result of the purchase price
allocation, we recorded intangible assets and goodwill of $37
and $15, respectively. We may be required to pay additional
consideration of up to $13million in the form of an
earnout payment based on GroupComm meeting cumulative financial
performance targets over a five year period. GroupComm designs
and implements integrated audiovisual solutions and is
consolidated as part of our North America segment. In June 2005, we completed the acquisition of 100% of the
outstanding capital stock of a dealer in the United Kingdom for
a net purchase price of $23. As a result of the purchase price
allocation, we recorded goodwill of $23. This acquisition was
completed as part of our ongoing consolidation and restructuring
of our distribution network in the United Kingdom and is
consolidated in our International segment. In February 2006, we completed the acquisition of 100% of the
outstanding capital stock of two small French dealers for a net
purchase price of $05. As a result of the purchase price
allocation, we recorded goodwill of $05. These acquisitions
were completed as part of our ongoing consolidation and
restructuring of our distribution network in France and are
consolidated in our International segment. 74 STEELCASE INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTSContinued These acquisitions were not material individually or in the
aggregate.

DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS In 2004, the Company sold substantially all of the net assets of
its marine hardware and accessories business previously
reported under the Other category for cash proceeds of $479,
resulting in a pre-tax net gain of $319 or $200 after-tax. The
operating results of this business have been segregated as
discontinued operations for all periods presented and include
the amounts indicated in the following table

During 2005, we reversed pre-tax reserves of $15 originally
recorded by our former marine hardware and accessories business.
These reserves related to a legal contingency that was favorably
resolved in 2005. The $10 after-tax effect of this reversal was
included within Income on sale of discontinued operations
in the 2005 Consolidated Statement of Income.

RESTRUCTURING CHARGES During Q1 2006, we announced our plans to continue the
consolidation of our North America operations by closing certain
facilities in the Grand Rapids, Michigan area over the next two
years. At that time, we estimated total restructuring charges of
$22 to $25, which does not include relocation costs. The 2006
North America charges included $211 related to this initiative
including employee termination costs and the impairment of
certain fixed assets including the Grand Rapids complex,
partially offset by a gain on the sale of a manufacturing plant
and curtailment gains for post-retirement and medical benefits.
We now estimate that total restructuring charges related to this
initiative will be $25 to $30 and will be completed in 2007. The
remaining 2006 North America restructuring charges of $15
primarily relate to a lease impairment. We also incurred $143 of restructuring costs as we continued
our restructuring activities in our International segment in
2006 to reduce our cost structure. The charges primarily relate
to consolidating our French manufacturing operations,
outsourcing our European wood manufacturing business, recording
an impairment charge for our Strasbourg campus, and
restructuring our operations in Malaysia. We also incurred $20 of restructuring costs in our Other
category which primarily related to plant consolidation
activities at our PolyVision subsidiary. 75 STEELCASE INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
