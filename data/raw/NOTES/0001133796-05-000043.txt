index present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of
Bluefly, Inc. and its subsidiary at December 31, 2004 and December 31, 2003, and
the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three years
in the period ended December 31, 2004 in conformity with accounting principles
generally accepted in the United States of America. In addition, in our opinion,
the financial statement schedule listed in the accompanying index presents
fairly, in all material respects, the information set forth therein when read in
conjunction with the related consolidated financial statements. These financial
statements and financial statement schedule are the responsibility of the
Company management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these
financial statements and financial statement schedule based on our audits. We
conducted our audits of these statements in accordance with the standards of the
Public Company Accounting Oversight Board United States. Those standards
require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about
whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit
includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and
disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles
used and significant estimates made by management, and evaluating the overall
financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a
reasonable basis for our opinion. s/ PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP

1.   THE COMPANY
Bluefly, Inc., a Delaware corporation, the Company, is a leading
Internet retailer that sells over 350 brands of designer apparel,
accessories and home products at discount prices. The Company Web site
was launched in September 1998.
The Company has sustained net losses and negative cash flows from
operations since the formation of Bluefly.com. The Company ability to
meet its obligations in the ordinary course of business is dependent
upon its ability to establish profitable operations or raise additional
financing through public or private debt or equity financing, or other
sources of financing to fund operations. The Company believes that its
existing resources, together with working capital should be sufficient
to satisfy our cash requirements through December 31, 2005. The Company
may seek additional equity or debt financings to maximize the growth of
its business or if anticipated operating results are not achieved. If
such financings are not available on terms acceptable to the Company,
and/or the Company does not achieve its sales plan, future operations
will need to be modified, scaled back or discontinued.
2.   SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
PRINCIPLES OF CONSOLIDATION
The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the
Company and its wholly owned subsidiary. All significant intercompany
balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.
REVENUE RECOGNITION
The Company recognizes revenue in accordance with Staff Accounting
Bulletin SAB 101 No. 101 Revenue Recognition in the Financial
Statements, as amended. Gross sales consists primarily of revenue from
product sales and shipping and handling charges and is net of
promotional discounts. Net sales represent gross sales, less provisions
for returns, credit card chargebacks and adjustments for uncollected
sales tax. Revenue is recognized when all the following criteria are
met.    A customer executes an order.    The product price and the shipping and handling fee have been
determined.    Credit card authorization has occurred and collection is
reasonably assured.    The product has been shipped and received by the customer.
Shipping and handling billed to customers is classified as revenue in
accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board FASB Task
Force Emerging Issues Task Force EITF No. 00-10, Accounting for
Shipping and Handling Fees and Costs EITF No. 00-10.

PROVISIONS FOR SALES RETURNS AND DOUBTFUL ACCOUNTS
The Company generally permits returns for any reason within 90 days of
the sale. The Company performs credit card authorizations and checks the
verifications of its customers prior to shipment of merchandise.
Accordingly, the Company establishes a reserve for estimated future
sales returns and allowance for doubtful accounts at the time of
shipment based primarily on historical data. Accounts receivable is
presented on the consolidated balance sheet net of the allowance for
doubtful accounts. As of December 31, 2004 and 2003, the allowance for
doubtful accounts was $44,000 and $40,000, respectively, and the
allowance for sales returns was $2,174,000 and $2,528,000, respectively.
Deferred revenue, which consists primarily of goods shipped to customers
but not yet received and customer credits, totaled approximately
$1,697,000 and $1,252,000 as of December 31, 2004 and 2003,
respectively.
CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS
The Company considers all highly liquid investments with an original
maturity of three months or less to be cash and cash equivalents.
INVENTORIES
Inventories, which consist of finished goods, are stated at the lower of
cost or market. Cost is determined by the first-in, first-out FIFO
method. The Company reviews its inventory levels in order to identify
slow-moving merchandise and establishes a reserve for such merchandise,
Inventory reserves are established based on historical data and
management best estimate of excess inventory. Inventory may be marked
down below cost if management determines that the inventory stock will
not sell at its currently marked price. Inventory is presented net of
reserves on the consolidated balance sheet.
As of December 31, 2004 and 2003, inventories, net consists of the
following                            2004      2003
Inventory on hand             $ 12,433,000  $ 10,755,000

Total inventories, net     $ 12,958,000  $ 11,340,000
PROPERTY AND EQUIPMENT
Property and equipment are stated at cost net of depreciation. Equipment
and software are depreciated on a straight-line basis over two to seven
years. Leasehold improvements are amortized over the shorter of their
estimated useful lives or the term of the lease. Lease amortization is
included in depreciation expense. Maintenance and repairs are expensed
as incurred.
Certain equipment held under capital leases is classified as property
and equipment and amortized using the straight-line method over the
lease terms and the related obligations are recorded as liabilities.

Costs related to the upgrade and development of the Web Site are
accounted for in accordance with EITF Issue No. 00-02 Accounting for
Website Development Costs, and to the extent they are capitalized, are
amortized over 24 months.
LONG-LIVED ASSETS
The Company policy is to evaluate long-lived assets for possible
impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the
carrying amount of such assets may not be recoverable. This evaluation
is based on a number of factors, including expectations for operating
income and undiscounted cash flows that will result from the use of such
assets. The Company has not identified any such impairment of assets.
INCOME TAXES
The Company recognizes deferred income tax assets and liabilities on the
differences between the financial statement and tax bases of assets and
liabilities using enacted statutory tax rates in effect for the years in
which the differences are expected to reverse. The effect on deferred
taxes of a change in tax rates is realized in income or loss in the
period that includes the enactment date. In addition, valuation
allowances are established when it is more likely than not that deferred
tax assets will not be realized.
STOCK BASED COMPENSATION
At December 31, 2004, the Company has two stock-based employee
compensation plans, which are described more fully in Note 9. The
Company applies Statement of Financial Accounting Standards SFAS No.
148 Accounting for Stock Based Compensation - Transition and
Disclosure, an amendment of FASB Statement No. 123, SFAS No. 123
Accounting for Stock Based Compensation, and FASB Interpretation No.
44, Accounting for Certain Transactions Involving Stock Compensation
in accounting for its stock based compensation plan. In accordance with
SFAS No. 123, the Company applies Accounting Principles Board Opinion
No. 25 and related Interpretations for expense recognition. For the year
ended December 31, 2004, compensation expense of $17,000 was recorded in
connection with certain options issued below market value to the
Company Chief Executive Officer in accordance with the terms of her
employment agreement, and $113,000 in compensation expense was recorded
in connection with certain options issued to the Company former Chief
Executive Officer pursuant to his separation agreement. Except for these
options, no compensation expense has been recorded for the year ended
December 31, 2004 and December 31, 2003 in connection with stock option
grants to employees, because the exercise price of employee stock
options equals or exceeds the market price of the underlying stock on
the date of grant. Had compensation expense for the Plan been determined
consistent with the provisions of SFAS No. 123, the effect on the
Company basic and diluted net loss per share would have been as
follows                    F-8 BLUEFLY, INC.

NET LOSS PER SHARE
The Company calculated net loss per share in accordance with SFAS No.
128, Earnings Per Share. Basic loss per share excludes dilution and is
computed by dividing loss available to common shareholders by the
weighted average number of common shares outstanding for the period. For
purposes of calculating basic and diluted loss per share, the Company
presents the amount of dividends earned but unpaid on the face of the
statement of operations.
Diluted loss per share is computed by dividing loss available to common
shareholders by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding
for the period, adjusted to reflect potentially dilutive securities. Due
to the loss, the following shares of Common Stock issuable pursuant to
options, warrants, Preferred Stock and Convertible Notes were not
included in the computation of diluted earnings per share because the
result of such inclusion would be antidilutive                         COMMON STOCK ISSUABLE

MARKETING EXPENSES
In addition to marketing salaries, marketing expenses consist primarily
of online advertising, print advertising, costs associated with
sweepstakes, direct mail campaigns as well as the related external
production costs. The costs associated with online and print advertising
are expensed as incurred, while the costs associated with direct mail
campaigns are capitalized and charged to expense over the expected
future revenue stream. There were no amounts associated with direct mail
campaigns capitalized at December 31, 2004 and 2003. Marketing expenses
excluding marketing and public relations salaries and related salary
expenses of $761,000, $628,000 and $553,000 for the years ended
December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002 amounted to approximately $1,452,000,
$1,270,000 and $1,722,000, respectively.
FULFILLMENT EXPENSES
The Company utilizes a third party to perform all of its order
fulfillment including warehousing, administrative support, returns
processing and receiving labor. For the years ended December 31, 2004,
2003 and 2002, fulfillment expenses totaled $2,914,000, $2,776,000 and
$2,622,000, respectively. These amounts are included in selling,
marketing and fulfillment expenses in the statement of operations.
FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS
The carrying amounts of the Company financial instruments, including
cash and cash equivalents, other assets, accounts payable, accrued
liabilities, and notes payable to related party shareholders approximate
fair value due to their short maturities.
RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS
In March, 2004, the Emerging Issues Task Force issued EITF 03-6,
Participating Securities and the Two-Class Method under FASB Statement
No. 128. This statement provides additional guidance on the calculation
and disclosure requirements for earnings per share. The FASB concluded
in EITF 03-6 that companies with multiple classes of common stock or
participating securities, as defined by SFAS No. 128, calculate and
disclose earnings per share based on the two-class method. The adoption
of this statement does not have an impact to the Company financial
statement presentation as the Company is currently in a loss position.
In December 2004, the FASB issued Statement No. 123 revised 2004,
Share-Based Payment SFAS 123R, which replaces SFAS 123 and
supersedes APB No. 25. Under the new standard, companies will no longer
be able to account for stock-based compensation transactions using the
intrinsic value method in accordance with APB No. 25. Instead, companies
will be required to account for such transactions using a fair-value
method and to recognize the expense in the statements of income. The
adoption of SFAS 123R will also require additional accounting related to
the income tax effects and additional disclosure regarding the cash flow
effects resulting from share-based payment arrangements. SFAS 123R will
be effective for periods beginning after June 15, 2005 and allows, but
does not require, companies to restate prior periods. The Company is
evaluating the impact of adopting SFAS 123R and expects that it will
record substantial non-cash stock compensation expenses. The adoption of
SFAS 123R is not expected to have a significant effect on the Company
financial condition or cash flows but is expected to have a significant,
adverse effect on its results of operations.
RECLASSIFICATIONS
Certain amounts in the consolidated financial statements of the prior
periods have been reclassified to conform to the current period
presentation for comparative purposes.

USE OF ESTIMATES
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally
accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and
assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities
and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the
financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses
during the reporting period. Significant estimates and assumptions
include the adequacy of the allowances for sales returns, recoverability
of inventories, useful lives of property and equipment and the
realization of deferred tax assets. Actual results could differ from
those estimates.
3.   PROPERTY AND EQUIPMENT
As of December 31, 2004 and 2003, property and equipment consists of the

6.   OTHER INCOME
In June 2002, the Company entered into an agreement with a third party
investor pursuant to which the investor committed to purchase
approximately $7 million of Common Stock and warrants from the Company.
The investor breached the contract by failing to consummate the
investment, although it did provide the Company with $169,000 as a good
faith deposit. In October 2002, the Company filed an action against the
investor based on its failure to consummate the investment, and in
December 2003, the court entered judgment in the Company favor against
the third party investor in the amount of $3,793,688. In the first
quarter of 2004, following the expiration of all applicable appeal
periods, the Company recognized the good faith deposit of $169,000 as
other income, as a partial recognition of litigation settlement. Based
on the information currently available to it regarding the investor
finances, the Company does not believe that it will be successful in
collecting a material amount of additional funds as a result of the
damages award.
In addition, as discussed in Note 9 below, the Company recognized
$564,000 of other income for the year ended December 31, 2004 to adjust
a liability associated with warrants issued by the Company to its fair
value as of June 17, 2004 at which point the liability was reclassified
as equity in accordance with EITF 00-19 and described in Note 9.

Net deferred tax asset liability  $     -  $     -
The Company is in an accumulated loss position for both financial and
income tax reporting purposes. The Company has U.S. Federal net
operating loss carryforwards of approximately $67,627,000 at December
31, 2004 which have expiration dates from 2018 through 2024.
Approximately $53 million of these net operating loss carryforwards
relate to the exercise of employee stock options and any tax benefit
derived there from, when realized, will be accounted for as a credit to
additional paid-in-capital rather than a reduction of the income tax
provision. Pursuant to Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code, the
usage of these net operating loss carryforwards may be limited due to
changes in ownership that have occurred or that may occur in the future.
The Company has not yet determined the impact, if any, that changes in
ownership have had on net operating loss carryforwards. The Company
provided a full valuation allowance on the entire deferred tax asset
balance to reflect the uncertainty regarding the realizability of these
assets due to operating losses incurred since inception.
The Company effective tax rate differs from the U.S. Federal Statutory
income tax rate of 35% as follows                          2004    2003    2002

Stock, in accordance with the Company Certificate of Incorporation.
The shares of Series B Convertible Preferred Stock were converted into

JANUARY 2003 FINANCING
In January 2003, the Company issued to Soros $1 million of demand
convertible promissory notes that bore interest at a rate of 8% per
annum and had a maturity date of July 28, 2003, and warrants to purchase
25,000 shares of its common stock, exercisable at any time on or prior
to January 28, 2007 at $112 per share the January 2003 Financing.
Interest on the notes was payable only upon repayment of the principal
amount, whether at maturity or upon a mandatory or optional prepayment.
The principal amount, together with accrued interest, was convertible
into equity securities that the Company might issue in any subsequent
round of financing, at the holder option, at a price that was equal to
the lowest price per share accepted by any investor in such subsequent
round of financing. These notes were converted into Series D Preferred
Stock in connection with the March 2003 Financing described below.
MARCH 2003 FINANCING
In March 2003, the Company entered into an agreement with Soros pursuant
to which Soros: i provided $2 million of new capital by purchasing
2,000 shares of Series D Preferred Stock, ii converted the promissory
notes issued to it in the January 2003 Financing and all of its Series
2002 Preferred Stock into 3,109425 shares of Series D Preferred Stock
and iii purchased 2,027123

shares of Series D Preferred Stock, with the proceeds from this sale
being retained by Soros as payment in full of the Company obligations
under the Series C Notes the March 2003 Financing. The material
terms of the Series D Preferred Stock are described above.
Additionally, Soros agreed to provide the Company with up to $1 million
in additional financing the 2003 Standby Commitment Amount on a
standby basis at any time prior to January 1, 2004, provided that the
Company cash balances were less than $1 million at that time the
2003 Standby Commitment. Such financing was to be made in one or more
tranches as determined by the members of the Company Board of
Directors other than the Series A Designee and the Series B Designee,
and any and all draws against the 2003 Standby Commitment Amount were to
be effected through the purchase of newly-designated shares of Series E
Preferred Stock. Subject to certain limitations, the 2003 Standby
Commitment Amount was to be reduced on a dollar-for-dollar basis by the
gross cash proceeds received by the Company or any of its subsidiaries
from the issuance of any equity or convertible securities after March
12, 2003.
As a result of the March 2003 Financing, the conversion price of the
Series B Preferred Stock and the Series C Preferred Stock automatically
decreased from $093 to $076 per share. In accordance with EITF 00-27,
the reduction in the conversion price of the Series C Preferred Stock
resulted in the Company recording a beneficial conversion feature in the
approximate amount of $225,000 as part of its financial results for the
first quarter of 2003. This non-cash charge, which is analogous to a
dividend, resulted in an adjustment to the Company computation of Loss
Per Share.
MAY 2003 FINANCING
In accordance with the terms of the 2003 Standby Commitment, in May 2003
Soros invested an additional $10 million in the Company through the
purchase of 1,000 shares of Series E Preferred Stock and thereby
fulfilled the 2003 Standby Commitment in full. The terms of the Series E
Preferred Stock are described above.
JULY 2003 FINANCING
In July 2003, Soros invested an additional $20 million in the Company.
Under the terms of the transaction, the Company issued $20 million of
convertible promissory notes that bear interest at a rate of 12% per
annum and had a maturity date of January 12, 2004 which, was
subsequently extended to May 1, 2006. Interest on the notes is payable
only upon repayment of the principal amount, whether at maturity or upon
a mandatory or optional prepayment. The principal amount, together with
accrued interest, is convertible into equity securities of the Company
sold in any subsequent round of financing, at the holder option, at a
price that is equal to the lowest price per share accepted by any
investor in such subsequent round of financing the July 2003
Financing. The conversion of the notes is subject to certain
limitations until such time as the conversion provisions are approved by
the Company stockholders.
OCTOBER 2003 FINANCING
In October 2003 Soros invested an additional $20 million in the
Company. Under the terms of the transaction, the Company issued $20
million of convertible promissory notes. These notes were on
substantially the same terms as the notes issued in the July 2003
Financing, except that the maturity date of these notes was April 14,
2004. Subsequent to year end, the maturity date of these notes was
extended to May 1, 2006.

WARRANTS
WARRANTS TO SOROS
The Company has issued warrants to Soros in connection with past and
recent financings as well as in connection with the Loan Facility.
Warrants issued in connection with the Company Loan Facility are
included in the table below and are described more fully in Note 11
below.
In connection with the January 2003 Financing, the Company issued
warrants to purchase 25,000 shares of its common stock, exercisable at
any time on or prior to January 28, 2007 at $112 per share to Soros.
The Company valued the warrants using the Black Scholes option pricing
model using the following assumptions: risk free interest rate: 354     volatility 113%, expected life 4 years, zero dividend yield. Using these
factors the warrants were valued at $21,000 and were expensed over the
life of the note. The full amount was expensed in the first quarter of
2003.
In exchange for the March 2002 Standby Agreement, the Company issued to
Soros warrants to purchase 100,000 shares of Common Stock at an exercise
price of $168 per share the 20 day trailing average of the closing
sale price of the Company Common Stock on the date of issuance,
exercisable at any time until March 27, 2007. The Company valued the
warrants using the Black Scholes option pricing model using the
following assumptions: risk free interest rate: 522%, volatility 183     expected life 3 years, zero dividend yield. The Company accounted for
the warrants by crediting additional paid in capital for approximately
$157,000 and capitalizing the amount on the balance sheet. This amount
was then netted against the proceeds from the subsequent May 2003
Financing and July 2003 Financing described above, on a pro rata basis.
WARRANTS TO SUPPLIER
On December 22, 2003 the Company issued warrants to purchase 250,000
shares of Common Stock at an exercise price of $234 per share to a
supplier of inventory in exchange for reduced pricing. The warrants are
fully vested and expire on December 22, 2006. The Company valued the
warrants using the Black-Scholes option pricing model key assumptions:
risk free interest rate: 375%, volatility 85%, expected life 2 years,
zero dividend yield. The total value of $502,500 was capitalized and
classified as prepaid inventory. During 2004 the Company reclassified
the prepaid inventory when inventory was purchased as a component of the
inventory cost. As of December 31, 2004 approximately $251,000 of this
asset remained on the balance sheet and was included in other current
assets.
WARRANTS ISSUED TO INVESTORS
In accordance with EITF 00-19, the Company accounted for the 385,801
warrants issued in connection with the January 2004 Financing at fair
market value and classified the warrants as a liability because the
Company may have been required to make cash payments to the investors
who purchased the warrants in the event that the registration statement
covering the offer and sale of the shares underlying the warrants were
to no longer be effective. The Company used the Black-Scholes option
pricing method assumption: volatility 147%, risk free rate 376% two
year expected life and zero dividend yield to calculate the value of
the warrants. At January 12, 2004, the date of transaction the
Transaction Date, the warrants had a value of $1,096,000. The value
of the warrants was marked to market in each subsequent reporting period
as a derivative gain or loss until June 17, 2004 the End Date, at
which time EITF 00-19 called for the warrants to be re-classified as
equity because the maximum potential cash amount payable to the
investors had decreased to the point where it was no longer considered
significant.

During the period beginning on the Transaction Date and ending on the

income for the year ended December 31, 2004.

In addition to the $4,000,000 of promissory notes issued in connection
with the July 2003 Financing and October 2003 Financing see Note 9
above, on December 15, 2001, the Company issued promissory notes in the
amount of $182,000 to affiliates of Soros in exchange for legal services
provided during the course of the year. The notes bore interest at 9%
per annum and had a maturity date of December 15, 2004. In December 2004
the Company repaid the notes with accrued interest of $54,000 for a
total of $236,000.
In January 2004, the Company also extended the maturity dates on the
Convertible Promissory Notes issued to Soros in July and October 2003
the Notes. The maturity dates of the Notes, which were originally
January and April 2004, respectively, were each extended to March 1,
2005. In February 2005, the maturity date of the Notes was further
extended to May 1, 2006.
11.   FINANCING AGREEMENT
The Company has a financing agreement the Financing Agreement with
Rosenthal & Rosenthal, Inc. Rosenthal pursuant to which Rosenthal
provides the Company with certain credit accommodations, including loans
and advances, factor-to-factor guarantees or letters of credit in favor
of suppliers or factors or purchases of payables owed to the Company
suppliers the Loan Facility.
The Financing Agreement was amended in April 2004 and then again in
February 2005 to: i extend the term until March 30, 2006; ii
substitute $125 million of cash collateral pledged by the Company for
the $20 million standby letter of credit previously provided by Soros
as collateral security for the Company obligations under the Loan
Facility; iii decrease the maximum amount available under the Loan
Facility from $45 million to $40 million; iv increase the tangible
net worth requirement to $70 million; v increase the working capital
requirement to $60 million; and vi increase the minimum cash balance
that the Company is required to maintain to $750,000 exclusive of the
$125 million in cash collateral. The cash collateral is included on
the balance sheet as Restricted Cash and represents monies deposited
in a segregated account that has been pledged to Rosenthal as collateral
for the facility. During fiscal 2004, the maximum amount available under
the Loan Facility did not exceed $35 million.
F-22 BLUEFLY, INC.
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
December 31, 2004
- 
Because the requirement that Soros provide a standby letter of credit to
secure the Loan Facility was removed, the Company is no longer subject
to an agreement with Soros that previously required it to issue
additional warrants to Soros with an exercise price equal to 75% of
market price in the event that Rosenthal were to draw on Soros' letter
of credit.
As of December 31, 2004, the maximum availability under the Loan
Facility was approximately $35 million of which approximately $23
million was committed, leaving approximately $12 million available
against the Loan Facility.
The Company pays interest monthly on the average daily amount
outstanding under the Loan Facility during the preceding month at a per
annum rate equal to the prime rate plus 1% at December 31, 2004 -
625%. For the period ended December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002 interest
expense and fees totaled approximately $112,000, $77,000 and $91,000,
respectively.
The Company pays an annual facility fee equal to 15% of the portion of
the Loan Facility that is provided on the basis of its inventory level.
This formula currently results in an annual facility fee of $33,750.
Rosenthal also charges fees to open letters of credit and guarantees in
an amount equal to a certain percentage of the face amount of the letter
of credit for each thirty 30 days such letter of credit, or a portion
thereof, remains open.
In consideration for the Loan Facility, among other things, we granted
to Rosenthal a first priority lien on substantially all of our assets,
including control of all of our cash accounts including the $125
million of cash collateral, which has been placed in a segregated,
restricted account upon an event of default and certain of our cash
accounts in the event that the total amount of funded debt loaned to us
under the Loan Facility exceeds 90% of the maximum amount available
under the Loan Facility for more than 10 days.
Under the terms of the Loan Facility, Soros has the right to purchase
all of our obligations from Rosenthal at any time during its term.
ROSENTHAL WARRANTS
Upon inception of the Loan Facility in March 2001, the Company issued to
Rosenthal a warrant to purchase 50,000 shares of Common Stock at an
exercise price of $234, per share exercisable for five years. The
Company valued the warrant using the Black-Scholes option pricing model
key assumptions: risk free interest rate: 486%, volatility 117     expected life 4 years, zero dividend yield and amortized the fair value
of the warrants of $45,000 amount over the life of the Loan Facility. In
March 2002, when the agreement was amended and as partial consideration
for the amendment, the Company extended the termination date of the
warrant it issued to Rosenthal from March 30, 2006 to March 30, 2007.
The Company revalued the warrant as of the new measurement date, using
the Black-Scholes option pricing model key assumptions: risk free
interest rate: 525%, volatility 184%, expected life 3 years, zero
dividend yield and credited additional paid in capital for $80,000.
This amount was amortized in full in fiscal 2002.
In November 2003, Rosenthal exercised this warrant in full.
