ITEM 8. FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of RSA Security Inc. and Subsidiaries:
Bedford, Massachusetts We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of RSA Security Inc. and
subsidiaries the Company as of December31, 2005 and 2004, and the related consolidated
statements of operations, stockholders equity and comprehensive income loss, and cash flows for
each of the three years in the period ended December31, 2005. These financial statements are the responsibility of the Companys management. Our
responsibility is to express an opinion on the financial statements based on our audits. We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting
Oversight Board United States. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to
obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material
misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and
disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting
principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall
financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our
opinion. In our opinion, such consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material
respects, the financial position of RSA Security Inc. and subsidiaries at December31, 2005 and
2004, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the
period ended December31, 2005, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the
United States of America. We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting
Oversight Board United States, the effectiveness of the Companys internal control over financial
reporting as of December31, 2005, based on the criteria established in Internal ControlIntegrated
Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission and our
report, dated March15, 2006, expressed an unqualified opinion on managements assessment of the
effectiveness of the Companys internal control over financial reporting and an unqualified opinion
on the effectiveness of the Companys internal control over financial reporting. s/ Deloitte Touche LLP Boston, Massachusetts

Supplemental disclosure of non-cash financing activities In 2004, the holders of our convertible debentures with a principal amount of $80,000 converted the full amount of the
debentures into shares of our common stock. These conversions resulted in the issuance of an aggregate of 5,820,297 shares of
our common stock and the cancellation of the holders debentures. We made no principal payment in connection with the
conversions. These conversions resulted in the increase of additional paid in capital of $79,942 and an increase in the value of our common stock of $58 during the twelve months ending
December31, 2004. See notes to consolidated financial statements

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements
In thousands, except share and per share data 1. Nature of Business and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Nature of Business RSA Security Inc. and its consolidated subsidiaries are an expert in
protecting online identities and digital assets. The inventor of core security technologies for the
Internet, the company leads the way in strong authentication and encryption, bringing trust to
millions of user identities and the transactions that they perform. With nearly 20,000 customers
worldwide, RSA Security has a 20-year track record of award-winning solutions. Principles of Consolidation The consolidated financial statements include our accounts and
those of our wholly-owned subsidiaries. All intercompany accounts and transactions have been
eliminated. Reclassification The long term portion of deferred revenue of $61million has been
reclassified in the 2004 financial statements to conform to the 2005 presentation. This
reclassification had no impact on total assets, stockholders equity or the results of operations
or cash flows. Use of Estimates The preparation of our consolidated financial statements and notes are
prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of
America and require management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts
of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the
financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting periods.
We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe
are reasonable under the circumstances and we continually evaluate such estimates. Our actual
results could differ from those estimates. Revenue Recognition Revenue is recognized when earned. We recognize revenue from the sale
of products when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, delivery has occurred, the fee is
fixed or determinable, and collection is considered probable. We recognize revenue from licensing
other intellectual property when evidence of an arrangement exists, the fee is fixed or
determinable and collection is considered probable. We reduce revenue for provisions of estimated
returns. When arrangements contain multiple elements and vendor specific objective evidence of fair
value exists for all undelivered elements, we recognize revenue for the delivered elements using
the residual method. For arrangements containing multiple elements where vendor specific objective
evidence of fair value does not exist for all undelivered elements, we defer revenue for the
delivered and undelivered elements until vendor specific objective evidence of fair value exists or
all elements have been delivered. We recognize revenue upon shipment of product to our stocking
distributors, net of estimated returns. We defer maintenance services revenue, whether sold
separately or as part of a multiple element arrangement, and recognize it ratably over the term of
the maintenance contract, which is generally twelve months. Some of our arrangements contain bundled products that include a term software license, an RSA
SecurID authenticator and support for the term of the license. As these arrangements contain
multiple elements where vendor specific objective evidence of fair value does not exist for all
undelivered elements, we record these arrangements as deferred revenue and recognize revenue
ratably on a monthly basis over the term of the license agreement. For arrangements that contain an initial prepaid license fee with the payment of ongoing
royalties, we recognize revenue on the initial prepaid license fee when persuasive evidence of an
arrangement exists, delivery has occurred, the fee is fixed or determinable and collection is
considered probable. We recognize the ongoing royalties at the time a reliable estimate can be
made of the actual usage that has occurred, provided that collection is probable. Annual license
fees or one-time license fee arrangements typically contain non-refundable terms; therefore we
recognize revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, delivery has occurred, the fee
is fixed or determinable and collection is considered probable. We recognize revenue allocated to professional service elements as the services are performed.
When the customization is essential to the functionality of the licensed software, then both the
software license and professional services revenue are recognized under the percentage of
completion method. We recognize revenue and gross profit using labor hours as an input measure of
progress to completion on these arrangements. Allowance for Sales Returns and Rebates We record allowances for estimated sales returns and
allowances in the same period as the related revenue is recorded. We base these estimates on
historical sales returns, analysis of credit memo data, current economic 45 Table of Contents trends, product line and customer industry and other known factors. Allowances for estimated
rebates are recorded in the same period as the related revenue and are based upon historical
rebates, analysis of sales data, current economic trends, and other known factors. Accrued sales
returns are recorded net against accounts receivable and accrued rebates are included in accrued
expenses and other liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets. The allowance for sales returns
and rebates was as follows

Allowance for Doubtful Accounts We maintain allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated
losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments. We analyze our
accounts receivable and the composition of the accounts receivable aging, historical bad debts,
customer creditworthiness, current economic trends, and changes in customer payment terms when
evaluating the adequacy of the allowance for doubtful accounts. Bad debt expense is included in
marketing and selling expenses in the consolidated statements of operations. The following table presents changes in the allowance for doubtful accounts

Allowance for Warranty Obligations Our standard practice is to provide a warranty on all RSA
SecurID hardware authenticators for the customer selected programmed life of the
authenticator generally two to five years and to replace any defective authenticators other than
authenticators damaged by a users abuse or alteration free of charge. We sell our other products
to customers with a limited warranty for product defects for a specified period, generally ninety
days. We provide reserves for warranty obligations based on historical failure and defective
return rates and include these costs as a component of product cost of revenue. Each quarter, we
reevaluate our estimate of warranty and defective return obligations, including our assumptions
about estimated failure and return rates. During 2002 and 2003, our quarterly analysis of historical failure and defective return rates
indicated that certain authenticators produced between 2000 and 2002 were subject to higher defect
and failure rates. Accordingly, we recorded significant warranty provisions in the year ended
December31, 2003, based upon our estimates of warranty and defective return obligations as a
result of these trends. We continue to monitor warranty claims and reevaluate its estimate of
warranty and defective return obligations in future periods, which may result in recording
additional warranty expense. We monitor warranty claims and address product defects through our quality and design
processes, which are managed by our product engineering, quality control and technical support
organizations. During the last several years, we have increased resources and initiated new
programs to build an expanded family of high performance authentication solutions. These programs
have resulted in the redesign and re-engineering of authenticator products to improve performance
and reliability by incorporating new microprocessors, electronics, firmware and batteries with
longer lives, which has resulted in decreases in warranty claims in 2005 and 2004. 46 Table of Contents Accrued warranty reserve is included in accrued expenses and other liabilities in the
consolidated balance sheets. The following table presents changes in the warranty reserve

three months or less when purchased to be cash equivalents. We have
$1,598 and $3,021 of restricted cash at December31, 2005 and
2004, respectively, in intangible and other assets, net. Marketable Securities All marketable securities are classified as available for sale and
reported at market value. Unrealized gains and losses are included in accumulated other
comprehensive income, net of tax effects. We determine realized gains or losses based on the
specific identified cost of the securities. Any unrealized losses that are considered to be other
than temporary are charged immediately to the income statement. Inventory Inventory consists primarily of RSA SecurID authenticators and is stated at the
lower of cost first-in, first-out method or market. We maintain an allowance for potentially obsolete inventory. The following table presents

Property and Equipment Property and equipment are stated at cost. Furniture and equipment
are depreciated by the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets,
generally two to ten years. Leasehold improvements are depreciated by the straight-line method
over the lease term or estimated useful live of the related asset, whichever is shorter. Buildings
are depreciated using the straight line method over fifty years, the estimated useful life.
Property and equipment sold or retired is eliminated from the accounts in the year of disposition
and the resulting gain or loss is reflected in earnings. Goodwill and Intangible Assets Goodwill and other acquisition related identifiable assets
are stated at fair value as of the date acquired in a business combination accounted for as a
purchase. SFAS No142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, requires goodwill to be tested
for impairment on an annual basis and between annual tests in certain circumstances, and written
down if impaired. We evaluate goodwill for impairment on November30 of each year and at an
interim date if events or circumstances occur that would more likely than not reduce the fair value
of the goodwill below its carrying amount. We evaluate the carrying value of goodwill and other
intangible assets against the estimated fair value of its assets and will record an impairment
charge in the amount by which the carrying value of the assets exceed their estimated fair value.
Estimated fair value is determined based on estimated discounted future cash flows or a market
multiple valuation method. There were no impairments recorded in 2005 and 2004. SFAS No142 also requires purchased intangible assets other than goodwill to be amortized
over their useful lives, unless their lives are determined to be indefinite. Purchased intangible
assets are carried at cost, less accumulated amortization. Amortization is calculated over the
estimated useful lives of the intangible assets, generally two to ten years. 47 Table of Contents The following table presents changes in goodwill for 2005 and 2004

2005 and 2004. The tax benefit from any future utilization of the remaining acquired net operating
loss carryforwards will also reduce the carrying value of goodwill and other intangible assets
which arose from the acquisitions that we completed in 2001 and 2005. We had recorded a deferred tax liability for merger expenses of $3,946 at December31, 2003,
representing the tax benefit of an amount that was deducted for tax purposes in 2001 but was not
deducted for financial statement purposes. The deferred tax liability was eliminated in 2004 and
the applicable tax benefit reduced goodwill. We recorded $8,418 of deferred tax liabilities in connection with our acquisition of
Cyota, Inc. in 2005. The deferred tax liabilities relate to identifiable intangibles that will be
amortized for financial statements but not for tax. We determined that previously established
deferred tax assets will be available to offset the reversal of these deferred tax liabilities in
future years. As a result, we reduced our previously established valuation allowances by $8,418.
The applicable tax benefit serves to reduce goodwill as the reduction to the valuation allowances
was determined to be the result of the business combination. Impairment of Long-Lived Assets Other Than Goodwill and Intangible Assets We test long-lived
assets for recoverability whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying
amount may not be recoverable. The recoverability of long-lived assets is assessed by comparing the
undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated to the carrying value of the assets. If the sum
of the undiscounted cash flows is less than the carrying value of the assets, we recognize an
impairment charge. The amount of an impairment charge is determined by comparing the carrying
amount of the long-lived asset to its fair value. Fair value is determined based on estimated
discounted cash flows. Financial Instruments The carrying amounts of cash and cash equivalents, marketable
securities, accounts receivable and accounts payable approximate fair value due to the short-term
nature of these instruments. Research
and Development Research and development costs are
expensed as incurred. Cost associated with software development are
capitalized upon achievement of technological feasibility and
amortized over the expected sales of the ultimate products.
Technological feasibility generally occurs late in the development
process and to date these costs have not been material. Advertising Advertising costs are expensed as incurred and were approximately $1,359 2,416 and $869 in 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. Income Taxes Deferred income taxes are recognized based on temporary differences between the
financial statement and tax bases of assets and liabilities and for loss and credit carryforwards.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using the statutory tax rates and laws expected to
apply to taxable income in the years in which the temporary differences are expected to reverse.
Valuation allowances are provided against net deferred tax assets if, based upon the available
evidence, it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will not be
realized. The ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of
future taxable income and the timing of the temporary differences becoming deductible. Management
considers, among other available information, scheduled reversals of deferred tax liabilities,
projected future taxable income, and other matters in making this assessment. Other than a one-time repatriation in 2005 of $19,000 from our foreign subsidiaries, allowed
by the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004 the Act, we intend to continue to reinvest our foreign
earnings indefinitely. The Act provided for a special one-time tax benefit to qualifying
companies, provided that the funds repatriated were used for designated purposes in the United
States. This special repatriation had the effect of increasing our 2005 income tax provision by
approximately $1,000. We have no current intentions to repatriate any further amounts.
Accordingly, no US income taxes have been provided for remaining unremitted earnings of foreign
subsidiaries. At December31, 2005, the remaining unremitted
earnings of our foreign
subsidiaries aggregated approximately $21,100. 48 Table of Contents Foreign Currency The financial statements of our subsidiary in Ireland are measured using
the U.S. dollar as its functional currency. The financial statements of all other of our foreign
branches and subsidiaries are measured using the local currencies as the functional currencies.
Assets and liabilities are translated from their functional currencies to their U.S. dollar
equivalents at balance sheet date exchange rates and revenue and expenses are translated from
functional currencies to U.S. dollar equivalents at average exchange rates in effect during the
year. Any gain or loss from these translations are included in accumulated other comprehensive
income. Foreign currency transaction gains and losses and transaction gains or losses arising from
Ireland are included in interest expense, income and other in the consolidated statements of
operations. Included in interest expense, income and other in the consolidated statements of
operations are foreign currency losses of $502, $303 and $632 in 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. Earnings Per Share We compute basic earnings per share using the weighted average number of
common shares outstanding. We compute diluted earnings per share using the weighted average number
of shares outstanding plus the effect of potential outstanding shares, including options and
warrants, using the treasury stock method. Common Stock Warrants We record warrants to purchase shares of our common stock at fair
value. We estimate the fair value of warrants using the Black-Scholes model at the time of
issuance. We amortize the fair value of the warrants to expense over the expected life of the
related 7% convertible debentures using the straight-line method, which was not materially
different than the effective interest rate method. Treasury Stock We record shares of our common stock that are repurchased in treasury stock
as cost and include them as a component of stockholders equity. We relieve the costs associated
with the reissuance of shares of common stock out of treasury using the first-in, first-out method. Concentration of Credit Risk We had two significant customers who are distributors, whose
aggregate balances accounted for approximately 14% and 19% of total accounts receivable as of
December31, 2005 and December31, 2004, respectively. Stock-Based Compensation Plans We account for stock-based compensation expense using the
intrinsic value method. Under this intrinsic value method, compensation expense, if any, is
recognized based on the difference between the fair value of the underlying stock and the price to
exercise option at the measurement date. The measurement date is defined as that time when both
the number of shares and the exercise price become known. The measurement date is generally the
date the award is made. On December1, 2005, our Board of Directors approved the acceleration of the vesting of
unvested stock options granted under our stock compensation plans for non senior executives having
an exercise price per share of $1579 or greater. Stock option awards granted from 2001 through
2005 with respect to 1,463,322 shares of our common stock were subject to this acceleration, which
was effective as of December1, 2005. Since these options had exercise prices in excess of the
current market values and were not fully achieving their original objectives of incentive
compensation and employee retention, we expect the acceleration to have a positive effect on
employee morale, retention and perception of option value. The acceleration also eliminated future
compensation expense we would otherwise recognize in our Consolidated Statements of Operations. Had we recognized compensation costs for our stock option and purchase plans based on the fair
value for awards under our stock compensation plans, pro forma net income lossand pro forma net
income lossper share would have been as follows

In light of new accounting guidance under SFAS 123R, we reevaluated our assumptions used in
estimating the fair value of employee options granted. Based on this assessment, management
determined that implied volatility is a better indicator of expected future volatility than
historical volatility. Therefore, we used implied volatility figures for the purpose of calculating
the fair value of options granted during the fourth quarter of 2005, which resulted in a reduction
of the pro forma expense by an aggregate of approximately $20million over the expected life for
the options granted during the fourth quarter of 2005. Recent Accounting Pronouncements On December16, 2004, FASB issued a revision to SFAS No.
123, Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation titled Share-Based Payment. This revision requires
that all share-based payments, including grants of employee stock options, are recognized in the
consolidated statements of operations based upon their fair values. The adoption of SFAS 123R will
have a material impact on our statements of operations. The revision is effective for public
companies for fiscal periods beginning after June15, 2005. We adopted SFAS 123R on January1,
2006. Based on the current options outstanding, we expect our 2006 pretax expense for those
options to be between $12,000 and $14,000. This amount may increase to the extent any options are
granted in 2006. Under SFAS 123R, the pro forma disclosures previously permitted no longer will be an
alternative to financial statement recognition. We will apply the Black-Scholes valuation model in
determining the fair value of share-based payments to employees, which will then be amortized on a
straight-line basis over the requisite service period. We will apply the modified prospective
method, which requires that compensation expense be recorded for all unvested stock options and
restricted stock following adoption of SFAS 123R. 2. Acquisition On December30, 2005, we completed our acquisition of Cyota, Inc. for total costs of $137,024.
We deposited $13,600 of the cash consideration into an escrow fund to secure certain
indemnification obligations of the former stockholders of Cyota and to satisfy certain obligations
of the former stockholders of Cyota. On the 12-month anniversary of the closing, the balance of the
escrow fund in excess of any amounts held for unresolved claims will be distributed to the former
stockholders of Cyota. In addition, we have agreed to pay $5,500 for
retention bonuses for the Cyota employees. These retention bonuses
are being accrued over the required service period. Cyota delivers online security and anti-fraud solutions to thousands of financial
institutions worldwide. The acquisition enabled us to introduce a risk-based layered authentication
approach that will allow customers to choose from a range of authentication techniques from life
questions, watermarking and anomaly detection to digital certificates, tokens and smart cards 
depending on the risks posed and desired convenience. We accounted for the Cyota acquisition as a purchase, and accordingly, included the assets
purchased and liabilities assumed 50 Table of Contents in the
consolidated balance sheet at the purchase date based upon their estimated fair values. The results of operations of
Cyota will be included in the consolidated financial statements beginning January1, 2006. The preliminary purchase price is shown below in thousands

The purchase price and related allocation are preliminary and may be revised as a result of
adjustments made to the purchase price, additional information regarding liabilities assumed,
including contingent liabilities, and revisions of preliminary estimates of fair values made at the
date of purchase, based upon final appraisals. Intangible assets include amounts recognized for the fair value of existing technology,
customer relationships, trade name and trademarks, and  agreements.
These intangible assets have an average useful life of approximately 7years. The following pro forma financial information presents the combined results of operations of
RSA Security and Cyota as if the acquisition had occurred as of the beginning of the periods
presented below. Adjustments, which reflect the amortization of purchased intangible assets and
deferred stock compensation, have been made to the combined results of operations for fiscal years
2005 and 2004. The unaudited pro forma financial information is not intended to represent or be
indicative of our consolidated results of operations or financial condition that would have been
reported had the acquisition been completed as of the dates presented, and should not be taken as

We have determined that the gross unrealized losses on our investment securities at December
31, 2005 and 2004 are temporary in nature. We review our investments to identify and evaluate
investments that have indications of possible impairment. Factors considered in determining whether
a loss is temporary include the length of time and extent to which fair value has been less than
the cost basis, the financial condition and near-term prospects of the investee, and our intent and
ability to hold the investment for a period of time sufficient to allow for any anticipated
recovery in market value. All of our fixed income securities are rated investment grade or better.
As of December31, 2005 and 2004, the number of marketable securities held in gross unrealized
loss positions were 72 and 48, respectively. 52 Table of Contents Income from investing activities includes the following gains

In 2003, we recognized $1,542 from the sale of our investments in privately held companies. In November2000, we transferred 2,636,916 shares of VeriSign, Inc. VeriSign common stock,
which was covered by three forward contracts Forwards and one variable delivery forward
contractVDF, to Crosby Finance, LLCCrosby, of which we were, until December2004, a 99%
member. Crosby was a bankruptcy-remote qualified special purpose entity, established specifically
to securitize the shares of VeriSign common stock. We accounted for the contribution and the
transfer as a sale under SFAS No125, Accounting for Transfers and Servicing of Financial Assets
and Extinguishments of Liabilities. Accordingly, we did not consolidate Crosby for accounting
purposes. Until December2004, the counterparty to the VDF contract held the remaining 1% interest
in Crosby. At December31, 2003, Crosby held 2,027,325 shares of VeriSign common stock and the VDF
contract. The VDF contract entitled Crosby to receive cash proceeds of up to $35,336 depending on
the market price of VeriSign common stock on January3, 2006. The closing price of VeriSigns
common stock on The NASDAQ National Market on December31, 2003 was $1630 per share. Unless the
value of the VeriSign stock were to appreciate to at least $8716 per share in January2006, Crosby
would not be entitled to any cash proceeds. Crosby had no liability or obligation to its members
or to the counterparty to the VDF contract other than to deliver the shares of VeriSign common
stock to the counterparty upon maturity of the VDF contract and to distribute the cash proceeds, if
any, to its members. After settlement of the VDF in January2006, Crosby would dissolve. The carrying amount of our 99% interest in Crosby was $208 at December31, 2003 and on
December30, 2004, we sold our 99% interest to Deutsche Bank AG for $20. 4. Property and Equipment Property and equipment were as follows

6. Convertible Debentures During October and November2001, we issued 7% convertible debentures with an aggregate
principal amount of $80,000. The debentures were scheduled to mature on October17, 2004, unless
redeemed earlier by us or converted into shares of our common stock at the holders option. In June and October2004, the holders of our 7% convertible debentures converted the full
amount of the debentures in several tranches. These conversions resulted in the issuance of an
aggregate of 5,820,297 shares of our common stock and the cancellation of all of our outstanding 7%
convertible subordinated debentures. We made no principal payments in connection with any of the
conversions. 7. Stockholders Equity Common Stock Warrants In connection with the issuance of our 7% convertible debentures in
October and November2001, we issued warrants to the convertible debenture holders to purchase
shares of our common stock. The holders may exercise the warrants for an aggregate of 873,045
shares of our common stock at an exercise price of $13745 per share. The exercise price of the
warrants may be adjusted under certain circumstances, such as events that would cause dilution of
the holders interest. The warrants were immediately exercisable upon issuance and expire on
October17, 2006. We recorded the fair market value of the warrants as additional paid-in capital
upon issuance. As of December31, 2005, none of the warrants have been exercised. Stockholder Rights Plan On July20, 1999, our Board of Directors adopted a Stockholder
Rights Plan, and a Rights Agreement to govern the Plan, under which common stock purchase rights
each, a Right were distributed to our stockholders at the rate of one Right for each share of
our common stock. Each Right entitles the stockholder that owns the Right to purchase one share of
our common stock at a purchase price of $8333 per share, subject to adjustment the Purchase
Price. Our stockholders may exercise the Rights 1if another party acquires, or obtains the
right to acquire, beneficial ownership of 15% or more of our common stock, or 2upon the
commencement of a tender or exchange offer that, if consummated, would result in another party
acquiring 15% or more of our common stock. In the event of such an acquisition or similar event,
each Right, other than those owned by the acquiring party, will enable the stockholder that owns
the Right to purchase the number of shares of our common stock that equals the Purchase Price
divided by one-half of the current market price as defined in the Rights Agreement of the common
stock. In addition, if we are involved in a merger or other transaction with another company in which
we are not the surviving corporation, or if we sell or transfer 50% or more of our assets or
earning power to another company, each Right will entitle the stockholder that owns it to purchase
the number of shares of common stock of the acquiring company that equals the Purchase Price
divided by one-half of the current market price of the acquiring companys common stock. We are
generally entitled to redeem the Rights at $0001 per Right at any time until the tenth business
day after the later of 1a public announcement that an acquiring party has acquired, or obtained
the right to acquire, 15% or more of our common stock or 2the actual knowledge by any of our
executive officers of such an acquisition. Unless the Rights are redeemed or exchanged earlier,
they will expire on July20, 2009. Share Repurchase Program We have maintained a common stock repurchase program since
September2004. Under the program, we are authorized to repurchase up to 8,700,000 shares of our
common stock through June30, 2006. We may make repurchases in the open market or through
negotiated transactions from time to time depending on market conditions. We use repurchased shares
for stock option and employee stock purchase plans, and for general corporate purposes. During
2005, we repurchased 2,154,729 shares for $28,973. Since the repurchase program was authorized, we
have repurchased an aggregate of 2,204,729 shares for $29,884 as of December31, 2005. 54 Table of Contents 8. Stock Option and Purchase Plans Our 2005 Stock Incentive Plan the 2005 Plan allows us to grant stock options, stock
appreciation rights, restricted stock awards and other stock-based awards to our employees,
officers, directors, consultants and advisors. Some of the stock options that we grant vest over
time, generally four years, and some vest based on the achievement of performance metrics. Stock
options generally expire seven years after the grant date. In 2005, the Compensation Committee of
our Board of Directors granted 50,000 shares of restricted stock to one of the Companys officers,
which vest over three years. At December31, 2005, there were 6,900,000 shares authorized and
5,333,537 shares available for grant under the 2005 Plan. Our 1994 Stock Option Plan, as amended 1998 Restatement, as amended the1994 Plan,
allowed us to grant to our employees, officers, directors and consultants options to purchase
common stock intended to qualify as incentive stock options, options that do not qualify as
incentive stock options non-statutory options, restricted stock awards and other stock-based
awards. In 2004, the 1994 Plan expired in accordance with its terms, except with respect to awards
already granted, and we no longer grant awards under this plan. Our Amended and Restated 1998 Non-Officer Employee Stock Incentive Plan, as amended the1998
Plan, allows us to grant non-statutory stock options and stock appreciation rights awards to our
employees, consultants and advisors, other than those who are also officers within the meaning of
Section16 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. In general, stock options granted
under the 1998 Plan become exercisable as to 25% of the shares subject to each option on the first
anniversary of the grant date and in equal quarterly installments thereafter for three years. In
general, no installment is exercisable after the fourth anniversary of the date on which such
installment first becomes exercisable, and options generally expire eight years from the grant
date. At December31, 2005, there were 10,608,263 shares authorized and 1,444,930 shares available
for grant under the 1998 Plan. A summary of stock option activity under all plans follows

1475   Until February1, 2006, our 1994 Employee Stock Purchase Plan, as amended the Purchase
Plan, provided for sales of common stock to participating employees at 85% of the closing price
of our common stock on The NASDAQ National Market on either the first day or the last day of the
offering period, whichever was lower. Effective February1, 2006, our Board of Directors approved
an amendment to the Purchase Plan that fixes the price at which our common stock may be sold to
participating employees at 85% of the closing price of our common stock on The NASDAQ National
Market on the last day of the offering period. At December31, 2005, 4,100,000 shares were
authorized under the Purchase Plan and 1,327,201 shares were available for purchase. The cumulative
total shares purchased under the plan through 2005, 2004 and 2003 were 2,772,799, 2,453,888 and
2,153,016, respectively. 9. Earnings Per Share Equity instruments that were considered antidilutive and therefore were not included in the

than a one-time repatriation in 2005 of $19,000 from our foreign subsidiaries,
allowed by the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004 the Act, we intend to continue to
reinvest our foreign earnings indefinitely. The Act provided for a special one-time tax benefit to
qualifying companies, provided that the funds repatriated were used for designated purposes in the
United States. This special repatriation had the effect of increasing our 2005 income tax
provision by approximately $1,000. We have no current intentions to repatriate any
further amounts. Accordingly, no US income taxes have been provided for remaining unremitted
earnings of foreign subsidiaries. At December31, 2005, the
remaining unremitted earnings of our foreign subsidiaries aggregated approximately $21,100. 56 Table of Contents The provision for income taxes consisted of the following

We perform an annual assessment of the realization of our deferred tax assets considering all
of the available evidence, both positive and negative. We then record a valuation allowance
against the deferred tax assets which we believe, based on the weight of available evidence, will
more than likely not be realized. In 2005, our valuation allowances were reduced by $5,177, which
consisted of a net reduction of $900 attributable to net tax liabilities assumed in the Cyota
acquisition, and a further reduction of $4,277 due to the realization of tax carryforwards for
which valuation allowances had been provided. This $4,277 reduction was recorded as a reduction in
goodwill of $3,544 and an increase in additional paid-in-capital of $734. In 2004, our valuation
allowances were reduced
by $1,765, which was attributable to ian increase of $10,813 recorded against deferred tax
assets that we believe will more than 57 Table of Contents likely not be realized, and iia decrease of $12,578 which
represents the tax benefit of the utilization of approximately $35,937 of acquisition net operating
loss carryforwards in 2004. The $12,578 tax benefit reduced goodwill in 2004. Tax benefits arising from the exercise of stock options were $3,723, $9,552 and $5,485 in
2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. These tax benefits are generally allocated directly to
additional paid-in capital in stockholders equity when realized, although on adoption of SFAS 123R
a portion of these benefits may be recorded as reductions in income tax expense prospectively.
Cash payments for income taxes were approximately $4,866, $3,238 and $1,749 in 2005, 2004 and 2003,
respectively. As of December31, 2005, we have net operating loss carryforwards for federal tax purposes of
approximately $65,056. These carryforwards will expire in calendar years 2020 through 2024. In
addition, we have net loss carryforwards available for state filing purposes, however, these
carryforwards have been fully reserved as the remaining carryforward periods are so short that we
believe it is unlikely that they will be realized in cash before they expire. Of these federal
carryforwards, approximately $48,075 was acquired through acquisitions consummated in 2001 and
2005. To the extent these losses are realized, the reversal of valuation allowances provided
against these assets will be recorded as an adjustment to goodwill, which could result in a
reduction of goodwill of up to $16,827. In addition, approximately $1,242 relate to deductions
taken for tax purposes related to the exercise of stock options; to the extent these losses are
realized, the reversal of valuation allowances provided against these asset will generally be
recorded as increases in additional paid-in-capital, which could result in an increase in
additional paid-in-capital of up to $435. We settled a United States Internal Revenue Service IRS audit in 2005. The IRS audit
related to tax years 1996 through 2002. We received tax refunds and associated interest of
approximately $9,864 as a result of this settlement. Approximately $3,146 and $878 of the refund
was recorded as an offset to previously established tax receivable and deferred tax asset balances
respectively. Approximately $935 was recorded as interest income. The remaining $4,905 was
recorded as a benefit to tax expense in 2005. We do not expect any additional refunds for the tax
periods noted above. We are required to reserve for certain loss contingencies relating to, among other things,
income taxes. We reserve for these items in accordance with SFAS No5, Accounting for
Contingencies. In the ordinary course of global business there are many transactions and
calculations where the ultimate tax outcome is uncertain. As a result we are, from time to time,
subjected to various US, international and state tax audits. Accordingly, we reserve for potential
tax liabilities due in these various jurisdictions. We review these tax reserves annually. In
connection with our review of the tax reserves for 2005 and 2004, we determined that the amount of
reserves required for tax exposures was less than the amount recorded in the financial statements.
As a result, we reduced the tax reserves by $2,500 in 2005 and $7,000 in 2004. These reductions in
tax reserve was recorded as a benefit to income tax expense. 11. Restructurings The following table summarizes our restructuring activities

During the year ended December31, 2002, we recorded total restructuring charges of $56,036,
consisting of facility exit costs,
costs associated with the liquidation of our Swedish development operations and the sale of
certain Swedish assets and the business 58 Table of Contents related to the assets to TFS Technology AB TFS, and
severance and other costs associated with the reduction of employee headcount. During 2004 we recorded a net charge of $1,032 related to revised estimates of facility exit
costs. We revised this estimate of facility exit costs based upon the terms of finalized subleases
and associated costs obtained during the second quarter of 2004. We also reduced our restructuring
reserve by $250 at December31, 2004 when we determined our remaining severance costs were lower
than originally estimated. On December1, 2005, our management committed to a plan to restructure the companys
engineering resources into four core locations around the world. Under the plan, which we expect
to bring greater cost efficiencies to the engineering group and closer coordination to engineering
projects, approximately 120 positions will be relocated. All engineering personnel currently based
in our offices in Vancouver, B.C, San Mateo, California and New York City will be relocated to
Bedford, Massachusetts or to expanded operations in India and Brisbane, Australia. These
transitions will be conducted in phases, with an expected completion date of December2006. The
program is projected to result in total charges in the range of
$10,000to $14,000
primarily related to facility closings and headcount reductions associated with relocating
engineering resources. In the fourth quarter of 2005, we recorded a charge of $2,051 related to
engineering, sales and other headcount reductions in connection with this plan. We
expect to pay the remaining restructuring costs accrued at December31, 2005 as

Certificate Manager software, RSA ClearTrust software, and maintenance and professional services
associated with these products. Developer solutions include sales of RSA BSAFE encryption software
and protocol products, RSA Certificate Manager components, and maintenance and professional
services associated with these products. The segment was determined primarily based on how
management views and evaluates our operations. Our operations are conducted throughout the world. Operations in the United States represent
more than 55% of total revenue for the year ended December31, 2005. Our operations in other
countries have been grouped by regional area below. The following tables present information about

Corporation accounted for 9% and 11% of our total revenue for the years ended December31, 2005 and
2004, respectively. During 2003, Tech Data Corporation merged with Azlan Group Plc also a
distributor. Had this merger been completed as of January1, 2003, revenue from the combined
entity, on a pro forma basis, would have accounted for 10% of our total revenue for the year ended

13. Retirement and Savings Plan We have a 401k retirement and savings plan that allows each participant to defer up to 20%
of the participants annual earnings subject to an annual statutory maximum amount. We may make,
at our discretion, matching and profit-sharing contributions to the plan. Generally, matching and
profit-sharing contributions that we make vest annually over four years. Matching contributions are
paid in cash and totaled $1,844, $1,602 and $1,412 in 2005, 2004, and 2003, respectively. No
profit sharing contributions were made for 2005, 2004 and 2003. We also have a non-qualified deferred compensation program that permits key employees to
annually elect to defer, for their personal income tax purposes, a portion of their compensation
for not less than three years or until their retirement, termination, death or disability. To
assist in the financing of the funding of the deferred compensation program, we invest the
compensation that is withheld and deferred in Company-owned life insurance policies. Amounts
withheld and deferred for key employees under our deferred compensation program were $562, $1,085
and $545 in 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively, and are included in operating expenses. A non
recurring expense of $1,190 for fees and losses on investment income related to our deferred
compensation plan was included in our general and administrative expenses in 2004. On July19, 2005, we entered into a letter agreement with a member of the Board of Directors
of RSA Security who is also our former Chairman, Chief Executive Officer and President that upon
his retirement on June30, 2005 we will provide medical and dental benefits to him and his wife for
the duration of their lives. As of December31, 2005 we have accrued $249 for these post
retirement benefits. 14. Commitments We lease office facilities and equipment under non-cancelable operating leases expiring
through 2017. Future minimum rental payments net of existing sublease agreements and excluding

in U.S. District Court for the District of Delaware against RSA Security, VeriSign, Inc.,
Netegrity, Inc., Computer Associates International, Inc. and Johnson Johnson Case Number
05-214. In its complaint, Prism Technologies alleges that some of our products, including our RSA
ClearTrust product, and certain products of each of the other defendants infringe a patent that
Prism Technologies owns, and Prism Technologies seeks unspecified damages as well as a permanent
injunction enjoining the defendants from infringing its patent. The parties are now conducting
discovery. We believe Prism Technologies claims are without merit. We cannot predict the outcome
of this matter, but we believe that the disposition of the matter will not have a material adverse
effect on our continuing operations and consolidated financial position. From time to time, we have been named as a defendant in other legal actions arising from our
normal business activities, which we believe will not have a material adverse effect on us or our
business. Item 1. BUSINESS

Item 5. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES Disclosure Controls and Procedures. Our management, with the participation of our Chief
Executive Officer, who is also our acting Chief Financial Officer, evaluated the effectiveness of
our disclosure controls and procedures as defined in the SEC rules promulgated under the
Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended as of December31, 2005. Based on this evaluation, our
CEO concluded that, as of December31, 2005, our disclosure controls and procedures were 1
designed to ensure that material information relating to RSA Security, including its consolidated
subsidiaries, is made known to our CEO and CFO by others within RSA Security, particularly during
the period in which this Report was being prepared, and 2effective, in that they provide
reasonable assurance that information that we are required to disclose in the reports we file under
the Securities Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods
specified in the SECs rules and forms. 61 Table of Contents Managements Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting Our management is responsible
for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as such term
is defined in Exchange Act Rule13a-15f. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control
over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Projections of any evaluation of
effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because
of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may
deteriorate. Our management, including our Chief Executive Officer, who is also our acting Chief Financial
Officer, conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial
reporting based on the framework in Internal Control Integrated Framework issued by the Committee
of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Based on its evaluation under the framework
in Internal Control Integrated Framework, our management concluded that our internal control over
financial reporting was effective as of December31, 2005. Our managements assessment of the
effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December31, 2005 has been
audited by Deloitte Touche LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in
its report which is included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Because we acquired Cyota on December30, 2005, we have not yet fully integrated
Cyota into our internal control over financial reporting, and therefore excluded Cyota from our
December31, 2005 evaluation of internal control. Cyota will be included in our December31, 2006
evaluation of internal control over financial reporting. REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM To the
Board of Directors and Stockholders of RSA Security Inc. and
Subsidiaries Bedford, Massachusetts We have
audited managements assessment, included in the accompanying
Managements Report on Internal Control Over Financial
Reporting, 
that RSA Security Inc. and subsidiaries the
Company maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2005,

As described in Managements Report on Internal Control Over
Financial Reporting, management excluded from their assessment
the internal control over financial reporting at Cyota Inc., which
was acquired on December30, 2005, and whose financial
statements constitute 2% of total consolidated assets as of
December31, 2005, exclusive of goodwill and intangible assets
subject to the Companys systems of internal control over
financial reporting. Accordingly, our audit did not include the
internal control over financial reporting at Cyota Inc.
The Companys management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on managements assessment and an opinion on the effectiveness of the Companys internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board United States. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, evaluating managements assessment, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinions. A companys internal control over financial reporting is a process
designed by, or under the supervision of, the companys principal executive and principal financial officers, or persons performing
similar functions, and effected by the companys board of
directors, management, and other personnel to provide reasonable assurance
regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with
generally accepted accounting principles. A companys internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures
that 1 pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable
detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions
of the assets of the company; 2 provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of
financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are
being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and 3 provide reasonable assurance regarding
prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the companys assets that could have a material
effect on the financial statements. Because of the inherent limitations of internal control over financial reporting, including the possibility of collusion or improper management override of controls, material misstatements due to error or fraud may not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. Also, projections of any evaluation of the effectiveness of the internal control over financial reporting to future periods are subject to the risk that the controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. In our
opinion, managements assessment that the Company maintained
effective internal control over financial reporting as of December
31, 2005, is fairly stated, in all material respects, based on the
criteria established in Internal Control Integrated
Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of
the Treadway Commission. Also in our opinion, the Company maintained,
in all material respects, effective internal control over financial
reporting as of December 31, 2005, based on the criteria established
in Internal Control Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. We have
also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company
Accounting Oversight Board United States, the consolidated
financial statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2005
of the Company and our report, dated March15, 2006, expressed an unqualified opinion on those financial statements. s/ 
Deloitte Touche llp Boston,
Massachusetts March 15, 2006 Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. No change in our internal control over
financial reporting as defined in the SEC rules promulgated under the Securities Exchange Act
occurred during the quarter ended December31, 2005 that has materially affected, or is reasonably
likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. ITEM 9B. OTHER INFORMATION None. PART III
