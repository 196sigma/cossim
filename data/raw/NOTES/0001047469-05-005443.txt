operations, stockholders' equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December31, 2004. These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company management.
Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audits. 
We

reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the
financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.
We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. 
In
our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Monster Worldwide,Inc. at December31, 2004
and 2003, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December31, 2004, in conformity
with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM     Monster
Worldwide,Inc.
New York, New York 
We
have audited management assessment, included in the accompanying Management Report on Internal Control, that Monster Worldwide,Inc. the Company maintained effective internal control
over financial reporting as of December31, 2004, based on the criteria established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway
Commission COSO. The Company management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over
financial reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on management assessment and an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company internal control over financial reporting based on our
audit. 
We
conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board United States. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over
financial reporting, evaluating management assessment, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control, and performing such other procedures as we considered
necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion. 
A
company internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements
for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that 1pertain
to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; 2provide reasonable assurance that
transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are
being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and 3provide
reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. Because
of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are
subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. 
As
indicated in the accompanying Management Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting, management assessment of and conclusion on the effectiveness of internal control over financial
reporting did not include the internal controls of jobpilot GmbH, which is included in the 2004 consolidated financial statements of Monster Worldwide,Inc. and constituted approximately 3% of
consolidated revenues and 6% of income from continuing operations before income taxes for the year ended December31, 2004. Management did not assess the effectiveness of internal control over
financial reporting at this entity because the Company acquired this entity during 2004. Refer to Note2 to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion of this acquisition and
its impact on the Company consolidated financial statements. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting of Monster Worldwide,Inc. also did not include an evaluation of the
internal control over financial reporting of the entity referred to above. 
In
our opinion, management assessment that Monster Worldwide,Inc. maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of December31, 2004, is fairly stated, in all
material respects, based on the criteria established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by COSO. Also in our opinion, 
37  the
Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December31, 2004, based on the criteria established in Internal Control-Integrated
Framework issued by COSO. 
We
have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board United States, the consolidated balance sheets of Monster Worldwide,Inc. as of
December31, 2004 and 2003 and the related consolidated statements of operations, stockholders' equity, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December31, 2004
and our report dated February18, 2005 expressed an unqualified opinion. s/BDO SEIDMAN, LLP BDO Seidman, LLP. New

MONSTER WORLDWIDE, INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS      Dollars in thousands, except per share amounts    
1. BASIS OF PRESENTATION AND SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES 
The Company continuing operations consist of three business segments: Monster, Advertising Communications and Directional Marketing. Revenue is primarily earned from
job postings placed on the Company career website, Monster, resume and other database access, selling and placing recruitment advertising, resume screening services and selling and placing Yellow
Pages advertising. These services are provided to customers in a variety of industries throughout North America, Europe and the Asia-Pacific Region. The
consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and all of its wholly-owned and majority-owned subsidiaries. All significant inter-company accounts and transactions have been
eliminated in consolidation. 
The
preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported
amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting
period. These estimates include, among others, allowances for doubtful accounts, net realizable values on long-lived assets and deferred tax assets, certain accrued expense accounts and
revenue recognition. Actual results could differ from those estimates. 
Certain
reclassifications of prior year amounts have been made for consistent presentation. 
Business Combinations and Dispositions 
The Company accounts for business combinations using the purchase method of accounting, which requires that assets acquired and liabilities assumed be recorded at their fair
values on the date of a business acquisition. The consolidated financial statements and results of operations reflect an acquired business from the completion date of an acquisition and are not
restated. The costs to acquire a business, including transaction costs, are allocated to the fair value of net assets acquired upon acquisition. Any excess of the purchase price over the estimated
fair values of the net assets acquired is recorded as goodwill. 
For
the period January1, 2003 through December31, 2004, the Company completed six business combinations accounted for using the purchase method of accounting. There were no significant
business acquisitions in the year ended December31, 2002. Note2 to the financial statements contains a full discussion of the Company business combinations occurring in the 2003 and
2004 periods. Although none of the following acquisitions were considered to be significant subsidiaries, either individually or in the aggregate, they do affect the comparability of results from
period to period. The acquisitions and the acquisition dates are as follows: Acquired Business

The Company accounts for business dispositions in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards SFAS No144, Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived
Assets. SFAS144 requires the results of operations of business dispositions
to be segregated from continuing operations and reflected as discontinued operations in current and prior periods. The results of the Company continuing operations have been restated to reflect such
dispositions in each period presented. See Note3 to the financial statements for further discussion of the Company disposition transactions. 
Revenue Recognition and Work-In-Process 
Monster.The Company Monster division primarily earns revenue from the placement of job postings on the websites within the Monster
network, access to the Monster network online resume database and other ancillary services. The Company recognizes revenue at the time that job postings are displayed on the Monster network
websites. Revenue earned from subscriptions to the Monster network resume database is recognized over the length of the underlying subscriptions, typically ranging from two weeks to twelve months.
Revenue associated with multiple element contracts is allocated based on the relative fair value of the services included in the contract. Unearned revenues are reported on the balance sheet as
deferred revenue. 
Advertising Communications.The Company Advertising Communications division derives revenue for job advertisements
placed in newspapers, Internet career job boards such as Monster and other media, plus associated fees for related services. Revenue is recorded net of media placement costs, which are passed on to
the customer. Revenue is generally recognized upon placement date for newspapers and other media. Online media revenue is recognized when services are purchased. Directional Marketing.The Company Directional Marketing division derives revenue from the placement of advertisements in telephone
directories Yellow Pages advertising. Revenue for Yellow Pages advertisements are recognized on the publications' closing dates and are recorded net of publisher advertising costs, which is passed
on to the customer. Direct operating costs incurred that relate to future revenue for Yellow Pages advertisements, are deferred recorded as
work-in-process in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets and subsequently charged to expense when the directories are closed for publication and the related commission
is recognized as income. In addition, the Company earns revenue from mortgage companies, real estate firms and other companies that place advertisements on its online relocation portal, Monstermoving.
Revenue derived from such advertisements is recognized over the stated terms of fixed contracts, or upon referral to advertisers on our website for performance based contracts. 
Marketing and Promotion 
Advertising production costs are recorded as an expense the first time an advertisement appears. All other advertising costs are expensed as incurred. 
Fair Value of Financial Instruments 
The carrying amounts reported in the consolidated balance sheets for cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable and accounts payable approximate fair value because of the
immediate or short-term maturity of these financial instruments. The carrying amount reported for long-term debt approximates fair value because, in general, the interest on
the underlying instruments fluctuates with market rates. In instances where long-term debt carries fixed interest rates, the obligation is recorded at the present value of the future
payments. 
44  Concentrations of Risk 
Financial instruments that potentially subject the Company to concentrations of credit risk are primarily cash and cash equivalents and accounts receivable. Cash and cash
equivalents are maintained with several financial institutions. Deposits held with banks may exceed the amount of insurance provided on such deposits. Generally these deposits may be redeemed upon
demand. The Company also invests in short term commercial paper rated P1 by Moody or A1 by Standard Poors or better. 
The
Company performs continuing credit evaluations of its customers and does not require collateral. The Company has not experienced significant losses related to receivables from individual customers
or groups of customers in any particular industry or geographic area. 
Cash and Cash Equivalents 
Cash and cash equivalents, which primarily consist of commercial paper and time deposits, are stated at cost, which approximates fair value. For financial statement
presentation purposes, the Company considers all highly liquid investments having original maturities of three months or less to be cash equivalents. Outstanding checks in excess of account balances
typically represent publisher payments, payroll and other contractual obligations disbursed on or near the last day of a reporting period and are reported as a current liability in the accompanying
consolidated balance sheets. 
Accounts Receivable 
The Company accounts receivable primarily consist of trade receivables and earned commissions receivable. Earned commissions receivable represent Yellow Pages commissions
that have not been billed to customers. As of December31, 2004 and 2003, earned commissions receivable were $7,914 and $7,357, respectively. Management reviews accounts receivable on a monthly
basis to determine if any receivables will potentially be uncollectible. The Company includes any accounts receivable balances that are determined to be uncollectible, in its allowance for doubtful
accounts. After all attempts to collect a receivable have failed, the receivable is written off against the allowance. Based on the information available, the Company believes its allowance for
doubtful accounts as of December31, 2004 is adequate. However, actual write-offs could exceed the recorded allowance. Activity in the allowance for doubtful accounts is as follows: Year ended December 31,

Computer and communications equipment, furniture and fixtures and capitalized software costs are stated at cost and are depreciated using the straight line method over the
estimated useful lives of the assets, generally 3 to 10years. Leasehold improvements are stated at cost and amortized, using the straight line method, over their estimated useful lives, or the
lease term, whichever is shorter. 
45  Capitalized Software Costs 
Capitalized software costs consist of costs to purchase and develop software for internal use. The Company capitalizes certain incurred software development costs in accordance
with, the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants AICPA issued Statement of Position No98-1, Accounting for the Cost of Computer Software
Developed or Obtained for Internal Use SOP 98-1. Costs incurred during the application-development stage for software bought and further customized by outside
vendors for the Company use and software developed by a vendor for the Company proprietary use have been capitalized. Costs incurred related to the Company own personnel who are directly
associated with software development are capitalized as appropriate. 
Goodwill, Intangible Assets and Accounting Change 
Goodwill represents acquisition costs in excess of the fair value of net tangible and intangible assets of businesses purchased. Other intangible assets primarily consist of
the value of customer relationships, non-compete agreements, trademarks and internet domains. Amortizable intangible assets are primarily being amortized on a straight-line
basis, which approximates economic use, over periods ranging from two to thirty years. In accordance with SFAS142, Goodwill and Other Intangible
Assets, the Company evaluates goodwill and indefinite lived intangibles annually for impairment, or earlier if indicators of potential impairment exist. The determination of
whether or not goodwill has become impaired involves a significant level of judgment in the assumptions underlying the approach used to determine the value of the Company reporting units. Changes in
the Company strategy and/or market conditions could significantly impact these judgments and require adjustments to recorded amounts of intangible assets. 
In
connection with the Company implementation of SFAS142, a non-cash charge of $428,374, net of tax $149,374 relating to continuing operations, net of tax, was recorded at
January1, 2002 and is reflected in the Company consolidated statement of operations as a cumulative effect of accounting change for the year ended December31, 2002. The Company has
adopted a policy to review each reporting unit for impairment using a discounted cash flow approach that uses forward-looking assumptions regarding market share, revenues and costs for each reporting
unit as well as appropriate discount rates. The write-down of goodwill shown as a cumulative effect of an accounting change in our consolidated statement of operations for the year ended
December31, 2002 was determined using the forward-looking assumptions that were available to us on January1, 2002. In 2003 and 2004, the Company again reviewed each reporting unit for
impairment and no further impairment was identified. The estimates used were consistent with the plans and estimates that the Company was using to manage the underlying business. Long-Lived Assets 
Long-lived assets, other than goodwill are evaluated for impairment when events or changes in business circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets
may not be fully recoverable. An impairment loss would be recognized when estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected to result from the use of these assets and its eventual disposition is less
than its carrying amount. Identified intangible assets are primarily evaluated on an annual basis, generally in conjunction with the Company evaluation of goodwill balances. Impairment, if any, is
assessed using discounted cash flows. The determination of whether or not long-lived assets have become impaired involves a significant level of judgment in the assumptions underlying the
approach used to determine the estimated future cash flows expected to result from the use of those assets. Changes in our strategy, assumptions and/or market conditions could significantly impact
these judgments and require adjustments to recorded amounts of long-lived assets. During the year ended December31, 2003, we recorded a $25,783 impairment charge as a component of
business reorganization, 
46  spin-off
and other special charges, relating to certain software and other equipment that will no longer be utilized as designed, as a direct result of the spin-off
transaction. 
Foreign Currency Translation 
The financial position and results of operations of the Company foreign subsidiaries are determined using local currency as the functional currency. Assets and liabilities of
these subsidiaries are translated at the exchange rate in effect at each year-end. Income statement accounts are translated at the average rate of exchange prevailing during the year.
Translation adjustments arising from the use of differing exchange rates from period to period are included in other comprehensive
income loss, a component of stockholders' equity. Gains and losses resulting from other foreign currency transactions are included in other income expense. 
Comprehensive
income loss is defined to include all changes in equity except those resulting from investments by owners and distributions to owners. The Company items of other comprehensive income
loss are foreign currency translation adjustments, which relate to investments that are permanent in nature, and unrealized gains and losses on forward foreign exchange contracts used to manage
foreign currency risk, net of applicable income taxes. To the extent that such amounts relate to investments that are permanent in nature, no adjustments for income taxes are made. 
Income Taxes 
Income taxes are computed on the pretax income loss based on the current tax law. Deferred income taxes are recognized for the expected tax consequences in future years of
differences between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their financial reporting amounts at each balance sheet date and are based on enacted tax laws and statutory tax rates. Valuation
allowances are recorded against deferred tax assets to the extent their ultimate realization is uncertain. 
Stock-Based Compensation 
The Company financial statements are presented in accordance with the Accounting Principles Board APB Opinion No25, Accounting for
Stock Issued to Employees. Under APB 25, generally, no compensation expense is recognized in connection with the awarding of stock option grants to employees provided that, as
of the grant date, all terms associated with the award are fixed and the quoted market price of the stock is equal to or less than the amount an employee must pay to acquire the stock as defined. As
the Company only issues fixed term stock option grants at or above the quoted market price on the date of the grant, there has been no compensation expense associated with stock options recognized in
the accompanying financial statements. The Company adopted the disclosure only provisions of SFAS123, Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation,
which requires certain financial statement disclosures, including pro forma operating results had the Company prepared its consolidated financial statements in accordance with the fair value based
method of accounting for stock-based compensation. 
The
Black-Scholes option-pricing model was developed for use in estimating the fair value of traded options that have no restrictions and are fully transferable and negotiable in a free trading
market. Black-Scholes does not consider the employment, transfer or vesting restrictions that are inherent in the Company employee options. Use of an option valuation model, as required by
SFAS123, includes highly subjective assumptions based on long-term predictions, including the expected stock price volatility and average life of each option grant. Because the
Company employee options have characteristics significantly different from those of freely traded options, and because changes in the subjective input 
47  assumptions
can materially affect the Company estimate of the fair value of those options, in the Company opinion, the existing valuation models, including Black-Scholes, are not reliable single
measures and may misstate the fair value of the Company employee options. 
As
required under SFAS123 and SFAS148, Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation Transition and Disclosure, the pro forma effects of
stock-based compensation on net income loss and net income loss per share have been estimated at the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model based on the following weighted
average assumptions: Years Ended December 31 2004

75 For
purposes of pro forma disclosures, the estimated fair value of the options is assumed to be amortized and expensed over the options' vesting periods. Certain stock options issued to employees of
Hudson Highland Group,Inc. HH Group, the Company former eResourcing and Executive Search segments that were spun-off in March2003 see Note3, were forfeited
in accordance with plan provisions. Accordingly, the Company has adjusted pro forma stock based compensation expense in the year ended December31, 2003 to reflect such forfeitures. The pro
forma effects of recognizing compensation expense under the fair value method on the Company operating results and per share data are as follows: Year Ended December 31 2004 
2003 
2002 Net income loss as reported 73,104 81,864 534,896 Add: Stock based employee compensation expense included in reported net income loss, net of tax 1,770 2,141 1,249 Deduct: Compensation expense determined under fair value based method for all awards, net of tax 32,100 31,294 62,070 Pro forma net income loss 42,774 111,017 595,717 Basic earnings loss per share Net income loss-as reported 062 073 480 Net income loss-pro forma 036 099 535 Diluted earnings loss per share Net income loss-as reported 061 072 480 Net income loss-pro forma 036 099 535 Earnings Per Share 
Basic earnings per share does not include the effects of potentially dilutive stock options and is computed by dividing income available to common shareholders by the weighted
average number of common shares outstanding for the period. Diluted earnings per share reflects, in periods in which they have a dilutive effect, common shares issuable upon exercise of stock options
for periods in which the options' exercise price is lower than the Company average share price for the period.

11,897 and 12,829 for 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively. The Company continuing operations reported income in the years ended December31, 2004 and 2003. As a result, certain stock options
are considered to have a dilutive effect during these periods. 
Recently Issued Accounting Standards 
On October13, 2004, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Statement 123R, Share-Based Payment, which requires
all companies to measure compensation cost for all share-based payments, including employee stock options, at fair value. The statement is effective for all public companies for interim or annual
periods after June15, 2005. The statement eliminates the ability to account for share-based compensation transactions using APB No25, and generally requires that such transactions be
accounted for using a fair-value-based method and recognized as expenses in our
consolidated statements of operations. The standard also requires that the modified prospective transition method be used, which would necessitate the Company to recognize compensation cost for the
fair value of new awards granted, modified or settled after the effective date of the SFAS123R. In addition, the measurement of compensation cost for awards that are not fully vested as of the
effective date of the SFAS123R would be based on the same estimate that the Company used to previously value its grants under SFAS123. 
As
a result of SFAS123R, the Company will be required to expense the fair value of our stock option grants rather than disclose the impact on its consolidated statement of operations within
the Company footnotes, as is current practice. The Company is currently assessing the potential impact of the new standard on its consolidated financial statements and is evaluating alternative
equity compensation arrangements.

8.FINANCING AGREEMENT 
In
April2003, the Company entered into a financing arrangement to provide for a $100,000, three year, secured revolving credit facility with a group of lenders. The credit facility is secured
by substantially all of the Company assets and is available for ongoing working capital requirements and other corporate
purposes. Under the credit facility, loans will bear interest, at the Company option at either 1the higher of aprime rate or bFederal Funds rate plus 1/2
of 1%, plus a margin determined by the ratio of our debt to earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization EBITDA as defined in the revolving credit agreement or 2the

restrict, among other things, the ability of the Company to borrow, pay dividends, acquire businesses, distribute assets, guarantee debts of others and lend funds to affiliated companies and contains
criteria on the maintenance of certain financial statement amounts and ratios, all as defined in the agreement. 
At
December31, 2004, the utilized portion of this credit facility was $4,625 for standby letters of credit and $95,375 was unused. Accounts receivable are sufficient to allow for the
draw-down of the entire amount. At December31, 2004, the prime rate, federal funds rate, and one month LIBOR were 525%, 197% and 240%, respectively. 
On
January14, 2005, the Company amended and restated the terms of its secured revolving credit facility. The amended and restated credit facility provides for maximum borrowings to be
increased from $100,000 to $125,000 at the Company request under certain conditions and extends the expiration date from April7, 2006 to June30, 2008. The amended and restated credit
facility is secured by substantially all of the Company assets and is available for ongoing working capital requirements and other corporate purposes. Under the amended and restated credit facility,
loans will bear interest, at the Company option at either 1the higher of aprime rate or bFederal Funds rate plus 1/2 of 1%, plus a margin determined by

ACommon and ClassB Common Stock

the option of the stockholder into one share of common stock. BShare Repurchase Program 
In September2002, the Board of Directors approved a share repurchase plan to acquire outstanding common stock on the open market. Under the terms of the plan, the
Company was authorized to repurchase up to five million shares of common stock from time-to-time as conditions warranted. During the year ended December31, 2002, the
Company repurchased 927,000 shares of its common stock for an aggregate purchase price of $9,842. The share repurchase plan expired on March3, 2004. 
59  CStock Options 
In January1996, the Company Board of Directors the Board adopted the 1996 Employee Stock Option Plan and a stock option plan for non-employee
directors the 1996 Plans. The employee stock option plan provided for the issuance of both incentive stock options, within the meaning of Section422 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986,
as amended the Code and nonqualified stock options. Options granted for non-employee directors did not qualify as incentive stock options within the meaning of Section422 of
the Code. 
In
December1998, the Company adopted a long-term incentive plan the 1999 Plan, pursuant to which stock options, stock appreciation rights, restricted stock and other equity
based awards may be granted. Following the adoption of the 1999 Plan, no options are available for future grants under the 1996 Plans. Stock options granted under the 1999 Plan may be incentive stock
options and nonqualified stock options within the meaning of the Code. Stock options awarded by the Company generally have an exercise price of 100% of the fair market value of the common stock on the
date of grant, a ten-year term and become exercisable in accordance with a vesting schedule determined by the Board. The total number of shares of the common stock of the Company that may
be granted under the 1999 Plan is the sum of 30,000,000 and the number of shares that would have been available for new awards under the 1996 Plans if they were still in effect. At December31,
2004, approximately 10,023,110 options were exercisable and 5,951,640 options were available for future grants. 
Amounts
below reflect option activity of employees in the Company continuing operations as well as HH Group employees. The outstanding stock options of the Company were adjusted in 2003 to reflect
the impact of the spin-off transaction. For employees who continued employment with the Company, the option remained an option for Monster Worldwide common stock with the number of shares
and the related exercise price adjusted to preserve the intrinsic value of each option. For
employees who worked for HH Group after the spin-off, certain options were cancelled in accordance with the provisions of the spin-off agreement. December31, 2004

The
tax effects of temporary differences that give rise to the Company deferred tax assets and liabilities are as follows: December31 2004
2003 Deferred tax assets Allowance for doubtful accounts 7,354 6,543 Accrued expenses and other liabilities 2,911 3,946 Accrued business reorganization and spin-off costs 7,098 10,057 Other reserves not currently deductible 4,190 3,117 Investments in foreign entities discontinued 12,600 Tax loss carry forwards 82,059 61,705 Tax credits 738 1,394 Valuation allowance 77,907 39,472 Deferred tax assets 39,043 47,290 Deferred tax liabilities Earned commissions 3,193 2,945 Work-in-process 3,894 4,230 Property and equipment 4,560 8,076 Intangibles 25,285 6,609 Deferred tax liabilities 36,932 21,860 Net deferred tax assets 2,111 25,430 As
of December31, 2004 and 2003, net current deferred tax assets were $9,166 and $15,721, respectively, and net non-current deferred tax assets were $14,846 and $15,712,
respectively. Net non-current deferred tax liabilities were $21,901 and $6,003 as on December31, 2004 and 2003, respectively. 
At
December31, 2004, the Company has net operating loss carry forwards, for U.S. Federal tax purposes of approximately $15,000, which expire in 2020 and operating loss carry forwards in the
United Kingdom of approximately $43,000 with no expiration periods. In addition, the Company also has approximately $177,000 of net operating loss carry forwards in various other countries throughout
the world. 
Realization
of the Company net deferred tax assets is dependant upon the Company generating sufficient taxable income in future years in the appropriate tax jurisdictions to obtain a benefit from
the reversal of deductible temporary differences and from tax loss carry-forwards. 
The
Company has concluded that, based on expected future results and the future reversals of existing taxable temporary differences there is no reasonable assurance that certain deferred tax assets
can be used, principally net operating losses in foreign jurisdictions. Accordingly, a valuation allowance has been established. During the year ended December31, 2004 the valuation allowance
on deferred tax assets increased by $38,435 for deferred tax assets attributable to pre-acquisition period net operating losses of acquired companies of $22,000, basis differences on
foreign investments that were no longer considered permanent in nature, and other discontinued operation losses of $15,650 and increases in previously computed net operating losses of $3,553. Should
the $22,000 portion of the valuation allowance attributable to acquired tax losses be reversed, the resulting benefit will be credited to Goodwill relating to the acquisition. 
In
addition, deferred tax benefits from the exercise of nonqualified stock options were recorded net of a valuation allowance as additional paid-in capital. Should this portion of the
valuation allowance be reversed which is approximately $2,800, the resulting benefit will be recorded as additional paid-in capital.

Provision has not been made for U.S. or additional foreign taxes on undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries. Such earnings have been and will continue to
be reinvested but could become subject to additional tax if they were remitted as dividends, or were loaned to the Company or a U.S. affiliate, or if the Company should sell its stock in the foreign
subsidiaries. It is not practicable to determine the amount of additional tax, if any, that might be payable on the undistributed foreign earnings. The company believes its undistributed foreign
earnings are presently insignificant.

Management Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. 
The
Company management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as defined in Securities Exchange Act Rules13a-15f
or15d-15f. The Company internal control system was designed to provide reasonable assurance to the Company management and board of directors regarding the preparation and
fair presentation of published financial statements. 
All
internal control systems, no matter how well designed, have inherent limitations. Therefore, even those systems determined to be effective can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to
financial statement preparation and presentation. 
The
Company management assessed the effectiveness of the Company internal control over financial reporting as of December31, 2004. In making this assessment, we used the criteria set forth
by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission COSO in Internal ControlIntegrated Framework. Based on our
assessment, we believe that as of December31, 2004, the Company internal control over financial reporting is effective based on those criteria. In
conducting the Company evaluation of the effectiveness of its internal control over financial reporting, we have excluded the jobPilot acquisition completed in 2004. The contribution from the
jobPilot acquisition represent approximately 3% of consolidated revenues and 6% on income from continuing operations before income taxes for the year ended December31, 2004. Refer to
Note2 to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion of the jobPilot and other acquisitions and their impact on the Company consolidated financial statements. 
69  There
have been no significant changes in the Company internal controls or in other factors which could significantly affect internal controls subsequent to the date the Company management carried
out its evaluation. 
The
Company independent registered public accounting firm has issued its audit report on our assessment of the Company internal control over financial reporting. This report appears on
pages37-38.
