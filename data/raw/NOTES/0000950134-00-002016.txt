INDEPENDENT AUDITORS' REPORT
To the Board of Directors
Suiza Foods Corporation
Dallas, Texas
We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Suiza Foods
Corporation and subsidiaries the Company as of December 31, 1999 and 1998,
and the related consolidated statements of income, stockholders' equity and cash
flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 1999. These
consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the Company
management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated
financial statements based on our audits.
We conducted our audits in accordance with generally accepted auditing
standards. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material
misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting
the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes
assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by
management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.
We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above
present fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated financial position of
Suiza Foods Corporation and subsidiaries as of December 31, 1999 and 1998, and
the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three years
in the period ended December 31, 1999, in conformity with generally accepted
accounting principles.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 1999, 1998 AND 1997
1. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
Basis of Presentation -- Our consolidated financial statements include the
accounts of our wholly owned and majority owned subsidiaries. All significant
intercompany balances and transactions are eliminated in consolidation. We also
own equity interests of less than 50% in certain companies that we do not
control which are accounted for in the consolidated financial statements using
the equity method of accounting. Under the equity method of accounting, our
investments in these affiliates are presented as a single amount in our
consolidated balance sheets and our proportional share of their earnings are
presented in our consolidated statements of income as a single line item in
other income.
The preparation of our consolidated financial statements in conformity with
generally accepted accounting principles requires us to make estimates and
assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and
disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated
financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during
the reporting period. Actual results could differ from these estimates.
Cash Equivalents and Temporary Investments -- We consider all highly liquid
investments purchased with a remaining maturity of three months or less to be
cash equivalents. Temporary investments at December 31, 1998 consisted of
held-to-maturity U.S. government obligations due within one year, certificates
of deposit or Eurodollar deposits due within one year, and highly rated
commercial paper. These temporary investments were stated at amortized cost,
which approximated market value.
Inventories -- Inventories are stated at the lower of cost, using the
first-in, first-out FIFO method, or market. The costs of finished goods
inventories include raw materials, direct labor and indirect production and
overhead costs.
Property, Plant and Equipment -- Property, plant and equipment are stated
at acquisition cost, along with capitalized interest on borrowings during the
actual construction period of major capital projects. Also included in property,
plant and equipment are certain direct costs related to the implementation of
computer software for internal use. Depreciation and amortization are provided
using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets, as
follows ASSET                              USEFUL LIFE
-                                                            
Buildings and improvements                  Ten to 40 years
Machinery and equipment                   Three to 20 years   Capitalized lease assets are amortized over the shorter of their lease term
or their estimated useful lives. Expenditures for repairs and maintenance which
do not improve or extend the life of the assets are expensed as incurred.

SUIZA FOODS CORPORATION
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS -- CONTINUED
Intangible and Other Assets -- Intangible and other assets include the
following intangibles which are amortized over their related useful lives         ASSET                USEFUL LIFE
Goodwill                Straight-line method over 25 to 40
years
Identifiable intangible assets:
Customer lists            Straight-line method over seven to
ten years
Trademarks/trade names        Straight-line method over ten to 40
years
Noncompetition agreements       Straight-line method over the terms
of the agreements
Patents                Straight-line method over fifteen
years
Deferred financing costs        Interest method over the terms of the
related debt   We periodically assess the net realizable value of our long-lived assets,
as well as all other assets, by comparing the expected future net operating cash
flows, undiscounted and without interest charges, to the carrying amount of the
underlying assets. We would evaluate a potential impairment if the recorded
value of these assets exceeded the associated future net operating cash flows.
Any potential impairment loss would be measured as the amount by which the
carrying value exceeds the fair value of the asset. Fair value of assets would
be measured by market value, if an active market exists, or by a forecast of
expected future net operating cash flows, discounted at a rate commensurate with
the risk involved.
Interest Rate Agreements -- Interest rate swaps, caps and floors are
entered into as hedges against interest exposure of our variable rate debt.
Differences between amounts to be paid or received on these interest rate
agreements designated as hedges are included in interest expense as payments are
made or received. Gains or losses on agreements not designated as hedges are
included in income as incurred. Amounts paid to acquire interest rate caps and
amounts received for interest rate floors are amortized as an adjustment to
interest expense over the life of the related agreement.
Foreign Currency Translation -- The financial statements of our foreign
subsidiaries are translated to U.S. dollars in accordance with the provisions of
Statement of Financial Accounting Standards SFAS No. 52, Foreign Currency
Translation. The functional currency of our foreign subsidiaries is generally
the local currency of the country. Accordingly, assets and liabilities of the
foreign subsidiaries are translated to U.S. dollars at year-end exchange rates.
Income and expense items are translated at the average rates prevailing during
the year. Changes in exchange rates, which affect cash flows and the related
receivables or payables are recognized as transaction gains and losses in the
determination of net income. The cumulative translation adjustment in
stockholders' equity reflects the unrealized adjustments resulting from
translating the financial statements of our foreign subsidiaries.
Minority Interest in Subsidiaries -- Minority interest in results of
operations of consolidated subsidiaries represents the minority shareholders'
share of the income or loss of various consolidated subsidiaries. The minority
interest in the consolidated balance sheets reflect the original investment by
these minority shareholders in these consolidated subsidiaries, along with their
proportional share of the earnings or losses of these subsidiaries.
Employee Stock Options and Restricted Stock -- We measure compensation
expense for our stock-based employee compensation plans using the intrinsic
value method and provide the required pro forma disclosures of the effect on net
income and earnings per share as if the fair value-based method had been applied
in measuring compensation expense.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS -- CONTINUED
Revenue -- Revenue is recognized when the product is shipped to the
customer. We provide credit terms to customers generally ranging up to 30 days,
perform ongoing credit evaluation of our customers and maintain allowances for
potential credit losses based on historical experience.
Income Taxes -- All of our wholly owned U.S. operating subsidiaries are
included in our consolidated tax return. In addition, our proportional share of
the operations of our majority owned subsidiaries and certain of our equity
method affiliates, which are organized as limited liability companies or limited
partnerships are also included in our consolidated tax return. Our Puerto Rico
and foreign subsidiaries are required to file separate income tax returns in
their local jurisdictions. Certain distributions from these subsidiaries are
subject to U.S. income taxes; however, available tax credits of these
subsidiaries may reduce or eliminate these U.S. income tax liabilities.
Deferred income taxes are provided for temporary differences in the
consolidated financial statements and tax bases of assets and liabilities using
current tax rates. Deferred tax assets, including the benefit of net operating
loss carryforwards, are evaluated based on the guidelines for realization and
may be reduced by a valuation allowance if deemed necessary.
Advertising Expense -- Advertising expense is comprised of media, agency
and production expenses. Advertising expenses are charged to income during the
period incurred, except for expenses related to the development of a major
commercial or media campaign which are charged to income during the period in
which the advertisement or campaign is first presented by the media. Advertising
expenses charged to income totaled $435 million in 1999, $289 million in 1998
and $260 million in 1997. Additionally, prepaid advertising costs were $17
million at December 31, 1999 and $09 million at December 31, 1998.
Comprehensive Income -- We consider all changes in equity from transactions
and other events and circumstances, except those resulting from investments by
owners and distributions to owners, to be comprehensive income.
Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements -- SFAS No. 133, Accounting for
Derivative Financial Instruments and Hedging Activities, was issued in June
1998, and establishes standards for accounting and reporting for derivative
instruments, including certain derivative instruments embedded in other
contracts, and for hedging activities. SFAS No. 133 is effective in the first
quarter of our year ending December 31, 2001. We are currently analyzing the
effect of this standard and do not expect it to have a material effect on our
consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows.
Reclassifications -- Certain reclassifications have been made to conform
the prior years' consolidated financial statements to the current year
classifications.
2. ACQUISITIONS
During 1997, 1998 and 1999 we completed the acquisitions of 25 dairy
businesses and nine packaging businesses which included the following
acquisitions which were significant at the time of completion                                            PURCHASE

These acquisitions and the smaller dairy and packaging businesses acquired
were funded primarily with borrowings under our then-existing senior credit
facility, along with the issuance in 1999, 1998 and 1997 of 77,233, 2,050,635
and 297,400 shares of our common stock, respectively, with then-existing fair
market values of $32 million, $1385 million and $100 million, respectively.
All acquisitions were accounted for using the purchase method of accounting
as of their respective acquisition dates, and accordingly, only the results of
operations of the acquired companies subsequent to their respective acquisition
dates are included in our consolidated financial statements. At the acquisition
date, the purchase price was allocated to assets acquired, including
identifiable intangibles, and liabilities assumed based on their fair market
values. The excess of the total purchase prices over the fair values of the net
assets acquired represented goodwill. In connection with the acquisitions,
assets were acquired and liabilities were assumed, subject to final purchase
price adjustments, as follows                          YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31,

operations or net income for 1999 or 1998.
Related Party Transactions -- During 1999, 1998 and 1997, we paid fees to a
former officer and director for acquisition consulting services related to
certain completed acquisitions totaling $05 million, $51 million and $14
million, respectively, which have been capitalized as part of the purchase price
of the acquisition.
3. SUBSEQUENT EVENTS
Effective January 1, 2000, we entered into a joint venture with Dairy
Farmers of America DFA in which we combined certain of our domestic fluid
dairy operations with certain of DFA operations into a newly formed venture,
Suiza Dairy Group. DFA is a large farmers cooperative from which we purchase a
significant portion of our raw milk. DFA received a 338% ownership interest in
Suiza Dairy Group in exchange for the contribution of the operations of Southern
Foods Group and for the contribution of its investments in its other joint
ventures with us: Suiza GTL, LLC and Suiza SoCal, LLC. We received a 662%
ownership interest in Suiza Dairy Group in exchange for the contribution of our
domestic fluid dairy operations excluding our Puerto Rican operations and our
Morningstar subsidiary. Our ownership interests as well as DFA were
determined by negotiation between the parties. This transaction will be
accounted for as an acquisition of Southern Foods using the purchase method of
accounting. Suiza Dairy Group also assumed $1138 million, 9 7/8% senior notes
of Southern Foods which mature in September 2007.

SUIZA FOODS CORPORATION
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS -- CONTINUED
Upon closing of the acquisition, Suiza Dairy Group entered into a new $161
billion credit facility and borrowed approximately $11 billion under this new
facility. Suiza Dairy Group distributed a portion of the borrowings under the
new credit facility to DFA and to us. DFA used its portion of the distributed
funds to repay certain existing obligations of Southern Foods and we used our
portion of the distributed funds to repay certain of our existing obligations,
including redeeming the $100 million aggregate stated amount of mandatorily
redeemable trust issued preferred securities held by DFA and repaying amounts
outstanding under our senior credit facility. We also terminated our existing
senior credit facility and replaced it with a new $300 million parent-level
senior credit facility as discussed in Note 11.

basis for the year ended December 31, 1999, as if the Southern Foods operations

On February 8, 2000, we completed the acquisition of Valley of Virginia
Cooperative Milk Producers Association, an agricultural marketing cooperative
with dairy processing plants in Springfield, Virginia and Mt. Crawford,
Virginia. Valley of Virginia, which had net sales of $209 million for the twelve
month period ended August 31, 1999, sells milk and ice cream products in
Virginia, Maryland, Pennsylvania, Delaware and the District of Columbia, and
ultra-high temperature dairy products across the eastern half of the United
States, primarily under the Shenandoah Pride R brand.
In February of 2000, we purchased a majority interest in Leche Celta, S.A.,
a Spanish dairy processor with sales of approximately $150 million in 1999.
Leche Celta produces primarily ultra-high temperature dairy products from three
plants located in northern Spain. We funded approximately $315 million of our
equity investment through borrowings under our new parent-level senior credit
facility. We financed the balance of the purchase price with a low-interest rate
loan in Spain.
On March 3, 2000, we completed the sale of our European metal packaging
operations. The proceeds of this sale were used to repay borrowings made to fund
our equity investment in Leche Celta and for other corporate purposes.
4. DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS AND EXTRAORDINARY GAINS AND LOSSES
On April 30, 1998, we consummated the sale of our packaged ice operations
for net cash proceeds of approximately $1727 million. We reported an
extraordinary gain of $355 million from the sale of this operation, net of
$220 million of income tax expense. Our packaged ice segment had revenues of
approximately $179 million during the four months ended April 30, 1998 and
$663 million during 1997. The results of discontinued operations includes
interest expense of $24 million during 1998 and $71 million during 1997.
Interest charges allocated to discontinued operations are based on debt
specifically attributed to our packaged ice operations. The results of
discontinued operations are presented net of the related income tax benefit of
$21 million in 1998 and income tax expense of $04 million in 1997. During
1999, certain
F-10
35
SUIZA FOODS CORPORATION
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS -- CONTINUED
contingencies related to this sale were resolved, resulting in an additional
extraordinary gain on the sale of $09 million, net of $05 million of income
tax expense.
In 1998, an extraordinary loss of $38 million, net of a $23 million
income tax benefit, was also recognized in connection with the early
extinguishment of the term loan of our senior credit facility, and included
losses from the write-off of deferred financing costs and interest rate swap
losses. We also recognized extraordinary losses in connection with the early
extinguishment of prior credit facilities in 1997 and expensed $113 million in
1997, net of an income tax benefit of $70 million. These costs related to debt
issuance, legal and other costs associated with the extinguishment of these
prior credit facilities.
5. INVESTMENTS IN UNCONSOLIDATED AFFILIATES
Investment in Consolidated Container Company LLC -- On July 2, 1999, we
sold a majority interest in our U.S. plastic packaging operations to
Consolidated Container Company, which through a predecessor owned another
plastic packaging business. Pursuant to this transaction, we received a 431%
common equity interest in Consolidated Container Company in exchange for our
existing common equity interest in our U.S. plastic packaging operations, along
with cash of approximately $3640 million in connection with Consolidated
Container Company refinancing of the intercompany debt and preferred stock
investment that our U.S. plastic packaging operations owed us. As a part of this
transaction the senior secured notes of Plastic Containers, Inc., a former
subsidiary of Continental Can, were assumed by Consolidated Container Company
see Footnote 11.
With the consummation of this transaction, the assets and liabilities and
results of operations of our formerly consolidated U.S. plastic packaging
operations were combined with those of Consolidated Container Company and were
eliminated from our consolidated financial statements. For all periods prior to
this date, our U.S. plastic packaging operations continue to be included in our
consolidated financial statements. The consolidated balance sheet at December
31, 1998 included current assets of approximately $800 million, total assets of
approximately $5660 million and total liabilities of approximately $2180
million excluding intercompany debt and preferred stock investment balances
related to our U.S. plastic packaging operations, which are no longer reflected
in the consolidated balance sheet at December 31, 1999. Included in consolidated
sales for the first six months of 1999 and for all of 1998 were sales of $2450
million and $3320 million, respectively, related to the U.S. plastic packaging
operations.
Our investment in Consolidated Container Company after July 2, 1999 is
accounted for under the equity method of accounting. Our investment in
Consolidated Container Company at December 31, 1999 was $39 million. Our
initial investment was lower than our proportional share of Consolidated
Container Company net assets by $1091 million which is being amortized over
forty years. Earnings from our unconsolidated affiliates in our consolidated
statements of income includes $24 million net of restructuring and other
non-recurring charges of $49 million attributable to Consolidated Container
Company, of which $14 million is attributable to the amortization of the
difference between the carrying amount of our investment and our proportional
share of our underlying equity interest in their net assets. Although the market
value of our investment in Consolidated Container Company is not readily
determinable, management believes that the fair value of this investment exceeds
its carrying amount.

investment under the equity method of accounting as we believe that we have the
ability to influence the operating policies of Horizon. The quoted stock price
of this investment ranged from $1750 to $725 per share during 1999. The
closing stock price on December 31, 1999 was $750 per share, resulting in a
market value of our investment of $100 million. Our investment in Horizon
Organic at December 31, 1999 and 1998 was $162 million and $123 million,
respectively and our equity in earnings included in our consolidated statement
of income for 1999 and 1998 were $02 million and $01 million, respectively.

addition, during 1997, we sold $44 million of previously recognized tax credits
for cash proceeds of $37 million, net of discounts and related expenses, which
is recorded in other income. However, since these tax credits had been
previously recognized, this sale resulted in income tax expense of $56 million
for an after tax loss of $19 million.
At December 31, 1999, we had approximately $423 million of net operating

Terminated Senior Credit Facility -- In connection with our acquisition of
Southern Foods on January 4, 2000, we replaced our then existing senior credit
facility with two new facilities, as described under Suiza Dairy Group Credit
Facility and New Parent Credit Facility below. The old senior credit facility
provided us with a line of credit of up to $1 billion to be used for general
corporate and working capital purposes, including the financing of acquisitions.
Interest was payable quarterly or at the end of the applicable interest period
and the interest rate in effect on that facility, including the applicable
interest rate margin, was an average 655% during the quarter ended December 31,
1999. The senior credit facility would have expired on March 31, 2003.
Suiza Dairy Group Credit Facility -- Simultaneous with the closing of the
Southern Foods transaction, Suiza Dairy Group entered into a new $16 billion
credit facility with a group of lenders which expires in January 2005. The Suiza
Dairy Group credit facility provides an $805 million revolving line of credit, a
$625 million term loan and a $180 million term loan. Suiza Dairy Group initially
borrowed approximately $11 billion and distributed a portion of the borrowings
to DFA and us. We used our portion of the distribution to repay our then
existing senior credit facility and certain other obligations.
New Parent Credit Facility -- On January 4, 2000 we also entered into a new
parent credit facility, which replaced our then existing senior credit facility.
The new facility, which expires in January 2005, provides us with a revolving
line of credit of up to $300 million to be used for general corporate and
working capital purposes, including the financing of future acquisitions. On the
date of this new agreement, we had not borrowed any funds under this facility.
Credit Facility Terms -- Amounts outstanding under the Suiza Dairy Group
credit facility and our new parent credit facility bear interest at a rate per
annum equal to one of the following rates, at our option: i a base rate equal
to the higher of the Federal Funds rate plus 50 basis points or the prime rate,
plus a margin that varies from 25 to 125 basis points for the Suiza Dairy Group
credit facility and 0 to 75 basis points on the new parent credit facility,
depending on our ratio of defined indebtedness to EBITDA or ii The London
F-15

SUIZA FOODS CORPORATION
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS -- CONTINUED
Interbank Offering Rate LIBOR computed as LIBOR divided by the product of
one minus the Eurodollar Reserve Percentage, plus a margin that varies from 125
to 225 basis points for the Suiza Dairy Group credit facility and 75 to 175
basis points on the new parent credit facility, depending on our ratio of
defined indebtedness to EBITDA. In consideration for the revolving commitments,
we pay a commitment fee on unused amounts of the Suiza Dairy Group credit
facility and the new parent credit facility that ranges from 25 to 50 basis
points, based on our ratio of defined indebtedness to EBITDA. Interest is
payable quarterly or at the end of the applicable interest period.
The Suiza Dairy Group credit facility and our new parent credit facility
contain various financial and other restrictive covenants and requirements that
Suiza Dairy Group and we maintain certain financial ratios, including a leverage
ratio computed as the ratio of the aggregate outstanding principal amount of
defined indebtedness to EBITDA, as defined separately by each agreement and an
interest coverage ratio computed as the ratio of EBITDA to interest expense as
defined separately by each agreement. In addition, the Suiza Dairy Group credit
facility and our new parent credit facility require that we maintain a minimum
level of net worth as defined separately by each agreement. The facilities also
contain limitations on liens, investments, the incurrence of additional
indebtedness and acquisitions, and prohibit certain dispositions of property and
restrict certain payments, including dividends. The credit facilities are
secured by capital stock of certain of our subsidiaries.
Subsidiary Debt Obligations -- Subsidiary debt obligations include lines of
credit, industrial development revenue bond obligations and other debt
obligations of certain subsidiaries.
Borrowings under these subsidiary lines of credit are generally subject to
limitations based on a borrowing base, as defined in the respective agreements,
and bear interest generally at floating interest rates determined for each
subsidiary. The weighted average interest rate in effect on our subsidiaries'
lines of credit, which represent only foreign subsidiary lines of credit, at
December 31, 1999 was 443%.
The senior secured notes outstanding at December 31, 1998 were issued by
one of Continental Can subsidiaries, Plastic Containers, Inc., and had an
original par value of $125 million and a fixed interest rate of 10%. The senior
secured notes were assumed by Consolidated Container Company on July 2, 1999 in
connection with the sale of a majority interest in our U.S. plastic packaging
operations.
Certain of our subsidiaries have revenue bonds outstanding which require
aggregate annual sinking fund redemptions aggregating $07 million and are
secured by irrevocable letters of credit issued by financial institutions, along
with first mortgages on certain real property and equipment. Interest on these
bonds is due semiannually at interest rates that vary based on market conditions
which, at December 31, 1999, ranged from 560% to 585%.
Other debt includes various promissory notes for the purchase of property,
plant and equipment and capital lease obligations. The various promissory notes
payable provide for interest at varying rates and are payable in monthly
installments of principal and interest until maturity, when the remaining
principal balances are due. Capital lease obligations represent machinery and
equipment financing obligations which are payable in monthly installments of
principal and interest and are collateralized by the related assets financed.
Interest Rate Agreements -- We have interest rate derivative agreements in
place, including interest rate caps, swaps and collars that have been designated
as hedges against our variable interest rate exposure on our loans under our
senior credit facility.

senior credit facility at December 31, 1999, and subsequently for our Suiza
Dairy Group facility by limiting or fixing the LIBOR interest rates at the
interest rates noted above until the indicated expiration dates of these
interest rate derivative agreements. The original costs and premiums of these
derivative agreements are being amortized on a straight-line basis as a
component of interest expense.
We are exposed to market risk under these arrangements due to the
possibility of exchanging a lower interest rate for a higher interest rate. The
counterparties are major financial institutions and the risk of incurring losses
related to the credit risk is considered to be remote.
Scheduled Maturities -- The scheduled maturities of long-term debt, which
include capitalized lease obligations, at December 31, 1999, were as follows in

12. MANDATORILY REDEEMABLE TRUST ISSUED PREFERRED SECURITIES
In connection with our acquisition of Land-O-Sun in February 1998, we
issued $100 million of company-obligated 5% mandatorily redeemable convertible
preferred securities of a Delaware business trust. On March 24, 1998, we also
completed the sale of $600 million of company-obligated 55% mandatorily
redeemable convertible preferred securities of a Delaware business trust in a
private placement to qualified institutional buyers under Rule 144A under the
Securities Act of 1933, as amended. The 5% preferred securities mature 20 years
from the date of issue and the 55% preferred securities mature 30 years from
the date of issue. These trust issued preferred securities, which are recorded
net of related fees and expenses, are convertible at the option of the holders
into an aggregate of approximately 91 million shares of our common stock,
subject to adjustment in certain circumstances. These preferred securities are
also redeemable, at our option, at any time after three years from their
respective issue dates at specified amounts and are mandatorily redeemable at
their liquidation preference amount of $50 per share at maturity or upon
occurrence of certain specified events.
On January 4, 2000, in connection with the Southern Foods transaction, we
redeemed the 5% mandatorily redeemable convertible preferred securities in the
amount of $100,638,889, which includes the principal repayment and accrued
interest.

13. STOCKHOLDERS' EQUITY
Our authorized shares of capital stock include 1,000,000 shares of
preferred stock and 500,000,000 shares of common stock with a par value of $01
per share.
Preferred Stock -- The rights and preferences of preferred stock are
established by our Board of Directors upon issuance. The Series A preferred
stock previously outstanding represented 11,691 shares of preferred stock with a
stated and redemption value of $32000 per share, provided for cumulative
dividends at a rate of 8% and were redeemable only at our option. On September
29, 1998, we redeemed all outstanding shares of Series A preferred stock for the
stated value of $32000 per share, plus accumulated unpaid dividends, for a
total cost of $38 million.
Stock Offerings -- On January 28, 1997, we sold 4,270,000 shares of common
stock in a public offering at a price to the public of $2200 per share. The
public offering provided net cash proceeds to us of approximately $890 million
which was used to repay senior and subordinated debt and prepayment penalties
related to the early extinguishment of the subordinated notes.
Stock Option and Restricted Stock Plans -- We have three stock option and
restricted stock plans. These plans provide for grants of stock options and
restricted stock to employees, officers, directors and consultants to acquire
6,156,023 shares of common stock. The plans stipulate that the exercise prices
of stock options will approximate or be above fair market value on the grant
date. The options vest in accordance with provisions as set forth in the
applicable option agreements.

Rights Plan -- On February 27, 1998, our board of directors declared a
dividend of one common share purchase right for each outstanding share of common
stock to the stockholders of record on March 18, 1998. The rights are not
exercisable until ten days subsequent to the announcement of the acquisition of
or intent to acquire a beneficial ownership of 15% or more in Suiza. At such
time, each right entitles the registered holder to purchase from us that number
of shares of common stock at an exercise price of $21000, with a market value
of up to two times the exercise price. At any time prior to such date, a
required majority may redeem the

redeems, the rights.
Earnings Per Share -- Basic earnings per share is based on the weighted

Defined Contribution Plans -- Certain of our non-union personnel may elect
to participate in savings and profit sharing plans sponsored by us. These plans
generally provide for salary reduction contributions to the plans on behalf of
the participants of between 10% and 170% of a participant annual
compensation and provide for employer matching and profit sharing contributions
as determined by our Board of Directors. In addition, certain union hourly
employees are participants in company-sponsored defined contribution plans which
provide for employer contributions in various amounts ranging from $21 to $39
per pay period per participant.
Multi-Employer Pension Plans -- Certain of our subsidiaries contribute to
various multi-employer union pension plans, which are administered jointly by
management and union representatives and cover substantially all full-time and
certain part-time union employees who are not covered by our other plans. The
Multi-Employer Pension Plan Amendments Act of 1980 amended ERISA to establish
funding requirements and obligations for employers participating in
multi-employer plans, principally related to employer withdrawal from or
termination of such plans. We could, under certain circumstances, be liable for
unfunded vested benefits or other expenses of jointly administered
union/management plans. At this time, we have not established any liabilities
because withdrawal from these plans is not probable or reasonably possible.

Plant closing, merger and other costs -- During 1999, as part of an overall
integration and cost reduction strategy, we recorded plant closing and other
non-recurring expenses of $126 million. In addition, our share of Consolidated
Container Company restructuring charges was $49 million and was reported as a
reduction of equity in earnings of unconsolidated affiliates.
The charges recorded for our integration and cost reduction programs
reflect several approved efficiency and integration efforts including closing of
four plants with consolidation of production into other plants, disposition of a
small cheese processing plant, consolidation of administrative offices within
one of our regions, and severance costs incurred at the corporate office as well
as the European and Puerto Rican operations.
The principal components of the plan included the following   - Workforce reduction as a result of plant closings, plant rationalizations
and consolidation of administrative functions. The plan included an
overall reduction of 315 people, primarily plant employees associated
with the plant closings and rationalization. The costs were charged to
our earnings in the period that the plan was established in detail and
employee severance and benefits had been appropriately communicated. All
except fourteen employees had been severed as of December 31, 1999.
- Shutdown costs include those costs that are necessary to clean and
prepare the plant facilities for closure. Additional costs to be incurred
after shutdown included lease obligations or termination costs, utilities
and property taxes after shutdown of the plant.
- Write-downs of property, plant and equipment and other assets are
primarily for asset impairments as a result of facilities that are no
longer used in operations. The impairments relate primarily to owned
building, land and equipment at the facilities which are being sold and
were written down to their estimated fair value.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS -- CONTINUED
There have not been significant adjustments to the plan and the majority of
future cash requirements to reduce the liability at December 31, 1999 are
expected to be completed in early 2000. However, there are continuing cash
payments under one severance agreement that will be made into the first quarter
of 2001.
Acquired facility closing costs -- As a part of accounting for
acquisitions, we accrued costs pursuant to plans to exit certain activities and
operations in order to rationalize productivity and reduce costs and
inefficiencies. Two plants were closed in connection with the acquisition of
Broughton Foods, and two plants in our northeastern U.S. region were also closed
subsequent to acquisition. The production from these plants was moved to our
other facilities.
The principal components of the plans included the following   - Workforce reduction as a result of plant closings included an overall
reduction of 340 plant personnel. The costs incurred were charged against
our acquisition liabilities for these costs.
- Shutdown costs include those costs that are necessary to clean and
prepare the plant facilities for closure. Additional costs to be incurred
after shutdown included lease obligations or termination costs, utilities
and property taxes after shutdown of the plant.
Activity with respect to these acquisition liabilities are summarized

Merger fees and expenses include primarily fees paid to investment bankers

fees. Severance and employment costs include primarily payments to employees
terminated at the merger date and payments for retention bonuses and excise
taxes, pursuant to preexisting employment agreements. Costs of uncompleted
transactions include the costs and expenses related to abandoned acquisitions in
1997. Other costs primarily include the cost of the consolidation of our
corporate offices in connection with the Morningstar merger in 1997. The
majority of these costs were incurred and paid during the fourth quarter of 1997
with substantially all the remaining costs paid in 1998.

Leases -- We lease certain property, plant and equipment used in our
operations under both capital and operating lease agreements. Such leases, which
are primarily for machinery and equipment and vehicles, have lease terms ranging
from one to nine years. Certain of the operating lease agreements require the
payment of additional rentals for maintenance, along with additional rentals
based on miles driven or units produced. Rent expense, including additional
rent, was $451 million, $480 million and $185 million for the years ended
December 31, 1999, 1998 and 1997, respectively.
The composition of capital leases which are reflected as property, plant
and equipment in our consolidated balance sheets are as follows                                 DECEMBER 31,

Litigation -- We and our subsidiaries are parties, in the ordinary course
of business, to certain claims and litigation. In our opinion, the settlement of
such matters is not expected to have a material adverse impact on our financial
position, results of operations or cash flows.
Employment Agreements -- We have entered into employment agreements with
certain key management personnel which provided for minimum compensation levels
and incentive bonuses, along with provisions for termination benefits in certain
circumstances and for certain severance payments in the event of a change in
control.
20. FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS
Pursuant to SFAS No. 107, Disclosure About Fair Value of Financial
Instruments, we are required to disclose an estimate of the fair value of our
financial instruments as of December 31, 1999 and 1998. SFAS No. 107 defines the
fair value of financial instruments as the amount at which the instrument could
be exchanged in a current transaction between willing parties.
Due to their near-term maturities, the carrying amounts of accounts
receivable and accounts payable are considered equivalent to fair value. In
addition, because the interest rates on our senior credit facility and most
other debt are variable, their fair values approximate their carrying values.
We have entered into various interest rate agreements to reduce our
sensitivity to changes in interest rates on our variable rate debt. The fair
values of these instruments were determined based on current values for similar
instruments with similar terms. The following table presents the carrying value
and fair value of our interest rate agreements at December 31                             1999          1998

In all periods shown in the consolidated financial statements contained in
this report prior to the third quarter of 1999, we had two reportable segments,
including dairy and packaging. As a result of the sale of a majority
interest in our U.S. plastic packaging operations effective July 2, 1999, as
discussed in Note 5, we no longer have a reportable packaging segment under
current accounting rules. Our remaining packaging operations, which consist of
only our European flexible film business, are now included in Other in the
table below along with our corporate expenses not allocated to a specific
segment; all periods presented have been reclassified to conform with this
change. Our dairy products and related distribution businesses manufacture and
distribute fluid milk, ice cream and novelties, dairy and non-dairy coffee
creamers, half-and-half and whipping cream, sour cream, cottage cheese, yogurt,
dairy and non-dairy frozen whipped toppings as well as certain refrigerated,
frozen and extended shelf-life products on a national basis. We also manufacture
and distribute fruit juices and other flavored drinks, bottled water and coffee.
The accounting policies of the segments are the same as those described in
the summary of significant accounting policies. We evaluate performance based on
profit or loss from operations before income taxes not including nonrecurring
gains and losses and foreign exchange gains and losses.
We do not allocate income taxes or unusual items to segments. In addition,
not all segments have significant noncash items other than depreciation and
amortization in reported profit or loss. The amounts in
