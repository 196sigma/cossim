significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement
presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material
respects, the consolidated financial position of COMSYS IT Partners, Inc. and Subsidiaries at

See notes to consolidated financial statements 43 Table of Contents COMSYS IT Partners, Inc. and Subsidiaries Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements 1. Description of Business COMSYS IT Partners, Inc. and its wholly-owned subsidiaries COMSYS or the Company provide a
full range of specialized IT staffing and project implementation services, including website
development and integration, application programming and development, client/server development,
systems software architecture and design, systems engineering and systems integration. The Company
also provides services that complement its IT staffing services, such as vendor management, project
solutions, process solutions and permanent placement of IT professionals. The Companys TAPFIN
Process Solutions division offers total human capital fulfillment and management solutions within
three core service areas: vendor management services, services procurement management and
recruitment process outsourcing. The Companys fiscal year ends on the Sunday closest to December31st and its first three fiscal
quarters are 13 calendar weeks each and each also ends on a Sunday. References to 2009, 2008 and
2007 refer to the fiscal years ending January3, 2010, December28, 2008 and December30, 2007,
respectively. The year ended January3, 2010 included 53weeks, and the years ended December28,
2008 and December30, 2007, each included 52weeks. The Companys consolidated financial information is reviewed by the chief decision makers, the
business is managed under one operating strategy, and the Company operates under one reportable
segment. The Companys principal operations are located in the United States, and the results of
operations and long-lived assets in geographic regions outside of the United States are not
material. During the years 2009, 2008 and 2007, no individual customer accounted for more than 10%
of the Companys consolidated revenues. Subsequent events have been evaluated through March1, 2010, the date of the issuance of the
financial statements. There were no recognized subsequent events requiring recognition in the
financial statements. See below and in Note 11 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for the
required disclosures of non-recognized subsequent events. Pending Exchange Offer and Merger with Manpower Inc. On February1, 2010, the Company entered into an agreement and plan of merger the Merger
Agreement with Manpower Inc. Manpower and a wholly-owned subsidiary of Manpower Merger
Sub. The Merger Agreement provides that, subject to the terms and conditions of the Merger
Agreement, Merger Sub will commence an exchange offer to purchase all of the outstanding shares of
COMSYS common stock the Offer and, following the completion of the Offer, merge with and into
COMSYS, with COMSYS surviving as a direct or indirect wholly owned subsidiary of Manpower the
Merger. The Merger Agreement provides that the Offer will be commenced within five business
days following the filing of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Pursuant to the Merger Agreement, and subject to the terms and conditions of the Merger Agreement,
in both the Offer and the Merger, each share of COMSYS common stock accepted by Merger Sub will be
exchanged for either at the stockholders election $1765 in cash or $1765 in fair market value
of shares of Manpower common stock, where fair market value is the average trading price of
Manpowers common stock during the ten trading days ending on and including the second trading day
prior to the closing of the Offer. At the effective time of the Merger, any remaining outstanding
shares of COMSYS common stock not tendered in the Offer, other than shares owned by Manpower or any
direct or indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of Manpower or COMSYS, will be acquired for cash and
Manpower common stock. The aggregate amount of cash and Manpower common stock available for election at the closing of the
Offer and of the Merger will be determined on a 50/50 basis, such that if the holders of more than
50% of the shares tendered in the Offer, or more than 50% of the shares converted in the Merger,
elect more than the cash or Manpower common stock available in either case, they will receive on a
pro rata basis the other kind of consideration to the extent the kind of consideration they elect
to receive is oversubscribed. For example, if the holders of more than 50% of COMSYS Common Stock
who tender in the Offer elect cash then such holders in the aggregate will receive all of the cash
available for payment in the Offer 50% of the total consideration payable to all stockholders who
tender in the Offer but also will receive some Manpower common stock on a pro rata basis, since
there would have been an oversubscription for cash payment. Manpower has the right, at any time
not less than two business days prior to the expiration of the Offer, to elect to convert the
transaction into an all-cash deal and to pay $1765 in cash for all shares of COMSYS common stock
tendered in the Offer and acquired in the Merger. 44 Table of Contents The Offer is subject to satisfaction or waiver of a number of conditions set forth in the Merger
Agreement, including the expiration or termination of applicable waiting periods under the
Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvement Act of 1976 and the tender to Merger Sub and no withdrawal
of at least a majority of the shares of COMSYS common stock the Minimum Condition. The Minimum
Condition may not be waived by Merger Sub without the prior written consent of COMSYS. Subject to
certain conditions and limitations, COMSYS has granted Manpower and Merger Sub an option to
purchase from COMSYS, following the completion of the Offer, a number of additional shares of
COMSYS common stock that, when added to the shares already owned by Manpower and Merger Sub, will
constitute one share more than 90% of the shares of COMSYS common stock entitled to vote on the
Merger. If Manpower and Merger Sub acquire more than 90% of the outstanding shares of COMSYS
common stock including through exercise of the aforementioned option, it will complete the Merger
through the short form procedures available under Delaware law. The Merger Agreement contains certain termination rights for each of Manpower and COMSYS, and if
the Merger Agreement is terminated under certain circumstances, COMSYS is required to pay Manpower
a termination fee of $152million and/or reimburse Manpower for its out-of-pocket
transaction-related expenses up to $25million. The Merger Agreement includes customary representations, warranties and covenants of COMSYS,
Manpower and Merger Sub. In addition to certain other covenants, COMSYS has agreed not to
iencourage, solicit, initiate or facilitate any takeover proposal from a third party; iienter
into any agreement relating to a takeover proposal or any agreement, arrangement or understanding
requiring COMSYS to abandon, terminate or fail to consummate the Offer, the Merger, the Merger
Agreement or the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement; iiigrant any waiver or
release under any standstill agreement relating to COMSYS common stock; or iventer into
discussions or negotiations with a third party in connection with, or take any other action to
facilitate any inquiries or the making of any proposal that constitutes, or could reasonably be
expected to lead to, a takeover proposal, in each case subject to certain exceptions set forth in
the Merger Agreement. Accounting Standards Codification During 2009, the Company adopted the Financial Accounting Standards Board FASB Accounting
Standards Update No2009-01, Amendments based on Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No.
168 The FASB Accounting Standards Codification and the Hierarchy of Generally Accepted Accounting
Principles the Codification. The Codification became the single source of authoritative GAAP
in the United States, other than rules and interpretive releases issued by the United States
Securities and Exchange Commission SEC. The Codification reorganized GAAP into a topical format
that eliminates the previous GAAP hierarchy and instead established two levels of guidance -
authoritative and nonauthoritative. All non-grandfathered, non-SEC accounting literature that was
not included in the Codification became nonauthoritative. The adoption of the Codification did not
change previous GAAP, but rather simplified user access to all authoritative literature related to
a particular accounting topic in one place. Accordingly, the adoption had no impact on the
Companys consolidated financial position or results of operations. All references to previous
GAAP in the Companys consolidated financial statements were updated for the new references under
the Codification. 2. Significant Accounting Policies Principles of Consolidation The accompanying financial statements present on a consolidated basis the accounts of the Company
and its wholly-owned subsidiaries. All significant intercompany transactions have been eliminated. Cash and Cash Equivalents The Company considers all highly liquid instruments with a remaining maturity of three months or
less at the time of purchase to be cash equivalents. At December28, 2008, the Company maintained,
in a separate cash account, an additional $20million it borrowed on its revolver in October2008
to insure access to liquidity. The Company invested these additional funds in a US Treasury money
market fund and considered this money market fund to be a cash equivalent; the funds were used
during 2009 to pay down the balance on the revolver. 45 Table of Contents Fixed Assets Fixed assets are recorded at cost less accumulated depreciation. Depreciation is provided on all
furniture, equipment and related software using the straight-line method over the estimated useful
lives of the related assets, which range from three to seven years. Leasehold improvements are
amortized using the straight-line method over the shorter of the lease term or the estimated useful
lives of the related assets. Maintenance and repairs are expensed as incurred. The Company capitalizes certain internal and external costs related to the acquisition and
development of internal use software during the application development stages of projects. Such
costs consist primarily of custom-developed and packaged software and the direct labor costs of
internally-developed software. Capitalized costs are amortized using the straight-line method over
the estimated lives of the software, which range from three to five years. The costs capitalized
in the application development stage include the costs of design, coding, installation of hardware
and testing. The Company capitalizes costs incurred during the development phase of the project as
permitted. Costs incurred during the preliminary project or the post-implementation/operation
stages of the project are expensed as incurred. Leases The Company currently leases all of its administrative facilities under operating lease agreements.
Most lease agreements contain tenant improvements allowances, rent holidays and/or rent escalation
clauses. In instances where one or more of these items are included in a lease agreement, the
Company records or adjusts deferred rent liability on the Consolidated Balance Sheets to reflect
rent expense on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease. Rental deposits are provided for
lease agreements that specify payments in advance or scheduled rent decreases over the lease term.
Lease terms generally range from five to ten years with one to two renewal options for extended
terms. Management expects that as these leases expire, they will be renewed or replaced by other
leases in the normal course of business. For leases with renewal options, the Company records rent
expense and amortizes the leasehold improvements on a straight-line basis over the initial
non-cancelable lease term in instances where the lease term is shorter than the economic life of
the asset as the Company does not believe that the renewal of the option is reasonably assured.
The Company is also required to make additional payments under operating lease terms for taxes,
insurance and other operating expenses incurred during the operating lease period. Allowance for Doubtful Accounts Accounts receivable are reduced by an allowance for amounts that may become uncollectible in the
future. Estimates are used in determining the allowance for doubtful accounts and are based on the
Companys historical level of write-offs and judgments management makes about the creditworthiness
of significant customers based on ongoing credit evaluations. Further, the Company monitors
current economic trends that might impact the level of credit losses in the future. As of January
3, 2010, and December28, 2008, the allowance for uncollectible accounts receivable was $33
million and $32million, respectively. Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets Goodwill represents costs in excess of fair values assigned to the underlying net assets of
acquired companies. Goodwill is not amortized but instead is tested for impairment annually or
more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate the asset might be impaired. The Companys other intangible assets represent customer list intangibles. Other intangible assets
are amortized over the respective contract terms or estimated life of the customer list, ranging
from one to eight years. In the event that facts and circumstances indicate intangibles or other
long-lived assets may be impaired, the Company evaluates the recoverability and estimated useful
lives of such assets. Long-Lived Assets In the event that facts and circumstances indicate intangibles or other long-lived assets may be
impaired, the Company evaluates the recoverability and estimated useful lives of such assets. The
estimated future undiscounted cash flows associated with the assets are compared to the assets
carrying amount to determine if a write-down to market is necessary. The Company believes all
long-lived assets are fully realizable as of January3, 2010. 46 Table of Contents Fair Value of Financial Instruments Fair value is defined as the exchange price that would be received for an asset or paid to transfer
a liability an exit price in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability
in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date. The company
utilizes a fair value hierarchy, which maximizes the use of observable inputs and minimizes the use
of unobservable inputs when measuring fair value. The fair value hierarchy has three levels of
inputs that may be used to measure fair value   Level 1 
Unadjusted quoted prices in active markets that are accessible at
the measurement date for identical, unrestricted assets or
liabilities.   
Level 2
Quoted prices in markets that are not active; or other inputs that
are observable, either directly or indirectly, for substantially
the full term of the asset or liability.   
Level 3
Prices or valuation techniques that require inputs that are both
significant to the fair value measurement and unobservable. The Company uses fair value measurements in areas that include, but are not limited to: the
allocation of purchase price consideration to acquired tangible and identifiable intangible assets,
impairment testing of goodwill and long-lived assets and stock-based compensation arrangements.
The carrying values of cash, accounts receivable, restricted cash, accounts payable, and payroll
and related taxes approximate their fair values due to the short-term maturity of these
instruments. The carrying value of the Companys revolving line of credit, senior term loan and
interest payable approximates fair value due to the variable nature of the interest rates under the
Companys senior credit agreement. However, considerable judgment is required in interpreting data
to develop the estimates of fair value. Revenue Recognition The Company recognizes revenue and records sales, net of related discounts, when all of the
following criteria are met   
Persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists   
Ownership has transferred to the customer   
The price to the customer is fixed or determinable; and   
Collectibility is reasonably assured. The Companys core staffing revenues vary from period to period based on several factors that
include: 1 the billable headcount during the period; 2 the number of billing days during the
period; and 3 the average bill rate during the period. Revenues under time-and-materials contracts are recorded at the time services are performed.
Hourly bill rates are typically determined based on the level of skill and experience of the
consultants assigned and the supply and demand in the current market for those qualifications.
Alternatively, the bill rates for some assignments are based on a mark-up over compensation and
other direct and indirect costs. Service contract revenue is recorded as earned per the contract.
Revenue from fixed price contracts, which accounts for a small percentage of our business, is
recognized as we complete milestones in the contract. Revenues from services are shown net of rebates and discounts primarily to volume-related discounts
and prompt-payment discounts under contracts with the Companys clients. Such rebates and
discounts totaled $117million 18% of gross revenues, $131million 18% of gross revenues
and $120million 15% of gross revenues for 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively. Revenues from vendor management services are recorded net of the related pass-through labor costs.
Vendor management services are services that allow the Companys clients to automate and
consolidate management of their temporary personnel contracting processes. Revenues are also
reported net for payrolling activity. Payrolling is defined as a situation in which the Company
accepts a client-identified consultant for payroll processing in exchange for a fee. Permanent
placement fee revenues are usually determined based on a percentage of the employees first year
cash compensation and are recorded when candidates begin their employment. Reimbursable expenses are expenses the Company pays to its consultants that are reimbursed by the
Companys clients. The Company records reimbursable expenses in revenue with the associated cost
recorded in cost of services. 47 Table of Contents Accrued Bonuses The Company generally pays bonuses to certain executive management, field management and corporate
employees based on, or after giving consideration to, a variety of financial performance measures
or individual objectives. Executive management, field management, and certain corporate employees
bonuses are accrued throughout the year for payment during the first quarter of the following year,
based in part upon anticipated annual results compared to annual budgets or individual objective
criteria. Commissions The Companys associates make placements and earn commissions as a percentage of gross profit
pursuant to the associates individual commission plan. The amount of commissions paid as a
percentage of gross profit increases as volume increases. The Company accrues commissions for
actual gross profit at a percentage equal to the percent of total expected commissions payable to
total gross profit for the year. Stock-Based Compensation The Company recognizes stock-based compensation expense as a component of selling, general and
administrative expense. At January3, 2010, the Company had two types of stock-based employee
compensation: stock options and restricted stock. The Company measures the fair value of
restricted shares based upon the closing market price of the Companys common stock on the date of
grant. These grants either vest over a three-year period or are based on a combination of service
and performance criteria. Restricted stock awards that vest in accordance with service conditions
are amortized over their applicable vesting period using the straight-line method adjusted for
estimated forfeitures. For nonvested share awards subject to service and performance conditions,
the Company is required to assess the probability that such performance conditions will be met. If
the likelihood of the performance condition being met is deemed probable, the Company will
recognize the expense either using the straight-line attribution method or a method that reflects
how the shares are earned. If such performance conditions are not met, no performance-based
compensation expense will be recognized and any previously recognized compensation expense will be
reversed. No excess tax benefit has been recognized related to the Companys stock-based
compensation since none were realized due to the Companys loss carryforwards. The Companys stock
compensation plans are discussed more fully in Note 9. Self-Insurance The Company offers employee benefits, including workers compensation and health insurance, to
eligible employees, for which it is self-insured for a portion of the cost. The Company retains
liability up to $100,000 for each workers compensation claim and up to $275,000 annually for each
health insurance participant for whom it is not insured previously recorded at $250,000 annually
for each health insurance participant for whom it is not insured through 2008. These
self-insurance costs are accrued using estimates based on historical data to approximate the
liability for reported claims and claims incurred but not reported. Income Taxes The Company follows the liability method of accounting for income taxes. Under this method,
deferred income tax assets and liabilities are determined based on differences between the
financial statement and income tax bases of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in
effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse. Beginning in 2009, in
connection with adoption of provisions of ASC Topic 805, Business Combinations, we changed our
accounting for the remaining reserved deferred tax assets that previously would have been treated
as reductions to goodwill. This resulted in a decline in our reported income tax expense see
Recent Accounting Pronouncements below. The Company records an income tax valuation allowance when it is more likely than not that certain
deferred tax assets will not be realized. The Company carried a valuation allowance against most
of its deferred tax assets as of January3, 2010. These deferred tax items represent expenses or
operating losses recognized for financial reporting purposes, which will result in tax deductions
over varying future periods. The judgments, assumptions and estimates that may affect the amount
of the valuation allowance include estimates of future taxable income, timing or amount of future
reversals of existing deferred tax liabilities and other tax planning strategies that may be
available to the Company. If the Company continues to be profitable, the Company will continue to
evaluate each quarter its estimates of the recoverability of its deferred tax assets based on its
assessment of whether any portion of these fully reserved assets become more likely than not
recoverable through future taxable income. At such time, if any, that the Company no longer has a
reserve for its deferred tax assets, it will begin to provide for taxes at the full statutory rate. 48 Table of Contents Presentation of Governmental Taxes Other Than Income Taxes The Companys business activities are subject to various tax regulations in several taxing
jurisdictions. Governmental taxes assessed on the Companys activities, other than income taxes,
are presented in the Consolidated Statements of Operations on a net basis. Upon conclusion of a
taxable transaction, the amount of tax collected is accrued in a liability account in the
Consolidated Balance Sheets and is subsequently remitted to the taxing jurisdiction. Net Income Loss Per Share Basic net income lossper share is computed by dividing income available to common stockholders
by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding for the period. Net income available
to common shareholders is calculated using the two-class method, which is an earnings allocation
method for computing earnings per share when an entitys capital structure includes common stock
and participating securities. The two-class method determines earnings per share based on dividends
declared on common stock and participating securities i.e., distributed earnings and
participation rights of participating securities in any undistributed earnings. The application of
the two-class method is required since the Companys unvested restricted stock and warrants contain
participation features. See further discussion below. Diluted net income lossper share is
computed on the basis of the weighted average number of shares of common stock plus the effect of
dilutive potential common shares outstanding during the period using the treasury stock method. Dilutive securities at January3, 2010, include 248,654 warrants to purchase the Companys common
stock Note 8. The warrant holders are entitled to participate in dividends declared on common
stock as if the warrants were exercised for common stock. As a result, for purposes of calculating
basic net income lossper common share, income lossattributable to warrant holders has been
excluded from net income loss. Additionally, dilutive securities include 972,124 unvested restricted stock shares at January3,
2010. The unvested restricted stock holders are entitled to participate in dividends declared on
common stock as if the shares were fully vested. As a result, for purposes of calculating basic
net income lossper common share, income lossattributable to unvested restricted stock holders
has been excluded from net income loss. The computation of basic and diluted net income lossper share is as follows, in thousands,
except per share amounts

For 2009, 2008 and 2007 there were 1,273,020, 683,369 and 1,289 shares, respectively, attributable
to outstanding stock options, warrants and restricted stock excluded from the calculation of
diluted net income lossper share because their inclusion would have been antidilutive. 49 Table of Contents Use of Estimates The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting
principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported
in the financial statements and accompanying notes. The more significant areas requiring the use
of management estimates include estimates for uncollectible accounts, useful asset lives for
depreciation and amortization, deferred taxes and valuation allowances and stock-based
compensation. The Company believes that its estimation processes are adequate and its estimates in
these areas have consistently been similar to actual results. However, estimates in these areas
are highly subjective and future results could be materially different. Recent Accounting Pronouncements In June2009, the FASB approved the FASB Accounting Standards Codification the Codification as
the single source of authoritative nongovernmental GAAP. All existing accounting standard
documents, such as the FASB, American Institute of Certified Public Accountants, Emerging Issues
Task Force and other related literature, excluding guidance from the SEC, will be superseded by the
Codification. All non-grandfathered, non-SEC accounting literature not included in the
Codification will become non-authoritative. The Codification does not change GAAP, but instead
introduces a new structure that will combine all authoritative standards into a comprehensive,
topically organized online database. The Codification was effective for interim and annual periods
ending after September15, 2009. The Company adopted the Codification during the fourth quarter of
fiscal 2009. The Codification impact is limited to financial statement disclosures, as all
references to authoritative accounting literature are referenced in accordance with the
Codification. In May2009, the FASB issued ASC 855, Subsequent Events ASC 855. ASC 855 defines subsequent
events as events or transactions that occur after the balance sheet date, but before the financial
statements are issued. It defines two types of subsequent events: recognized subsequent events,
which provide additional evidence about conditions that existed at the balance sheet date, and
non-recognized subsequent events, which provide evidence about conditions that did not exist at the
balance sheet date, but arose before the financial statements were issued. Recognized subsequent
events are required to be recognized in the financial statements, and non-recognized subsequent
events are required to be disclosed. The statement requires entities to disclose the date through
which subsequent events have been evaluated, and the basis for that date. ASC 855 is consistent
with the Companys current practice and does not have any impact on the Companys results of
operations, financial condition or liquidity. See Note 1 and Note 11 for the required disclosure. In October2009 the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No2009-13, Multiple-Deliverable
Revenue Arrangements ASU No2009-13. ASU No2009-13 provides principles for allocation of
consideration among its multiple-elements, allowing more flexibility in identifying and accounting
for separate deliverables under an arrangement. The statement also introduces an estimated selling
price method for valuing the elements of a bundled arrangement if vendor-specific objective
evidence or third-party evidence of selling price is not available, and significantly expands
related disclosure requirements. ASU No2009-13 is effective prospectively for revenue
arrangements entered into or materially modified in fiscal years beginning on or after June15,
2010. The Company adopted this accounting standard in first quarter of 2010 using the prospective
method and the adoption did not have a material impact on the Companys consolidated financial
statements. In April2008, the FASB issued amendments to ASC 350, Intangibles Goodwill and Other. These
provisions amend the factors that should be considered in developing renewal or extension
assumptions used to determine the useful life of a recognized intangible asset. The intent of the
position is to improve the consistency between the determination of the useful life of a recognized
intangible asset and the period of expected cash flows used to measure the fair value of the asset.
The amended guidance is effective for fiscal years beginning after December15, 2008. The Company
adopted these provisions during the fiscal year ending January3, 2010; there was no impact to the
Companys consolidated financial statements. In December2007, the FASB issued guidance included in ASC Topic 805, Business Combinations
formerly FASB Staff Position SFAS No141R-1, which amends and clarifies SFAS No141R, Business
Combinations. The new provisions of ASC Topic 805 require the acquiring entity in a business
combination to record all assets acquired and liabilities assumed at their respective
acquisition-date fair values if fair value can be reasonably estimated, changes the recognition of
assets acquired and liabilities assumed arising from contingencies, changes the recognition and
measurement of contingent consideration, and requires the expensing of acquisition-related costs as
incurred. If fair value cannot be reasonably estimated, the asset or liability would generally be
recognized in accordance with ASC Topic 450, Contingencies. ASC Topic 805 also requires
additional disclosure of information surrounding a business combination, such that users of the
entitys financial statements can fully understand the nature and financial impact of the business
combination. The new provisions of ASC Topic 805 applies prospectively to business combinations for
which the acquisition date is on or after the beginning of the first annual reporting period
beginning on or after December15, 2008, which is the Companys fiscal 2009;
the Company adopted the new provisions of ASC Topic 805 in fiscal 2009. For business combinations
completed on or subsequent to the adoption date, the application of the new provisions of this
topic could have a significant impact on the Companys consolidated statement of operations and
financial condition, the magnitude of which will depend on the specific terms and conditions of the
transactions. Additionally, the adoption of the new provisions of ASC Topic 805 will have a
material impact on the Companys income tax provision. Any future release of the Companys
existing tax valuation allowance related to acquired tax benefits in a purchase business
combination when reversed, will be reflected as an income tax benefit in its Consolidated Statement
of Operations. Under the previous accounting standards, the reversal would have been recorded to
goodwill as well as income tax expense. As a result, the Companys reported income tax expense
declined in 2009. 50 Table of Contents 3. Selected Balance Sheet Accounts Accounts Receivable Receivables consist of the following, in thousands

Depreciation and amortization expense related to fixed assets amounted to $48million, $48
million and $41million in 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively. During 2009, the Company disposed
of $260million of fixed assets that were substantially fully depreciated. Goodwill The Company assesses recoverability of goodwill and other intangible assets in accordance with ASC
Topic 350, Intangibles Goodwill and Other, which requires goodwill and other intangible assets with
indefinite lives to be tested annually for impairment, unless an event occurs or circumstances
change during the year that reduce or may reduce the fair value of the reporting unit below its
book value, in which event an impairment charge may be required during the year. The Company has
selected the last day of the second-to-last month of our fiscal year as the date on which it will
perform the annual goodwill impairment test. The Company performed its annual impairment test as
of November29, 2009 and determined that the fair value of the reporting unit exceeded the
carrying value and there was no impairment. For the year ending December28, 2008, the implied goodwill was less than the carrying value of
goodwill, resulting in a non-cash, pre-tax impairment charge of $868million in the fourth quarter
of 2008. 51 Table of Contents The change in the carrying value of goodwill is set forth below, in thousands

The increase in 2007 was due primarily to the Companys purchases of Plum Rhino, Praeos and TWC and
the earnout payments related to the purchase of Pure Solutions partially offset by the
determination of certain tax and unclaimed property claim amounts related to the merger. The
decrease in 2008 was primarily due to the non-cash impairment charge partially offset by the
purchase of ASET and earnout payments related to the purchases of Pure Solutions and ASET. Other Intangible Assets The Companys intangible assets other than goodwill consisted of the following, in thousands

Restructuring Costs In November2008, the Company announced a restructuring plan designed to improve operational
efficiencies by relocating certain administrative functions primarily from the Washington, DC area
and Portland, Oregon into its Phoenix customer service center facility. All of these charges are
expected to result in future cash expenditures. These charges primarily relate to miscellaneous
employee termination benefits and lease-related costs. The change in the liability for restructuring costs is set forth below, in thousands

The Company recorded additional restructuring charges related to lease abandonment costs in 2009
related to its reduction in space at the Companys Washington, DC area facility. The Company entered into a sublease on the Washington, DC-area facility in the fourth
quarter of 2009, and thus reversed $10million previously accrued expense, which was partially
offset by $05million estimated and actual leasehold improvements which were expensed and not
recorded in the liability account. These lease charges will be paid from 2010 through 2014. 4. Long-Term Debt Long-term debt as of January3, 2010 and December28, 2008, consists of amounts outstanding under
the Companys senior credit agreement revolving credit facility in the amount of $381million and
$697million, respectively. The full balance as of January3, 2010 is due March31, 2012. 53 Table of Contents Credit Facilities In March2009, the Company entered into a Ninth Amendment to its senior credit agreement the
Amendment. Among other things, the Amendment provided for ia decrease in the Companys
borrowing capacity under its existing revolving credit facility from $1600million to
$1100million, iian extension of the maturity date for the facility for an additional two years
to March31, 2012, and iiiincreases in the applicable interest rates under the facility to LIBOR
plus a margin of 375% or, at the Companys option, the prime rate plus a margin of 275%. The
Amendment also permits the Company to make up to $100million in stock redemptions and/or dividend
payments in the aggregate subject to the terms and conditions specified. The Company pays a quarterly commitment fee of 075% per annum on the unused portion of the
revolver. The Company and certain of its subsidiaries guarantee the loans and other obligations
under the senior credit agreement. The obligations under the senior credit agreement are secured
by a perfected first priority security interest in substantially all of the assets of the Company
and its U.S. subsidiaries, as well as the shares of capital stock of its direct and indirect U.S.
subsidiaries and certain of the capital stock of its foreign subsidiaries. Pursuant to the terms
of the senior credit agreement, the Company maintains a zero balance in its primary domestic cash
accounts. Any excess cash in those domestic accounts is swept on a daily basis and applied to
repay borrowings under the revolver, and any cash needs are satisfied through borrowings under the
revolver. Borrowings under the revolver are limited to 85% of eligible accounts receivable, as defined in the
senior credit agreement, as amended, reduced by the amount of outstanding letters of credit and
designated reserves. At January3, 2010, these designated reserves were   
a $50million minimum availability reserve, and   
a $09million reserve for outstanding letters of credit. At January3, 2010, the Company had outstanding borrowings of $381million under the revolver at
interest rates ranging from 399% to 600% per annum weighted average rate of 400% and excess
borrowing availability under the revolver of $710million. Fees paid on outstanding letters of
credit are equal to the LIBOR margin then applicable to the revolver, which at January3, 2010, was
375%. At January3, 2010, outstanding letters of credit totaled $09million. The Companys credit facilities contain a number of covenants that, among other things, restrict
its ability to   
incur additional indebtedness   
pay more than $10million in the aggregate for stock repurchases and dividends   
incur liens   
make certain capital expenditures   
make certain investments or acquisitions   
repay debt; and   
dispose of property. In addition, under the credit facilities, there are springing financial covenants that would
require the Company to satisfy a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio and a maximum total leverage
ratio if the excess availability falls below $25million. A breach of any covenants governing the
Companys debt would permit the acceleration of the related debt and potentially other indebtedness
under cross-default provisions. As of January3, 2010, the Company was in compliance with these
requirements. The senior credit agreement contains various events of default, including failure to pay principal
and interest when due, breach of covenants, materially incorrect representations, default under
other agreements, bankruptcy or insolvency, the occurrence of specified ERISA events, entry of
enforceable judgments against the Company in excess of $20million not stayed and the occurrence
of a change of control. In the event of a default, all commitments under the revolver may be
terminated and all of the Companys obligations under the senior credit agreement could be
accelerated by the lenders, causing all loans and borrowings outstanding including accrued
interest and fees payable thereunder to be declared immediately due and payable. In the case of
bankruptcy or insolvency, acceleration of obligations under the Companys senior credit agreement
is automatic. 54 Table of Contents 5. Income Taxes The related components of the provision for income taxes are as follows, in thousands

In the table above, tax benefit allocated to goodwill and effect of increase decreasein
valuation allowance include both federal and state tax attributes. The total provision for
federal, state and foreign income taxes was $09million for 2009. Additionally, beginning in 2009,
in connection with adoption of provisions of ASC Topic 805, Business Combinations, we changed our
accounting for the remaining reserved deferred tax assets that previously would have been treated
as reductions to goodwill. This resulted in a decline in our reported income tax expense. The 2008 income tax expense contains current expenses in the amount of $03million for federal
alternative minimum tax; $11million for the Texas Margin tax, Michigan Gross Receipts tax,
California Corporate Income and other miscellaneous state and foreign income tax expenses and a
deferred expense in the amount of $33million resulting from the release of a portion of the
valuation allowance on Venturis acquired net deferred assets from the Comsys/Venturi merger. In 2008, the Company recognized a non-cash, pre-tax goodwill impairment charge in the amount of
$868million. The Company recorded a deferred tax asset related to the deductible portion of the
goodwill impairment in the amount of $215million and a corresponding valuation allowance. The
tax benefit for the impairment will be realized when the valuation allowance is released, resulting
in a benefit recorded to the Consolidated Statement of Operations. The non-deductible portion of
the goodwill impairment charge resulted in a permanent difference of $127million. The impairment
charge created a reduction in income tax expense in the amount of $08million. The Companys
deferred tax assets increased due to the goodwill impairment charge; therefore, the Company did not
utilize Venturi non-NOL deferred tax assets. If the Company had utilized Venturi non-NOL deferred
tax assets, a tax expense for the goodwill bifurcation discussed above would have been necessary. 55 Table of Contents The 2007 income tax expense contains current expenses in the amount of $03million for federal
alternative minimum tax; $03million for the Texas Margin tax and other miscellaneous state income
tax expenses and $01million for foreign income taxes related to the Companys profitable United
Kingdom subsidiary, a deferred expense in the amount of $23million resulting from the release of
a portion of the valuation allowance on Venturis acquired net deferred assets from the
Comsys/Venturi merger and a deferred state tax benefit of $07million related to the conversion of
the Companys Texas net operating loss carryforwards into the new Texas Margin tax credit. Deferred tax assets and liabilities result
primarily from temporary differences in book versus tax basis accounting as well as net operating loss
carryforwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities, which are included in Other non-current Assets on the
accompanying balance sheets, consist of the following, in thousands

As of January3, 2010, the Company had $601million in total net deferred tax assets and had
recorded a valuation allowance of $593million against those assets, since the Company has
concluded that it is more likely than not that these deferred tax assets will not be realized based
upon the Companys assessments using the criteria required for accounting for income taxes. The
decrease in the valuation allowance from December28, 2008, resulted primarily from pre-tax book
income and utilization of net deferred tax assets during the year. The change in the tax valuation
allowance for 2009, 2008 and 2007, is as follows, in thousands

At January3, 2010, the Company had federal and state net operating loss carryforwards of
approximately $967million and $965million, respectively. The federal net operating losses
begin to expire in 2023 and the state net operating losses began to expire in 2005. On February9,
2007, the Company experienced an ownership change as defined by the Internal Revenue Code due to third
party beneficial ownership changes. This subjects the utilization of the Companys net operating
loss carryforwards to an annual limitation, which may cause the carryforwards to expire before they
are used. The Companys ability to use its federal and state net operating loss carryforwards to
reduce future taxable income are subject to restrictions attributable to equity transactions that
have resulted in a change of ownership as defined by Internal Revenue Code Section382. The entire
amount of the $967million federal net operating loss carryforwards is subject to the limitations
of Internal Revenue Code 382. The Company has not paid United States federal income tax on the undistributed foreign earnings of
its foreign subsidiaries as it is the Companys intent to reinvest such earnings in its foreign
subsidiaries. Pre-tax income attributable to the Companys profitable foreign operations amounted
to $0, $01million and $06million in 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively. 56 Table of Contents The Company files U.S. federal and state tax returns and
foreign tax returns. As of January3, 2010, open years for U.S. federal and state tax returns
subject to examination by the IRS or state taxing authorities are 2005 through 2008. The Company
believes that its income tax filing positions and deductions would be sustained on audit and does
not anticipate any adjustments that will result in a material adverse effect on the Companys
financial condition, results of operations or cash flow. The Company may, from time to time, be assessed interest or penalties by major tax jurisdictions,
although any such assessments historically have been minimal and immaterial to its financial
results. In the event it has received an assessment for interest and/or penalties, it has been
classified in the financial statements as selling, general and administrative expense. For 2009,
2008 and 2007, the Company has not recorded any interest or penalties. 6. Commitments and Contingencies The Company leases various office space and equipment under noncancelable operating leases expiring
through 2018. Certain leases include free rent periods, rent escalation clauses and renewal
options. Rent expense is recorded on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease. Rent
expense was $72million, $82million and $74million for 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively.
Sublease income was $10million, $07million and $06million for the years 2009, 2008 and 2007,
respectively. Future minimum annual payments for noncancelable operating leases are as follows, in thousands

In connection with the Comsys/Venturi merger and the sale of Venturis commercial staffing business
in 2004, the Company placed $25million of cash and 187,556 shares of its common stock in separate
escrows pending the final determination of certain state tax and unclaimed property assessments.
The shares were released from escrow on September30, 2006, in accordance with the Comsys/Venturi
merger agreement, while the cash remains in escrow. The cash escrow account was scheduled to
terminate on December31, 2009, but prior to December31 the purchaser of Venturis staffing
business made a claim against the escrow account pursuant to the indemnification provisions in the
purchase agreement. The Company has disputed this claim, but as a result of the dispute, the
termination of the cash escrow will not occur until either the parties reach an
agreement as to the matters that are the subject of the dispute or the receipt of a court order.
Following the termination of the escrow, the Company will be paid the balance of the escrow
account. The Company has recorded liabilities for amounts that management believes are adequate to
resolve all of the matters these escrows were intended to cover, but management cannot ascertain at
this time what the final outcome of these assessments or the outcome of the dispute with the
purchaser of Venturis staffing business will be in the aggregate, and it is possible that
managements estimates could change. The escrowed cash is included in restricted cash on the
Consolidated Balance Sheets. Chimes, a vendor management services VMS company, filed for bankruptcy under Chapter7 on
January9, 2008. The Company has filed a proof of claim in the bankruptcy case. Like a number of
other Chimes vendors, the Company is the subject of a number of preference lawsuits demanding the
return of payments made to the Company by Chimes during the 90days leading up to the filing of the
bankruptcy petition. The Company believes that none of the payments it received were preferences
as defined by bankruptcy law and intends to vigorously defend itself against these claims.
However, no assurance can be made as to the outcome of these legal proceedings. 57 Table of Contents The Company has agreed to indemnify members of its board of directors and its corporate officers
against any threatened, pending or completed action or proceeding, whether civil, criminal,
administrative or investigative by reason of the fact that the individual is or was a director or
officer of the Company. The individuals will be indemnified, to the fullest extent permitted by
law, against related expenses, judgments, fines and any amounts paid in settlement. The Company
also maintains directors and officers insurance coverage in order to mitigate exposure to these
indemnification obligations. No assets are held as collateral and no specific recourse provisions
exist related to these indemnifications. There was no amount recorded for these indemnification
obligations at January3, 2010 and December28, 2008. Due to the nature of these obligations, it
is not possible to make a reasonable estimate of the maximum potential loss or range of loss. The Company has entered into employment agreements with certain of its executives covering, among
other things, base compensation, incentive bonus determinations and payments in the event of
termination or a change of control of the Company. The Company is a defendant in various lawsuits and other claims arising in the normal course of
business and is defending them vigorously. While the results of litigation cannot be predicted
with certainty, management believes the final outcome of such litigation will not have a material
adverse effect on the consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows of the
Company. Any cost to settle litigation will be included in selling, general and administrative
expense on the Consolidated Statements of Operations. 7. Defined Contribution Plan The Company maintains a voluntary defined contribution 401k plan for certain qualifying
employees, which provides for employee contributions. Participating employees may elect to defer
and contribute a percentage of their compensation to the plan, not to exceed the dollar limit set
by the Internal Revenue Code. For the years ended December31, 2009, 2008 and 2007, the maximum
deferral amount was 50%, subject to limitations set by the Internal Revenue Code. The Company may,
at its discretion, make a year-end profit-sharing contribution. No discretionary contributions
were made in 2009, 2008 or 2007. Total net expense under the plan amounted to approximately $01
million, $14million and $15million in 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively. The Company suspended the matching contribution to its 401k plan effective April1, 2009. Future
matching contributions will be made at the Companys discretion. Additionally, Pure Solutions maintains a voluntary defined contribution 401k plan for certain
qualifying employees, which provides for employee contributions. Participating employees may elect
to defer and contribute a percentage of their compensation to the plan, not to exceed the dollar
limit set by the Internal Revenue Code. Pure Solutions has the discretion under the plan to match
participant deferrals. For 2009, 2008 and 2007, Pure Solutions elected to forego a matching
contribution. During 1999, Venturi established a Supplemental Employee Retirement Plan the SERP for its then
Chief Executive Officer. When this officer retired in February2000, the annual benefit payable
under the SERP was fixed at $150,000 through March2017. As of January3, 2010, approximately $09
million was accrued for the SERP. 8. Warrants In the Comsys/Venturi merger, the Company assumed outstanding warrants to purchase 768,997 shares
of Venturi now COMSYS common stock. The warrants were originally issued on April14, 2003, in
connection with the comprehensive financial restructuring with Venturis subordinated note holders.
The warrants are exercisable in whole or in part over a 10-year period, and the exercise price is
$78025 per share. The warrants may be exercised on a cashless basis at the option of the holder.
The holders of the warrants are also entitled to participate in dividends declared on common stock
as if the warrants were exercised for common stock. In connection with the purchase accounting for
the merger, the warrants were recorded at fair value as a component of shareholders equity. At
January3, 2010, warrants to purchase 248,654 shares of the Companys common stock were
outstanding. 58 Table of Contents 9. Stock Compensation Plans The Company has four stock-based compensation plans with outstanding equity awards: the 1995
Equity Participation Plan 1995 Plan, the 2003 Equity Incentive Plan 2003 Equity Plan, the
Amended and Restated COMSYS IT Partners, Inc. 2004 Stock Incentive Plan 2004 Equity Plan and
the 2004 Management Incentive Plan 2004 Incentive Plan. Plan Descriptions In 2003, Venturi terminated the 1995 Plan in connection with its financial restructuring. As a
result of the Comsys/Venturi merger, all outstanding options under the 1995 Plan were vested and
are exercisable. Although the 1995 Plan has been terminated and no future option issuances will be
made under it, the remaining outstanding stock options will continue to be exercisable in
accordance with their terms. In 2003, Venturi adopted the 2003 Equity Plan under which the Company may grant non-qualified stock
options, incentive stock options and other stock-based awards in the Companys common stock to
officers and other key employees. On the date of the Comsys/Venturi merger, all outstanding
options under the 2003 Equity Plan at that time vested and became exercisable. Options granted
under the 2003 Equity Plan have a term of 10years. In connection with the Comsys/Venturi merger, the Companys Board of Directors adopted and the
stockholders approved the 2004 Equity Plan, which was subsequently amended and restated in 2007 and
further amended in 2009. Under the 2004 Equity Plan, the Company may grant non-qualified stock
options, incentive stock options, restricted stock and other stock-based awards in its common stock
to officers, employees, directors and consultants. Options granted under this plan generally vest
over a three-year period from the date of grant and have a term of 10years. Effective January1, 2004, Old COMSYS adopted the 2004 Incentive Plan. The 2004 Incentive Plan was
structured as a stock issuance program under which certain executive officers and key employees
might receive shares of Old COMSYS nonvoting ClassD Preferred Stock in exchange for payment at the
then current fair market value of these shares. Effective July1, 2004, 1,000 shares of ClassD
Preferred Stock were issued by Old COMSYS under the 2004 Incentive Plan. Effective with the
Comsys/Venturi merger, these shares were exchanged for a total of 1,405,844 shares of restricted
common stock of COMSYS. Of these shares, one-third vested on the date of the Comsys/Venturi
merger, one-third vested over a three-year period subsequent to merger, and one-third vested over a
three-year period subject to specific performance criteria being met. Effective June1, 2007, the
Compensation Committee of the Companys Board of Directors the Committee made certain
modifications to the 2004 Incentive Plan after concluding that the performance vesting targets
appeared to be unattainable, as noted below. Although there will be no future restricted stock
issuances under the 2004 Incentive Plan, the remaining outstanding restricted stock awards will
continue to vest in accordance with their terms. In accordance with the terms of the 2004
Incentive Plan, any shares forfeited by participants will be distributed to certain stockholders of
Old COMSYS in 2010 after the completion of the 2009 audit. Stock Options A summary of the activity related to stock options granted under the 1995 Plan, the 2003 Equity

The aggregate intrinsic value of options outstanding at January3, 2010 was $10,865. During 2007, the Company entered into a modification agreement with Mr.Michael H. Barker, its
Chief Operating Officer, effective June1, 2007, amending the vesting schedule for a portion of
Mr.Barkers 100,000 share stock option award dated October1, 2004. The Committee determined that
the performance targets for the 49,990 shares that were originally scheduled to vest over three
years would not be met. Therefore, these shares were rescheduled to vest as follows: two-thirds
were rescheduled to vest in substantially equal annual installments over the three-year period
ending January1, 2010, and one-third were rescheduled to vest over the same three-year period
based on the attainment of the Companys annual EBITDA target under its management incentive plan.
The purpose of these modifications was to retain the services of the executive and provide an
incentive for the executive to contribute to the Companys long-term success after October1, 2007,
when the initial three-year vesting schedule for these options was originally scheduled to expire.
All other terms of the original award remained unchanged. On October1, 2008, the Committee
concluded that the annual EBITDA bonus target for its 2008 management incentive plan the Original
EBITDA Target was unattainable, and replaced the annual target with a new EBITDA bonus target for
the final six months of 2008 the New EBITDA Target that was lower on an annualized basis than
the Original EBITDA Target by approximately 22%, therefore, the awards issued to Mr.Barker subject
to 2008 performance vesting criteria were reduced by approximately 25% at the date of the
modification. If the New EBITDA Target was met, 50% of the original awards would vest. If the New
EBITDA Target was exceeded, up to 75% of the original awards would vest. On February13, 2009, the
Committee determined that the New EBITDA Target was met; therefore, 50% of the original awards
vested and the remaining 25% were forfeited. The fair value of options modified in 2008 and 2007 was estimated on the date of modification using
the Black-Scholes option pricing model based on the assumptions noted in the following table.
There were no new options granted in 2009, 2008 or 2007.

Option valuation models, including the Black-Scholes model used by the Company, require the
input of assumptions, including expected life and expected stock price volatility. Due to the
limited trading history of the Companys common stock following the Comsys/Venturi merger, expected
stock price volatility for stock option grants or modifications prior to 2007 was based on an
analysis of the actual realized historical volatility of the Companys common stock as well as that
of its peers. Beginning in 2007, the expected volatility assumption for stock option grants or
modifications was based on actual historical volatility of the Companys common stock from the
period after its December2005 common stock offering through the quarter ended prior to the grant
or modification date. The Company uses historical data to estimate option exercises and employee
forfeitures within the valuation model. The expected life is derived from an analysis of
historical exercises and remaining contractual life of stock options and represents the period of
time that options granted are expected to be outstanding. The risk-free interest rate is based on
the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant. The Company has never paid cash
dividends, and does not currently intend to pay cash dividends, and thus has assumed a 0% dividend
yield. 60 Table of Contents Cash received from option exercises was $0, $01million and $18million in 2009, 2008 and 2007,
respectively, and was included in financing activities in the accompanying Consolidated Statements
of Cash Flows. The total intrinsic value of options exercised during 2009, 2008 and 2007 was $0 24,300 and $23million, respectively. The Company has historically used newly issued shares to
satisfy option exercises and restricted stock grants and expects to continue to do so in future
periods. Restricted Stock Awards Restricted stock awards are grants that entitle the holder to shares of common stock as the awards
vest. The Company measures the fair value of restricted shares based upon the closing market price
of the Companys common stock on the date of grant. Restricted stock awards that vest in
accordance with service conditions are amortized over their applicable vesting period using the
straight-line method. For nonvested share awards subject partially or wholly to performance
conditions, the Company is required to assess the probability that such performance conditions will
be met. If the likelihood of the performance condition being met is deemed probable, the Company
will recognize the expense using the straight-line attribution method. Certain executive officers have existing provisions in their employment contracts regarding change
in control. A summary of the activity related to restricted stock granted under the 2004 Equity Plan and the
2004 Incentive Plan is as follows

The shares issued to employees under the 2004 Equity Plan and 2004 Incentive Plan are subject
to a three-year time-based vesting requirement, except as noted below, and the compensation expense
associated with these shares is amortized using the straight-line method. The aggregate intrinsic
value of restricted stock outstanding at January3, 2010 was $18million. Effective January2, 2009, the Committee approved equity grants to five executive officers,
including the Companys Chief Executive Officer. These shares are 100% performance-based, and will
vest if at all at the end of the three-year period ending December31, 2011, based on the
Companys earnings per share EPS growth as against the BMO staffing stock index during the
three-year period. The shares will fully vest if the Companys EPS growth is in the top 25% of the
index. The shares will vest 50% or 25% if the Companys EPS growth is in the second 25% or third
25% of the index, respectively. No shares will vest if the Companys EPS growth is in the bottom
25% of the index. The vesting percentages will be prorated within individual tiers, except that no
shares will vest for EPS growth in the bottom tier. As of January3, 2010, there was $40million of total unrecognized compensation costs related to
nonvested option and restricted stock awards granted under the plans, which are expected to be
recognized over a weighted-average period of 23months. The total fair value of shares and options
that vested during 2009 was $40million. 61 Table of Contents 10. Related Party Transactions Elias J. Sabo, a member of the Companys board of directors, also serves on the board of directors
of The Compass Group, the parent company of StaffMark. StaffMark provides commercial staffing
services to the Company and its clients in the normal course of its business. During 2009, the
Company and its clients purchased approximately $38million of staffing services from StaffMark
for services provided to the Companys vendor management clients. At January3, 2010, the Company
had no outstanding accounts payable to StaffMark. Frederick W. Eubank II and Courtney R. McCarthy, members of the Companys board of directors, are

profits realized on sales of the Companys stock that was purchased and sold within a six month or
less time frame. Under Section 16b of the Securities and Exchange Act, the profits realized from
these transactions by the greater than 10% shareholder must be disgorged to the Company under
certain circumstances. The Company received proceeds of approximately $164,000 related to these
transactions. 11. Subsequent Events Merger Agreement As

CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures Our management has established and maintains a system of disclosure controls and procedures
designed to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed by us in the
reports filed or submitted by us under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended the
Exchange Act, is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified
in the SECs rules and forms, and include controls and procedures designed to provide reasonable
assurance that information required to be disclosed by us in those reports is accumulated and
communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Accounting
Officer our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, respectively, as
appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. As of January3, 2010, our
management, including our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Accounting Officer, conducted an
evaluation of our disclosure controls and procedures. Based on this evaluation, our Chief
Executive Officer and Chief Accounting Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and
procedures were effective as of January3, 2010. All internal control systems, no matter how well designed, have inherent limitations. Therefore,
even those systems determined to be effective can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to
financial statement preparation and presentation. Changes in Internal Controls over Financial Reporting There has been no change in our internal control over financial reporting during the quarter ended
January3, 2010, that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our
internal control over financial reporting. Managements Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting Management is responsible for the fair presentation of the consolidated financial statements of
COMSYS IT Partners, Inc. Management is also responsible for establishing and maintaining a system
of internal control over financial reporting as defined in Rule13a-15f and 15d-15f under the
Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. Our internal control over financial reporting is
designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the
preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted
accounting principles. Our internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and
procedures that   
i
pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company   
ii
provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of our management and directors; and   
iii
provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. 64 Table of Contents A control system, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not
absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met. Further, the benefits of
controls must be considered relative to their costs. Because of the inherent limitations in all
control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues
and instances of management override or improper acts, if any, have been detected. These inherent
limitations include the realities that judgments in decision making can be faulty and that
breakdowns can occur because of simple errors or mistakes. Additionally, controls can be
circumvented by the individual acts of some persons, by collusion of two or more people or by
management override of the control. The design of any system of controls is also based in part upon
certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance that any
design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions. Because of
the inherent limitations in a cost-effective control system, misstatements due to management
override, error or improper acts may occur and not be detected. Any resulting misstatement or loss
may have an adverse and material effect on our business, financial condition and results of
operations. Management conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial
reporting based on the framework in Internal ControlIntegrated Framework issued by the Committee
of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Based on our evaluation under the
framework in Internal ControlIntegrated Framework, management concluded that our internal control
over financial reporting was effective as of January3, 2010. Management has engaged Ernst Young
LLP, the independent registered public accounting firm that audited the financial statements
included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, to attest to the Companys internal control over
financial reporting. Its report is included herein.

65 Table of Contents REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM Board of Directors and Stockholders
COMSYS IT Partners, Inc. and Subsidiaries We have audited COMSYS IT Partners, Inc. and Subsidiaries s internal control over financial
reporting as of January3, 2010, based on criteria established in Internal ControlIntegrated
Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission the COSO
criteria. COMSYS IT Partners, Inc.s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal
control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control
over financial reporting included in the accompanying Managements Report on Internal Control Over
Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the companys internal control
over financial reporting based on our audit. We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight
Board United States. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was
maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal
control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and
evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk,
and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe
that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion. A companys internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable
assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial
statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A
companys internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that 1
pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the
transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; 2provide reasonable assurance that
transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance
with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company
are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company;
and 3provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized
acquisition, use or disposition of the companys assets that could have a material effect on the
financial statements. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or
detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are
subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that
the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. In our opinion, COMSYS IT Partners, Inc. and Subsidiaries maintained, in all material respects,
effective internal control over financial reporting as of January3, 2010, based on the COSO
criteria. We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight
Board United States, the consolidated balance sheets of COMSYS IT Partners, Inc. and Subsidiaries
as of January3, 2010, and December28, 2008, and the related consolidated statements of
operations, comprehensive income, stockholders equity and cash flows for each of the three years
in the period ended January3, 2010 of COMSYS IT Partners, Inc. and our report dated March1, 2010,
expressed an unqualified opinion thereon. s/ ERNST YOUNG LLP Phoenix, Arizona
