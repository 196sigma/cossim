To the Shareholders of
TB Wood Corporation     We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of TB
Wood Corporation a Delaware corporation and Subsidiaries as of December 31,
1999 and January 1, 1999 and the related consolidated statements of operations,
comprehensive income, changes in shareholders' equity, and cash flows for each
of the three years in the period ended December 31, 1999. These financial
statements are the responsibility of the Company management. Our
responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on
our audits.
We conducted our audits in accordance with auditing standards generally
accepted in the United States. Those standards require that we plan and perform
the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements
are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis,
evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An
audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant
estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial
statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis
for our opinion.
In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present
fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of TB Wood
Corporation and subsidiaries as of December 31, 1999 and January 1, 1999 and the
results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in
the period ended December 31, 1999 in conformity with accounting principles
generally accepted in the United States.
Our audits were made for the purpose of forming an opinion on the basic
financial statements taken as a whole. The schedule listed in the index of
financial statements is presented for purposes of complying with the Securities
and Exchange Commission rules and is not part of the basic financial
statements. This schedule has been subjected to the auditing procedures applied
in the audit of the basic financial statements and, in our opinion, fairly
states in all material respects the financial data required to be set forth
therein in relation to the basic financial statements taken as a whole. ARTHUR ANDERSEN LLP Atlanta, Georgia

TB Wood Corporation and subsidiaries collectively, Wood or the
Company is an established designer, manufacturer, and marketer of electronic
and mechanical industrial power transmission products which are sold to
distributors, domestic and international manufacturers and users of industrial
equipment. Principal products of the Company include electronic drives,
integrated electronic drive systems, mechanical belted drives, and flexible
couplings. The Company has operations throughout the United States, Canada,
Mexico, Germany, Italy and India. The accompanying consolidated financial
statements include the accounts of TB Wood Corporation, its wholly owned
subsidiaries and its majority-owned joint venture. All inter company accounts
have been eliminated in consolidation.
Year-End
Fiscal year-ends are as follows      31, 1999
1, 1999
2, 1998 2.    SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
Restricted Cash
At December 31, 1999, $1,091 of cash is restricted under the Variable
Rate Demand Revenue Bonds Note 4. This cash may be used for building
renovations, improvements, or other capital expenditures related to new
production facilities for the electronics systems business and a new production
facility for the mechanical division.
Cash Equivalents
The Company considers all highly liquid investments with an original
maturity of three months or less to be cash equivalents.
Property, Plant, and Equipment
The Company depreciates its property, plant, and equipment principally
using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets.
Equipment under capital leases is depreciated over the asset estimated useful
life and is included in machinery and equipment. Maintenance and repair costs
are charged to expense as incurred, while major renewals and improvements are
capitalized. When property and equipment are retired or otherwise disposed of,
the related carrying value and accumulated depreciation are removed from the
accounts and any resulting gain or loss is reflected in income. The depreciable
lives of the major classes of property, plant and equipment are summarized as
follows     Asset Type                           Lives
Machinery and equipment                 3 - 15 years
Buildings and improvements               10 - 40 years                    21 Inventories
Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market primarily using
the last-in, first-out LIFO method. Market is defined as net realizable
value. Cost includes raw materials, direct labor, and manufacturing overhead.
Approximately 79% and 77% of total inventories in years ending December 31, 1999
and January 1, 1999, respectively, were valued using the LIFO method. TB
Wood-Canada, TB Wood-Mexico and TB Wood-Berges inventories are stated at
the lower of cost or market using the first-in, first-out FIFO method.
Self-Insurance
The Company maintains workers' compensation insurance policies which
have the potential for retrospective premium adjustments and a partially
self-insured group health insurance policy which is subject to specific
retention levels. Insurance administrators assist the Company in estimating the
fully developed workers' compensation liability and group health insurance
reserves which are accrued by the Company. In the opinion of management,
adequate provision has been made for all incurred claims. At December 31, 1999
the Company has issued letters of credit totaling $735 to cover incurred claims
and other costs related to the workers' compensation.
Foreign Currency Translation
The financial statements of the Company foreign subsidiaries have
been translated into U.S. dollars in accordance with Statement of Financial
Accounting Standards SFAS No. 52, Foreign Currency Translation.
Translation adjustments, which result from the process of translating financial
statements into U.S. dollars, are accumulated as a separate component of other
comprehensive income. Exchange gains and losses resulting from foreign currency
transactions, primarily intercompany sales of products, are included in other
expense in the accompanying statements of operations and are not material.
Goodwill
The excess of cost over the net assets acquired Goodwill is being
amortized on a straight-line basis over a period of 40 years. Goodwill relates
to the acquisition of TB Wood Incorporated Wood-US in 1986 and the
acquisition of certain other businesses and product lines Note 8.
Long-Lived Assets and Intangible Assets
The Company reviews the carrying values assigned to long-lived assets
and certain identifiable intangible assets based on expectations of undiscounted
future cash flows and operating income generated by the long-lived assets or the
tangible assets underlying certain identifiable intangible assets in determining
whether the carrying amount of such assets is recoverable.
Shareholders' Equity
In 1996, the board of directors authorized, subject to certain business
and market conditions, the purchase of up to 200,000 of the Company common
shares. At December 31, 1999 the number of treasury shares purchased under this
authorization was 162,432. The number of treasury shares issued to employees
under option and purchase plans was 12,456 and under the 401k profit-sharing
plan was 21,557 for 1999. The Board of Directors authorized a self-tender Dutch
Auction for 400,000 of the Company common shares at a price not to exceed
$1250 per share and not lower than $900 per share. On December 17, 1999, the
Company accepted 400,000 shares at $900 per share and incurred related costs.                    22 Fair Value of Financial Instruments
The fair value of financial instruments classified as current assets or
liabilities, including cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, and
accounts payable, approximate carrying value due to the short-term maturity of
the instruments. The fair value of short-term and long-term debt and deferred
compensation amounts approximate carrying value and are based on their effective
interest rates compared to current market rates.
Use of Estimates
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally
accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and
assumptions that affect the reported amount of assets and liabilities, the
disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial
statements, and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the
reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.
Cyclical Industry
The markets for some of the Company products are cyclical, generally
following changes in the overall economy. Consequently, during periods of
economic expansion, the Company has experienced increased demand for its
products, and during periods of economic contraction, the Company has
experienced decreased demand for its products. Such changes in the general
economy affect the Company results of operations in the relevant fiscal
periods.
Research and Development Costs
Research and development costs consist substantially of projects
related to new product development within the electronics business and are
expensed as incurred. Total research and development costs are $3,659 in 1999 3,482 in 1998, and $3,733 in 1997.
Major Customers
The Company five largest customers accounted for approximately 29 25%, and 30% of net sales for fiscal years 1999, 1998, and 1997, respectively.
Of these customers, one accounted for close to 20% of net sales for the year
ended December 31, 1999. The loss of one or more of these customers would have
an adverse effect on the Company performance and operations. Foreign and
export sales accounted for 23% and 22% of total sales in fiscal years 1999 and
1998, respectively. Inter company transactions are consummated on terms
equivalent to those that prevail in arms-length transactions.
Supply of Electronic Raw Materials and Purchased Components
Historically, the electronics component industry, which supplies
components for the Company electronic products, has from time to time
experienced heavy demand for certain components during periods of growth in the
consumer electronic industry. The rapid growth of the AC electronic drive market
has also created heavy demand for power control electronics. While certain of
the Company components are obtained from a single or limited number of
sources, the Company has potential alternate suppliers for most of the specialty
components used in its manufacturing operations. There can be no assurance,
however, that the Company will not experience shortages of raw materials or
components essential to the production of its products or be forced to seek
alternative sources of supply, which may increase costs or adversely affect the
Company ability to obtain and fulfill orders for its products.                    23 Net Income Per Share
In March 1997, the Financial Accounting Standards Board FASB issued
SFAS No. 128, Earnings Per Share, which the Company adopted for the year ended
January 2, 1998. Basic earnings per share EPS is computed by dividing
reported earnings available to common shareholders by weighted average shares
outstanding. No dilution for any potentially dilutive securities is included in
basic EPS. Diluted EPS is computed by dividing reported earnings available to
common shareholders by weighted average shares and common equivalent shares
outstanding. The difference between primary and fully diluted net income per
share is not material for any of the periods presented and has therefore been
excluded.
The computation of weighted average shares outstanding and net income
per share is as follows for fiscal years 1999, 1998, and 1997                                             1999     1998    1997

Common shares outstanding for basic     5,896    5,874    5,833
Shares issued upon assumed exercise of outstanding stock options.     14      58     88
Weighted average number of common and common equivalent
shares     5,910    5,932    5,921
Recent Accounting Pronouncements
Effective fiscal 1997, the Company adopted SFAS No. 129, Disclosure of
Information and Capital Structure. SFAS No. 129 requires disclosure of the
pertinent rights and privileges of all securities other than ordinary common
stock. The Company has disclosed such information in its annual reports filed in
Form 10-K.
In July 1997, the FASB issued SFAS No. 130, Reporting Comprehensive
Income, effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 1997. The
statement addresses the reporting and display of changes in equity that result
from transactions and other economic events, excluding transactions with owners.
The Company adopted SFAS No. 130 in 1998.
Effective fiscal 1998, the Company adopted SFAS No. 131, Disclosures
about Segments of an Enterprise and Related Information. The Company has
disclosed such information in Note 9 to the consolidated financial statements.
Effective January 3, 1998, the Company adopted SFAS No. 132,
Employers' Disclosure about Pension and Other Postretirement Benefits. See
Note 6.
In June 1998, the FASB issued SFAS No. 133 Accounting for Derivative
Instruments and Hedging Activities, effective for fiscal years beginning after
June 15, 1999. SFAS No. 133 requires derivatives to be recorded on the balance
sheet as assets or liabilities, measured at fair value. Gains or losses
resulting from changes in values of derivatives would be accounted for depending
on the use of the derivative and whether it qualifies for hedge accounting. In
June 1999, the FASB issued SFAS No. 137, Accounting for Derivative Instruments
and Hedging Activities - Deferral of the Effective Date of SFAS No. 133. SFAS
No. 137 delays the standard effective date to the beginning of the first quarter
of the fiscal year beginning after June 15, 2000. Adoption of this statement is
not expected to have a material effect on the Company financial statements.                    24 Reclassifications

The Company has a $52,500 unsecured revolving credit facility arranged
by PNC Bank, N.A. PNC bearing variable interest of LIBOR plus 1125 basis
points, maturing October 2003. The credit facility contains numerous restrictive
financial covenants which require the Company to comply with certain financial
tests including, among other things, maintaining minimum tangible net worth, as
defined, and maintaining certain specified ratios. The credit facility also
contains other restrictive covenants that include, among other things,
restrictions on outside investments and restrictions on capital expenditures.
In April 1997, the Company borrowed approximately $26 million by
issuing Variable Rate Demand Revenue Bonds under the authority of the Industrial
Revenue Board of the City of Chattanooga, bearing variable interest of 565% at
December 31, 1999 maturing April 2022. The bonds were issued to finance the new
production facility for the electronics systems business.                    25     In August 1998, the Company entered into an interest rate swap
agreement that effectively converted the underlying variable rate debt in the
unsecured revolving credit facility to fixed rate debt. The notional principal
amount of the swap agreement is $10,000 with an effective fixed rate of 575%.
The swap agreement is settled each month and will expire in July 2001.
In February 1999, the Company borrowed approximately $30 million by
issuing Variable Rate Demand Revenue Bonds under the authority of the Industrial
Development Corporation City of San Marcos, bearing variable interest of 565%
at December 31, 1999, maturing April 2024. The bonds were issued to finance a
new production facility for the mechanical division.
The gross proceeds from repayments of the revolving credit facilities
are as follows                                1999      1998      1997

Provision for income taxes                  $3,361     $5,256     $5,794
Under SFAS No. 109, deferred tax assets or liabilities at the end of
each period are determined by applying the current tax rate to the difference
between the financial reporting and income tax bases of assets and liabilities.
The deferred tax benefit is determined based on changes in deferred tax items
exclusive of deferred tax implications of the early extinguishment of debt and
reclassifications between deferred and current taxes.                    26     The components of deferred income taxes are as follows                              1999       1998
-   Deferred income tax liabilities:

A reconciliation of the provision for income taxes at the statutory
federal income tax rate to the Company tax provision as reported in the
accompanying statements of operations is shown below                     1999      1998       1997
-    Federal statutory income tax      $2,966     $4,470      $4,924

In 1999, 1998, and 1997 earnings before income taxes included $2,541 2,862, and $1,259, respectively, of earnings generated by the Company foreign
operations. No federal or state income taxes have been provided on such
earnings, since undistributed earnings have been reinvested and are not expected
to be remitted to the parent company.
In September 1997, the Internal Revenue Service completed its review of
the Company 1995, 1994, and 1993 federal income tax returns. The review did
not have a material effect on the Company operations. The Internal Revenue
Service is currently in review of the Company 1996 federal income tax return. 6.    BENEFIT PLANS
Compensation Plans
Wood maintains a discretionary compensation plan for its salaried and
hourly employees which provides for incentive awards based on certain levels of
earnings, as defined. Amounts awarded under the plan and charged to expense in
the accompanying statements of operations were $709, $1,238, and $2,002, for
fiscal years 1999, 1998, and 1997 respectively.                    27 Profit-Sharing Plans
Since January 1, 1988, the Company has maintained a separate defined
contribution 401k profit-sharing plan covering all domestic employees. Under
this plan, the Company matches a specified percentage of each eligible
employee contribution and 50% of the match is invested in funds designated by
the employee and 50% of the match is used to purchase company common shares on
the open market. The Company contributed 21,557 shares of common stock held in
treasury in 1999, 35,990 in 1998, and 5,797 in 1997. Amounts contributed by the
Company under this profit-sharing plan were approximately $249, $580, and $530
for fiscal years 1999, 1998, and 1997, respectively. In addition, the Company
has a noncontributory profit-sharing plan covering its Canadian employees for
which $38, $17, and $37 were charged to expense for the fiscal years 1999, 1998,
and 1997, respectively.
Employee Stock Purchase Plan
The Company Employee Stock Purchase Plan ESPP enables employees
of the Company to subscribe for shares of common stock on quarterly offering
dates, at a purchase price which is the lesser of 90% of the fair value of the
shares on the first or last day of the quarterly period. Employee contributions
to the ESPP were $124, $152 and $63 for 1999, 1998, and 1997 respectively.
Pursuant to the ESPP, 12,456 shares were issued to employees during 1999, 8,775
during 1998 and 4,436 shares during 1997. At the annual meeting on April 11,
1997, the Company shareholders approved the reservation of 500,000 shares to
be issued under the ESPP. As of December 31, 1999, 474,333 shares are available
for future issuance.
Stock Options
In March 1991, the Company granted nonqualified stock options to the
president of the Company to purchase 157,893 shares of the Company common
stock at an option price of $633 per share. The options vested 30% in January
1993, 15% in each of January 1994, 1995, 1996, and 1997, and 10% in January
1998. The option agreement was amended on March 30, 1992 to set the option price
at $158 per share plus an amount equal to the average yield on the 30-year U.S.
Treasury bond maturing on the day closest to the fifteenth anniversary of the
option measurement date as defined in the agreement. The options are exercisable
on or after the seventh anniversary of the measurement date and expire one year
thereafter. During 1992, the controlling shareholder granted an additional
47,367 options on the controlling shareholder shares to a director, with terms
similar to the 1991 options, as amended. Also in 1992, the Company granted an
additional 30,000 options to an employee with terms similar to the 1991 options,
as amended, with vesting beginning in 1994. The options are exercisable
beginning on the seventh anniversary of the measurement date, as defined, and
expire on the eighth anniversary of the measurement date. The option agreements
contain various fair value puts and calls, with fair value to be determined by
the board of directors or an independent appraiser. All of the above options
have expired or have been exercised as of December 31, 1999.
As a result of the above amendment, beginning in March 1992, the
Company began accounting for the options under variable plan accounting, whereby
increases in the value of the Company common stock above the option price
resulted in the recording of compensation expense by the Company. Through
December 31, 1994, the Company recorded no compensation expense related to the
options as, in the opinion of management, the fair value of the Company common
stock was equal to or below the option price, as adjusted. Due to increases in
the estimated fair value of the Company common stock, as determined by an
independent appraiser, the Company recorded stock option compensation expense of
$675 for the year ended December 29, 1995. Additional stock option compensation
expense of approximately $230 will be recorded in future periods based on the
vesting schedule of options. In July 1995, the option agreements were amended to
remove features of the options that resulted in variable plan accounting.
Accordingly, subsequent to July 1, 1995, the options are being accounted for as
fixed options whereby future increases in the value of the Company common
stock will not result in additional stock option compensation expense.                    28     In February 1994, the Company granted an additional 105,000 options
with terms similar to those discussed above, except that the February 1994
options do not have a put feature and have an option price which escalates
during the vesting period at a fixed rate of 6% per year. The February 1994
options are exercisable at a fixed exercise price for a one-year period
following the vesting period. The Company accounts for the February 1994 options
as fixed options whereby future increases in the value of the Company common
stock do not result in the recording of compensation expense by the Company. The
option agreements contain various fair value puts and calls, with fair value to
be determined by the board of directors or an independent appraiser.
In December 1994, the controlling shareholder of the Company granted
89,004 options on the controlling shareholder shares to certain members of
management which contain terms similar to the February 1994 options, except that
the option price escalates during the vesting period at a fixed rate of 786%
per year.
The Company adopted a 1996 stock-based incentive compensation plan the
1996 Plan, the purpose of which is to assist the Company in attracting and
retaining valued personnel by offering them a greater stake in the Company
success and a closer identity with the Company, and to encourage ownership of
the Company common stock by such personnel.
The 1996 Plan is administered by a committee the Committee
designated by the board of directors. The aggregate maximum number of shares of
common stock available for awards under the 1996 Plan is 500,000, subject to
adjustment to reflect changes in the Company capitalization. Awards under the
1996 Plan may be made to all officers and key employees of the Company. No
awards can be made under the 1996 Plan after January 31, 2006.
The Committee may grant shares of common stock in the form of either
deferred stock or restricted stock, as defined in the 1996 Plan. Options granted
under the 1996 Plan may be either incentive stock options ISOs or
nonqualified stock options. ISOs are intended to qualify as incentive stock
options within the meaning of Section 422 of the Internal Revenue Code. Unless
an option is specifically designated at the time of grant as an ISO, options
under the 1996 Plan will be nonqualified. The exercise price of the options will
be determined by the Committee. The maximum term of an option or Stock
Appreciation Right SAR granted under the 1996 Plan shall not exceed ten
years from the date of grant or five years from the date of grant if the
recipient on the date of grant owns, directly or indirectly, shares possessing
more than 10% of the total combined voting power of all classes of stock of the
Company. No option or SAR may be exercisable sooner than six months from the
date the option or SAR is granted.
The Company has adopted SFAS No. 123, Accounting for Stock-Based
Compensation, for its stock options. SFAS No. 123 requires companies to
estimate the value of all stock-based compensation using a recognized pricing
model. However, it also allows an entity to continue to measure compensation
cost for those plans using the method of accounting prescribed by Accounting
Principles Board APB Opinion No. 25, Accounting for Stock Issued to
Employees. Entities electing to remain with the method of accounting in APB No.
25 must make pro forma disclosures of net income and, if presented, earnings per
share, as if the fair value-based method of accounting defined in the statement
had been applied. The Company has elected to continue to account for options
under APB No. 25.
