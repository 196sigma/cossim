The Board of Directors
Pepsi-Cola Puerto Rico Bottling Company
and Subsidiaries We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of
Pepsi-Cola Puerto Rico Bottling Company and subsidiaries as of
September 30, 1996 and 1995, and the related consolidated
statements of income/loss, shareholders' equity and cash flows
for each of the years in the three-year period ended September
30, 1996.  These consolidated financial statements are the
responsibility of the Company management. Our responsibility
is  to express an opinion on these consolidated financial
statements based on our audits.
We conducted our audits in accordance with generally accepted
auditing standards. Those standards require that we plan and
perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether
the financial statements are free of material misstatement.  An
audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting
the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements.  An
audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and
significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating
the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that
our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to
above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial
position  of  Pepsi-Cola Puerto Rico Bottling Company  and
subsidiaries as of September 30, 1996 and 1995, and the results
of their operations and their cash flows for each of the years in
the three-year period ended September 30, 1996, in conformity
with generally accepted accounting principles.

BAESA of approximately 17%, as of September 30, 1996 and 1995,
is accounted for under the equity method of accounting.  All
balances  and  transactions  have  been  eliminated  in
consolidation, including significant intercompany profit on
assets remaining within the group.
B. Inventories
Inventories are stated at the lower of cost first-in first-
out method or net realizable value.
C. Property, Plant and Equipment
Property, plant and equipment are stated at cost.  Property
and equipment under capital leases are stated at the present
value of minimum lease payments. Depreciation on property,
plant and equipment is calculated using the straight-line
method at rates based on the estimated useful lives of the
related assets. Plant and equipment held under capital leases
and leasehold improvements are amortized straight-line over
the shorter of the lease term or the estimated useful life of
the asset.
The  estimated useful lives in years of the Company
property, plant and equipment are as follows                 37                      Useful Life
Building and Improvements     40
Machinery and Equipment     10 and 15
Plastic returnable bottles     4
Cases and Shells        5 and 10
Furniture and Fixtures     5 to 10
The cost of maintenance and repairs is charged to expenses as
incurred.  The cost of significant renewals and improvements
is added to the carrying amount of the respective fixed
assets. The carrying amounts and accumulated depreciation for
assets sold or retired are eliminated from the respective
accounts and gains or losses realized on disposition are
reflected in the consolidated statement of income/loss.
D. Intangible Assets
The cost in excess of fair value of net assets of companies
acquired in purchase transactions is being amortized on a
straight-line method over its economic life not to exceed 40
years.  In 1996, the Company wrote-off other intangibles of
$624 due to the loss of value of these. In 1994, the Company
wrote off the unamortized portion of the intangible asset
related to the assembled work force, which was in place when
the  Company was purchased in 1987, due to higher than
anticipated employee turnover levels.  The costs had been
scheduled to be amortized over a 12 year period. In 1994, the
Company wrote-off its remaining organizational cost related to
IBMC, due to the dissolution of IBMC after the sale of its net
assets to BAESA see note 8. Other intangibles are also
amortized on a straight-line method over their estimated
useful life. Intangible assets at September 30, 1996 and 1995
are summarized as follows                          1996   1995

The Company periodically reevaluates the recoverability of its
intangible assets as well as their amortization periods to
determine whether an adjustment to the carrying value or a
revision to the estimated useful levies is appropriate.  The
primary indicators of recoverability are the current and
forecasted  operating cash flows which pertain  to  that
particular asset. An entity that has a deficit in its cash
flow from operations for a full fiscal year, in light of the
surrounding economic environment, is viewed by the Company as
a situation which could indicate an impairment of value.
Taking into account the above factors, the Company determines
that an impairment loss has been triggered when the future
projected  undiscounted cash flows  associated  with  the
intangible asset does not exceed its current carrying amount
and the amount of the impairment loss to be recorded is the
difference between the current carrying amount and the future
projected undiscounted cash flows. The Company currently is
generating negative cash flow from operations but believes
that the existing condition is temporary.  Based on the
Company policy, management believes that there  is  no
impairment of value related to the intangible assets as of
September 30, 1996.
E. Investment in BAESA
Investments in less than 50% owned affiliates are accounted
for under the equity method. Under this method of accounting
a proportionate share of profits or losses are recorded as an
increase or reduction of the investments.  In the case of
losses these are recorded to the extent of the amount of the
investment since the Company does not guarantee any of the
debts of the investee nor is committed to provide any further
financial support.
F. Investment Securities
Investment securities at September 30, 1996 consist of short
term discount notes.  The Company classifies its debt and
equity  securities in one of three categories:  trading,
unavailable-for-sale, or held-to-maturity. Trading securities
are bought and held principally for the purpose of selling
them in the near term. Held-to-maturity securities are those
securities in which the Company has the ability and intent to
hold the security until maturity. All other securities not
included in trading or held-to-maturity are classified as
available-for-sale.
Trading and available-for-sale securities are recorded at fair
value.  Held-to-maturity securities are recorded at amortized
cost, adjusted for the amortization or accretion of premiums
or discounts.  Unrealized holding gains and losses on trade
securities are included in earnings. Unrealized holding gains
and losses, net of the related tax effect on available-for-
sale securities are excluded from earnings and are reported as
a separate component of stockholders' equity until realized.
Realized gains and losses from the sale of available-for-sale
securities are determined on a specific identification basis.
A decline in the market value of any available-for-sale or
held-to-maturity security below cost that is deemed to be
other than temporary results in a reduction in carrying amount
to fair value. The impairment is charged to earnings and a
new cost basis for the security is established. Premiums and
discounts are amortized or accredited over the life of the
related held-to-maturity security as an adjustment to yield
using the effective interest method. Dividend and interest
income are recognized when earned.
All of the Company investment securities are considered to
be held-to-maturity.                 39
G. Income Taxes
The Company accounts for income taxes under the provisions of
Statement  of  Financial  Accounting  Standards  No.  109
Statement 109, Accounting form Income Taxes.  Under the
assets and liability method of Statement 109, deferred tax
assets and liabilities are recognized for the estimated future
tax  consequences attributable to differences between the
financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and
liabilities and their respective tax bases.  Deferred tax
assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates in
effect for the year in which those temporary differences are
expected to be recovered or settled. Under Statement 109, the
effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in
tax rates is recognized for income for the period that
includes the enactment date.
H. Cooperative Marketing Agreement
The Company and PepsiCo are required under the franchise
arrangement to spend a specified amount, based on prior
calendar year volume, on the marketing of PepsiCo beverage
products.  The Company and PepsiCo have historically spent
significantly more on marketing than called for by  the
franchise arrangement. Furthermore, the Company and PepsiCo
develop a Cooperative Marketing Agreement CMA on an annual
basis to promote PepsiCo beverage products in the Company
franchise territory. The total amount spent by the Company
and  PepsiCo on advertising pursuant to this cooperative
arrangement in any year is determined by the amount set forth
in that year CMA, which may be adjusted subject to mutual
agreement by the parties. The CMA provides for, among other
things, marketing related asset investments, as well  as
expenditures  for  advertising  and  promotions.  PepsiCo
reimburses the Company for PepsiCo share of the marketing
expenditures, which have been paid directly by the Company.
The  reimbursements  are reflected  in  the  consolidated
statements of income/loss as a reduction of selling and
marketing expenses.
During 1995, the Company implemented Statement of Position No.
93-7, Reporting on Advertising Costs, SOP 93-7, issued
by the Accounting Standards Executive Committee. The adoption
of SOP 93-7 did not have a material effect on the Company
financial position or results of operations.
The Company expenses production costs of advertising the first
time the advertising takes place. All other advertising and
promotional costs are expended when incurred. Advertising and
marketing  expenditures  reflected  in  the  accompanying
consolidated statements of income/loss amount to $11,396,
$4,220 and $3,565 in 1996, 1995 and 1994, respectively.
I. Issuance of BAESA Shares
Increases and decreases in the Company investment in BAESA
resulting from BAESA issuance of newly issued shares are
reflected as adjustments to additional paid-in capital to the
extent that the proceeds to BAESA exceed or are less that the
Company carrying value in the shares.
J. Cash Equivalents
Cash equivalents of $17,647 at September 30, 1996 consist of
discount notes with an initial term of less than three months.
For purposes of the statement of cash flows, the Company
considers all highly liquid debt instruments with original
maturities of three months or less to be cash equivalents.
K. Recapitalization
In  connection  with the Company public offering  the
offering of 7,000,000 Class B common shares in September
1995, the Company changed its capital structure to 5,000,000
authorized shares of $001 par value Class A common shares and
35,000,000 authorized shares of $001 par value Class B common
shares.
40  In connection with the offering, the Company sold 3,500,000
Class  B  common shares while certain of the  principal
shareholders sold 3,500,000 Class B common shares of the
Company.  The shares were sold at $1400 per share.  The
Company did not receive any proceeds from the sale by the
principal shareholder.
On August 14, 1995, the Company Board of Directors declared
a 24,000 to 1 stock split effective concurrently with the
effective date of the Offering. The par value of each share
is $001. A total of $179 was reclassified from the Company
additional paid-in capital account to the Company Class A
and B common share accounts. All share and per share amounts
have been restated to retroactively reflect the stock split.
Earnings/loss per common share is determined by dividing net
income/loss by the weighted average number of common shares
outstanding during each year.
L. Adoption of New Accounting Pronouncement.
During the year ended September 30, 1996, the Company adopted
the provisions of the Financial Accounting Standard Board
Statement No. 121, Accounting for the Impairment of Long-
Lived Assets and for Long-Lived Assets to be Disposed of.
The statement requires that long-lived assets and certain
identifiable intangibles to be held and used by an entity be
reviewed  for impairment whenever events or  changes  in
circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset
may not be recoverable. The Company deems an asset to be
impaired if a forecast of undiscounted future cash flows
directly related to the assets, including disposal value, if
any, is less than its carrying amount.
As a result of the implementation of SFAS No. 121, the Company
revalued certain of its long-lived assets and recorded a non-
cash charge of $1,400. Of the total impairment loss, $600
represent  the impairment of manufacturing equipment  and
furniture, and $800 represent impairment to manufacturing
plant.  Factors leading to the impairment were the Company
decision,  in  mid-1996, to consolidate its manufacturing
activities in its new manufacturing facility, and anticipated
losses  from the disposition of the former manufacturing
facility, and remaining unused equipment.  The amount of
impairment was calculated using a recent appraisal of the
estimated value of the property less estimated costs of
disposition.  The balance at September 30, 1996 remained at
$1,400.

43 Business
BAESA produces, sells and distributes Pepsi Products in
various Argentine provinces, Chile, Uruguay and Costa Rica.
BAESA has been awarded the exclusive rights to produce, sell
and distribute PepsiCo soft drink products in the Southern
Brazil franchise territories and commenced such operations on
December 1, 1994.
Foreign Currency Translation and Transaction
For purposes of preparation of its financial statement, BAESA
uses local currencies as the functional currencies except in
highly inflationary counties such as Brazil and Uruguay.
Assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies other
than  the  functional currency are translated  into  the
functional currency at exchange rates prevailing in  the
exchange market at each balance sheet date.
Results of operations for foreign subsidiaries, other than
those located in highly inflationary countries, are translated
into U.S. dollars using the average exchange rates during the
period, while assets and liabilities are translated into U.S.
dollars using current rates in effect at the balance sheet
date.  Resulting translation adjustments are recorded  as
cumulative  translation  adjustments  in  shareholders'
equity/deficit.  For subsidiaries in highly inflationary
countries, the U.S. dollar is used as the functional currency.
Therefore, non-monetary assets and liabilities are translated
at  historical exchange rates, while monetary assets and
liabilities are translated using the current exchange rate,
results of operations are translated using a combination of
historical and average exchange rates, and all translation
adjustments are reflected in the consolidated statements of
income/loss.
Southern Cone Acquisitions
In November 1993, BAESA acquired from PepsiCo its bottling
operations in Chile and Uruguay and was granted the rights to
produce, sell and distribute PepsiCo soft drink products in
Southern  Brazil  the Southern Cone  acquisitions.  In
connection with the Southern Cone acquisitions, ABA  and
PepsiCo formed BSA. PepsiCo contributed 100% of the capital
stock in its Pepsi Cola bottling and distribution operations
in Chile and Uruguay to BAESA in exchange for 16,372,973 newly
issued Class B shares of common stock of BAESA. Such Class B
Shares are beneficially owned by PepsiCo through BSA.  ABA
contributed 26,859,135 Class A shares of the common stock of
BAESA to BSA in exchange for a general partnership interest in
BSA.
Pursuant to the Partnership Agreement between ABA and PepsiCo
the  Partnership Agreement, the principal  controlling
shareholders of the Company had the right as representatives
of ABA for a period ending not later than December 1, 1999 to
vote all of the BAESA shares held by BSA and by another
shareholder of BAESA.  These shares represent approximately
602% of BAESA outstanding capital stock and approximately
851% of the voting rights outstanding.  Pursuant to the
Partnership Agreement, ABA would cease to be, and PepsiCo
would become the controlling shareholder of BAESA by December
1, 1999.  The transfer of voting control to PepsiCo occurred
on July 1, 1996. For the period that commenced subsequent to
July 1, 1996, the Company does not have access to information
about BAESA financial operations other than the information
about BAESA financial operations other than the information
which is made public by BAESA.
In  November 1994, BAESA entered into an agreement with
Compania Cervecerias Unidas S.A. CCU whereby the soft
drink bottling operations of CCU in Chile were combined with
the operations of Embochile. The formation of this joint
venture  required BAESA to contribute the operations  of
Embochile to the joint venture in addition to the equivalent
of $50,000 to CCU in exchange for 45% interest of the newly
created joint venture. In addition, BAESA has the option to                 44  acquire and additional 4% interest of the joint venture for
$14,000.  The investment is accounted for under the equity
method  by  BAESA.  This transaction resulted  in  BAESA
recognizing an excess of cost over fair value of asset
acquired of approximately $60,200. In connection with this
agreement with CCU, BAESA made a capital contribution of
$1,800 to Embochile during October 1994. BAESA paid $10,000
of the total required payment, the remaining balance of
$40,000 is to be paid over the next four years. The shares of
Embochile serve as collateral for the outstanding required
payment.
Brazil
BAESA,  pursuant to the Southern Cone acquisitions,  was
scheduled to receive various franchise rights for the Southern
brazilian States of Rio de Janeiro, Rio Grande do sul, Santa
Catarina, Sao Paulo and Parana as they became available
between September 1994 and November 1996. However, BAESA and
the previous company holding such franchise rights to produce,
sell  and  distribute PepsiCo products in  the  southern
Brazilian territories, reached an agreement to accelerate,
subject to certain terms and conditions, BAESA operation of
PepsiCo bottling franchises in all of the southern Brazilian
franchise territories to December 1, 1994.  BAESA agreed to
purchase certain assets from the previous franchise holder,
including returnable glass bottles, plastic cases and certain
other assets.  BAESA paid $57,000 under the agreement, of
which $22,000 was paid in December 1993, $2,900 in September
1994 and the balance during fiscal year 1995. The $24,000
deposit has been classified as a prepayment and therefore in
other assets in BAESA balance sheet as of September 30,
1994.  Total start-up expenses incurred in Brazil amounted to
$7,040 and $3,162 in 1994 and 1995, respectively.
On May 16, 1995, PepsiCo, and BAESA signed an Amendment
Agreement  the  Amendment to the  original  franchise
agreements between the parties. Pursuant to the Amendment,
effective on January 1, 2000, PepsiCo will increase the
concentrate price for PepsiCo products for the Southern Brazil
territories to 20% of net wholesale selling price NWSP.
In addition, pursuant to the Amendment, PepsiCo will grant
BAESA the franchise rights for the majority of the Minas
Gerais region in Brazil effective March 25, 1996.  The
concentrate price of the Minas Gerais territory shall be 20%
of NWSP as soon as BAESA takes over this territory.
Income Taxes
BAESA accounts for income taxes pursuant to Statement 109.
Income taxes is calculated separately for BAESA and each of
its subsidiaries as required by the tax laws in which BAESA
and its subsidiaries operate. The difference between the
computed expected tax expense based on statutory tax rates of
each country of operation and the effective income tax rate in
mainly attributable to the recognition of benefits arising
from tax leases and the effect of indexing for inflation for
tax purposes. The statutory tax rate in many of the countries
in which BAESA operates is lower than the U.S. statutory tax
rate.
Cooperative Marketing Agreement
BAESA and each of this bottling subsidiaries participate with
PepsiCo in a CMA on an annual basis to market and promote
PepsiCo beverage products in BAESA franchise territories.
The CMA provides for among other things, marketing related
asset investments, as well as expenditures for advertising and
promotions.  PepsiCo reimburses BAESA for PepsiCo share of
marketing expenditures. These reimbursements are reflected on
BAESA consolidated statements of income/loss as reduction
of selling and marketing expenses.
During 1995, BAESA adopted SOP 93-7. The adoption of SOP 93-7
did not have a material effect on BAESA financial position
or results of operations.
Issuance of BAESA Shares
In 1994, BAESA completed a secondary public offering national
and international whereby 58 million previously unissued
Class B common shares of BAESA were sold at $1725 per share.
Concurrent with this public offering, PCPRB sold 13 million
shares of Class B common shares of BAESA. The total proceeds
to BAESA from the offering was $138,133, net of underwriting
commissions and related expenses. PCPRB recognized a gain of
$15,924 attributable to the difference between PCPRB'S basis
of its interest in BAESA and the proceeds from the sale.                 45  Furthermore, PCPRB increased additional paid in capital by
$19,935 net of tax effect, attributable to the sale of the 58
million Class B shares mentioned above and the issuance of
16,372,973 Class B shares in conjunction with the Southern
Cone acquisition, representing the difference between the
Company equity interest in BAESA after the issuance of
shares and the historical book value of its interest in BAESA.
NOTE 6 - NOTES PAYABLE TO BANK AND LONG TERM DEBT
In November 1994, the Company and its subsidiaries entered into a
credit Agreement with Banco Popular.  The Credit Agreement
provides for borrowing by the Company from time to time of $5
million in revolving loans, $88 million in term loans and $15
million in non-revolving loans. In December 1995, Banco Popular
increased the amount the Company may borrow under revolving loans
to $100 million. As of September 30, 1996, the Company had
outstanding under the Credit Agreement revolving loans in an
aggregate principal amount of $100 million, term loan aggregate
principal amount of $60 million and non-revolving loans in an
aggregate principal amount of $100 million, term loan aggregate
principal amount of $60 million and non-revolving loans in
aggregate principal amount of $150 million. These loans mature
on March 30, 1997, September 10, 2000 and January 10, 1997
respectively, and bear interest at a floating rate of 2% over and
above the cost of Banco Popular of 936 funds or LIBOR lending
rates ranging from 664% to 727%. The Agreement contains
various covenants and events of default typical of a credit
facility agreement of this size and nature, including additional
debt restrictions and maintaining a minimum level of tangible net
worth. As of September 30, 1996, the Company was not in
compliance with some of these covenants but had obtained a waiver
from the lending institution.
Long-term debt consists of the following at September 30, 1996
and 1995   Term Loan of $6,000 in 1996 and $8,800 in        
1995 to Banco Popular, payable in 78     1996   1995
monthly payments of $128 excluding            interest, refinanced under the above    
mentioned Agreement. Interest is payable

The Company is negotiating the refinancing of its credit facility
to include a payment schedule which more closely matches the life
of its productive assets.                 46 NOTE 7 - INCOME TAXES
PCPRB and its subsidiaries are subject to U.S. Federal income
taxes; however, each has elected the benefit of Section 936 the
U.S. Internal Revenue Code. Section 936 presently allows the
Company a tax credit equal to a portion of the amount of U.S.
income  tax expense attributable to earnings derived  from
operations  within  Puerto Rico and to  certain  qualified
investments maintained in Puerto Rico subject  to  certain
limitations.  The tax credit against U.S. income taxes on
possession business income, as computed under current law, is
subject to one of two limitations to be chosen by PCPRB and its
subsidiaries, the Economic Activity Limitation or a credit of 55%
in 1996 and lesser in subsequent years down to 40% in 1998 of
their taxable income. PCPRB and its subsidiaries elected the
Economic Activity Limitation to calculate their 1995 and future
Section 936 credits. However, the Small Business Job Protection
Act of 1996 repealed Section 936 and provided for a 10-year
phaseout period. During the phaseout period, the Section 936
credit must be computed under the Economic Activity Limitation.
In addition, during the taxable years commencing after December
31, 2001, the Section 936 credit will be subject to a net income
limitation.  In order to utilize income tax credits available
under Section 936 each company is required to derive at least 80%
of its gross income from sources within Puerto Rico, and at least
75% of gross income must be gross income must be from an active
trade or business in Puerto Rico. Distributing, Manufacturing
and BEV were in compliance with these gross income requirements
for the years ended September 30, 1996 and 1995. However, PCPRB
did not meet these gross income requirements for the years ended
September 30, 1996 and 1995 and, therefore is not allowed the
benefit of Section 936 for such years.
The Company was granted, effective October 1988, a ten-year tax
exemption for its plastic preforms manufacturing and sales
operations BEV, pursuant to the provisions to the Puerto rico
Tax Incentives Act of 1987 for certain net industrial development
income. Under the terms of the grant, the Company received a 90%
exemption from Puerto Rico income tax. The Company also received
a full exemption from Puerto Rico income and municipal tax on
interest, rents, dividends and other investments and was granted
a 60% exemption from municipal tax and a 90% exemption from
property tax. In exchange for these tax exemptions, the Company
agreed to manufacture plastic preforms and plastic bottles,
employ a minimum number of persons and maintain equipment and
facilities in Puerto Rico.

operations, except for $102 of the September 30, 1995 balance
which will be allocated to equity in net earnings of BAESA.
On December 31, 1993, PCPRB manufacturing and distributing
divisions were contributed to two newly formed subsidiaries,
Manufacturing and Distributing. PCPRB Puerto Rico tax net
operating loss carryforwards followed the respective assets of
the divisions.  During the year ended September 30, 1996,
Manufacturing utilized $3,819 of the prior year Puerto Rican net
operating loss carryforwards.                 49 Deferred tax benefits for the federal and Puerto Rican tax net
operating  loss  carryforwards of PCPRB, Manufacturing  and
Distributing have been partially reserved because realization of
that benefit for tax purposes is dependent upon the existence of
future  taxable  income.  At September  30,  1996,  PCPRB,
Manufacturing  and  Distributing have  net  operating  loss
carryforwards for federal tax purposes of $24,667, which expire
in 2011, and for Puerto Rican income tax purposes as follows Amount                 Year of Expiration

For U.S. income tax purposes, ABA and BSA are considered
partnerships and, as a result, do not pay income tax on their
income.  ABA and BSA income gains, losses deductions and
credits flow-through and are recognized proportionately by their
partners on their U.S. income tax return.  Therefore, a tax
provision was not computed on ABA and BSA income.
NOTE 8 - RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS
The following are transactions between PCPRB and BAESA that took
place during the years ended September 30, 1996, 1995 and 1994.

Sale of preforms to BAESA, including   
guaranteed payments.  $2,235  4,419  4,852
Charges from PCPRB to BAESA

Sale of property and equipment and other  
-    -   935
Sale of machinery to unconsolidated      
affiliate of BAESA.    -   208    Charges by BAESA to PCPRB for management

PCPRB sold preforms to BAESA pursuant to a long-term supply
contract.  In management opinion, the terms of this long-term
supply contract were reasonable and, at the time such contract
was entered into, no other comparable long-term supply contract
was available to BAESA from an unrelated interest due to the
hyperinflationary conditions in Argentina at the time.  This
contract was terminated subsequent to September 30, 1996.  As
part of the negotiation which led to the cancellation of the long-
term preforms supply contract, outstanding obligations of the
Company to BAESA and its subsidiaries amounting to $2,065,063
were settled for a cash payment of $50,000. In addition, the
Company  was relieved from obligations related to  certain
operating leases. This transaction was accounted for as a gain
on the early termination of a supply Agreement.
50 The following are transactions between PCPRB and subsidiaries,
including ABA, with other related parties for the years ended
September 30, 1996, 1995 and 1994 Accounts receivable other includes, $40 and $80 at September 30,
1996 and 1995, respectively, due from two partners of ABA.
As of January 1, 1995, the Company entered into an agreement with
a shareholder and former director who was to provide construction
management services for approximately $200. No amounts were paid
as of September 30, 1995 related to these services. During 1996
$151 was paid under this agreement no additional payments are
contemplated.
PCPRB paid approximately $2,105, $2,700 and $4,400 during 1995
and 1994, respectively in advertising fees to a firm controlled
by a shareholder of the Company.
PCPRB paid approximately, $232 and $350 during 1995 and 1994,
respectively for consulting fees to a shareholder of BAESA and a
former director of the Company.
Certain members of the Company Board of Directors and certain
of its executive officers were also directors and/or officers of
BAESA until approximately the end of June 1996.
Pursuant to the terms of a ten-year Voting Trust Agreement five
year initial term and renewal option for a second five-year term
and a related Stock Option Agreement, the 5,000,000 Class A
shares authorized and outstanding were placed into a voting
trust, the trustee of which is the present President of the
Company, who has the unrestricted right to vote such shares for a
period of ten years. The voting trust provides the President of
the Company with an indemnity and hold harmless with respect to
his duties and functions as trustee. The President may terminate
the Voting Trust at his will. Pursuant to the Stock Option
Agreement, the President of the Company has the right to purchase
the aforementioned 5,000,000 Class A Shares, for the exclusive
benefit of the Company, within a period of two years ending on
September 28, 1998, at a price of $1 per share.
PCPRB paid or assumed approximately $133 in 1996, for legal fees
incurred by the President and the Chairman of the Board of
Directors in connection with the issues in litigation involving
the Company and certain of its directors, and the issues relating
to the Stock Option Agreements and the Voting Stock Agreement
approved by the Board of Directors.
NOTE 9 - BUSINESS AND CREDIT CONCENTRATIONS
Financial  instruments,  which  subject  the  company  to
concentrations of credit risk consist primarily  of  trade
receivables.  Most of the Company customers are located in
Puerto Rico. Two customers accounted for approximately 28% of
the Company sales during 1996, 1995 and 1994.  Although the
Company exposure to credit risk associated with non payments by
customers is affected by conditions for occurrences with Puerto
Rico, that risk is mitigated by the large number of entities
comprising the Company customer base. As of September 30,
1996, no single receivable from a customer exceeded 15% of the
company trade receivables at that date. The Company reviews a
customer credit history before extending credit. The Company
establishes an allowance for doubtful accounts based upon factors
surrounding the credit risk of specific customers, historical
trend, and other information.
NOTE 10 - PENSION PLANS
The Company has two separate non-contributory defined benefit
pension plans covering eligible salaried and hourly employees of
the company and its subsidiaries in Puerto Rico. The benefits
under the salaried employees' plan are based on years of serviced
and the employees' average earnings during the last five years of
employment.  The benefits under the hourly employees' plan are
based on a fixed amount times years/credit service.  The
Company funding policy is to make the annual contributions as                 51 required by applicable regulations. Contributions are intended
to provide for benefits attributed to service to date as well as
for those expected to be earned in the future. Both plans are
insured by the Pension benefit Guarantee Corporation.  This
insurance requires all members of the controlled group to be
jointly  and  severally liable for  the  unfunded  pension
obligations. The only event that may trigger a full payment of
the unfunded liability is a plan termination which management
believes is a remote possibility.
In accordance with the provisions of Accounting Standards Board
Statement No. 87, Employers Accounting for Pensions, the
Company recognized an additional minimum liability, computed as
the excess of the accumulated benefit obligation over the fair
value of plan assets of $1,388 and $1,592 at September 30, 1996
and 1995 respectively, with a related intangible asset limited
to the unrecognized prior service cost of the related plans of
$23 and $48 at September 30, 1996 and 1995 respectively, with the
remainder being reflected as an adjustment to shareholders'
equity.
The following table sets forth the funded status of the plans and
amounts recognized in the balance sheet at September 30, 1996 and
1995.
1996   1995

1995 $2,593 and $2,871 respectively, long
term                      $2,776  $3,127
Net pension expense for 1996 and 1995 included          
the following components  Service cost for benefits earned during the   
period                     $160   $150
Interest cost on projected benefit obligation   518   496
Actual return on plan assets           533  187
Net amortization and deferral           442    82
Net periodic pension cost            $587   $541
The actuarial present value of the projected benefit obligation
was determined using a weighted-average discount rate of 7% at
September 30, 1996 and 1995 and an expected long-term rate of
return on plan assets of 9% for the two years.  The rate of
increase in future compensation levels for the salaried plan was
4%.  The cost of retroactive benefits resulting from plan
amendments is amortized over the future worklife expectancy of
the active participants.                 52 NOTE 11 - STOCK OPTION PLANS
The Company is in the process of establishing two Stock Option
Plans, subject to the approval by the Board of Directors and the
shareholders of the Company, for the granting of stock options to
purchase Class B Shares to certain employees and directors of the
Company and its affiliates who have serviced in such capacities
for at least one year prior to the date the options are granted.
It is expected that all officers and directors and other
employees of the Company and its affiliates will be eligible to
participate under this stock option plan, as deemed appropriate
by the Company Board of Directors. One of these stock option
plans will be qualified for income tax purposes, whereas, the
other will not be a qualified plan. The stock option plan that
will be qualified for income tax purposes will have exercise
prices not less than the fair market value of the Class B shares
at the date of grant; the exercise prices in the non-qualified
stock option plan may be less than the fair market value of the
Class B shares at the date of grant. Subsequent to September 30,
1996, the Company granted an option to the President of the
Company to acquire 190,000 shares to under the qualified plan,
subject to the constitution and approval of the plans by the
Board of Directors and shareholders of the Company. These plans
replace a stock option plan that existed and was terminated
during 1996.
The Company has granted another stock option to the President of
the Company to acquire 1,516,667 Class B Shares of the Company,
at an exercise price of $5 a share. This stock option will be
exercisable in whole or in part until exercised in full.  A
similar option previously granted to the former president of the
Company was cancelled during 1996.

In 1991 the Company entered into an agreement with the Puerto
Rico Aqueduct and Sewer Authority PRASA to invest approximately
$15,000 to build a new bottling facility and waste water
treatment plant.  The Company is required to pay utilities
surcharges of approximately $13 per month until the new facility
is operational.
B.  Legal Proceedings
The Company is a defendant in nine putative class actions
alleging federal securities violations by the Company and various
officers and directors of the Company. Plaintiffs in all actions
seek  unspecified money damages except one case in  which
plaintiffs seek rescissory or compensatory damages that are
alleged to be estimated in excess of $70,000, together with
judgement declaring null and void the sale of the Company
common shares initially sold to the public in the Company
September 19, 1995 initial public offering and all subsequent
trading in such shares.
The Company intends to contest the cases vigorously.  No
discovery has been taken in any of the actions.  It is not
possible at this early stage of the proceedings to determine the
likelihood and amount of the possible loss if any.
In November 1995, the Company obtained directors, officers and
entity liability insurance coverage.  The Company has been
recently advised by the insurance carrier that based on the 
allegations contained in the complaints relating to the lawsuits 
filed against the Company, the insurance carrier although not
implying that it believes such allegations to be true now 
believes that certain of the claims appear not to be covered by 
the policies, and that other claims may also not be covered. 
The Company intends to vigorously contest this interpretation 
of the policy by the insurance carrier, but there can be no
assurance that any coverage ultimately will be available to the
Company under the policy with respect to some or all of the 
claims under these or any similar lawsuits.
NOTE 13 - FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS
The carrying amounts of cash and cash equivalents, accounts
receivable, accounts payable, bank loans and overdrafts, accrued
payroll, taxes and other current liabilities approximate fair
value because of the short maturity of these instruments.
The  fair value of each of the Company long-term  debt
instruments is based on the amount of future cash  flows
associated with each instrument discounted using the company
current borrowing rate for similar debt instruments of comparable
maturity.  The carrying amounts approximate the estimated fair
value at September 30, 1996.                 54 The Company currently does not hold any derivatives.
Under the equity method, the Company investment in BAESA has
been reduced to zero. At September 30, 1996, such investment has
an estimated fair value of $35,500 determined using a basis The
New York Stock Exchange quoted closing value per share on that
date.
NOTE - 14 INTANGIBLE AND FIXED ASSET WRITE-OFFS
In 1996, the Company recorded a non-cash charge of approximately
$600 in order to write-off an intangible.
In 1994, the Company recorded a charge of approximately $2,900 in
order to write-off approximately $1,000 of certain intangibles
and approximately $1,900 of fixed assets.                 55 Item 1.    1
