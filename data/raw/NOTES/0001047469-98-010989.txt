NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
DOLLARS IN THOUSANDS, EXCEPT PER SHARE AMOUNTS
1. NATURE OF BUSINESS AND SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
BASIS OF PRESENTATION
The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Planet
Hollywood International, Inc. PHI and its wholly and majority owned
subsidiaries collectively, the Company. All material intercompany
transactions and accounts have been eliminated in consolidation. The Company has
interests in various entities which are not majority owned or controlled. The
Company uses the equity method to account for these interests.
The Company fiscal year is the 52 or 53 weeks ending the Sunday closest to
December 31. The fiscal years ended December 31, 1995, December 29, 1996 and
December 28, 1997 are herein referred to as fiscal 1995, fiscal 1996 and
fiscal 1997, respectively. All years presented herein are 52 week years.
DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS
The Company primary business is to create and develop consumer brands. To
date, the Company has promoted its brands primarily through the operation of
distinctive entertainment-oriented theme restaurants and their associated
merchandise sales. The Company currently operates under the PLANET HOLLYWOOD and
OFFICIAL ALL STAR CAFE brands. Direct revenues in the accompanying financial
statements include sales of food, beverage and merchandise.
CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS
Cash and cash equivalents are defined as highly liquid investments with
original maturities of three months or less and consist of amounts held as bank
deposits and certificates of deposit.
INVENTORIES
Inventories, consisting primarily of merchandise, are valued at the lower of
cost determined by the first-in, first-out method or market.
PREOPENING COSTS
The Company capitalizes costs relating to opening of units and amortizes
such costs over the twelve months following the opening date of the unit.
PROPERTY AND EQUIPMENT
Property and equipment are stated at cost, less accumulated depreciation.
Depreciation is provided for by using the straight-line method over the
following useful lives:
YEARS
Furniture and     5-10
20
Leasehold     5-40

DOLLARS IN THOUSANDS, EXCEPT PER SHARE AMOUNTS
1. NATURE OF BUSINESS AND SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES CONTINUED
Expenditures for additions and improvements which extend the life of the
assets are capitalized. Expenditures for normal repairs and maintenance are
charged to expense as incurred. Depreciation of memorabilia commences when it is
placed in service upon its installation at a unit location.
GOODWILL
The excess of purchase price over the fair value of assets acquired is
amortized on a straight-line basis over 20 years. Accumulated amortization of
goodwill at December 29, 1996 and December 28, 1997 was $1,028 and $2,393,
respectively.
DEBT ISSUANCE COSTS
Costs related to the issuance of debt are capitalized and amortized to
interest expense using the effective interest method over the term of the
related debt.
MINORITY INTERESTS
Minority interests represent third parties' equity in the earnings or losses
in the entities which are majority owned by the Company.
FOOD, BEVERAGE AND MERCHANDISE REVENUES
Food, beverage and merchandise revenues are recognized as the products are
sold to customers.
FRANCHISE AND ROYALTY REVENUES
Revenues from the sale of franchises are deferred until the Company fulfills
its obligations under the franchise agreement, which is generally upon the
opening of a franchise restaurant or merchandise shop. The franchise agreements
provide for continuing royalty fees based on a percentage of gross receipts.
ADVERTISING AND PROMOTIONAL COSTS
All costs associated with advertising and promoting the Company brands are
expensed in the period incurred. Advertising expense for fiscal 1995, 1996 and
1997 totaled $2,103, $2,753 and $6,309, respectively.
INCOME TAXES
Deferred taxes are provided for the tax effects of the differences between
the carrying value of assets and liabilities for tax and financial reporting
purposes. These differences relate primarily to differences in depreciable lives
and amortization periods for property and equipment and preopening costs,
deferred rentals, the timing of franchise revenue recognition, net operating
losses, certain accrued expenses and reserves. Deferred tax assets and
liabilities represent the future tax consequence of those differences.
No provision is made for United States income taxes applicable to
undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries or affiliates that are
indefinitely reinvested in the foreign operations.

FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSLATION
Assets and liabilities of foreign operations are translated into United
States dollars at the year-end rate of exchange. Revenue and expense accounts
are translated at the average rate of exchange. Resulting translation
adjustments are included in the caption Cumulative currency translation
adjustment as a separate component of stockholders' equity. Gains and losses
from foreign currency transactions which are included in the consolidated
statements of operations were not material.
STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION
The Company accounts for compensation costs related to employee stock
options and other forms of employee stock-based compensation plans in accordance
with the requirements of Accounting Principles Board Opinion 25 APB 25. APB
25 requires compensation costs for stock-based compensation plans to be
recognized based on the difference, if any, between the fair market value of the
stock on the date of grant and the option exercise price. In October 1995, the
Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Statement of Financial Accounting
Standards No. 123, ACCOUNTING FOR STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION SFAS 123. SFAS
123 established a fair value-based method of accounting for compensation costs
related to stock options and other forms of stock-based compensation plans.
However, SFAS 123 allows an entity to continue to measure compensation costs
using the principles of APB 25 if certain pro forma disclosures are made. The
Company adopted the provisions for pro forma disclosure requirements of SFAS
123.
Options granted to celebrities and other non-employees are recorded at their
estimated fair value at the date of grant and the expense is recognized over the
periods benefitted, generally 5 years.
EARNINGS PER SHARE
The Company adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 128,
Earnings Per Share in the fourth quarter of 1997. As a result of this
adoption, the Company has restated all periods presented in these financial
statements to reflect basic and diluted earnings per share. Basic earnings
per share is computed by dividing net income by the weighted average number of
common shares outstanding for the period. Diluted earnings per share is computed
by dividing net income by the weighted average number of common shares
outstanding plus common stock equivalents related to stock options for each
period.
A reconciliation of weighted average number of common shares to weighted
average number of common shares plus common stock equivalents is as follows:
1995    1996    1997
Weighted average number of common shares.   80,000  100,741  108,465
Stock options and     399   1,849   1,340
1,834   --                                         Weighted average number of common shares plus common stock
82,233  102,590  109,805
Options to purchase 3 million shares of common stock were not included in
the computation of diluted earnings per common share in fiscal 1997 because the
option exercise price was greater than the average market price of the common
stock.

agreements, primarily unit sites. Unit leases are established using a base
amount and/or a percentage of sales. Certain of these leases provide for
escalating lease payments over the terms of the leases. For financial statement
purposes, the total amount of base rentals over the terms of the leases is
charged to expense on the straight-line method over the lease terms. Rental
expense in excess of lease payments is recorded as a deferred rental liability.
FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS
The carrying value of cash, cash equivalents, receivables and accounts
payable approximate the fair value because of the short maturity of these
instruments. The carrying value of notes payable approximate fair value as
interest rates vary with market interest rates.
USE OF ESTIMATES
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally
accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and
assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and
disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial
statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the
reporting period. Estimates are used in the determination of allowances for
doubtful accounts, impairment of long-lived assets, depreciation and
amortization, and taxes, among others. Actual results could differ from those
estimates.
RECLASSIFICATIONS
Certain reclassifications have been made in the prior years' consolidated
financial statements to conform with the fiscal 1997 presentation.
2. IMPAIRMENT OF LONG LIVED ASSETS
Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 121, Accounting for the
Impairment of Long-Lived Assets and for Long-Lived Assets to be Disposed of
SFAS 121, was implemented by the Company in fiscal 1996. SFAS 121 states
that if the carrying value of an asset, including associated intangibles,
exceeds the sum of estimated undiscounted cash flows from the operation of the
asset, an impairment loss should be recognized for the difference between the
asset estimated fair value and carrying value.
As a result of operating losses incurred in fiscal 1997 and projected to
continue at certain restaurant units, the Company recorded a non-cash impairment
charge of $487 million related to a write-down of long-lived assets relating to
these non-performing domestic and foreign restaurant units. The Company
considers continued and projected operating losses or significant and long-term
changes in market conditions to be its primary indicators of potential
impairment. An impairment was recognized as the future undiscounted cash flows
for these units were estimated to be insufficient to recover the related
carrying value of the long-lived assets relating to the units. As a result, the
carrying values of these assets were written down to their estimated fair
values, based on the Company estimates of future discounted cash flows.

3. ACQUISITIONS AND DIVESTITURES
In August 1995, the Company entered into an agreement whereby the Company
purchased a 579% interest in All Star Cafe, Inc. All Star for $567 from the
Company President, who is a stockholder of All Star, and the All Star Cafe
Trust the Trust, a trust established for the benefit of the President
children collectively the Sellers.
The acquisition of the 579% interest in All Star was accounted for using
the purchase method of accounting and the purchase price was allocated to the
assets acquired and the liabilities assumed based on their fair values at the
date of acquisition. The excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the
net assets acquired of $738 was recorded as goodwill.
In February 1996, the Company entered into an agreement to acquire the
remaining minority interests in All Star. Under the terms of the agreement, the
Company issued 11,545,706 shares of Class B non-voting stock in exchange for all
of the minority interests in All Star. Due to the high degree of common control
between the Company and All Star and the lack of an exchange of monetary
consideration, the acquisition was accounted for as a reorganization of entities
under common control. Accordingly, the bases of All Star assets and
liabilities are carried at historical cost.
The following unaudited pro forma information has been prepared assuming
that the acquisition of All Star took place at the beginning of fiscal 1995. The
unaudited pro forma financial information does not purport to be indicative of
the results of operations had the transaction been effected at the beginning of
fiscal 1995, nor to project results for any future period:

During 1996, the Company acquired the remaining minority interests in PH
London and the minority interests in the Company subsidiaries that operate
Planet Hollywood units in Maui, Washington D.C. and New York. These acquisitions
were accounted for using the purchase method of accounting and the purchase
price was allocated to the assets purchased and the liabilities assumed based on
their fair values at the date of acquisition. The excess of the purchase price
over the fair value of the net assets acquired was $23,090 and has been recorded
as goodwill which is being amortized on a straight line basis over twenty years.
The results of operations for All Star, PH London and the minority interests
in Maui, Washington D.C. and New York after their respective acquisition dates
are included in the consolidated statement of operations.

In January 1997, the Company acquired the net assets of a domestic franchise
unit for $8,000. The acquisition was accounted for using the purchase method of
accounting and the purchase price was allocated to the assets purchased and
liabilities assumed based on their fair values at the date of acquisition. The
excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the net assets acquired 5,835, was recorded as goodwill and is being amortized on a straight-line basis
over twenty years.
In December 1994, the Company purchased the PLANET HOLLYWOOD Cancun unit
from a former franchisee see Note 5 for $5,600. The purchase was funded by a
$4,600 bank loan. In July 1995, the Cancun unit was sold to an affiliated
company, ECE, S.A. de C.V. ECE for net book value $1,000 and the

5. INVESTMENT IN UNCONSOLIDATED AFFILIATES
The Company investments in affiliated companies which are not majority
owned or controlled are accounted for using the equity method.
In January 1995, the Company obtained a 50% equity interest in PH Asia,
which operates and franchises PLANET HOLLYWOOD and OFFICIAL ALL STAR units in
the Pacific Rim. The remaining interest in PH Asia is owned by an entity
controlled by a company in which a director of the Company is a major
stockholder.
In July 1995, the Company acquired a 20% equity interest in ECE for $5,000.
ECE operates themed restaurant/retail units in Mexico see Notes 3 and 9. At
the acquisition date, the Company share of the underlying net assets of ECE
exceeded the investment by $2,900. The excess is being amortized over 20 years.
A director of the Company is also a principal stockholder of ECE. In January
1997, ECE issued 21,587,145 shares of common stock in an initial public offering
in Mexico. The Company purchased 4,317,429 shares for $6,050 in order to retain
its 20% equity interest in ECE.
In September 1997, the Company entered into a venture to remodel and
renovate the Hotel Pennsylvania in New York City. During 1997, the Company
advanced the venture $96 million and estimates that total funding requirements
for its 20% equity investment in the venture will be $20 million. The renovated
hotel will be branded the OFFICIAL ALL STAR HOTEL, and the Company will receive
royalties for the use of its OFFICIAL ALL STAR HOTEL trademark.
In December 1997, the Company entered into a venture to construct a
50-story, 560-room movie-themed hotel in New York City. During 1997, the Company
contributed $50 million to the venture and estimates that its total funding
requirements for its 20% equity investment in the venture will be $70 million.
In addition to participation in the hotel profits through its equity interest
in the venture, the Company will receive a license fee for the use of the Planet
Hollywood name and logo. A PLANET HOLLYWOOD restaurant will be constructed in
the lobby of the hotel. The Company has entered into a $35 million LIBOR-based
leveraged lease for this facility. The lease has a base term of three years and
can be extended up to 21 years.

Company incurred a one-time extraordinary charge of $104 million, net of $59
million in taxes, as a result of the early extinguishment of the 1995 Notes.
In September 1997, the Company replaced its existing $50 million credit
facility with a multi-currency, long-term credit facility with a consortium of
financial institutions. This facility consists of a $100 million revolving
credit facility and a $20 million term loan facility. The credit agreement
carries a commitment fee of 25% on the unused amount of the revolving credit
portion. Interest rates are variable, with either prime or LIBOR indexes. At
December 28, 1997, the Company weighted average rate on outstanding borrowings
under the facility was 696%. The revolving credit facility matures in September
2000, while the term loan facility matures in 1999. During 1997, the Company
drew $42 million under the revolving credit facility. The credit facility also
provides for the Company to have up to $10 million in letters of credit. At
December 28, 1997, the Company had outstanding letters of credit totaling $58
million.
Under the terms of the credit facility, the Company is required to meet
certain minimum quarterly net worth, interest coverage and various other
financial ratios. At December 28, 1997, the Company was in violation of one of
the financial covenants. In March 1998, the lenders modified the covenant and
the Company was in compliance with the revised covenants at December 28, 1997.
In fiscal 1996, notes due to stockholders totaling $70,750 were repaid from
the proceeds of the initial public offering of stock.
During fiscal 1995, the principal stockholders or their affiliates advanced
or guaranteed various loans and credit facilities to the Company totaling
$21,600. These borrowings were repaid with proceeds of the 1995 Notes. During

to interest expense under these loans.
During fiscal 1995, 1996 and 1997, approximately $12,661, $6,093 and $2,555,
respectively, was charged to interest expense and approximately $834, $1,098 and
$2,555 in fiscal 1995, 1996 and 1997, respectively, of interest was capitalized.

participation agreement with an employee dated January 1, 1994. The shares are
restricted and cannot be transferred or sold unless the Company waives its right
of first refusal to purchase any shares. The shares are subject to forfeiture by
the employee in the event the employee is no longer employed by the Company. The
forfeiture restriction lapses generally over a five year period. The shares were
valued at their estimated market value totaling $1,100. Compensation expense is
recognized over the vesting period. Deferred compensation expense has been
reflected as a reduction of stockholders' equity.
In April 1996, the Company completed an initial public offering of
12,406,452 shares of common stock at an offering price of $1800 per share,
including 1,618,233 shares from the exercise of the Underwriters' over allotment

Common Stock to certain celebrities. The restrictions lapse over a period of
years, generally three to four years. The shares were valued at their estimated
market value totaling $40 million. Compensation expense is recognized ratably
over the period benefitted. Deferred compensation expense has been reflected as
a reduction of stockholders equity.
REDEEMABLE WARRANTS
In connection with the issuance of the 1995 Notes see Note 7, the Company
issued warrants to purchase up to 5,112,765 shares of common stock at an
exercise price of $001 per share. The proceeds of the offering were allocated

warrants were subject to increase or decrease by up to 50% based upon the total
rate of return to the holders upon repayment of

the 1995 Notes, including the fair value of the warrants at the date they become
exercisable or are deemed exercised. The warrants became exercisable upon the
repayment of the 1995 Notes. The number of warrants which may be exercised were
reduced by 50% to 2,556,383 based upon the total rate of return to the holders
at the date of repayment of the 1995 Notes. In connection with the initial
public offering of stock in fiscal 1996, warrants to purchase 788,219 shares
were exercised. In 1996, the Company registered the shares issued upon the
exercise of the remaining warrants.

to be available. In May 1997, the 1995 Stock Plan was amended to provide for
6,000,000 shares of Class A common stock to be available. Under the 1995 Stock

of four years and expire five years from the date of grant.
During 1995, the Board of Directors adopted the 1995 Celebrity Stock Option
Award and Incentive Plan 1995 Celebrity Plan. The 1995 Celebrity Plan calls
for up to 4,000,000 shares of the Class A common stock to be available for
issuance upon the exercise of options and stock appreciation rights. In October
1996, the 1995 Celebrity Plan was amended to provide for 6,000,000 shares of

Accordingly, no compensation expense has been recognized for the 1995 Stock
Plan. Had compensation cost for the 1995 Stock Plan been determined based on the

The fair value of each option is estimated on the date of grant using the
Black Scholes option pricing model with the following weighted-average
assumptions for grants in 1995, 1996 and 1997: no dividend yield for all three
years; expected volatility of 33% in 1995 and 1996, 40% in 1997; risk free rates
of 595% in 1995 and 1996, 570% in 1997; and expected lives of 4 years for all
periods presented. The weighted-average fair value of options granted during
each year was $163, $683, and $632 for fiscal 1995, 1996 and 1997,
respectively.
9. FRANCHISE REVENUES
The Company has an agreement with PH Asia, whereby PH Asia was granted the
right to license the PLANET HOLLYWOOD name and rights within a number of
countries, primarily in the Pacific Rim. In 1996, PH Asia opened or franchised
four units, and the Company received the initial franchise fee revenue for three
of the units. In 1997, PH Asia opened or franchised eight units, and the Company
received the initial franchise fee revenue for five of the units.
During 1995, the Company entered into a franchise agreement with ECE, an
affiliated company see Note 5, which allows ECE to develop and operate up to
five PLANET HOLLYWOOD units and up to ten OFFICIAL ALL STAR CAFE units in
Mexico. Upon Company approval, ECE may open an additional five PLANET HOLLYWOOD
units. In 1996, ECE opened 5 units. No units were opened in 1997. ECE pays
continuing royalty fees as defined in the agreement.
In December 1995, the Company terminated the site franchise agreement of an
existing franchisee and purchased the franchise rights to four undeveloped
locations. The Company assumed certain liabilities and lease obligations
relating to the four undeveloped locations. In consideration for the franchise
rights, the Company will pay the seller an amount equal to a multiple of each
unit first year profits less the costs to develop and open the site, as
defined. The franchisee forfeited the nonrefundable initial franchise fees of
$2,000 each for four sites. Unearned franchise fees are included in deferred
credits and any consideration paid for the sites will be offset against each
site related unearned franchise fee. In fiscal 1997, the Company recognized
the deferred credit for two of the sites.
In March 1997, the Company entered into a franchise agreement which provides
for the development of up to 34 Planet Hollywood restaurant-merchandise units in
23 countries throughout the Middle East and Europe. The franchise agreement
provided for and the investor made a payment to the Company of $80 million for
six sites. Additional franchise fees may be payable to the Company under the
terms of the franchise agreement for the additional sites. In connection with
the agreement, the investor purchased 1% of the Company total common stock
outstanding directly from the Company for approximately $196 million.

The valuation allowance for the deferred tax asset as of January 1, 1995 was
$8,478. The allowance was decreased in fiscal 1995 due to the taxable income
generated by the Company in fiscal 1995 and the expectation of sufficient
taxable income in the future to utilize the deductible temporary differences and
carryforwards. A valuation allowance of $1,925 was established during fiscal
1997 for the deferred tax assets relating to foreign operations. Deferred tax
assets are required to be reduced by a valuation allowance if it is more likely
than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax asset will not be
realized.

The amount of domestic net operating loss carryforwards generated by certain
subsidiaries prior to their acquisition was $4,288 with expiration dates through
the fiscal year 2011. The use of pre-acquisition operating loss carryforwards is
subject to limitations imposed by the Internal Revenue Code. The Company does
not anticipate that these limitations will affect utilization of the
carryforwards prior to their expiration.
The amount of foreign net operating loss carryforwards at December 28, 1997
was $8,220, of which $5,674 has no expiration date and $2,546 expires between

Provision has not been made for United States or foreign taxes on the
undistributed earnings of foreign affiliates, as those earnings are considered
to be permanently invested. It is not practicable to estimate the amount of the
tax on such earnings. Such earnings would become taxable upon the sale or
liquidation of the investment in these foreign affiliates or upon the remittance
of dividends. Upon remittance, certain foreign countries impose withholding
taxes that are then available, subject to certain limitations, for use as
credits against the Company United States tax liability.

12. RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS
In December 1994, the Company transferred ownership of an aircraft to a
company owned by two of the Company stockholders. The transportation equipment
was leased to the Company on a month-to-month basis, and the debt assumed by the
stockholders was guaranteed by the Company. The results of operations for this
company are included in the Company consolidated results until June 1995, when
