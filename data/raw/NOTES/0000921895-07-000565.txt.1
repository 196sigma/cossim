The Board of Directors and Stockholders
FalconStor Software, Inc. We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of FalconStor
Software, Inc. and subsidiaries as of December 31, 2006 and 2005, and the
related consolidated  statements of operations,  stockholders' equity and
comprehensive income loss, and cash flows for each of the years in the
three-year period ended December 31, 2006. These consolidated  financial
statements  are the  responsibility  of the  Company  management.  Our
responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated financial
statements based on our audits.
We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company
Accounting Oversight Board United States. Those standards require that we plan
and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial
statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a
test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial
statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and
significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall
financial statement presentation.  We believe that our audits provide a
reasonable basis for our opinion.
In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present
fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of FalconStor Software,
Inc. and subsidiaries as of December 31, 2006 and 2005, and the results of their
operations and their cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period
ended December 31, 2006, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting
principles.
As discussed in Notes 1 k and 8 to the accompanying consolidated financial
statements, the Company adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No.
123 Revised 2004, SHARED-BASED PAYMENT, as of January 1, 2006.
We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company
Accounting Oversight Board United States, the effectiveness of FalconStor
Software, Inc. internal control over financial reporting as of December 31,
2006, based on criteria established in INTERNAL CONTROL - INTEGRATED FRAMEWORK
issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission
COSO, and our report, dated March 14, 2007, expressed an unqualified opinion
on management assessment of, and the effective operation of, internal control
over financial reporting.                                   /s/ KPMG LLP

The Board of Directors and Stockholders
FalconStor Software, Inc. We have audited  management  assessment,  included in the accompanying
Management Report on Internal Control Over Financial  Reporting,  that
FalconStor Software, Inc. and subsidiaries the Company maintained effective
internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2006, based on
criteria established in INTERNAL CONTROL--INTEGRATED FRAMEWORK issued by the
Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission COSO. The
Company management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control
over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal
control over financial reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on
management assessment and an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company
internal control over financial reporting based on our audit.
We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company
Accounting Oversight Board United States. Those standards require that we plan
and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective
internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material
respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over
financial reporting, evaluating management assessment, testing and evaluating
the design and operating effectiveness of internal control, and performing such
other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe
that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.
A company internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to
provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting
and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance
with generally accepted accounting principles. A company internal control over
financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that i pertain to
the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly
reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; ii
provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to
permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted
accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are
being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of
the company; and iii provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or
timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the
company assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting
may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of
effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become
inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance
with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
In our opinion, management assessment that the Company maintained effective
internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2006, is fairly
stated, in all material respects, based on criteria established in INTERNAL
CONTROL--INTEGRATED FRAMEWORK issued by COSO. Also, in our opinion, the Company
maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial
reporting as of December 31, 2006, based on criteria established in INTERNAL
CONTROL--INTEGRATED FRAMEWORK issued by COSO.
We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company
Accounting Oversight Board United States, the consolidated balance sheets of
the Company as of December 31, 2006 and 2005, and the related consolidated
statements of operations, stockholders' equity and comprehensive income loss,
and cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended December 31,
2006, and our report, dated March 14, 2007, expressed an unqualified opinion on
those consolidated financial statements. As discussed in our report, dated March
14, 2007, the Company adopted the provisions of Statement of Financial
Accounting Standards No. 123 Revised 2004, SHARED-BASED PAYMENT, as of
January 1, 2006.                                   /s/ KPMG LLP

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
DECEMBER 31, 2006
1 SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
A THE COMPANY AND NATURE OF OPERATIONS
FalconStor Software,  Inc., a Delaware Corporation the Company,
develops, manufactures and sells network storage software solutions and provides
the related maintenance, implementation and engineering services.
B PRINCIPLES OF CONSOLIDATION
The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company
and its wholly owned subsidiaries. All significant intercompany balances and
transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.
C USE OF ESTIMATES
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally
accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and
assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and
disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial
statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the
reporting period. The Company significant estimates include those related to
revenue recognition,  accounts receivable allowances,  share-based payment
compensation and deferred income taxes. Actual results could differ from those
estimates.
D CASH EQUIVALENTS AND MARKETABLE SECURITIES
The Company considers all highly liquid investments with a maturity of
three months or less when purchased to be cash equivalents. Cash equivalents,
consisting of money market funds and commercial paper, amounted to approximately
$110 million and $124 million at December 31, 2006 and 2005, respectively.
Marketable securities at December 31, 2006 and 2005 amounted to $254 million
and $178 million, respectively, and consisted of corporate bonds, government
securities and certificate of deposits, which are classified as available for
sale, and accordingly, unrealized gains and losses on marketable securities are
reflected as a component of  accumulated  other  comprehensive  loss in
stockholders' equity.
E REVENUE RECOGNITION
The Company recognizes revenue from software licenses in accordance with
Statement of Position SOP 97-2, SOFTWARE REVENUE RECOGNITION. Accordingly,
revenue for software licenses is recognized when persuasive evidence of an
arrangement exists, the fee is fixed and determinable, the software is delivered
and collection of the resulting receivable is deemed probable. Software
delivered to a customer on a trial basis is not recognized as revenue until a
permanent key is delivered to the customer. Reseller customers typically send
the Company a purchase order only when they have an end user identified. When a
customer licenses software together with the purchase of maintenance, the
Company allocates a portion of the fee to maintenance for its fair value.
Software maintenance fees are deferred and recognized as revenue ratably over
the term of the contract. The long-term portion of deferred revenue relates to
maintenance contracts with terms in excess of one year. The cost of providing
technical support is included in cost of revenues. The Company provides an
allowance for software product returns as a reduction of revenue, based upon
historical experience and known or expected trends.
Revenues associated with software implementation and software engineering
services are recognized as the services are performed. Costs of providing these
services are included in cost of revenues.                    43    The Company has entered into various distribution, licensing and joint
promotion agreements with OEMs and distributors, whereby the Company has
provided to the reseller a non-exclusive software license to install the
Company software on certain hardware or to resell the Company software in
exchange for payments based on the products distributed by the OEM or
distributor. Nonrefundable advances and engineering fees received by the Company
from an OEM are recorded as deferred revenue and recognized as revenue when
related software engineering services, if any, are complete and the software
product master is delivered and accepted.
For the years ended December 31, 2006 and 2005, the Company had a limited
number of transactions in which it purchased hardware and bundled this hardware
with the Company software and sold the bundled solution to its customer. Since
the software is not essential for the functionality of the equipment included in
the Company bundled solutions, and both the hardware and software have stand
alone value to the customer, a portion of the contractual fees is recognized as
revenue when the software or hardware is delivered based on the relative fair
value of the delivered elements.
F PROPERTY AND EQUIPMENT
Property and equipment are recorded at cost. Depreciation is recognized
using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets 3
to 7 years. Leasehold improvements are amortized on a straight-line basis over
the term of the respective leases or over their estimated useful lives,
whichever is shorter.
G GOODWILL AND OTHER INTANGIBLE ASSETS
Goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the estimated
fair value of net tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired in
business combinations.  Consistent with Statement of Financial Accounting
Standards SFAS 142, GOODWILL AND OTHER INTANGIBLE ASSETS, the Company does
not amortize goodwill, but has instead tested the balance for impairment
annually on December 31st of each year, and more frequently if events or changes
in circumstances indicate that goodwill may be impaired. Identifiable intangible
assets are amortized over a three-year period using the straight-line method.
Amortization expense was $182,777, $216,997 and $220,712 for 2006, 2005 and
2004, respectively. The gross carrying amount and accumulated amortization of
other intangible assets as of December 31, 2006 and December 31, 2005 are as
follows                          December 31,   December 31,
2006       2005

Accumulated amortization               615,777    433,000
Net carrying amount               $  407,316   $  216,864
H SOFTWARE DEVELOPMENT COSTS AND PURCHASED SOFTWARE TECHNOLOGY
Costs associated with the development of new software products and
enhancements to existing software products are expensed as incurred until
technological feasibility of the product has been established. Based on the
Company product development process, technological feasibility is established
upon completion of a working model. The Company did not capitalize any software
development costs until its initial product reached technological feasibility at
the end of March 2001. The Company previously capitalized $94,570 of software
development costs which were fully amortized as of the first quarter of 2004.                    44 Amortization of software development costs is recorded at the greater of
straight line over three years or the ratio of current revenue of the related
products to total current and anticipated future revenue of these products.
Purchased software technology of $183,578 and $372,306, net of accumulated
amortization of $5,008,853 and $4,646,694, is included in other assets in the
balance sheets as of December 31, 2006 and December 31, 2005, respectively.
Amortization expense was $362,159, $781,500 and $1,386,027 for the years ended
December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. Amortization of purchased
software technology is recorded at the greater of the straight line basis over
the products estimated remaining life or the ratio of current period revenue of
the related products to total current and anticipated future revenue of these
products.
As of December 31, 2006, amortization expense on existing identifiable
intangible assets and purchased software technology will be $295,433, $223,482,
and $71,979 for the years ended December 31, 2007, 2008 and 2009, respectively.
Such assets will be fully amortized at December 31, 2009.
I INCOME TAXES
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax
consequences  attributable to differences between the financial statement
carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax
bases. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates
expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary
differences are expected to be realized or settled. The effect on deferred tax
assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the
period that includes the enactment date. The Company provides a full valuation
allowance against its deferred tax assets.
J LONG-LIVED ASSETS
The Company reviews its long-lived assets for impairment whenever events
or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the asset may
not be recoverable. If the sum of the expected future cash flows, undiscounted
and without interest is less than the carrying amount of the asset, an
impairment loss is recognized as the amount by which the carrying amount of the
asset exceeds its fair value.
K SHARE-BASED PAYMENTS
Effective January 1, 2006, the Company adopted the provisions of Statement
of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123 R Revised 2004, SHARE-BASED
PAYMENT SFAS No. 123R, which establishes the accounting for transactions in
which an entity exchanges its equity instruments for goods or services. Under
the provisions of SFAS No. 123R, share-based payment compensation is measured
at the grant date, based on the fair value of the award, and is recognized as an
expense over the requisite employee service period generally the vesting
period. The Company adopted SFAS No. 123R using the modified prospective
method and, as a result, periods prior to January 1, 2006 have not been
restated. The adoption of this pronouncement resulted in increased compensation
expense of $94 million, which caused net income to decrease by the same amount
or $020 per share for the year ended December 31, 2006, as well as cash flows
from financing activities increasing by $45,895 while cash flows from operating
activities decreased by the same amount for the year ended December 31, 2006.
Prior to the adoption of SFAS No. 123 R, the Company accounted for stock-based
compensation using the intrinsic-value based method under Accounting Principles
Board APB Opinion No. 25, ACCOUNTING FOR STOCK ISSUED TO EMPLOYEES, and
related interpretations, and provided applicable pro-forma disclosures required
by Statement of Financial  Accounting Standards No. 123, ACCOUNTING FOR
STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION. Accordingly, prior to 2006, the Company recorded
employee stock-based compensation expense only if, on the date of grant, the
market price of the underlying stock on the date of grant exceeded the exercise
price.
L FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS
As of December 31, 2006 and 2005, the fair value of the Company
financial instruments including cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable,
accounts payable and accrued expenses, approximates book value due to the short
maturity of these instruments.                    45 M FOREIGN CURRENCY
Assets and liabilities of foreign operations are translated at rates of
exchange at the end of the period, while results of operations are translated at
average exchange rates in effect for the period. Unrealized gains and losses
from the translation of foreign assets and liabilities are classified as a
separate component of stockholders' equity. Realized gains and losses from
foreign currency transactions are included in the statements of operations
within interest and other income, net. Such amounts have historically not been
material.
N EARNINGS PER SHARE EPS
Basic EPS is computed based on the weighted average number of shares of
common stock outstanding. Diluted EPS is computed based on the weighted average
number of common shares outstanding  increased by dilutive common stock
equivalents. Due to net losses for the years ended December 31, 2006 and 2004,
all common stock equivalents for these periods were excluded from diluted net
loss per share. As of December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004, potentially dilutive
common stock equivalents included 11,060,975, 10,200,908 and 8,973,358 stock
options and shares of restricted stock outstanding, respectively. As of December
31, 2006, 2005 and 2004, potentially dilutive common stock equivalents also
included 750,000 warrants outstanding.
The following  represents a  reconciliation  of the numerators and
denominators of the basic and diluted earnings per share EPS computation                        Year Ended December 31, 2006          Year Ended December 31, 2005

O COMPREHENSIVE INCOME LOSS
Comprehensive income loss includes the Company net income loss,
foreign currency translation adjustments and unrealized losses on marketable
securities, net of tax. Components of accumulated other comprehensive income
loss were comprised of foreign currency translation adjustment losses of
$363,163 and $391,540 as of December 31, 2006 and 2005, respectively, unrealized
losses on marketable securities of $23,482 and $49,283, net of tax as of
December 31, 2006 and 2005, respectively and unrecognized pension adjustments of
$87,482, net of tax as of December 31, 2006.
P NEW ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS
In September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 158, EMPLOYERS' ACCOUNTING FOR
DEFINED BENEFIT PENSION AND OTHER POSTRETIREMENT PLANS - an amendment of FASB
Statements No. 87, 88, 106 and 132R SFAS 158. SFAS 158 requires that
employers recognize the funded status of their defined benefit pension and other
postretirement plans on their consolidated balance sheet and recognize as a
component of other comprehensive income, net of tax, the gains or losses and
prior service costs or credits that arise during the period but are not
recognized as components of net periodic benefit cost. SFAS No. 158 also
requires additional disclosures in the notes to financial statements. The
Company adopted SFAS No. 158, effective December 31, 2006, and recorded a
$87,482 adjustment to other comprehensive income.
In September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 157, FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS
SFAS 157, which defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring
fair value and expands the related disclosure requirements. Adoption is required
as of the beginning of the first fiscal year that begins after November 15,
2007. SFAS No. 157 applies under other accounting pronouncements that require or
permit fair value measurements and does not require any new fair value
measurements. Management is evaluating the impact the adoption of this statement
will have on the Company consolidated financial statements.                    46    In September 2006, the SEC issued Staff Accounting Bulletin SAB No.
108, CONSIDERING THE EFFECTS OF PRIOR YEAR MISSTATEMENTS WHEN QUANTIFYING
MISSTATEMENTS IN CURRENT YEAR FINANCIAL STATEMENTS SAB No. 108 to provide
guidance on the consideration of the effects of prior year misstatements in
quantifying current year misstatements for the purpose of a materiality
assessment. Under SAB No. 108, companies should evaluate a misstatement based on
its impact on the current year income statement, as well as the cumulative
effect of correcting such misstatements that existed in prior years existing in
the current year ending balance sheet. The Company adopted SAB No. 108 for the
year ended December 31, 2006 with no impact to the Company consolidated
financial statements.
In June 2006, the FASB issued FASB Interpretation No. FIN 48,
ACCOUNTING FOR UNCERTAINTY IN INCOME TAXES - an Interpretation of SFAS No. 109,
which clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in the
financial statements in accordance with SFAS No. 109, ACCOUNTING FOR INCOME
TAXES. FIN 48 prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for
the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or
expected to be taken in a tax return. Any change in the net assets or
liabilities recognized as a result of adopting the provisions of FIN 48 would be
recorded as an adjustment to the opening balance of retained earnings. FIN 48 is
effective for the Company as of January 1, 2007. Management is currently
evaluating the impact, if any, the adoption of FIN 48 will have on the Company
consolidated financial statements.
Q RECLASSIFICATIONS
Certain reclassifications have been made to prior years' consolidated
financial statement presentations to conform to the current year presentation.
2 ACQUISITION
On July 3, 2002, FalconStor AC, Inc., a newly formed wholly-owned
subsidiary of the Company, acquired all of the common stock of IP Metrics
Software, Inc. IP Metrics, a provider of intelligent trunking software for
mission-critical networks, for $2,432,419 in cash plus payments contingent on
the level of revenues from IP Metrics' products and services for a period of
twenty-four months. The acquisition was accounted for under the purchase method
and the results of IP Metrics are included with those of the Company from the
date of acquisition. As of December 31, 2004, the Company made aggregate
contingent acquisition payments totaling $501,139 related to the sale of IP
Metrics' products and services. In 2006, the Company recorded a litigation
settlement expense of $08 million relating to a contingent purchase price
dispute with two former shareholders of IP Metrics.
3 PROPERTY AND EQUIPMENT

Depreciation expense was $3,071,018, $2,452,737, and $2,041,592 in 2006,
2005, and 2004, respectively.                    47 4 MARKETABLE SECURITIES
The Company investments consist of available-for-sale securities, which
are carried at fair value, with unrealized gains and losses reported as a
separate component of stockholders' equity. Unrealized gains and losses are
computed on the specific identification method. Realized gains, realized losses
and declines in value judged to be other-than-temporary, are included in
interest and other income, net. The cost of available-for-sale securities sold
are based on the specific identification method and interest earned is included
in interest and other income.
The cost and fair values of the Company available-for-sale marketable
securities as of December 31, 2006, are as follows               Aggregate     Cost    Unrealized   Unrealized
Fair Value    Basis     Gains     Losses
Auction rate securities  $10,900,000  $10,900,000  $    --  $     Government securities    12,956,804   12,978,952       --     22,148

As of December 31, 2006 there are two corporate bonds and twelve
government securities that are in an unrealized loss position. Based on the
credit ratings of these  securities and the timing of their respective
maturities, there is no reason to believe the Company will be unable to collect
all amounts due according to the contractual terms of these securities.
Unrealized losses on the Company available-for-sales securities have not been
determined to be other-than-temporary due principally to the Company intent
and ability to hold these securities for a period of time sufficient to recover
the value of the investments.
The cost and fair values of the Company available-for-sale marketable

$3,056,055   $ 2,411,857   $5,856,902
As of December 31, 2006, the Company had U.S. Federal net operating loss
carryforwards of approximately $21,825,800 which expire from 2020 through 2025.
In August 2001, the Company was a party to a reverse merger with Network
Peripherals, Inc. NPI. As of the date of the merger, NPI had U.S. Federal
net operating loss carryforwards of $93,268,500 that start to expire in
December, 2012. As of December 31, 2006, the Company had state net operating
loss carryforwards of approximately $13,657,200 which expire from 2007 through
2025. As of December 31, 2006, the Company had foreign net operating loss
carryforwards of approximately $4,719,700. At December 31, 2006 and 2005, the
Company established a valuation allowance to reduce its deferred tax assets to
an amount that is more-likely-than-not realizable due to the Company prior
history of pre-tax losses and uncertainty about the timing of and ability to
generate taxable income in the future. Due to the Company various equity
transactions, which resulted in a change of control, the utilization of certain
tax loss carryforwards is subject to annual limitations imposed by Internal
Revenue Code Section 382. NPI experienced such an ownership change as a result
of the merger. As such, the Company ability to use its NOL carryforwards to
offset taxable income in the future may be significantly limited.
If the entire deferred tax asset were realized, $4,631,900 would be
allocated to paid-in-capital with the remainder reducing income tax expense. Of
the amount allocable to paid-in-capital, $2,340,600 relates to the tax effect of
the deductions for payments of liabilities of discontinued operations in
connection with the reverse merger and the remainder of $2,291,300 relates to
the tax effects of excess compensation deductions from exercises of employee and
consultant stock options. In determining the period in which related tax
benefits are realized for book purposes, excess share-based payment deductions
and deduction from discontinued operations included in net operating losses are
realized after regular net operating losses are exhausted.
7 STOCKHOLDERS' EQUITY
In September, 2003 the Company entered into a worldwide OEM agreement with
a major technology company the OEM, and granted the OEM warrants to purchase
750,000 shares of the Company common stock with an exercise price of $618 per
share. A portion of the warrants may vest annually subject to the OEM
achievement of pre-defined and mutually agreed upon sales objectives over a                    50 three-year period beginning June 1, 2004. If the OEM generates cumulative
revenues to the Company in the mid-eight figure dollar range from reselling the
Company products then all the warrants granted will vest. Any warrants that do
not vest by the end of the three-year period will expire. If and when it is
probable that all or a portion of the warrants will vest, the then fair value of
the warrants earned will be recorded as a reduction of revenue. Subsequently,
each quarter the Company will apply variable accounting to adjust such amount to
reflect the fair value of the warrants until they vest. Through December 31,
2006, the Company had not generated any revenues from this OEM and accordingly
no warrants had vested.
8 SHARE-BASED PAYMENT ARRANGEMENTS
As of May 1, 2000, the Company adopted the FalconStor Software, Inc. 2000
Stock Option Plan the 2000 Plan. The 2000 Plan is administered by the

the grant of options to purchase up to 14,162,296 shares of Company common stock
to employees, consultants and non-employee directors. Options may be incentive
ISO or non-qualified. ISOs granted must have exercise prices at least equal
to the fair value of the common stock on the date of grant, and have terms not
greater than ten years, except those to an employee who owns stock with greater
than 10% of the voting power of all classes of stock of the Company, in which
case they must have an option price at least 110% of the fair value of the
stock, and expire no later than five years from the date of grant. Non-qualified

fair value of the common stock on the date of grant, and have terms not greater
than ten years. All options granted under the 2000 Plan must be granted before
May 1, 2010.
The Company granted options to purchase an aggregate of 50,000 shares of
common stock to certain non-employee consultants in exchange for professional
services during 2002. The aggregate fair value of these options as determined
using the fair value method is expensed over the periods the services are
provided. The related expense amounted to $32,860 and $87,023 in 2005 and 2004,
respectively. These services were completed as of December 31, 2005.
On May 14, 2004, the Company adopted the FalconStor Software, Inc. 2004
Outside Directors Stock Option Plan the 2004 Plan. The 2004 Plan is
administered by the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors and
provides for the granting of options to non-employee directors of the Company to
purchase up to 300,000 shares of Company common stock. Exercise prices of the
options must be equal to the fair market value of the common stock on the date
of grant. Options granted have terms of ten years. All options granted under the
2004 Plan must be granted within three years of the adoption of the 2004 Plan.
On May 17, 2006, the Company adopted the FalconStor Software, Inc. 2006
Incentive Stock Plan the 2006 Plan. The 2006 Plan is administered by the
Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors and provides for the grant of
incentive and nonqualified stock options, and restricted stock, to employees,
officers, consultants and advisors of the Company. A maximum of 1,500,000 of the
authorized but unissued or treasury shares of the common stock of the Company
may be issued upon the grant of restricted stock or upon the exercise of options
granted under the 2006 Plan. Exercise prices of the options must be equal to the
fair market value of the common stock on the date of grant. Options granted have
terms of not greater than ten years. All options and shares of restricted stock
granted under the 2006 Plan must be granted within ten years of the adoption of
the 2006 Plan.
A summary of the Company stock option activity for 2006 is as follows                    51                                                      Weighted

Stock option exercises are fulfilled with new shares of common stock. The
total cash received from stock option exercises for the years ended December 31,
2006, 2005 and 2004 was $2,501,156, $1,942,540 and $2,031,903, respectively. The

The Company recognized $45,895 of tax benefits related to share-based
payment compensation during the year ended December 31, 2006.
In 2006, the Company granted options to purchase an aggregate of 25,000
shares of common stock to certain non-employee consultants in exchange for
professional services. The aggregate fair value of these options as determined
using the Black-Scholes method, $161,230 as of December 31, 2006, is being
expensed over the periods the services are provided. The related expense
amounted to $17,914 during the year ended December 31, 2006.
In 2006, the Company granted 225,000 shares of restricted stock at an
average fair value per share at date of grant of $706 per share. There were no
restricted shares issued or outstanding as of December 31, 2005. As of December
31, 2006 no restricted shares have been vested or forfeited.
For periods prior to January 1, 2006, the Company recorded compensation
expense for employee stock options based upon their intrinsic value on the date
of grant pursuant to Accounting Principles Board APB Opinion No. 25,
ACCOUNTING FOR STOCK ISSUED TO EMPLOYEES. Since the exercise price for such
options was equal to the fair market value of the Company stock at the date of
grant, the stock options had no intrinsic value upon grant and, therefore, no
expense was recorded in the consolidated statements of operations.                    52    Had the compensation cost of the Company share-based payments been
determined in accordance with SFAS No. 123, the Company pro forma net income

Under the modified prospective method, SFAS No. 123R applies to new
awards and to awards outstanding on the effective date that are subsequently
modified or cancelled. Compensation expense for outstanding awards for which the
requisite service had not been rendered as of December 31, 2005 is recognized
over the remaining service period using the compensation cost calculated for pro
forma disclosure purposes under SFAS No. 123. Prior to the adoption of SFAS No.
123R, the Company valued graded vesting awards based on the entire award for
purposes of pro forma disclosure. The Company has elected to continue valuing
awards with graded vesting, based on the value of the entire award. The Company
allocates the fair value of all awards on a straight-line basis over the vesting
period. Cumulative compensation expense recognized at any date will at least
equal the grant date fair value of the vested portion of the award at that time.
The Company estimates the fair value of share-based payments using the
Black-Scholes option pricing model. The Company believes that this valuation
technique and the approach utilized to develop the underlying assumptions are
appropriate in estimating the fair value of the Company share-based payments
granted during the year ended December 31, 2006. Estimates of fair value are not
intended to predict actual future events or the value ultimately realized by the
employees who receive equity awards.
The per share weighted average fair value of share-based payments granted
during the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004 was $432, $452 and
$655, respectively. In addition to the exercise and grant date prices of the
awards, certain weighted average assumptions that were used to estimate the fair
value of share-based payment grants in the respective periods are listed in the
table below                         Year ended December 31,

market value of the stock on the date of grant, a contractual term of ten years,
a vesting period of three years and an estimated forfeiture rate of 23%. All
options granted through December 31, 2005 had exercise prices equal to the fair
market value of the stock on the date of grant, a contractual term of ten years,
generally a vesting period of three years and an estimated forfeiture rate of
23%.
The Company estimates expected volatility based primarily on historical
daily volatility of the Company stock and other factors, if applicable. The
risk-free interest rate is based on the United States treasury yield curve in
effect at the time of grant. The expected option term is the number of years
that the Company estimates that options will be outstanding prior to exercise.
The expected term of the awards issued after December 31, 2005 was determined
using the simplified method prescribed in SEC Staff Accounting Bulletin
SAB No. 107.
As of December 31, 2006, there was approximately $11,433,934 of total
unrecognized compensation cost related to the Company unvested options and
restricted shares granted under the Company stock plans. The unrecognized
compensation cost is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of
223 years.
As of December 31, 2006, the Company has 12,605,548 shares of common stock
reserved for issuance upon the exercise of options, restricted shares and
warrants.
9 LITIGATION SETTLEMENT CHARGES
In January 2007, we resolved claims brought against us by two former
shareholders of IP Metrics, Inc. IP Metrics. When we purchased IP Metrics in
July 2002, part of the contractual consideration was payments to be made in 2003
and 2004 to the former IP Metrics shareholders based on sales of IP Metrics
products, and/or payments to be made if certain events occurred. We made
payments to all four former shareholders in 2003 and 2004. Two of the former
shareholders alleged that they were entitled to additional payments based on the
alleged occurrence of certain contingent events and they brought an action
against us. This action was resolved in January, 2007 without any admission of
liability, by the payment of an additional $08 million to the two former
shareholders. This amount was recorded as an operating expense as of December
31, 2006. All claims in the lawsuit have now been dismissed.
During the third quarter of 2004, the Company resolved claims relating to
alleged patent infringement brought by Dot Hill Systems Corporation Dot Hill
and by Crossroad Systems Texas, Inc. Crossroads against the Company.
Pursuant to the terms of the Settlement Agreement between the Company and
Crossroads, the Company, without admission of infringement, made a one-time
payment of $13 million and granted to Crossroads licenses to certain Company
technology in exchange for a worldwide, perpetual license to the technology
underlying the Crossroads patents at issue in the litigation. All claims against
the Company by both Dot Hill and Crossroads were dismissed.
10 COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES
The Company has an operating lease covering its primary office facility
that expires in February, 2012. The Company also has several operating leases
related to offices in foreign countries. The expiration dates for these leases

periodic pension cost. Actuarial gains and losses that arise in subsequent
periods and are not recognized as net periodic pension cost in the same periods
will be recognized as a component of other comprehensive income and will be
recognized subsequently as a component of net periodic pension cost on the same
basis as the amounts recognized in accumulated other comprehensive income upon
adoption of SFAS No. 158.

the following amounts, net of tax, that have not yet been recognized in net
periodic pension cost: unrecognized transition obligation of $63,120, and
