ITEM 8. FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA.
INDEPENDENT AUDITORS' REPORT To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of Elamex, S.A. de C.V. We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Elamex, S.A. de
C.V. and subsidiaries as of December 31, 2003 and 2002, and the related
consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss, stockholders'
equity, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December
31, 2003. These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company
management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial
statements based on our audits.
We conducted our audits in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted
in the United States of America. Those standards require that we plan and
perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial
statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a
test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial
statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and
significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall
financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a
reasonable basis for our opinion.
In our opinion, such consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all
material respects, the financial position of Elamex, S.A. de C.V. and
subsidiaries as of December 31, 2003 and 2002, and the consolidated results of
their operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period
ended December 31, 2003 in conformity with accounting principles generally
accepted in the United States of America.
As discussed in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements, in 2002 the
Company changed its method of accounting for goodwill and other intangible
assets to conform to Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 142. Deloitte & Touche March 25, 2004

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR THE YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31,
2003, 2002 AND 2001 IN THOUSANDS OF U.S. DOLLARS
1. ORGANIZATION AND BASIS OF PRESENTATION
COMPANY BACKGROUND - Elamex, S.A. de C.V. and its subsidiaries Elamex or the
Company are a group of Companies in Mexico and the United States that provide
manufacturing, packaging and distribution services. The Company provides
customized manufacturing services in the candy and nut industry, plastic and
stamped metal components industry. The Company manufacturing machinery and
equipment are located in facilities in Ciudad Juarez, in Mexico, and in
Louisville, Kentucky and El Paso, Texas in the United States.
On December 19, 2003 the Metal Stamping segment wholly owned subsidiary
Precision Tool, Die and Machine Company Precision voluntarily filed for
protection under Chapter 11 of the Federal Bankruptcy Code in the U.S.
Bankruptcy Court to implement a restructuring of its debt. Also, in December
2003 the Company Board of Directors authorized the sale of Precision. As a
consequence of seeking protection under bankruptcy laws, the Company no longer
controls Precision operations as of December 19, 2003. The Company
investment in Precision was deconsolidated and is thereafter recognized in
accordance with the equity method of accounting.
In July 2002, the Company acquired the new Food Products segment, which is Mt.
Franklin Holdings LLC and subsidiaries Franklin. Franklin operates a retail
nut and foodservice nut packaging and marketing company located in El Paso,
Texas and a candy manufacturing and packaging facility located in Ciudad Juarez,
Mexico see Note 3.
The Company is a subsidiary of Accel, S.A. de C.V. Accel, which owns
approximately 576% of the Company issued and outstanding common shares at
December 31, 2003.
BASIS OF PRESENTATION - These consolidated financial statements and the
accompanying notes are prepared in U.S. dollars, the functional and reporting
currency of Elamex.
PRINCIPLES OF CONSOLIDATION - The consolidated financial statements are prepared
in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States
of America U.S. and include the accounts of the Company and its wholly-owned
and majority-owned, controlled subsidiaries. All significant intercompany
balances and transactions are eliminated in consolidation.
Effective December 19, 2003, the results of operations of Precision, Metal
Stamping Segment which was previously consolidated are being reported on the
equity method. This was due to the voluntary petition for reorganization under
Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy code.
Financial information for Precision as of and for the year ended December 31,
2003 is as follows                        In Thousands of
U.S. Dollars
Current assets             $  13,188

Net loss                  16,709
During the fourth quarter of 2003 Precision encountered circumstances that
indicated that its carrying value may not be recoverable, as such, the Company
engaged an independent company to assist in the valuation of long-lived assets
for impairment. Based on the analysis of future cash flows of the assets group
the Company reported an impairment of Precision long-lived assets of $132
million in December 2003. This impairment is recorded in the statement of
operations as impairment of long-lived assets.                    28 During 2003 the Company loaned Precision $15 million in the form of a note
receivable, to meet working capital needs. At December 31, 2003 , the Company
had notes receivable from Precision of $15 million.
The Company share of undistributed equity net of amounts receivable from
Precision at December 31, 2003 was $0.

Qualcore, a joint venture with General Electric de Mexico GE de Mexico,
which was previously consolidated, are being reported on the equity method. This
was the result of the change in management control of the joint venture. As of
the beginning of the third quarter 2001 a new four-member board of directors in
which the two partners have equal voting rights directs the operations of
Qualcore. A general manager appointed by the board of directors, reports
directly to such board of directors.

to meet working capital needs. At December 31, 2003 and 2002, the Company had
notes receivable from Qualcore of $2,325 and $1,750, respectively
The Company share of undistributed equity net of amount receivable from
Qualcore at December 31, 2003 was $864.
MANAGEMENT ESTIMATES - The preparation of financial statements in conformity
with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. requires management to
make certain estimates that affect the reported amounts of assets and
liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of
the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses
during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from these estimates. 2. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
CHANGE IN ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLE - As of January 1, 2002 the Company adopted
Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 142 SFAS No. 142, Goodwill
and Other Intangible Assets which requires, among other things, the
discontinuance of amortization of goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite
lives. In addition, the standard includes provisions for the reclassification of
certain existing recognized intangibles, reclassification of certain intangibles
out of previously reported goodwill and the identification of reporting units
for purposes of assessing potential impairments of goodwill. SFAS No. 142 also
required the Company to complete a transitional goodwill impairment test six
months from the date of adoption. The result of the non-amortization provision
of SFAS No. 142 was a decrease in the net loss of $492 thousand for the year
ended December 31, 2002.
The Company engaged an independent company to assist in the valuation of
goodwill assigned to Precision. The fair value of the operating entity was
determined using a discounted cash flow model. Based on the analysis performed
the Company completed its implementation analysis of goodwill arising from prior
acquisitions and recorded an impairment charge of $853 thousand in the first
quarter of 2002, which was recorded as a cumulative effect of change in
accounting principle.
The following table details the pro forma transitional disclosures                                   $000s except for earnings-per-share amounts

Adjusted net loss                   $    461  $    072  $    154
29 The Company completed its annual impairment test during the first quarter of
2003 and reported an impairment of goodwill of $36 million. The goodwill
affected by the impairment analysis is that recorded at the time of the
acquisition of Precision Tool, Die and Machine Co. in 1999. The primary reason
for the impairment was an increase in required capital expenditures necessary to
replace aging equipment and new capital for business expansion. The Company has
elected to annually test goodwill for impairment during the first quarter of the
year and whenever an indication of impairment occurs. As a consequence of the
voluntary petition for reorganization under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy
code filed by Precision the Company tested the value of the goodwill in December
2003 and determined an additional impairment of goodwill of $45 million for
Precision goodwill. After impairment, goodwill remaining on the books is
approximately $37 million of goodwill recorded during the third quarter of 2002
as a result of the acquisition of Mt. Franklin Holdings See Note 3.
CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS - The Company considers all highly liquid debt
instruments and investments purchased with an original maturity of three months
or less to be cash equivalents. Cash includes deposits in Mexican banks,
denominated in Mexican Pesos Pesos, of approximately $0 and $262 thousand at
December 31, 2003 and 2002, respectively. The Company had approximately $23
million and $87 million at December 31, 2003 and 2002, respectively, in
short-term repurchase agreements, denominated in U.S. dollars, deposited in U.S.
banks.
CONCENTRATION OF CREDIT RISK - Financial instruments that potentially subject
the Company to concentrations of credit risk consist of cash and accounts
receivable. The Company monitors the risk of having deposits in bank in excess
of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation limits and does not anticipate any
losses. The Company performs ongoing credit evaluations of its customers and
generally does not require collateral to support amounts due for the sale of its
products.
ALLOWANCE FOR DOUBTFUL ACCOUNTS - The Company maintains an allowance for
doubtful accounts based on its best estimate of accounts receivable considered
to be uncollectible.
An analysis of the activity in the allowance for doubtful accounts for the years
ended December 31, 2003, 2002 and 2001 is as follows                         2003        2002        2001

Ending balance               $    1,275   $     654   $     649
FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSLATION - The functional currency of the Company is the
U.S. dollar, the currency of the primary economic environment in which the
Company operates. Gains and losses on foreign currency transactions and
remeasurement of balance sheet amounts are reflected in net income. Included in
other, net on the accompanying consolidated statements of operations are foreign
exchange losses of $211 thousand, $328 thousand, and $8 thousand for the years
ended December 31, 2003, 2002, and 2001, respectively. Assets and liabilities of
the Company are denominated in U.S. dollars except for certain amounts as
indicated below. Certain balance sheet amounts primarily inventories, property,
plant and equipment, accumulated depreciation, prepaid expenses, and common
stock denominated in other than U.S. dollars are remeasured at the rates in
effect at the time the relevant transaction was recorded, and all other assets
and liabilities are remeasured at rates effective as of the end of the related
periods. Revenues and expenses denominated in other than U.S. dollars are
remeasured at weighted-average exchange rates for the relevant period the
transaction was recorded. Assets and liabilities denominated in Pesos are
summarized as follows in thousands of U.S. dollars at the exchange rate
published in the Diario Oficial de la Federacion the Official Gazette of the
Federation, which is the approximate rate at which a receivable or payable can
be settled as of each period end                         2003        2002

Net foreign currency position   $    1,406   $    1,284
30 In addition, the Company has recorded a net deferred tax liability pursuant to
Statement of Financial Accounting Standards SFAS No. 109, Accounting for
Income Taxes see Note 10. The recorded net deferred tax asset of $885 thousand
and $22 million at December 31, 2003 and 2002 respectively, represent the net
dollar value of amounts provided for temporary differences between the financial
statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their
respective Mexican and U.S. tax bases.
FOREIGN EXCHANGE INSTRUMENTS - The Company maintains a policy of not engaging in
futures contracts with the purpose of hedging U.S. dollar/Peso revenues or
costs, with the exception of regular treasury operations to cover operating
requirements for up to 30 days. The Company had no open hedge contracts at
December 31, 2003 or 2002.
INVENTORIES - Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market. Cost is
determined using the first-in first-out FIFO method for Precision and a moving
weighted average for Franklin. Inventory cost includes material, labor and
overhead. Inventory reserves, which are charged to cost of sales, are provided
for excess inventory, obsolete inventory, and for differences between inventory
cost and its net realizable value.
PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT - Property, plant and equipment are stated at
cost, less accumulated depreciation and amortization. Plant and equipment under
capital leases are stated at the lower of their fair value at the inception of
the lease or the present value of minimum lease payments. Depreciation and
amortization are calculated using the straight-line method over the shorter of
related lease terms or estimated useful lives of the assets. The Company charges
amounts expended for maintenance and repairs to expense and capitalizes
expenditures for major replacements and improvements.
LONG-LIVED ASSETS - The Company measures impairment losses on long-lived assets,
including goodwill, when events and circumstances indicate that the assets might
be impaired and the undiscounted cash flows estimated to be generated by those
assets are less than the carrying amounts of those assets. The Company measures
impairment loss as the difference between the carrying value and the fair value
of the asset.
STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION - The Company accounts for the stock option plans under
APB Opinion No. 25, under which compensation cost of $223 thousand and $321
thousand were recognized in 2003 and 2002, respectively. Additional compensation
expense of $126 thousand will be expensed in the future in connection with these
options. Had compensation cost for these plans been determined consistent with
SFAS No. 123, Accounting for Stock Based Compensation, the Company net loss
and loss per share for the year ended December 31, 2003, would have been
adjusted to the following pro forma amounts                                  In Thousands of U.S. Dollars, Except Per Share Data
2003          2002
Net loss as reported                                 $34,608        $6,017
Stock based employee compensation expense included in reported net loss          223          321
Total stock-based employee compensation expense determined under
fair value based method                                  282         440
Pro forma net loss                                  $34,667        $6,136
Loss per share Basic and Diluted:
As reported                                       $461        $084
Pro forma                                        $462        $085
BASIC AND DILUTED NET LOSS PER SHARE - Basic and diluted net loss per share of
common stock is calculated by dividing net loss by the weighted-average number
of common shares outstanding for the year. There are no potentially dilutive
securities for the year ended December 31, 2001. Dilutive stock options for the
years ended December 31, 2003 and 2002 have not been included in the calculation
as their effect would be antidilutive due to the net loss.
INCOME TAXES - The Company accounts for income taxes under the asset and
liability method, as required by SFAS No. 109. Under the asset and liability
method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax
consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement
carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax
bases. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates
expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary
differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax
assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the
period that includes the enactment date. Provisions for taxes are made based
upon the applicable tax laws of Mexico and the United States. Deferred tax
assets and liabilities are not provided for differences related to assets and
liabilities that are remeasured from Pesos into U.S. dollars using                    31 historical exchange rates and that result from inflation indexing for Mexican
tax purposes or exchange rate changes.
REVENUE RECOGNITION - For metal stamping and food products sales are recognized
at the time the order is shipped. For contract manufacturing sales are
recognized when the order is shipped for manufacturing contracts and over the
contract period for assembly services. Anticipated losses on assembly services
contracts are charged to operations as soon as they are determined.
EMPLOYEE STATUTORY PROFIT-SHARING - A provision for deferred employee statutory
profit-sharing in Mexico is computed on income subject to employee statutory
profit-sharing, which differs from net income, due to certain differences in the
recognition of income and expenses for statutory profit-sharing and financial
statement purposes. There has been no employee statutory profit-sharing expense
for the years ended December 31, 2003, 2002, and 2001, respectively.
POST-RETIREMENT BENEFITS - Employees are entitled to certain benefits upon
retirement after 15 years or more of service seniority premiums, in accordance
with the Mexican Federal Labor Law. The benefits are accrued as a liability and
recognized as expense during the year in which services are rendered.
FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS - The carrying amounts of financial instruments, including
cash and cash equivalents, receivables, accounts payable, accrued expenses,
notes payable, taxes payable, and amounts due to related parties, approximated
fair value as of December 31, 2003 because of the relatively short maturity of
these instruments. The fair values of floating rate long-term debt are estimated
to be equivalent to their carrying amount based on current market conditions.
ACCRUED REBATES - The Company enters into contractual agreements for rebates on
certain products with its customers. Such amounts are netted against sales and
included in accrued advertising and promotions based on management estimates at
the date the sales occur.
PREPAID SLOTTING ALLOWANCES - Prepaid slotting allowances consist of payments to
customers for store shelf space and distribution agreements and are amortized to
sales revenue, as required by EITF 01-09, using the straight line method over
the term of the customer contract or proportionally with sales recorded, based
on the nature of the slotting contract. Contracts generally vary in length from
one to seven years and provide for fixed payments or payments upon achievement
of sales benchmarks. Prepaid slotting allowances of $13 million and $16
million are included on the balance sheet as other assets at December 31, 2003
and 2002 respectively.
RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS - In January 2003, the FASB issued FASB
Interpretation No. 46, Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities FIN 46.
In December 2003, FIN 46 was replaced by FASB Interpretation No. 46 revised
December 2003, Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities FIN 46R. FIN
46R clarifies the application of Accounting Research Bulletin No. 51,
Consolidated Financial Statements, to certain entities in which equity
investors do not have the characteristics of a controlling financial interest or
do not have sufficient equity at risk for the entity to finance its activities
without additional subordinated financial support from other parties. FIN 46R
requires an enterprise to consolidate a variable interest entity if that
enterprise will absorb a majority of the entity expected losses, is entitled
to receive a majority of the entity expected residual returns or both. For
investments in variable interest entities formed after December 31, 2003, the
Company will be required to apply FIN 46R as of January 1, 2004. As of
December 31, 2003, the Company does not have any variable interests held in
special purpose entities. The Company will be required to apply FIN 46R to any
other investments in variable interest entities no later than the end of the
first reporting period that ends after March 15, 2004. The Company does not
expect the adoption of FIN 46R to have a material impact on its financial
position or results of operations.
In April 2003, the FASB issued SFAS No. 149, Amendment of Statement 133 on
Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities. SFAS No. 149 improves financial
reporting by requiring that contracts with comparable characteristics be
accounted for similarly. In particular, SFAS No. 149 1 clarifies under what
circumstances a contract with an initial net investment meets the characteristic
of a derivative discussed in paragraph 6b of SFAS No. 133, 2 clarifies when
a derivative contains a financing component, 3 amends the definition of an
underlying to conform it to language used in FIN No. 45, and 4 amends certain
other existing pronouncements. Those changes will result in more consistent
reporting of contracts as either derivatives or hybrid instruments. In general,
SFAS No. 149 is effective for contracts entered into or modified after June 30,
2003 and for hedging relationships designated after June 30, 2003. The adoption
of SFAS No. 149 has not had a material impact on the Company financial
position or results of operations.
In May 2003, the FASB issued SFAS No. 150, Accounting for Certain Financial
Instruments with Characteristics of both Liabilities and Equity. SFAS No. 150
establishes standards for how an issuer classifies and measures certain
financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity. In
general this statement is effective for financial instruments entered into or
modified after May 31, 2003, and otherwise is effective for interim periods
beginning after June 15, 2003. The adoption of this statement did not have a
material impact on the Company financial position or results of operations.                    32 RECLASSIFICATIONS - Certain prior year amounts have been reclassified to conform
to the 2003 financial statement presentation. 3. ACQUISITIONS AND DISPOSITION OF ASSETS
The sale of certain assets, effective at the close of business on July 4, 2003,
was made to TECMA Group LLC, a private contract, shelter and manufacturing
services provider headquartered in El Paso, Texas. The transaction included the
sale of five Shelter Services customer contracts, miscellaneous assets and stock
of five newly created Companies. Substantially all Shelter Services operations
personnel related to these contracts were transferred to the buyer. Elamex
received approximately $18 million in cash. In connection with the disposition
the Company transferred assets with a book value of $120 thousand to the buyer
and recorded a gain of $17 million. The Company incurred other costs of
approximately $575 thousand associated with the sale, which were included in
operating expenses in the 2003 results of operations.
On July 18, 2002, Elamex USA, Corp. Elamex USA, a wholly owned Delaware
subsidiary of Elamex, completed the acquisition of Mt. Franklin Holdings, LLC
Franklin, Franklin Food Products LLC and the merger of Reprop Corporation
with and into Elamex USA. The effective closing date for tax and accounting
purposes was the close of business on June 28, 2002. Franklin operates a retail
nut and foodservice nut packaging and marketing company, whose operations are
located in El Paso, Texas and a candy manufacturing and packaging facility in
Ciudad Juarez, Mexico. The purchase price was cash payment of US$1,445,040 and
923,161 restricted shares of the common stock of Elamex. 278,499 of these shares
were contingent and subject to escrow agreements, which requires Franklin to
reach certain income levels through December 31, 2003. Franklin did not reach
the required income level; therefore the 278,499 shares in escrow will be
canceled or used for a different purpose.
The unaudited proforma combined historical results, as if Franklin had been
acquired at the beginning of fiscal 2001, are estimated in the following table              IN THOUSANDS OF U.S. DOLLARS, EXCEPT PER SHARE DATA
December 31, 2002    December 31, 2001
Net sales        $      151,179   $      170,461
Gross profit             18,077          8,693
Net loss               11,090        23,120
Net loss per share           148         308
The above proforma results include adjustments to give effect to intercompany
sales, depreciation and other purchase price adjustments. The proforma results
are not necessarily indicative of the operating results that would have occurred
had the acquisition been consummated as of the beginning of the periods
presented, nor are they necessarily indicative of future operating results.
4. RESTRUCTURING CHARGES
During the first quarter of 2001, the Company initiated a process of
restructuring its business model to eliminate non-productive assets and business
lines. As a result the Company recognized restructuring charges of $129 million
during the year ended December 31, 2001. Such restructuring charges include
severance and related costs and write-off of non-productive assets. As of
December 31, 2003 the Company has no accrued liabilities remaining in connection

required to comply with certain financial covenants including minimum tangible
net worth. As of December 31, 2003 Franklin was in compliance with such

for general maintenance. Included in property, plant and equipment at December
31, 2003 and 2002 is the cost of the land and buildings under operating lease
agreements of $16 million and $78 million and the related accumulated

Rental income was $15 million, $882 thousand, and $11 million for the years
ended December 31, 2003, 2002, and 2001, respectively. The future minimum rental
income to be received under these operating leases is $13 million in 2004 and
in 2005.                    35 9. INCOME TAXES
Mexican tax legislation requires that companies pay a tax calculated as the
greater of tax resulting from taxable income or tax on the value of certain
assets less certain liabilities asset tax. Taxes resulting from net income are
calculated using Mexican tax regulations, which define deductibility of expenses
and recognize certain effects of inflation.
Effective January 1, 1999, a tax rate was enacted in Mexico whereby the
corporate tax rate was 35%. An amount equal to 30% is paid on taxable earnings
reinvested in the Company and 5% on those earnings when they are distributed in
the form of dividends for the year ended December 31, 2001.
The tax law enacted January 1, 2002 eliminated the option to defer the payment
of 5% of taxable income and reduces the 35% tax rate to 34% in 2003, 33% in 2004
and 32% thereafter.
The tax provision differs from the statutory tax rate of 34% in 2003 and 35% for
2002 and 2001 on taxable income as follows                                2003        2002        2001

A valuation allowance is provided when it is more likely than not that some
portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized in the future.
The valuation allowances of $98 and $72 million at December 31, 2003 and
December 31, 2002, respectively, relate primarily to certain asset tax credit
and tax net operating loss carryforwards of individual Mexican subsidiaries and
the entire net deferred tax asset of the US Companies. The increase in the
valuation allowance at December 31, 2003 to $98 million relates primarily to
the expiration of certain asset tax credits and capital loss carryforwards of
individual Mexican subsidiaries, and the effect of reserving the entire net
deferred asset tax related to the US companies. In addition, primarily as a
result of the voluntary petition for reorganization filed by Precision under
Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code on December 19, 2003, the Company
investment in Precision, reported under the equity method of accounting, was
reduced by an increase in the valuation allowance against Precision underlying
deferred tax assets of $45 million.
An analysis of the activity of the valuation allowance for the years ended
December 31, 2003, 2002 and 2001 is as follows                             2003      2002      2001

The majority stockholder has filed a consolidated tax return with Elamex
operations since 1995. The tax sharing agreement entered into between the
majority stockholder, Accel, S.A. de C.V., and Elamex through 1998 provided that
Elamex transfer monthly an amount equal to its estimated tax payment, less
credits. Beginning in 1999, the Mexican tax law for consolidation required
Elamex and its subsidiaries to pay amounts directly to the Mexican Tax Authority
SHCP based on their individual tax calculations. The payments are calculated
as required by the SHCP as if Elamex and subsidiaries were filing a stand-alone
income tax return for such year. The majority stockholder further agrees to
reimburse Elamex for use of any of Elamex tax benefits at the time Elamex
would otherwise realize the benefit.
Dividends paid by Mexican companies, which exceed earnings, and profits, as
defined by the Mexican income tax law, are subject to a 34% income tax, payable
by the Company on 15152 times the amount in excess of earnings and profits.
Dividends paid which do not exceed earnings and profits are not currently
subject to Mexican tax to either the Company or the stockholder. The Mexican
companies paid no dividends on common stock in 2003, 2002 and 2001.
10. STOCKHOLDERS' EQUITY
COMMON STOCK - Under the bylaws and Mexican law, the capital stock of Elamex,
S.A. de C.V. must consist of fixed capital and may have, in addition thereto,
variable capital. Stockholders holding shares representing variable capital
common stock may require the Company, with a notice of at least three months
prior to December 31 of the prior year, to redeem those shares at a price equal
to the lesser of either i 95% of the market price, based on the average of
trading prices in the stock exchange where it is listed during the 30 trading
days preceding the end of the fiscal year in which the redemption is to become
effective or ii the book value of the Company shares as approved at the
meeting of stockholders for the latest fiscal year prior to the redemption date.
In July 2002, the Company issued 923,161 restricted shares of its authorized
variable capital common stock in connection with the acquisition of Mt. Franklin
Holdings see Note 3. Although the variable capital common stock is redeemable
by the terms described above, such shares would be classified as a component of
stockholders' equity in the consolidated balance sheets. Management believes the
variable common stock represents permanent capital because the timing and
pricing mechanisms through which a stockholder would exercise this option to
redeem are such that a stockholder, from an economic standpoint, would not
exercise this option. At the time a stockholder is required to give notice of
redemption, the stockholder will not be able to know at what price the shares
would be redeemed and would not expect the present value of the future
redemption payment to equal or exceed the amount which would be received by the
stockholder in an immediate public sale.
Under Mexican law, dividends must be declared in Pesos. If dividends are
declared in the future, the Company intent is to pay the dividends to all
stockholders in U.S. dollars, as converted from Pesos as of the date of record,
unless otherwise instructed by the stockholder.
Mexican law requires that at least 5% of the Company net income each year
after profit sharing and other deductions required by the law be allocated to
a legal reserve fund, which is not thereafter available for distribution, except
as a stock dividend, until the amount of such fund equals 20% of the Company
historical capital stock. The legal reserve fund at December 31, 2003 and 2002
was approximately $16 million. The Company anticipates that no additional
allocation will be made at its annual stockholders' meeting to be held on April
29, 2004. Retained earnings available for dividends under Mexican law at
December 31, 2003 and 2002 were $160 million and $174 million respectively.                    38 COMMON STOCK PURCHASE RESTRICTIONS AND PREEMPTIVE RIGHTS - Any person who seeks
to acquire ownership of 15% or more of the total outstanding shares of the
Company common stock must receive written consent from the Company Board of
Directors. Should shares in excess of 15% be acquired without permission, the
purchaser will be subject to liquidated damages, which will be used by the
Company to repurchase stock in excess of the 15% ownership limitation. In
addition, in the event that the Company issues additional shares, existing
stockholders will have a preemptive right to subscribe for new shares, except
when shares are issued in connection with a merger or for the conversion of
convertible debentures. The 15,000,000 shares of variable capital are not
subject to preemptive rights.
PREFERRED STOCK - Pursuant to the Company bylaws, the Company Board of
Directors, at its discretion, can issue up to an aggregate of 50,000,000 shares
of preferred stock in one or more series. The Board may attach any preferences,
rights, qualifications, limitations, and restrictions to the shares of each
series issued, including dividend rights and rates, conversion rights, voting
rights, terms of redemption, and liquidation preferences. The shares may be
issued at no par value or at a par value determined by the Board of Directors.
No shares of preferred stock have been issued as of December 31, 2003.
11. STOCK OPTION PLANS
On April 19, 2002, the shareholders approved the issuance of up to 850,000
Elamex stock options and authorized the Board of Directors to establish the
terms and conditions of the grant of the stock options.

The Company leases a building in Torreon, Mexico to Elamex de Torreon, S.A. de
C.V. a Mexican company established solely for the purpose of holding certain
governmental permits required by an Elamex Shelter Services Division customer.
For legal purposes only, Elamex de Torreon S.A. de C.V. was owned by an
affiliate of the Company. The assets and contracts related to Elamex de Torreon,
SA de C.V. are included in the assets sold to Tecma Group on July 4, 2003. Lease
income received by the Company through Elamex de Torreon from the Shelter
Services Division customer was approximately $106 thousand for the current year
period prior to the sale on July 4, 2003 and $211 thousand for each of the years
ended December 31, 2002 and 2001. In addition the customer obtained shelter
assembly services from the Company through Elamex de Torreon. For the current
year period prior to the sale on July 4, 2003 the services invoiced to Elamex de
Torreon were $23 million. For the years ended December 31, 2002 and 2001
services invoiced were and $25 million and $26 million, respectively.
The Company paid for services rendered by Comercial Aerea, of which the chairman
of the board of directors of Elamex is a principal, totaling approximately $148
thousand, $127 thousand, and $173 thousand during the years ended December 31,
2003, 2002, and 2001, respectively.
The Company purchases insurance through an insurance broker of which the
chairman of the board of Elamex is a principal. Premiums paid were approximately
$337 thousand, $393 thousand, and $761 thousand for the years ended December 31,
2003, 2002, and 2001, respectively.                    41 The Company, through its wholly owned subsidiary Confecciones de Juarez
Confecciones, leases a candy manufacturing building owned by Franklin
Inmobiliarios S.A. de C.V. Inmobiliarios, a Mexican company in which the
chairman of the board has an indirect ownership interest. The building, located
in Ciudad Juarez, Mexico, is the site on which all of Franklin candy
manufacturing operations are performed. Confecciones passes the cost of this
lease to Franklin under the terms of a shelter services agreement executed on
July 24, 2000 Shelter Contract. Shelter services companies generally lease
real properties in the normal course of arranging shelter services for a US
company. This lease agreement was executed on November 22, 2000, which was prior
to the July 1, 2001 date on which Elamex acquired Franklin.
The rights to collect lease payments from Confecciones have been assigned by
Inmobiliarios to the bank that financed the building. Franklin made lease
payments directly to that bank on behalf of Inmobiliarios in the amounts of $19
million, $19 million and $18 million during 2003, 2002 and 2001 respectively.
Under the terms of the Shelter Contract, Confecciones invoiced services to
Franklin in the amount of $88 million in 2001 and in the amount of $41 million
for the first six months of 2002. Thereafter, Franklin is a wholly owned
subsidiary of the Company.
In August 2001 the Company made a $3 million convertible subordinated loan to
Franklin Connections. In February 2002, May 2002 and June 2002 the Company
issued demand loans for $2 million, $11 million and $1 million, respectively to
Franklin Connections. The Company completed the acquisition of Franklin
Connections on July 18, 2002 and Franklin repaid $41 million plus interest to
the Company in connection with the demand loans.
During 2003 the Company loaned Qualcore $1,025 in the form of a note receivable,
to meet working capital needs. At December 31, 2003 and 2002, the Company had
notes receivable from Qualcore of $2,325 and $1,750, respectively
Qualcore sales of $16 million were made during 2001 to various companies and
divisions of GE.
16. COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES
The Company is a party to various claims, actions, and complaints, the ultimate
disposition of which, in the opinion of management, will not have a material
adverse effect on the operations or financial position of the Company.
The Mexican Federal Labor Law requires a severance payment for all permanent
employees that are terminated by the employer. This payment is calculated on the
basis of 90-days' pay for termination anytime during the first year of
employment, with an additional 12 days pay for each year of service thereafter
up to two times minimum wage. While most of the Company Mexican assembly labor
is hired under temporary labor contracts during the first two months of
employment, the labor force is changed to permanent labor contracts after this
period. The Company has agreements with many of its contract-assembly customers,
which require that the customers pay the severance costs incurred, in the event
that assembly contracts are terminated prior to their scheduled completion. In
management opinion, any severance costs incurred upon the termination of any
manufacturing contracts would not be material.
Seniority premiums to which employees are entitled upon retirement after 15
years or more of service, in accordance with the Mexican Federal Labor Law, are
recognized as expense during the year in which services are rendered, based on
actuarial computations. Included in other liabilities is approximately $51
thousand and $25 thousand as of December 31, 2002 and 2001, respectively, which
fully accrues for these estimated seniority obligations.
Qualcore, the joint venture with GE de Mexico, entered into a 12-year lease
agreement beginning January 2001 for the building that it occupies in Celaya
Mexico. The monthly lease payments are approximately $94,628 and are guaranteed
by both Elamex and GE de Mexico. Qualcore also obtained bank financing from
Wells Fargo and Eximbank for the plastic molding and metal stamping equipment
for the Celaya plant. The original notes payable totaled $84 million with a
five-year term and have equal semi-annual principal payments of $840 thousand
plus interest. The loan facilities are guaranteed by both GE de Mexico and
Elamex.
One of the Company subsidiaries has entered into certain fixed-price
commitments to purchase raw materials to be used in its manufacturing process
over the next year. As of December 31, 2003, the aggregate value of these
commitments was approximately $233 million.
Franklin is a defendant in a preferential payment transfer action in the United
States Bankruptcy Court for the District of New Mexico. The Trustee for the
Bankruptcy Estate of Furr Supermarkets, Inc Furr alleges that Franklin has
received preferential payments by Furr prior to the Furr bankruptcy filing
of $194 thousand and is seeking repayment from Franklin                    42 for the alleged transfer. Based on a review of the current facts and
circumstances, management has provided an accrual of $130,000, which is believed
to be a reasonable estimate of the probable loss associated with this matter.
One of the Company subsidiaries has received a Notice of Proposed Adjustment
issued by the Internal Revenue Service IRS in connection with an audit of the
subsidiary 2001 U.S. Corporate Income Tax Return. The IRS asserts that the
taxpayer failed to pay $274,000 of withholding taxes in 2001 on lease payments
made to Elamex pursuant to a maquiladora shelter services agreement. Management
intends to defend its position that no tax is payable, but has accrued expense
of $430 thousand as an estimate of all costs associated with this issue through
December 31, 2003.
