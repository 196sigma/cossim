33 Table of Contents   REPORT OF
REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM   Board of Directors   LanVision Systems, Inc.   We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of
LanVision Systems, Inc. as of January31, 2006 and 2005,
and the related consolidated statements of operations, changes
in stockholders equity, and cash flows for each of the
three years in the period ended January31, 2006. Our
audits also included the financial statement schedule of
LanVision Systems, Inc. listed in a. These
financial statements and schedule are the responsibility of the
Companys management. Our responsibility is to express an
opinion on these financial statements based on our audits.   We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the
Public Company Accounting Oversight Board United States. Those
standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are
free of material misstatement. We were not engaged to perform an
audit of the Companys internal control over financial
reporting. Our audit included consideration of internal control
over financial reporting as a basis for designing audit
procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not
for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of
the Companys internal control over financial reporting.
Accordingly we express no such opinion. An audit also includes
examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and
disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the
accounting principles used and significant estimates made by
management, and evaluating the overall financial statement
presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable
basis for our opinion.   In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above
present fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated
financial position of LanVision Systems, Inc. at
January31, 2006 and 2005, and the consolidated results of
its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in
the period ended January31, 2006, in conformity with
U.S.generally accepted accounting principles. Also, in our
opinion, the financial statement schedule, when considered in
relation to the basic financial statements taken as a whole,
presents fairly in all material respects the information set
forth herein.   Cincinnati, Ohio

1.
Organization
and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies   LanVision Systems, Inc. the Company operates in one segment as
a provider of Healthcare Information Technology through the
licensing of its Electronic Medical Record, Patient Financial
Services and other Workflow software applications and the use of
such applications through its application-hosting services as an
Application Service Provider. LanVisions products enable
hospitals and integrated healthcare delivery systems in the
UnitedStates to capture, store, manage, route, retrieve,
and process vast amounts of patient clinical, financial and
other healthcare provider information.   Fiscal
Year   All references to a fiscal year refer to the fiscal year
commencing February 1 in that calendar year and ending on
January 31 of the following year.   Consolidation   The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of
LanVision Systems, Inc. and its subsidiary, LanVision, Inc. All
significant intercompany transactions are eliminated.   Use of
Estimates   The preparation of financial statements in conformity with
accounting principles generally accepted in the United States
requires management to make estimates and assumptions that
affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and
accompanying notes. Actual results could differ from those
estimates. In the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2004, LanVision
recorded a $300,000 favorable change in the estimate for the
allowance for doubtful accounts and miscellaneous reserves. In
the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2003, LanVision recorded a
$290,000 favorable change in the estimate for certain franchise
tax liabilities as a result of the tax authority audit of
certain prior years tax returns. In fiscal years 2003,
2004 and 2005, the Company made certain estimates of its future
earnings before income taxes in determining the amount of the
valuation allowance required for the deferred income tax assets
relating to the net operating loss carry forward. See
Note4.   Revenue
Recognition   Revenue is derived from: the licensing and sale of systems,
either directly to end-users or through third-party resellers,
comprising internally developed software, third-party software
and hardware components; product support, maintenance and
professional services; and application-hosting services that
provide high quality, transaction or subscription based document
imaging/management services from a central data center.
LanVisions revenue recognition policies conform to
Statement of Position 97-2, Software Revenue Recognition.
Generally, revenue from software license fees and hardware sales
to end-users is recognized when a master agreement is signed and
products are made available to end-users. Revenues from
agreements that contain multiple-element arrangements are
allocated to the various elements based on the fair value of the
elements. Revenues related to routine installation and
integration and project management are deferred until the work
is performed. LanVision follows this method since reasonably
dependable estimates of the revenues and costs applicable to
various stages of a contract can be made. Revenues from
consulting, education, and application-hosting services are
recognized as the services are performed. Revenues from
short-term support and maintenance agreements are recognized
ratably over the term of the agreements. Billings to customers
recorded prior to the recognition of revenues are classified as
deferred revenues. Revenues recognized prior to progress
billings to customers are recorded as contract receivables.   Cash and
Cash Equivalents   Cash and cash equivalents include demand deposits and overnight
deposits. The long-term debt agreement See
Note3requires LanVision to maintain a minimum cash
balance equal the balance of the loan through the earlier of the
repayment or maturity of the loan in July, 2007.   
39 Table of Contents   NOTES TO
CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTSContinued   Receivables   Accounts and contract receivables are comprised of amounts owed
LanVision for licensed software, professional services,
including maintenance services and application-hosting
activities and are net of an allowance for doubtful accounts of
$200,000 at January31, 2006 and January31, 2005,
respectively. Contracts with individual customers and resellers
determine when receivables are due. In determining the allowance
for doubtful accounts, each unpaid receivable is reviewed
quarterly with the appropriate LanVision Client Manager to
determine the payment status based upon the most currently
available information as to the status of the receivables, the
customer comments, if any, and the status of any open or
unresolved issues with the customer preventing the payment
thereof. Corrective action, if necessary, is taken by LanVision
to resolve open issues related to unpaid receivables. During
these quarterly reviews, LanVision determines the required
allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting
from the unwillingness or inability of its customers or
resellers to make required payments.   Concentrations   Financial instruments, which potentially expose LanVision to
concentrations of credit risk, as defined by Statement of
Financial Accounting Standards No105, Disclosure of
Information about Financial Instruments with Off-Balance-Sheet
Risk and Financial Instruments with Concentrations of Credit
Risk, consist primarily of accounts receivable.
LanVisions accounts receivable are concentrated in the
healthcare industry. However, LanVisions customers
typically have been well-established hospitals, medical
facilities, or major Health Information Systems companies that
resell LanVisions products that have good credit histories
and payments have been received within normal time frames for
the industry. However, some hospitals and medical facilities
have experienced significant operating losses as a result of
limits on third-party reimbursements from insurance companies
and governmental entities and extended payment of receivables
from these entities is not uncommon.   To date, LanVision has relied on a limited number of customers
and remarketing partners for a substantial portion of its total
revenues. LanVision expects that a significant portion of its
future revenues will continue to be generated by a limited
number of customers and its remarketing partners. The failure to
obtain new customers or expand sales through remarketing
partners, the loss of existing customers or reduction in
revenues from existing customers could materially and adversely
affect LanVisions operating results See Note6.   LanVision currently buys all of its hardware and some major
software components of its Healthcare Information Systems from
third-party vendors. Although there are a limited number of
vendors capable of supplying these components, management
believes that other suppliers could provide similar components
on comparable terms. A change in suppliers, however, could cause
a delay in system implementations and a possible loss of
revenues, which could adversely affect operating results.   Other
Current Assets   Other current assets are primarily: prepaid insurance,
commissions, maintenance, deposits, deferred Federal income tax
assets relating to the net operating loss carryforward and
prepaid expenses related to future revenues. See Note4.   Property
and Equipment   Property and equipment are stated at cost. Depreciation is
computed using the straight-line depreciation, over the
estimated useful lives of the related assets. Estimated useful
lives are as follows   	
Computer equipment and software
3-4years   Office equipment
5years   Office furniture and fixtures
7years   Leasehold improvements
Life of lease   
40 Table of Contents   NOTES TO
CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTSContinued   In 2005, LanVision entered into a sixty-six month operating
lease for office space. In connection with the lease, the
property owned provided certain lease inducements to the
company, including a $326,000 build out allowance and use of the
premises for six months rent free. The company has accounted for
the value of these inducements by recording the build out
allowance as a leasehold improvement with a corresponding lease
incentive liability. The total amount of the lease payments are
amortized as rent expense on a straight line basis over the term
of the lease. The leasehold improvement asset and the lease
incentive liability are each amortized on a straight line basis
over the term of the lease to depreciation and as an offset to
rent expense, respectively.   Any timing differences between the actual monthly lease payments
and the straight line rent expense is recorded an adjustment to
the lease incentive liability.   Depreciation expense for 2005, 2004, and 2003 was $670,655,
$514,149, and $534,499, respectively.   Leased computer equipment and software meeting certain criteria
are capitalized and the present value of the related lease
payments is recorded as a liability. Depreciation of the
capitalized lease assets is computed on the straight-line method
over the term of the lease.   Normal repair and maintenance is expensed as incurred.
Replacements are capitalized and the property and equipment
accounts are relieved of the items being replaced or disposed
of, or if no longer of value. The related cost and accumulated
deprecation of the disposed assets are eliminated and any gain
or loss on disposition is included in the results of operations
in the year of disposal.   Capitalized
Software Development Costs   Software development costs are accounted for in accordance with
Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No86,
Accounting for the Costs of Software to be Sold, Leased or
Otherwise Marketed. Costs associated with the planning and
designing phase of software development, including coding and
testing activities necessary to establish technological
feasibility are classified as product research and development
and are expensed as incurred. Once technological feasibility has
been determined, a portion of the costs incurred in development,
including coding, testing, and product quality assurance, are
capitalized and subsequently reported at the lower of
unamortized cost or net realizable value. LanVision capitalized
approximately $1,450,000, $1,000,000, and $800,000 in 2005, 2004
and 2003, respectively.   Research and development expense, net of capitalized amounts,
was $2,733,293, $2,061,207, and $2,053,901 in 2005, 2004 and
2003, respectively.   Amortization is provided on a
product-by-product
basis over the estimated economic life of the software, not to
exceed three years, using the straight-line method. Amortization
commences when a product is available for general release to
customers. Unamortized capitalized costs determined to be in
excess of the net realizable value of a product are expensed at
the date of such determination. Amortization expense was
approximately $800,000, $633,000, and $500,000 in 2005, 2004,
and 2003, respectively.   Other
non-current assets   Other non-current assets at January31, 2006 and 2005
consist primarily of deferred tax assets relating to the net
operating loss carry forwards See Note4.   Accrued
Other Expenses   Accrued other expenses at January31, 2006, and 2005
include warranty reserves, accrued franchise and property taxes,
professional fees and other similar liabilities.   Income
Taxes   The provisions for income taxes are accounted for in accordance
with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No109,
Accounting for Income Taxes. Under the asset and
liability method of Statement109, deferred   
41 Table of Contents   NOTES TO
CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTSContinued   tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax
consequences attributable to differences between the financial
statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities
and their respective tax bases. Deferred tax assets and
liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to
apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary
differences are expected to be recovered or settled.   Stock
Options and Stock Appreciation Rights   Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No123,
Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation, establishes a
fair value method of financial accounting and reporting for
stock-based compensation plans. LanVision elected to continue to
account for stock options under the intrinsic value method
prescribed by Accounting Principles Board Opinion No25,
Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees and,
accordingly, has adopted the disclosure only provisions of
Statement123. At January31, 2006 LanVision had two
stock-based compensation plans, which are more fully disclosed
in Note7 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial
Statements. No stock-based compensation cost is reflected in the
net earnings, as all options granted under the plans had
exercise prices equal to the fair market value of the underlying
common stock on the date of grant. The table below illustrates
the effect on net earnings and earnings per share as if
LanVision had applied the fair value recognition provisions of
Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No123, to
stock-based employee compensation.   The Company is required to adopt the revised standards of
Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No123R,
Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation, effective the
first quarter of fiscal year 2006, which requires expensing the
fair value of the equity awards. Based on the number of
stock-based compensation equity awards currently outstanding,
the impact on operating expense in fiscal year 2006 is not
expected to be material in amount. However, future grants of
equity awards could have a material impact on reported expenses
depending upon the number, value and vesting period of future
awards.   Pro forma information regarding the net earnings and net
earnings per common share is required by the current
Statement123, and has been determined as if LanVision had
accounted for its stock options under the fair value method of
that Statement. The fair value of these options was estimated at
the date of grant using a Black-Scholes option pricing model
with the following weighted average assumptions for fiscal year
2005 risk-free interest rate of 425%, 2004 risk-free interest
rate of 425%, and 2003 risk-free interest rate of 250%; a
dividend yield of zeropercent; a volatility factor of the
expected market price of LanVisions Common Stock of 842
in 2005, 864 in 2004, and 916 in 2003 and a weighted average
expected life of the options of five years.   
42 Table of Contents   NOTES TO
CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTSContinued   The Black-Scholes option-pricing model was developed for use in
estimating the fair value of traded options that have no vesting
restrictions and are fully transferable. In addition, option
valuation models require the input of highly subjective
assumptions including the expected stock price volatility.
Because LanVisions stock options have characteristics
significantly different from those of traded options, and
because changes in the subjective input assumptions can
materially affect the fair value estimate, in LanVisions

Earnings Per Common Share   The net earnings per common share are computed in accordance
with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No128,
Earnings per Share. The basic net earnings per common
share are computed based on the weighted average number of
common shares outstanding during each period. The diluted net
earnings per common share reflects the potential dilution that
could occur if Stock Options, Stock Purchase Plan commitments
and Warrants were exercised into Common Stock, under certain
circumstances, that then would share in the earnings of
LanVision.   The following is the calculation of the basic and diluted net
earnings per share of common stock.

Operating
Leases   LanVision rents office and data center space and equipment under
noncancelable operating leases that expire at various times
through fiscal year 2010. Future minimum lease payments under
noncancelable operating leases for the next five fiscal years
are approximately as follows: 2006, $396,000; 2007, $363,000;
2008, $350,000; 2009, $342,000; 2010, $165,000 each year. Rent
expense was approximately $287,000, $253,000, and $229,000 for
fiscal years 2005, 2004, and 2003, respectively. In February
2005, LanVision entered into a sixty-six month lease for office
space. In connection with the lease, the property owner provided
a $326,000 build out allowance. As a further inducement to rent
the facilities, the owner provided the Company with the use of
the premises for six months rent free. The Company pays a base
rent and a proportional amount of the building operating
expenses, currently estimated at approximately $285,000 per
year. The Lease has no renewal provisions and predetermined
increases in the base rent in 2007 and again in 2009.   
3.
Long-term
Debt and Capitalized Leases   In July 2004, LanVision entered into a three-year working
capital term loan agreement. The long-term debt of $2,000,000 is
secured by all of the assets of LanVision and the loan agreement
restricts LanVision from incurring additional indebtedness for
borrowed money, including capitalized leases, etc. without
lender consent. The loan is repayable in two remaining annual
installments, which are due and payable of not less than
$1,000,000 by July30, 2006 and $1,000,000 by July30,
2007 and interest is payable quarterly, at the bank prime rate
at year-end 75%. In addition, LanVision is required to
maintain a minimum cash balance equal to the amount of the loan
through the earlier of the repayment or maturity of the loan on
July30, 2007. LanVision complied with all of the
provisions of its loan agreements during the period, except for
two covenants relating to the Fixed Charge Coverage and the
maximum capital expenditures at the end of the second quarter.
The bank waived the requirements and subsequently removed all of
such financial coverage covenants from the loan agreement.   In 1998, LanVision issued a $6,000,000 note. In connection with
the issuance of the note, LanVision issued Warrants to purchase
750,000shares of Common Stock of LanVision at
$387per share at any time through July16, 2008. The
Warrants are subject to customary antidilution and registration
rights provisions.   LanVision believes the fair market value of the long-term debt
approximates the carrying value based on the term, interest rate
and maturity that LanVision believes is currently available to
it.   During the third quarter of fiscal year 2005, LanVision acquired
additional computer equipment for the application-hosting
services data center, which are accounted for as capitalized
leases. The amount of the computer equipment leased assets is
$267,237. The lease is payable monthly in installments of
$8,192, through August 2008. The present value of the future
lease payments upon lease inception was $267,237 using the
interest rates implicit in the lease agreement at the inception
of the lease.

Income
Taxes   In 2005 and 2003, LanVision was subject to Alternative Minimum
Taxes.   The income tax benefit provision for income taxes differs from

the Federal net operating loss carry forward would not be
recognized totaling $2,058,394 $888,822 tax-benefit. An
adjustment of $888,822 was required to   
45 Table of Contents   NOTES TO
CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTSContinued   record the net operating loss carry forward deferred tax asset
to the appropriate amount. As the net operating loss carry
forward had a full valuation allowance recorded in the prior
year, there was no impact on the Consolidated Statement of
Income in 2003 resulting from this adjustment; however, the
adjustment is a component of the 2003 effective tax rate
reconciliation.   LanVision provides deferred income taxes for temporary
differences between assets and liabilities recognized for
financial reporting and income tax purposes. The income tax
effects of these temporary differences are as follows   	
Fiscal Year   2005   2004   Temporary items:

Equipment
1,986     Net deferred tax asset
1,875,000     978,000   In all fiscal years prior to 2003, LanVision established a full
valuation allowance against all of the deferred tax assets. As
of January31, 2006, LanVision reduced the valuation
allowance for the deferred tax assets primarily related to the
carry forward by $1,875,000 based upon reasonable future
earnings before income tax projections. A valuation allowance of
$8,350,683 is still required to reduce the deferred tax assets,
primarily relating to loss carry forwards, to a level currently
believed will be utilized to offset future earnings before
income taxes based upon the current backlog and forecasts over
the next two years. The valuation allowance is required due to
the inability to predict on a longer term basis that LanVision
will more likely than not attain levels of
profitability required to utilize additional loss carry forwards.   At January31, 2006, LanVision had a net operating loss
carry forward of approximately $28,000,000, which begins to
expire in 2013. LanVision also has an Alternative Minimum Tax
credit carry forward of approximately $74,000, which has an
unlimited carry forward period. Certain changes in stock
ownership can result in a limitation on the amount of net
operating loss carry forward that can be utilized each year.   
5.
Retirement
Plan   LanVision has established a 401k retirement plan that covers
all employees. Company contributions to the plan may be made at
the discretion of the Board of Directors. To date, no Company
contributions have been made to the plan. However, effective
February1, 2006, the Company began to match 100% up to the
first 4% of compensation deferred by each employee in the 401k
plan.

Compensation Plan which authorizes the Company to issue up to
1,000,000 equity awards Stock Options, Stock Appreciation
Rights SARs, and Restricted Stock to
directors and employees of the Company. At January31,
2006, Options to purchase 40,000shares of LanVision Common
Stock have been granted and 25,000 performance based SARs
have been granted and are outstanding under the Plan.   SARs are settled in Common Stock of the Company. Upon

Compensation Plan contains change of control provisions whereby
any outstanding equity awards under the plans subject to
vesting, which have not fully vested as of the date of the
change in control, shall automatically vest and become

is deemed to occur if there is a change in beneficial ownership,

representing 20% or more of the total of all of LanVisions
then outstanding voting securities, unless through a transaction
arranged by, or consummated with the prior approval of the Board
of Directors. Other change in control provisions relate to
mergers and acquisitions or a determination of change in control
by LanVisions Board of Directors.

Employee
Stock Purchase Plan   LanVision has an Employee Stock Purchase Plan under which
employees may purchase up to 500,000shares of Common
Stock. Under the plan, eligible employees may elect to
contribute, through payroll deductions, up to 10% of their base
pay to a trust during any plan year, July1 through
June30, of the following year. At June30 of each
year, the plan issues for the benefit of the employees shares of
Common Stock at the lesser of a85% of the Fair Market
Value of the Common Stock on July1, of the prior year, or
b85% of the Fair Market Value of the Common Stock on
June30, of the current year. At January31, 2006,
366,525shares remain that can be purchased under the plan.   During fiscal year 2005, 12,006shares were purchased at
the price of $226per share; 2004, 21,468shares were
purchased at the price of $166per share; and in 2003,

STATEMENTSContinued   and records the invoicing as deferred revenues and recognizes
the revenues ratably over the term of the maintenance
agreements. LanVisions standard agreements with its
customers usually include intellectual property infringement
indemnification provisions to indemnify them from and against
third-party claims, and for liabilities, damages, and expenses
arising out of LanVisions operation of its business or any
negligent act or omission of LanVision.   Application-hosting
Services   LanVision enters into long-term agreements to provide document
imaging/management and workflow services to its healthcare
customers on an outsourced basis from a central data center.
LanVision guarantees specific up-time and
response time performance standards, which, if not
met may result in reduced revenues, as a penalty, for the month
in which the standards are not met.   Employment
Agreements   LanVision has entered into employment agreements with its
officers and employees that generally provide annual salary, a
minimum bonus, discretionary bonus, stock incentive provisions,
and severance arrangements.   Reserved
Common Stock   LanVision has reserved 1,802,692shares of the Common Stock
authorized for issuance in connection with various Equity Award
Plans and the Employee Stock Purchase Plan and
750,000shares for the Warrants issued in connection with
the 1998 long-term debt.   Litigation   There are, from time to time, claims pending against LanVision
and its subsidiary. Based on a review of such litigation with
legal counsel, LanVision believes any resulting liability would
not have a material affect on LanVisions consolidated
financial position or results of operations.
