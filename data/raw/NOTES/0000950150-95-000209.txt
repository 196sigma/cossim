REPORT OF ERNST & YOUNG LLP, INDEPENDENT AUDITORS
To the Shareholders and Board of Directors
The Times Mirror Company
We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of The Times Mirror
Company as of December 31, 1994 and 1993, and the related consolidated
statements of operations, shareholders' equity and cash flows for each of the
three years in the period ended December 31, 1994. Our audits also included the
financial statement schedule listed in the Index to Financial Statements and
Financial Statement Schedules. These financial statements and schedule are the
responsibility of the company management. Our responsibility is to express an
opinion on these financial statements and schedule based on our audits.
We conducted our audits in accordance with generally accepted auditing
standards. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material
misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting
the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes
assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by
management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.
We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in
all material respects, the consolidated financial position of The Times Mirror
Company at December 31, 1994 and 1993, and the consolidated results of its
operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended
December 31, 1994, in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles.
Also, in our opinion, the related financial statement schedule, when considered
in relation to the basic financial statements taken as a whole, presents fairly
in all material respects the information set forth therein.
As discussed in Notes 9 and 13 to the consolidated financial statements, in 1992
the company changed its method of accounting for income taxes and postretirement
benefits other than pensions.

THE TIMES MIRROR COMPANY
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
NOTE 1 -- SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
Principles of Consolidation. The consolidated financial statements include
the accounts of the company and its subsidiaries after elimination of all
significant intercompany transactions and balances. Affiliated companies in
which the company owns a 20 percent to 50 percent interest are accounted for by
the equity method.
Reclassifications and Restatements. Certain amounts in previously issued
financial statements have been reclassified to conform to the 1994 presentation.
Financial information in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements has been
restated to exclude discontinued operations, except where noted.
Changes in Accounting Principle. Effective January 1, 1992, the company
adopted new accounting principles for income taxes and postretirement benefits.
These changes in accounting are described in Note 9 and Note 13, respectively.
Cash and Cash Equivalents. Cash equivalents consist of investments that are
readily convertible into cash and generally have original maturities of three
months or less. Cash equivalents of $39,813,000 and $20,418,000 at December 31,
1994 and 1993, respectively, were primarily commercial paper and repurchase
agreements.
Under the company cash management system, the bank notifies the company
daily of checks presented for payment against its primary disbursing accounts.
The company transfers funds from other sources such as short-term investments or
commercial paper issuance to cover the checks presented for payment. This
program results in a book cash overdraft in the primary disbursing accounts as a
result of checks outstanding. The book overdraft, which was reclassified to
accounts payable, was $54,263,000 and $41,733,000 at December 31, 1994 and 1993,
respectively.
Inventories. Inventories are carried at the lower of cost or market and are
determined under the first-in, first-out method for books and certain finished
products, and under the last-in, first-out method for newsprint, paper and
certain other inventories.
Property, Plant and Equipment. Property, plant and equipment are carried on
the basis of cost. Maintenance and repairs are charged to expense as incurred.
Additions, improvements and replacements are capitalized.
Depreciation is provided on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful
lives as follows:
Buildings. 10-55 years
Machinery and equipment. 2-20 years
Leasehold improvements. Lesser of useful life or lease term
Goodwill and Other Intangibles. Goodwill recognized in business
combinations accounted for as purchases subsequent to October 31, 1970
$718,840,000 at December 31, 1994, and $700,904,000 at December 31, 1993 net of
accumulated amortization of $168,904,000 and $145,295,000, respectively is
being amortized primarily over a period of 40 years. Goodwill arising from
business combinations consummated prior to November 1, 1970 is not being
amortized because, in the opinion of management, it has not diminished in value.
Goodwill amortization expense amounted to $23,973,000 for 1994, $20,327,000 for
1993 and $18,538,000 for 1992.
Other intangibles arising in connection with acquisitions are being
amortized on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives ranging
from 3 to 21 years. Accumulated amortization was $100,747,000 and $98,597,000 at
December 31, 1994 and 1993, respectively.
The company assesses on an ongoing basis the recoverability of intangible
assets, including goodwill, based on estimates of future undiscounted cash flows
for the applicable business compared to net book value.
27
29
THE TIMES MIRROR COMPANY
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED
If the future undiscounted cash flow estimate were less than net book value, net
book value would then be reduced to the undiscounted cash flow estimate. The
company also evaluates the amortization periods of assets, including goodwill
and other intangible assets, to determine whether events or circumstances
warrant revised estimates of useful lives.
Deferred Charges. Deferred charges for book design and teaching aids and
training material preparation and duplicating costs are written off over the
estimated product life as the products are sold. Magazine subscription selling
expenses are charged to expense over the same period as the related revenue is
earned.
Revenue Recognition. Revenues from certain products sold with the right of
return, principally books, are recognized net of a provision for estimated
returns. Revenues from newspaper and magazine subscriptions and professional
service fee annual subscriptions are deferred as unearned income at the time of
the sale. A pro rata share of the newspaper and magazine subscription price is
included in revenue as products are delivered to subscribers. Professional
service fee annual subscription revenues are recognized on a straight-line basis
over the life of the subscription service.
Earnings Per Share. Earnings per share computations are based upon the
weighted average number of shares of common stock and dilutive common stock
equivalents outstanding during the year. Fully diluted earnings per share are
the same as the earnings per share indicated.
Retirement Plans and Postretirement Benefits. The company has defined
benefit pension plans and various other contributory and noncontributory
retirement plans covering substantially all employees. In general, benefits
under the defined benefit plans are based on years of service and the employee
compensation during the last five years of employment. In determining net
periodic pension expense income, prior service costs are amortized on a
straight-line basis over 10 years. The defined benefit plans are generally
funded on a current basis in accordance with the Employee Retirement Income
Security Act of 1974. An Employee Stock Ownership Plan ESOP provides benefits
in conjunction with certain defined benefits, and the fair value of ESOP assets
is recognized as an offset to required funding. The majority of the company
employees are covered by one defined benefit plan. Funding is not expected to be
required for this plan in the near future as this plan is overfunded.
Postretirement health care benefits provided by the company are unfunded
and cover employees hired before January 1, 1993, or approximately half of the
company current employees. The various plans have significantly different
provisions for lifetime maximums, retiree cost-sharing, health care providers,
prescription drug coverage and other benefits. Postretirement life insurance
benefits are generally insured by life insurance policies and cover employees
who retired on or before December 31, 1993. Life insurance benefits vary by
plan, ranging from $1,000 to $250,000. Certain employees become eligible for the
postretirement health care benefits if they meet minimum age and service
requirements and retire from full-time, active service.
Voluntary Employee Beneficiary Association. The company maintains a
Voluntary Employee Beneficiary Association VEBA trust to fund certain health
care benefits. At December 31, 1994 and 1993, the VEBA trust balance of
$20,112,000 and $53,949,000, respectively, is included in Prepaid expenses.
NOTE 2 -- CAPITAL STOCK
Shares of Series A and Series C common stock are identical, except with
respect to voting rights, restrictions on transfer of Series C shares and the
right to convert Series C shares into Series A shares. Series A shares are
entitled to one vote per share and Series C shares are entitled to ten votes per
share. Series C shares are subject to mandatory conversion into Series A shares
upon transfer to any person other than a Permitted Transferee as defined in
the company Certificate of Incorporation or upon the occurrence of certain
regulatory events. Series B common stock is entitled to one-tenth vote per share
and is available for

common stock issuance transactions, such as underwritten public offerings and
acquisitions. The preferred stock is issuable in series under such terms and
conditions as the board of directors may determine. See Note 18 for information
on the company new capital structure.
NOTE 3 -- ACQUISITION
On October 30, 1992, the company acquired Wm. C. Brown Communications,
Inc., a leading publisher of college textbooks. This acquisition was accounted
for by the purchase method and resulted in a non-cash transaction of $30,112,000
for liabilities assumed. The operations of this company are reflected in the
company financial statements from the date of acquisition. This acquisition
resulted in goodwill of $66,653,000, which is being amortized over 40 years. Pro
forma results for 1992, assuming this acquisition occurred on January 1, are not
materially different from the results reported.
NOTE 4 -- RESTRUCTURING CHARGES
The company charged the estimated costs related to restructuring actions
against operations in 1992 and 1993. Remaining liabilities of $38,368,000
related to these restructuring charges are included in the consolidated balance
sheet at December 31, 1994, and primarily represent severance costs as well as
lease payments which will be paid over lease periods extending to 2002.
During 1993, the company recorded restructuring charges of $80,164,000
$47,724,000 after taxes, or 37 cents per share. More than half of this amount
was for severance or pay-related actions and approximately forty percent related
to leased facilities, product line changes and other costs necessary to
implement the company plans. The remainder included various asset write-offs.
During 1992, the company recorded restructuring charges of $202,700,000
$123,248,000 after taxes, or 96 cents per share. Nearly two-thirds of this
amount was for severance or pay-related actions. Approximately fifteen percent
was for leased facilities, while the remainder related to product line changes
and other costs necessary to implement the restructuring plan at Matthew Bender.
NOTE 5 -- NONRECURRING GAINS
During 1994, the company recognized a gain of $11,872,000, or $4,215,000 3
cents per share after applicable income taxes, on the divestiture of a small
elementary-high school book publishing operation. The company also sold

61% in 1994 and 33% in 1993. Short-term borrowings of $363,680,000 at December
31, 1994 carried a weighted average interest rate of 61%. The company has
agreements with several domestic and foreign banks for unsecured revolving lines
of credit which support its commercial paper and short-term borrowings. The
domestic agreements, which were canceled on February 9, 1995, provided for
borrowings up to $480,000,000 at the banks' base rates. The commitment fee was
3/20 of one percent per annum. The foreign agreements, which were terminated
effective March 17, 1995, provide for borrowings up to $150,000,000 at interest
rates based on, at the company option, London Interbank Offered Rates LIBOR,
certificate of deposit rates or the bank base rate. The commitment fee was
1/16 of one percent per annum. As of December 31, 1994, the company had not
borrowed under these agreements. In addition, the company has $49,037,000 of
unused standby letters of credit at December 31, 1994.
The company completed a tender offer in December 1994 and an exchange offer
in January 1995. The tender offer for its Medium-Term Notes and its three other

related costs of the tender, aggregating $20,749,000, or $12,232,000 after
taxes, were recorded as an extraordinary loss. The exchange offer resulted in

the 7 1/8% and 7 3/8% Debentures for similar debentures bearing interest rates

is being assumed by Cox Communications, Inc. Cox as part of the reorganization
described in Note 18. This debt was transferred to Cox on February 1, 1995.
The 8 7/8% Notes due on February 1, 1998 were called and repaid on February
1, 1995.
The company agreements with banks contain restrictive provisions relating
primarily to levels of indebtedness and maintenance of net worth. Under the most
restrictive of these agreements, consolidated debt may not exceed 135% of
consolidated net worth, and consolidated net worth must be at least
$1,250,000,000. Upon termination of the unsecured revolving lines of credit in
the first quarter of 1995, the company most restrictive debt covenant limits
secured debt issuances and guarantees to ten percent of shareholders' equity.

NOTE 11 -- FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS
The company has two interest rate swap agreements, one for $150,000,000
expiring in 2010 and one for $100,000,000 expiring in 2023. These agreements
exchange payments to the company at fixed rates of 7 1/8% and 7 3/8 respectively, for payments by the company at a variable rate based generally on
LIBOR, beginning in 1995. These payments will be recognized as an adjustment to
interest expense related to the debt. The fair value of these swaps is the
amount at which they could be settled, based on estimates of mark-to-market
rates. At December 31, 1994, the company would pay $13,000,000 to terminate its
interest rate swap agreements. This amount is not recognized in the financial
statements.
The fair value of long-term debt at December 31, 1994, based primarily on
the company current refinancing rates for publicly issued fixed rate debt with
comparable maturities, was $214,774,000, compared with a carrying value of
$246,462,000. The carrying value of short-term debt at December 31, 1994
approximates fair value due to the short maturity periods for these instruments.
NOTE 12 -- STOCK OPTION AND AWARD PLANS
The company has various stock option plans and a Key Employee Long-Term
Incentive Plan Incentive Plan under which options may be granted to purchase
shares of Series A common stock at a price equal to the fair market value at the
date of grant. Options granted prior to December 27, 1991 had a purchase price
equal to 75 percent of the fair market value at the date of grant. The Incentive
Plan allows for the granting of incentive stock options, nonqualified stock
options and deferred cash incentive awards. Options that are not exercised
expire ten years from the date of grant. Options generally vest over a four-year
period. Certain stock options vest nine years and nine months from the date of
grant, and accelerated vesting for these options is

Options Exercisable December 31, 1994. 1,199,259   $1946  to $3793
At December 31, 1994, there were 402,997 options outstanding with purchase
prices equal to 75 percent of the fair market value at the date of grant. At
December 31, 1994 and 1993, there were 1,018,710 shares and 1,508,824 shares,
respectively, reserved for future grants under the various plans.
In connection with the reorganization described in Note 18, the number of
options and the option price will be adjusted based on the average market price
for a short period before and after the reorganization is completed. The
adjustment will increase the number of options outstanding and will decrease the
option exercise price in order to preserve the economic value of the outstanding
options.
The company also has a restricted stock plan that provides for the sale of
1,600,000 shares of the company common stock to key employees, including
officers, at a price equal to par value. The Incentive Plan generally replaced
the restricted stock sales. At December 31, 1994 and 1993, there were 1,203,925
shares of Series A common stock reserved for future sales. The company expects
that future sales will not be significant.

respectively. Projected benefit obligations decreased by approximately
$112,406,000 at December 31, 1994 primarily as a result of the change in the
discount rate.
Plan assets include the company common stock, other listed stocks, and
corporate and government fixed-income securities. The fair value of plan assets
attributable to the company common stock at December 31, 1994 and 1993 was
$197,400,000 and $192,085,000, respectively, of which $169,113,000 and
$161,995,000, respectively, relate to the ESOP. Benefits provided by the ESOP
are coordinated with certain pension benefits. At December 31, 1994, the ESOP
held 3,089,548 shares of Series A common stock and 2,292,265 shares of Series C
common stock. The ESOP currently covers approximately two-thirds of the
company employees.
Substantially all employees over age 21 with one year of service are
eligible to participate in the company Savings Plus Plan. Eligible employees
may contribute from 1 percent to 13 percent of their basic compensation. The
company makes matching contributions equal to 50 percent of employee before-tax
contributions from 1 percent to 6 percent. Employees may choose among five
investment options, including a company common stock fund, for investing their
contributions and the company matching contribution. Defined contribution plan
expense, primarily related to the Savings Plus Plan, was $21,553,000 for 1994 23,776,000 for 1993 and $22,676,000 for 1992.

The assumed health care cost trend rate can significantly affect
postretirement expense and liabilities. An increase of 1 percent in the health
care cost trend rate would increase 1994 net periodic postretirement expense by
$1,467,000 and increase the accumulated postretirement benefit obligations as of
December 31, 1994 by $14,368,000.
The company adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 106
SFAS 106 Employers' Accounting for Postretirement Benefits Other Than
Pensions, and recorded a cumulative charge of $218,307,000 $133,376,000 net of
taxes, or $104 per share as of January 1, 1992. SFAS 106 requires that
postretirement health care and life insurance be charged to expense over the
period the benefits are earned. The effect of this change in accounting
principle was to increase postretirement expense in 1992 by $20,221,000
$12,133,000 net of taxes, or 9 cents per share.

NOTE 17 -- DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS
As a result of the reorganization described in Note 18, the company cable
television operations are reported as discontinued operations for all years
presented. The reorganization was completed on February 1, 1995.
During 1993, the company sold its four broadcast television stations to
Argyle Television Holdings, Inc. Argyle. The sale of KTVI-TV, an ABC affiliate
in St. Louis, Missouri, and WVTM-TV, an NBC affiliate in Birmingham, Alabama,
was completed in July. The sale of its remaining two stations, KDFW-TV in
Dallas, Texas, and KTBC-TV in Austin, Texas, both CBS affiliates, was completed
near the end of the year. The sale of the four stations resulted in an after-tax
gain of $131,702,000, net of income tax expense of $76,928,000, or $102 per
share. The broadcast television operations are reported as discontinued
operations for all years presented.

NOTE 18 -- REORGANIZATION
On February 1, 1995, the company completed the merger of its cable
television operations with Cox Communications, Inc. Cox and completed the
transfer of all its non-cable operations into a newly formed entity, New TMC,
Inc., as part of a tax-free reorganization. New TMC, Inc. was then renamed The
Times Mirror Company. The company expects to record a gain of approximately $16
billion on the cable television transaction during the first quarter of 1995.
The company borrowed $1306 billion shortly before the merger. The $1306
billion of debt, as well as $573 million of the company publicly held notes
which were not repurchased or exchanged prior to the merger, was assumed by Cox
on February 1, 1995. The company retained the cash proceeds from the debt
issuance. About one-third of the proceeds were used to retire the short-term
borrowings issued to finance the debt tender offer and to redeem the company
$100 million 8 7/8% Notes which were called on February 1, 1995. Approximately
$125 million of the proceeds are being used to retire commercial paper
borrowings, which are being paid off as they mature, through March 1995. As of
February 1, 1995, the company had total debt of approximately $2812 million,
including $347 million of commercial paper and $2465 million of long-term
debt. Cash of approximately $659 million as of February 1, 1995, primarily
representing the cash remaining after the aforementioned debt payouts, is
invested in short-term money market instruments with a weighted average interest
rate of 58%.
On February 1, 1995, the company commercial paper program was terminated
as a result of the merger, since those arrangements were established by the
predecessor to the company, which was merged with Cox.
In addition to assuming debt and accrued interest of approximately $1364
billion, Cox will issue between 48,806,033 shares and 59,651,818 shares of their
Class A common stock to the non-controlling shareholders of the company, which
excludes all Chandler Trust shareholders. This stock has an estimated aggregate
fair value of $932,000,000. Due to certain constraints imposed by the terms of
the Chandler Trusts, in lieu of common stock of Cox Cable, the Chandler Trusts
will receive non-voting, Series A cumulative preferred stock with an aggregate
stated value of approximately $412,000,000 with a dividend rate of approximately
9 percent. This preferred stock is expected to be issued between March 17, 1995
and May 3, 1995, but earns dividends from March 1, 1995. In connection with the
settlement of reorganization-related litigation, all non-controlling
shareholders are being offered the opportunity to exchange shares of Series A or
Series C common stock for shares of Series B cumulative preferred stock. This
offering commenced on February 16, 1995. The Series B preferred stock will have
a dividend rate of 65% and will earn dividends from March 1, 1995. The

NOTE 19 -- COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES
The company and its subsidiaries are defendants in actions for libel and
other matters arising out of their business operations. In addition, from time
to time, the company and its subsidiaries are involved as parties in various
governmental and administrative proceedings, including environmental matters.
The company does not believe that any such proceedings currently pending will
have a material adverse effect on its consolidated financial position, although

could have a material impact on results of operations for that period.
The company committed up to $200 million to a partnership with Cox. The
partnership, which was formed on February 1, 1995, is expected to develop and
purchase substantial investment interests in theme-based cable television
programming operations. The $200 million is expected to be contributed as
capital calls are made.
