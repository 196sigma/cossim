NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
In thousands of dollars, except per-share amounts 1. ORGANIZATION AND BASIS OF PRESENTATION
Applied Graphics Technologies, Inc. the Company is a provider of
digital prepress services to magazine publishers, advertising agencies,
entertainment companies and catalog retailers. In addition, the Company provides
outsourced, on-site prepress and related services to third parties and advanced
digital imaging services, such as digital archiving and distribution services,
and commencing in December 1996, duplication and distribution services of
advertising content for the broadcast industry. The Company was incorporated in
Delaware on December 12, 1995. Applied Printing Technologies, L.P. Applied
Printing, an entity beneficially owned by the Chairman of the Board of
Directors of the Company the Chairman and the Chief Executive Officer of the
Company the CEO, was issued 100 shares of common stock and became the
Company sole stockholder.
On April 16, 1996 the Offering Date, the Company Registration
Statement on Form S-1 under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, relating to
the initial public offering the Offering of the Company Common Stock, was
declared effective. Upon the offering being declared effective, the Company
acquired substantially all of the assets and certain related liabilities
relating to the prepress, digital imaging services and related businesses of
Applied Printing collectively, the Prepress Business in exchange for
9,309,900 shares of the Company Common Stock and $37,000 of additional
consideration Additional Consideration comprised of i the assumption by
the Company of the principal amount of collateralized senior indebtedness to
Applied Printing primary institutional lender the Institutional Senior
Indebtedness of $21,000 and ii the issuance of a promissory note by the
Company to Applied Printing the Applied Printing Note of $16,000. The
Company received net proceeds of $46,103,000 from the Offering, of which
$21,000,000 was used to repay Institutional Senior Indebtedness and $16,000,000
was used to invest in short-term investments to support a standby letter of
credit that collateralized the Applied Printing Note. At December 31, 1996,
Applied Printing owned approximately 60% of the Company outstanding common
stock.
The acquisition of the Prepress Business has been accounted for in a
manner similar to a pooling of interests. Accordingly, the financial statements
of the Company reflect the combined results of operations of the Prepress
Business through April 16, 1996, and the results of the Company from April 17,
1996, through December 31, 1996. The financial statements through the Offering
Date have been prepared by combining the assets, liabilities, results of
operations and cash flows of the specific divisions that comprise the Prepress
Business. Historically, these specific divisions have operated as separate
business units and maintained their own books and records. Through the effective
date, Applied Printing managed the cash and financing requirements of all of its
divisions centrally; as such, the interest expense, and related intercompany
borrowing, represent an allocation of Applied Printing interest expense and
the related debt. As discussed in Note 9, this allocation of debt is presented
as an intercompany borrowing. Additionally, Applied Printing and other related
parties had historically provided certain corporate, general and administrative
services to the Prepress Business including general management, treasury,
financial reporting, and legal services. Accordingly, the financial statements
include an allocation of expenses for such services. The combined financial
position and combined results of operations of the Prepress Business may differ
from results that may have been achieved had the Prepress Business operated as
an independent entity. 2. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
CASH EQUIVALENTS: Cash equivalents include highly liquid investments with
a maturity of less than three months at the time of acquisition.
MARKETABLE SECURITIES: Marketable securities consist of United States
government obligations that mature in January 1997. These securities support a
letter of credit that collateralizes the Applied Printing Note. In accordance
with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards SFAS No. 115, Accounting for
Certain Investments in Debt and Equity Securities, these securities have been
classified as held to maturity and are recorded at amortized cost, which
approximates fair value due to their short-term maturity.                    22
25
INVENTORY: Raw materials are valued at the lower of cost cost being
determined on a weighted average basis or market. Work-in-process, consisting
of labor and materials on partially completed projects, is recorded at cost
specific identification but not in excess of net realizable value.
PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT: Property, plant and equipment is stated at
cost. Depreciation is computed principally on the straight-line method over the
estimated useful lives of the assets, which generally range from 30 years for
buildings to three years for computer software and vehicles. Leasehold
improvements and amounts recorded under capital leases are amortized on the
straight-line method over the terms of the leases or their estimated useful
lives.
REVENUE RECOGNITION: Revenue is recognized at the time projects are
shipped or transmitted to the customer. Revenue for digital archiving services
is recognized on a per-image basis as items are scanned.
GOODWILL: Goodwill is being amortized on the straight-line method over
periods ranging from 7 to 20 years. The Company continually evaluates the
carrying value of goodwill by comparing it to the undiscounted expected future
cash flows to be generated. Goodwill is written off when there has been a loss
of value.
INCOME TAXES: The Prepress Business was treated as a partnership for
Federal and state income tax purposes prior to the Offering Date and was not
subject to tax. A provision for income taxes is included in the Company
Statement of Operations only for the period subsequent to the Offering Date.
EARNINGS PER SHARE OF COMMON STOCK: Earnings per share of common stock are
computed by dividing net income by the weighted average of the number of shares
of common stock and common stock equivalents, where dilutive, outstanding.
LONG-LIVED ASSETS: In accordance with the provisions of Statement of
Financial Accounting Standards SFAS No. 121, Accounting for the Impairment of
Long-Lived Assets and for Long-Lived Assets to Be Disposed of, the Company
reviews long-lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in
circumstances indicate that the carrying value of such assets may not be
recoverable.
ESTIMATES: The preparation of these financial statements in conformity
with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make
estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and
liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of
the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses
during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.
RECLASSIFICATION OF PRIOR YEARS' FINANCIAL STATEMENTS: Certain prior-year
amounts in the accompanying financial statements have been reclassified to
conform with the 1996 presentation. 3. ACQUISITION
On December 3, 1996, the Company acquired the assets of SpotLink, Inc.
SpotLink, a company that reproduces and distributes commercials to broadcast
and cable media, for a purchase price of approximately $8,500. The assets,
consisting primarily of duplication equipment, were acquired for 539,683 shares
of the Company common stock.
The acquisition was accounted for using the purchase method of accounting.
Accordingly, the assets and liabilities of SpotLink have been recorded at their
estimated fair values at the date of acquisition. The excess of the purchase
price over the fair value of the net assets acquired was $6,716 and has been
recorded as goodwill, which is being amortized on the straight-line method over
20 years. The results of operations of SpotLink have been included in the
Statement of Operations since the date of the acquisition.                    23

The following unaudited pro forma information combines the results of
operations of the Company and SpotLink for the years ended December 31, 1996 and
1995, calculated as if the acquisition had occurred on January 1, 1995. The pro
forma information has been prepared for comparative purposes only and does not
purport to be indicative of the results of operations that would have occurred
had the acquisition been consummated at the beginning of 1996 and 1995 or of

On April 16, 1996, as part of the acquisition of the assets of the
Prepress Business, the Company issued a promissory note to Applied Printing in
the amount of $16,000. A principal payment in the amount of $14,400 was made
during 1996. The remaining balance of $1,600 was repaid in February 1997. This
obligation, which bore interest at the rate of 4145% per annum, was
collateralized by a letter of credit. The Company incurred interest charges of
$295 during the 1996 period. 8. LONG-TERM DEBT
Long-term debt at December 31 consisted of the following                                1996    1995
362% - 8% notes payable due 1997 through 2000        $ 377   $ 853

Total                             $6,005   $ 853
In August 1996 the Company obtained a $10,000 revolving credit facility
that is collateralized by the Company trade receivables. The credit facility
is a two-year variable-rate facility with a major financial institution. Under
the terms of the facility, the Company must comply with certain covenants
related to tangible net worth, ratio of debt to tangible net worth, and debt
service coverage ratio. At December 31, 1996, the Company was in compliance with
all covenants. Interest on funds borrowed is the prime lending rate, which at
December 31, 1996, was 825%. The Company also has the option to borrow at LIBOR
plus 225%. Borrowings under this LIBOR provision may have maturities of 30, 90,
or 180 days. At December 31, 1996, there were no outstanding borrowings under
the LIBOR provision. The average variable rate on this revolving credit facility
during the period in 1996 was 825%. As of December 31, 1996, under the most
restrictive covenant of the revolving credit facility, approximately $10,000  
were available for the payment of dividends.                    25

Total long-term debt                           $6,005
9. INTERCOMPANY BORROWINGS
The Prepress Business had been financed principally through advances from
Applied Printing. Historically, Applied Printing had financed all of its
operations, including those of the Prepress Business, with Institutional Senior
Indebtedness, borrowings from the Daily News, L.P. the Daily News see Note
13, and borrowings from the majority limited partner collectively,
Borrowings.
Prior to the Offering Date the financial statements include an allocation
of Applied Printing interest expense and related Borrowings. Applied
Printing interest expense related to the Borrowings had been allocated to the
Prepress Business based on the ratio of net assets of the Prepress Business,
before an allocation of intercompany debt, to the sum of the total consolidated
net assets of Applied Printing plus the Applied Printing debt that is not
directly attributable to specific divisions within Applied Printing. The
intercompany borrowing amounts reflected in the financial statements represent
derived amounts which have been computed by applying Applied Printing weighted
average interest rate to the allocated interest expense, calculated using the
methodology discussed above. The weighted average interest rates during the
period ended April 16, 1996, and the year ended December 1995, were 108% and
89%, respectively The Company incurred interest charges of $944, $2,683, and
$1,992 for the period ended April 16, 1996, and the years ended December 31,
1995 and 1994, respectively. 10. LEASES
The Company leases certain property and equipment used in its operations
under agreements that are classified as both capital and operating leases. Such
agreements generally include provisions for inflation-based rate adjustments
and, in the case of leases for buildings and office space, payments of certain
operating expenses and property taxes.                    26

Future minimum rental payments required under capital leases and operating
leases that have initial or remaining noncancelable lease terms in excess of one
year are as follows                              Capital   Operating
Leases    Leases

Total rental expense under operating leases amounted to $7,578, $12,106,
and $9,241 for the years ended December 31, 1996, 1995, and 1994, respectively.
In 1996, the Company entered into sale and leaseback arrangements that are
recorded as operating leases. The gain from these sale and leaseback
arrangements has been deferred and is being recognized in income as a credit
against future rental expenses. At December 31, 1996, the remaining balance of
the deferred gain totaling $233 is included in Other Liabilities in the
accompanying Balance Sheets. 11. INCOME TAXES
The Company accounts for income taxes under the provisions of Statement of
Financial Accounting Standards SFAS No. 109, Accounting for Income Taxes,
which requires the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes.
Under the asset and liability method, deferred taxes are recognized based on the
expected future tax consequences of events that have been included in the
financial statements or tax returns by applying currently enacted statutory tax
rates applicable to future years to differences between the financial statement
and tax bases of assets and liabilities.                    27
30
The Prepress Business was treated as a partnership for Federal and state
income tax purposes prior to the Offering Date and was not subject to tax. At
the date of the Offering, the Company recorded the applicable deferred tax
assets related to the differences between financial statement and tax basis of
the assets and liabilities of the Prepress Business. These deferred tax assets
were entirely offset by a valuation allowance. A provision for income taxes is
included in the Company Statement of Operations only for the period subsequent
to the Offering Date.
The components of the provision for income taxes were as follows                                     1996
Current:
Federal                                 $ 2,287
State                                    927
Total current                               3,214
Deferred:
Federal                                 2,349
Total provision for income taxes                    $  865
The provision for income taxes varied from the Federal statutory income
tax rate due to the following                                     1996
Taxes at statutory rate                        $ 3,679
State income taxes, net of Federal tax benefit               612
Change in valuation allowance for Federal deferred tax assets      3,870
Meals and entertainment expenses                      252
Other - net                                192
Provision for income taxes                       $  865
Statutory rate                               34%
Effective rate                                8    The components of the net deferred tax asset at December 31, 1996, and
April 16, 1996, were as follows                           December 31,   April 16,
1996       1996
Deferred tax assets:
Obligations under capital leases            $  639     $  734
Property, plant, and equipment               679       220
Accrued expenses                     1,414      2,092
Other liabilities                     300      1,615
Other assets                        198       290
Total deferred tax assets                3,230      4,951
Valuation allowance                    881     4,951
Net deferred tax asset                 $ 2,349     $   0
28
31
There were no deferred tax liabilities at December 31, 1996, and April 16,
1996. A valuation allowance was established at the date of initially recording
the deferred tax assets associated with the acquisition of the Prepress
Business. Due to the Prepress Business having historically incurred losses, the
valuation allowance was deemed necessary due to the uncertainty relating to the
Company ability to utilize these benefits in the future. During the period
ended December 31, 1996, the Company reduced the valuation allowance by $3,870
for Federal and $200 for state deferred tax assets. Based on operating earnings
during 1996 and the Company expectations of future earnings from established
contracts and relationships, the Company believes that it is more likely than
not that the benefit associated with Federal deferred tax assets will be
realized in the future and therefore has not established a valuation allowance
for Federal deferred tax assets at December 31, 1996. Based on the uncertainty
associated with the ability to utilize state benefits, the Company believes it
is not more likely than not that these benefits will be realized in the future
and therefore has established a valuation allowance. 12. STOCK OPTIONS
In 1996, the Board of Directors and stockholders approved a Stock Option
Plan. Under such plan, options are granted to key employees of the Company to
purchase common stock of the Company. Options granted under the plan, which have
a term of ten years, become exercisable over a five year period in varying
amounts, but in no event less than 5% or more than 25% in any year for any
individual optionee. On the date of the Offering, 2,375,000 options were granted
with an exercise price of $1200 per share. Additional grants were made in 1996
for 14,000 shares and 40,000 shares with an exercise price of $1663 and $1525,
respectively. Also in 1996, the Board of Directors approved a Non-employee
Directors' Nonqualified Stock Option Plan. Under such plan, options are granted
to members of the Board of Directors who are not employees of the Company.
Options granted under the plan become exercisable over a two year period and
have a term of ten years. On the date of the Offering, 100,000 options were
granted with an exercise price of $1200. The plan also provides for an
additional 5,000 options to be granted to non-employee directors on each
subsequent anniversary date of having first become a member of the Board of
Directors. Such future option grants will have an exercise price equal to the
fair market value of the common stock on the date of grant and are fully vested
at grant.
The two plans call for a combined maximum of 4,200,000 shares of the
Company common stock to be available for issuance upon exercise of options.
During 1996, 35,000 and 3,000 options with an exercise price of $1200 and
$1663, respectively, were forfeited and became available for future issuance.
The weighted average exercise price of options outstanding at the end of the
year, options granted during the year, and options forfeited during the year was
$1207, $1207, and $1237, respectively. No options were exercisable as of
December 31, 1996, and none expired or were exercised during 1996.
The Company accounts for the issuance of stock options under the
provisions of Accounting Principles Board Opinion APB No. 25, Accounting for
Stock Issued to Employees, which requires compensation cost to be measured at
the date of grant based on the intrinsic value of the options granted. The
intrinsic value of an option is equal to the difference between the market price
of the common stock on the date of grant and the exercise price of the option.
There was no compensation cost recognized by the Company on the options granted
in 1996.
In 1995, Statement of Financial Accounting Standards SFAS No. 123,
Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation, was issued. SFAS No. 123 provides for
an alternative measurement of compensation cost based on the fair value of the
options granted. The fair value of an option is based on the intrinsic value as
well as the time value of the option. The fair value of stock options granted
was estimated on the grant dates using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model
and the following assumptions: a risk-free interest rate of 675%; an expected
life of 6 years; expected volatility of 5394%; and no expected dividends. The
weighted-average fair value of the options issued by the Company in 1996 was
$17,985. Had the Company elected to account for the issuance of stock options
under SFAS No. 123, the compensation cost would have been $2,511 for the year
ended December 31, 1996. The pro forma net income, primary earnings per share,
and fully diluted earnings per share for the year ended December 31, 1996,
calculated as if the Company had elected to account for the issuance of stock
options under SFAS No. 123, were $8,298, $066, and $063, respectively.                    29

13. RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS
In addition to the business it transacts with Applied Printing, the
Company also does business and shares services with entities beneficially owned
by the Chairman and the CEO, including the Daily News and U.S. News. The Company
also utilizes the travel-related services of ZWA, Inc., which is owned by the
Chairman.
DUE TO/FROM AFFILIATES - Affiliates owed the Company $46 and $1,841 at
December 31, 1996 and 1995, respectively. The Company owed affiliates $400 at
December 31, 1996.
AFFILIATE SALES AND PURCHASES - The Company has entered into Production
Services Agreements with U.S. News and the Daily News pursuant to which it will
provide prepress services. The agreement with U.S. News, which expires on
December 31, 2000, is renewable annually thereafter by mutual agreement of the
parties. The agreement with the Daily News commenced in October 1995 and is
renewable annually by mutual agreement of the parties. In 1995, the Company
entered into a two-year agreement to digitize the entire library of photographs
of an affiliate. In addition, the Company occasionally provides services to and
purchases services from related parties that are negotiated on an arms-length
basis. Sales to and purchases from related parties for the years ended December
31, 1996, 1995, and 1994 were as follows                      1996      1995      1994
Affiliate sales             $11,610     $ 7,901     $ 7,301
Affiliate purchases           $ 3,097     $  421     $  710    ALLOCATED COSTS - Prior to the Offering Date, Applied Printing and other
related parties provided to the Company certain administrative services that
included cash management, financial reporting, legal, and other similar
services. The costs allocated to the Company were based on either specific
identification of expenses attributable to the Prepress Business, where
practicable, or an allocation of the total costs incurred. For such services,
the Company incurred charges of $1,534, $6,645, and $6,128 for the period ended
April 16, 1996, and for the years ended December 31, 1995 and 1994,
respectively.
In the opinion of management, such allocated costs have been made on a
basis that is considered to be reasonable; however, these costs are not
necessarily indicative of the total costs that the Company would have incurred
had it operated on a stand-alone basis.
SHARED COSTS - Pursuant to shared services agreements, the Company
receives certain legal and computer services from the Daily News and U.S. News.
For such services, the Company incurred charges of $303, $150, and $198 for the
years ended December 31, 1996, 1995, and 1994, respectively. In 1995 and 1994,
the shared costs are included as part of the allocated costs.
TECHNOLOGY DEVELOPMENT AGREEMENT - Under an arrangement with the Daily
News, the Company is reimbursed for the costs incurred in the development of
certain digital technologies. Such reimbursements totaled $100, $1,184, and
$1,956 in the years ended December 31, 1996, 1995, and 1994, respectively.
LEASES - The Company leases office space in Washington, D.C. from U.S.
News. The charges incurred for the lease were $293, $281,and $281 for the years
ended December 31, 1996, 1995, and 1994, respectively. In addition, the Company
leases office space in New York City from Applied Printing and incurred charges
of $289 for the year ended December 31, 1996. The Company also leases a facility
from the Daily News and incurred charges of $53 for the year ended December 31,
1996.                    30
33
VENDOR AGREEMENT - The Company is a party to an agreement originally
entered into in January 1992 by Applied Printing with a vendor and its
affiliate. Pursuant to such agreement, the Company and Applied Printing are
obligated to purchase a specified cumulative annual minimum amount of the
vendor products provided that the prices are market competitive and that the
products meet technological and customer specifications. The Company receives a
significant rebate from the vendor that varies based on the volume of products
purchased. In addition, in 1995, the vendor prepaid to the Company $2,745 of the
rebate expected to be earned in 1997 and 1998. If the Company does not earn the
full amount of the prepaid rebate in 1997 and 1998, it would be required to
repay the difference to the vendor along with interest accrued since 1995. The
Chairman is a guarantor of the Company contingent repayment obligation. The
Company also received prepaid rebates in March 1996 aggregating approximately
$900, all of which was earned in 1996.
In connection with the agreement, the vendor affiliate loaned $15,000 to
the Chairman. The loan, which matures on December 31, 1998, bears interest at
the lender commercial paper rate. If the Company and Applied Printing do not
jointly satisfy the cumulative minimum purchase obligations specified in the
agreement, the Chairman must repay the loan balance in full at that time. These
minimum purchase obligations have been satisfied to date, and the Company
expects, through its normal purchasing requirements, to continue to exceed such
minimum obligation through December 31, 1998. The Company believes that the
terms for its purchases of the products covered by this agreement are no less
favorable to the Company than those that could be obtained from another vendor. 14. RETIREMENT PLANS
The Company has a defined contribution plan in which employees are
eligible to participate upon the completion of six months of service and the
attainment of 21 years of age. Participants can contribute into the plan on both
a pre-tax and after-tax basis. In addition, the Company can make discretionary
contributions into the plan. Participants vest 100% in the Company
discretionary contribution upon the completion of five years of service. The
Company did not make any discretionary contributions for the years ended
December 31, 1996, 1995, and 1994. 15. COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENT LIABILITIES
The Company is contingently liable as a result of transactions arising in
the ordinary course of business and is involved in certain legal proceedings in
which damages and other remedies are sought. In the opinion of Company
management, after review with counsel, the ultimate resolution of these matters
will not have a material effect on the Company Financial Statements.
Applied Printing and its corporate general partner are defendants in
litigation arising out of Applied Printing business. The Company is not a
defendant in any of such litigation, and does not believe there is a sustainable
basis for the Company to be named as a defendant in any of such litigation. If
the Company were to be named or held responsible in connection with any of such
litigation, the Company is indemnified by Applied Printing. 16. CONCENTRATION OF CREDIT RISK
Financial instruments that potentially subject the Company to
concentrations of credit risk consist principally of cash equivalents and trade
receivables. The Company maintains cash balances and cash equivalents with high
credit quality financial institutions and limits the amount of credit exposure
to any one financial institution.
The Company provides credit to customers on an uncollateralized basis
after evaluating customer credit worthiness. The Company customers are not
concentrated in any specific geographic region, but are concentrated in the
publishing, advertising agency, entertainment company, and catalog retailing
businesses. The Company five largest customers, excluding related parties,
comprise 35%, 37%, and 34% of sales for the years ended December 31, 1996, 1995,
and 1994, respectively. In addition, amounts due from these customers represent
29% and 31% of trade accounts receivable as of December 31, 1996 and 1995,
respectively. Any termination or significant disruption of the Company
relationships with any of its principal customers could have a material adverse
effect on the Company business, financial condition, results of operations,
and cash flows.                    31

18. FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS
The estimated fair values of financial instruments have been determined by
the Company using available market information and appropriate valuation
methodologies. However, considerable judgment is required in interpreting market
data to develop estimates of fair value. Accordingly, the estimates presented
herein are not necessarily indicative of the amounts that the Company could
realize in a current market exchange.                    32

The carrying amount and estimated fair values of financial instruments at
December 31, 1996 and 1995, are summarized as follows                          1996          1995
Carrying  Estimated  Carrying  Estimated
Amount  Fair Value  Amount  Fair Value
ASSETS:                                   
Cash and cash equivalents          $2,567   $2,567   $ 666   $ 666
Marketable securities            $1,600   $1,600        
Other assets                $1,470   $1,470   $1,125   $1,125
LIABILITIES:                                 
Applied Printing Note            $1,600   $1,600        
Long-term debt               $6,512   $6,400   $1,564   $1,335
Obligations under capital leases      $2,619   $2,557   $3,991   $3,281
The following methods and assumptions were used to estimate the fair value
of financial instruments presented above    CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS - the carrying amount is a reasonable
approximation of fair value.
MARKETABLE SECURITIES - due to the short-term maturity of the investments,
the carrying amount is a reasonable approximation of fair value.
OTHER ASSETS - the carrying amount of non-trade accounts receivables is 
a reasonable approximation of fair value.
APPLIED PRINTING NOTE - due to the short-term nature of the obligation,
the carrying amount is a reasonable approximation of fair value.
LONG-TERM DEBT - the fair value of notes payable, including the current
portion, is estimated by discounting the future streams of payments using the
rate at which the Company can currently obtain funds under its revolving credit
line. The carrying amount of the revolving credit line is a reasonable
approximation of fair value since it is a variable-rate obligation.
OBLIGATIONS UNDER CAPITAL LEASES - the fair value of obligations under
capital leases, including the current portion, is estimated by discounting the
future streams of payments using the rate at which the Company can currently
obtain funds under its revolving credit line. 19. RESTRUCTURING CHARGES
During 1994 and 1995, the Company restructured its operations in response
to the operational impact of acquisitions and the technological changes within
the industry. As part of the restructuring, the Company consolidated several
operations during 1994 and 1995 in an effort to gain operational and
administrative efficiencies. The Statements of Operations include restructuring
charges of $3,060 and $6,668 for the years ended December 31, 1995 and 1994,
respectively. Such charges were comprised primarily of the write off of assets,
including leasehold improvements, that are no longer utilized in the Company
business and contractual lease obligations for facilities and equipment that
provide no further benefit to the Company. The Company utilized a discount rate
of 10% to determine the present value of the contractual lease payments. The
remaining balance of the restructuring liability as of December 31, 1996, was
$409, which the Company expects to be paid during 1997.                    33
