To the Board of Directors and Shareholders of
Cylink Corporation
In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements listed in the
above index present fairly, in all material respects, the financial
position of Cylink Corporation and its subsidiaries at December 31, 1996
and 1995, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for
each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 1996, in
conformity with generally accepted  accounting  principles.  These
financial statements are the responsibility of the Company management;
our  responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial
statements based on our audits. We conducted our audits of these
statements in accordance with generally accepted auditing standards
which require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable
assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material
misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence
supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements,
assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made
by management,  and evaluating  the overall  financial  statement
presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for
the opinion expressed above.     PRICE WATERHOUSE LLP

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements 1.  The Company and a Summary of its Significant Accounting Policies
The Company
Cylink Corporation the Company was incorporated in California in
October 1989 to engage in the development, manufacture, license and
marketing of electronic encryption devices and in 1990 began developing
wireless communication products.
The Company operations outside of the United States consist primarily
of a sales office in the United Kingdom.
Basis of presentation
The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the
Company and its subsidiaries. All significant intercompany accounts and
transactions have been eliminated.
The Company interim quarters end on the Friday nearest the calendar
quarter end. The Company year end is December 31.
Foreign currency
The functional currencies of the Company foreign subsidiaries are the
local currencies. The balance sheet accounts are translated into United
States dollars at the exchange rate prevailing at the balance sheet date.
Revenues, costs and expenses are translated into United States dollars at
average rates for the period. Gains and losses resulting from translation
are presented as a component of shareholders' equity. Net gains and losses
resulting from foreign  exchange  transactions  are included in the
consolidated statement of operations and were not significant during any of
the periods presented.
Cash equivalents and short-term investments
Cash equivalents consist of highly liquid investment instruments with a
maturity at the time of purchase of three months or less.
The  Company  short-term  investments  are  classified  as
available-for-sale and therefore are reported at fair value with unrealized
gains and losses as a separate component of shareholders' equity.
Inventories
Inventories  are stated at the lower of  standard  cost which
approximates actual cost on a first-in, first-out basis or market.
Other assets
Patent acquisition costs are amortized using the straight-line method
over 10 years. Patents, net of amortization, of $18,000 and $27,000 are
included in other assets as of December 31, 1996 and 1995, respectively.
Property and equipment
Property and equipment are recorded at cost. Depreciation is computed
using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the
assets, generally five years. Amortization of leasehold improvements is
computed using the straight-line method over the shorter of the estimated
useful lives of the assets or the remaining lease term.                    28   Revenue recognition
Revenue is recognized upon shipment to customers. Concurrently, a
provision is made for estimated cost to repair or replace products under
warranty arrangements. Revenue from sales to distributors is recognized
upon shipment; no right of return, stock rotation or price protection is
given. Revenue from sales to value added resellers is recognized upon
shipment and concurrently a provision for estimated returns is recorded.
Royalty income of $1,308,000, $1,772,000 and $866,000 for the years
ended December 31, 1996, 1995 and 1994, respectively, is included in other
income and is generally recognized upon the reported sale of products
subject to royalties.
Research and development
Research and development costs are charged to operations as incurred.
The Company on occasion receives nonrecurring engineering funding for
development projects to apply or enhance the Company technology to a
particular customer needs. Non-refundable receipts are recognized over
the term of the respective contract using the percentage of completion
method. Receipts, which are refundable pending the achievement of certain
results, are deferred and recognized upon acceptance by the customer.
Amounts billed on contracts and collected prior to being earned are
recorded as deferred revenue. At the time of recognition, amounts received
under research and development contracts are offset against research and
development expenses.
Software development costs are included in research and development and
are expensed as incurred. Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No.
86 SFAS 86 requires the capitalization of certain software development
costs once technological feasibility is established, which the Company
defines as completion of a working model. The capitalized cost is then
amortized on a straight-line basis over the estimated product life, or on
the ratio of current revenues to total projected product revenues,
whichever is greater. To date, the period between achieving technological
feasibility and the general availability of such software has been short
and software development costs qualifying for capitalization have been
insignificant. Accordingly, the Company has not capitalized any software
development costs.
Stock-based compensation
The Company accounts for stock based compensation using the intrinsic
value method prescribed in Accounting Principles Board Opinion APB No.
25,  Accounting  for  Stock  Issued  to  Employees,  and  related
Interpretations. The Company provides additional pro forma disclosures as
required under Statement of Financial Accounting Standard No. 123 SFAS
123, Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation. See Note 7.
Income taxes
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the expected tax
consequences of temporary differences between the tax bases of assets and
liabilities and their financial statement reported amounts.
Net income loss per share
Net income loss per share is computed using the weighted average
number of outstanding shares of common stock and common stock equivalents.
Common stock equivalents consist of stock options using the treasury stock
method. Common stock equivalents are excluded from the computation if
their effect is antidilutive, except that, pursuant to the requirements of
the Securities and Exchange Commission, common stock equivalents using the
treasury stock method and the initial public offering price issued
subsequent to November 30, 1994 through February 15, 1996 have been
included in the computation as if they were outstanding for all periods
through the effective date of the Company initial public offering.
Off-balance sheet risk and concentrations of credit risk
Financial  instruments that  potentially  subject the Company to
significant concentration of credit risk consist primarily of cash and cash
equivalents, short-term investments, accounts receivable, and to a lesser
extent currency fluctuation of balances denominated in currencies other
than the United States dollar. The Company limits the amount of investment
exposure to any one financial institution and financial instrument. The
Company performs on-going credit evaluations and maintains reserves for
potential credit losses; historically such losses have been                     29   immaterial. The Company minimizes the amount of cash it maintains in local
currencies by maintaining excess cash in United States dollars.
No customer accounted for more than 10% of total accounts receivable at
December 31, 1996 and 1995 and no customer accounted for greater than 10%
of revenue in any period presented.
Use of estimates
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally
accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and
assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and
disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the
financial statements, and reported amounts of revenues and expenses during
the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.
Reclassifications
Certain amounts in the 1995 financial statements have been reclassified
to conform to the 1996 presentation.
Dependence on suppliers
The Company ability to timely deliver its products is dependent upon
the availability of quality components and subsystems used in these
products. The Company depends in part upon subcontractors to manufacture,
assemble and deliver certain items in a timely and satisfactory manner. The
Company obtains certain components and subsystems from single, or a limited
number of sources. A significant interruption in the delivery of such items
could have a material adverse effect on the Company financial condition
and results of operations.
2.  Initial Public Offering
In February 1996, the Company completed its initial public offering and
issued 5,000,000 shares of its common stock to the public at a price of
$1500 per share. In March 1996, the underwriters exercised their option to
cover over-allotments and an additional 750,000 shares of common stock were
issued at $1500 per share. The Company received approximately $79 million
of cash, net of underwriting discounts, commissions and other offering
costs.
In connection with the Company initial public offering, the Board of
Directors authorized the issuance of up to 5,000,000 shares of undesignated
preferred stock and the Board has the authority to issue the undesignated
preferred stock in one or more series and to fix the rights, preferences,
privileges and restrictions thereof. No preferred stock had been issued as
of December 31, 1996.                    30 3.  Details of Balance Sheet Components

December 31, 1995 were as follows in thousands                                  Unrealized
Cost    Fair Value    Loss

Short-term investments generally consisted of preferred stock and were
sold during 1996 resulting in a loss of $432,000. The Company had no
short-term investments as of December 31, 1996.
5.  Bank Line of Credit
In July 1995, the Company signed a credit agreement with a bank which
provided a line of credit for working capital advances of up to $5,000,000
or a specified percentage of eligible accounts receivable, plus $2,000,000
or a specified percentage of short-term investments, respectively. Any
advances under the line of credit were collaterized by certain assets and
intellectual property of the Company. Interest on borrowings under the line
of credit was set at the 30 day LIBOR plus 20%. Among other provisions,
the Company was required to maintain certain financial                     31   covenants. In addition, payment of cash dividends was prohibited without
the bank consent. At December 31, 1995, the Company had $1,000,000
outstanding under the line of credit which was repaid during 1996. The line
of credit agreement expired in July 1996 and was not renewed by the
Company.
6.  Income Taxes

Net deferred tax assets                  $ 1,420    $  904
32     Net deferred tax assets of $1,420,000 at December 31, 1996 were based
on the Company carryback capacity and expected future income in the next
twelve months. Based on the available objective evidence, including the
operating losses experienced in recent years, management cannot conclude
that it is more likely than not a portion of the deferred tax assets will
be realized and, therefore, the Company has recorded a partial valuation
against the deferred tax assets.
The provision benefit reconciles to the amount computed by applying
the United States federal statutory rate to income before taxes as follows                           Year ended December 31,

The Company has not provided United States federal income taxes on the
undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries because it is the Company
intention to permanently reinvest such earnings. At December 31, 1996, 1995
and 1994, total  undistributed  earnings of these subsidiaries were
approximately $1,846,000, $1,579,000 and $1,341,000, respectively.
The Company had research and development credit carry forwards of
approximately $980,000 and $1,200,000 at December 31, 1996 and 1995,
respectively, which expire from 2009 to 2010. 7.  Stock Option Plans
The Company has adopted the 1987 Stock Option Plan and the 1994 Flexible
Stock Incentive Plan collectively known as the Plans which provide for
the grant of incentive stock options and nonqualified stock options to
executives, employees and consultants to purchase up to 2,010,000 and
3,950,000 common shares, respectively. Stock options may be granted at
prices not less than 100% and 85% for incentive and nonqualified stock
options, respectively, of the fair market value of the stock on the date of
grant. Through December 31, 1996, all nonqualified stock options have been
granted at 100% of the fair market value of the stock on the date of grant.
Options granted under the Plans are exercisable at such times and under
such conditions as determined by the Board of Directors, and generally vest
over five years. Options expire ten years from the date of grant.
Shares issued upon exercise of options are subject to certain restrictions
on their transferability. The Company has the right to repurchase such
shares, at a price equal to the fair market value, when the optionee is no
longer associated with the Company. Shares repurchased increase the number
of shares available for grant under the Plans.                    33 The following table summarizes the Company stock option activity and related
weighted average exercise price within each category for each of the three years

The weighted average estimated grant date fair value, as defined by
SFAS 123, for options granted during 1995 at market price and below market price
on the dates of grant were $104 and $147, respectively. The weighted average
estimated grant date fair value, as defined by SFAS 123, for options granted at
market price during 1996 was $603. The estimated grant date fair value
disclosed by the Company is calculated using the Black-Scholes model. The
Black-Scholes model, as well as other currently accepted option valuation
models, was developed to estimate the fair value of freely tradeable, fully
transferable options without vesting restrictions, which significantly differ
from the Company stock option awards. These models also require highly
subjective assumptions, including future stock price volatility and expected
time until exercise, which greatly affect the calculated grant date fair value.                    34     The following weighted average  assumptions are included in the
estimated grant date fair value calculations for the Company stock option

stock option plans, the Company net income loss and net income loss
per share would have been reduced to the pro forma amounts below for the
years ended December 31, 1996 and 1995 in thousands, except for per share

share for 1996 and 1995 is not representative of the pro forma effect on
net income in future years because it does not take into consideration pro
forma compensation expense related to grants made prior to 1995.
As of December 31, 1995, the Company had granted certain options for
the purchase of common stock at less than the deemed fair market value and
approximately $417,000 of compensation expense is being amortized over the
five-year vesting period of the options.
8.  Notes Receivable From Shareholders
During November 1995, the Company made loans totaling $515,000 to
certain employees pursuant to the Company 1994 Flexible Stock Incentive
Plan. The loans bear interest at 80% per annum and are secured by 427,000
shares of the Company common stock. The loans were due in November 1996
or, if earlier, upon the borrower termination of employment with the
Company. During 1996, the Company extended the due dates on certain of the
loans. As of December 31, 1996, the remaining balance on these loans
totaled $301,000 and is due in February 1997.
9.  Research and Development Contracts
During the years ended December 31, 1996, 1995 and 1994, the Company
performed  research and development under several  government funded
arrangements aggregating $3,777,000, $526,000 and $297,000, respectively.
These contracts provide funding irrespective of the results for research
and development of certain cryptographic technologies which will be jointly
owned by the Company and these government agencies. Amounts received under
these contracts are offset against research and development expenses.
The Company performed research and development under several other
research and development contracts which provide for the development and
transfer of technology in exchange for development funding. The Company
recorded as a reduction of research and development expenses $2,363,000,
$604,000 and $367,000 under such arrangements in the years ended December
31, 1996, 1995 and 1994, respectively. The funds received under contracts
in progress,  included in deferred  revenue pending  achievement of
milestones, totaled $1,050,000 as of December 31, 1995. No funds had been
received under such contracts in advance of the achievement of milestones
as of December 31, 1996.                    35     In 1991, the Company entered into an agreement with a third party to
partially fund research and development related to certain cryptographic
technology. The Company is required to pay royalties of 5% on sales of
products developed under this research project. In connection with a
contract amendment in 1993, the Company prepaid royalties of $300,000 in
exchange for limitations on total royalties, not to exceed $712,000. The
prepaid royalties were fully amortized as of December 31, 1995. 10. Joint Venture and Contingencies
On September 6, 1995, the Company obtained an arbitration award
dissolving a former partnership, known as Public Key Partners PKP,
between the Company wholly-owned subsidiary, Caro-Kann Corporation, and
RSA DSI. Although various claims between the Company and RSA DSI were
settled on December 31, 1996, a third party continues to pursue various
claims against PKP and RSA DSI for wrongful business practices in action
C-94-20512 SW before the United States District Court for the Northern
District of California. Management believes that the ultimate resolution of
this matter will not have a material adverse effect on the Company
financial position or results of operations.
Subsequent event unaudited
On March 7, 1997, ten former employees of the Company filed suit in
action No. CV764647 in the Superior Court of California, County of Santa
Clara, against the Company, each of its Directors and its General Counsel,
asserting claims for wrongful termination, fraud, libel, slander, age
discrimination, invasion of privacy, and violation of the federal RICO
statute. Although the Company has placed its insurers on notice of these
claims, none of them have admitted coverage. The Company believes the
terminations were lawful and intends to defend the matter vigorously. The
defense of this matter may divert a material amount of management
attention and require the expenditure of significant legal fees and costs.
An unfavorable outcome which exceeds the Company insurance coverage, if
any, may also result in a material adverse effect on the Company
financial condition.  However, management believes that the ultimate
resolution of this matter will not have a material adverse effect on the
Company financial position or results of operations.                    36   11. Geographic Information

other operating costs under the terms of the leases. The Company also
