Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements
1. BASIS OF PRESENTATION
The Company
Boston Communications Group, Inc. the Company develops, markets and provides
specialized prepaid wireless services, teleservices, and roaming services to the
wireless telephone industry. The Company also manufactures prepaid and voice
system equipment.
2. SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
Revenue Recognition
The Company earns revenues by providing teleservices customer care support,
processing prepaid wireless calls and processing wireless calls for unregistered
wireless subscribers who have roamed outside of their service area. Revenue is
recognized when the service is provided and is recorded net of estimated billing
adjustments. The Company recognizes revenue from the sale of systems at the time
the systems are shipped.
Principles of Consolidation
The financial statements include 100% of the accounts and operations of the
Company and all of its majority-owned subsidiaries. All intercompany accounts
and transactions have been eliminated.
Cash and Cash Equivalents
The Company considers all highly liquid investments with a maturity of three
months or less at the date of purchase to be cash equivalents.
Investments
The Company accounts for its marketable securities under the Statement of
Financial Accounting Standards No. 115, Accounting for Certain Instruments in
Debt and Equity Securities. The Company has classified all of its securities as
available-for-sale, and are thus reported at fair market value.
Investments with maturities between three and twelve months are considered
short-term investments. The Company short-term investments are invested in
corporate notes.
Estimates
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted
accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that
affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of
contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and
the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period.
Actual results could differ from those estimates.
Concentrations of Credit Risk
The Company prepaid wireless services allows carriers, throughout the United
States and Canada, to access the Company prepaid C/2/C platform, enabling the
carriers to offer prepaid wireless calling to their subscribers. Accounts are
not activated until payment is received by the carrier. Teleservices are
provided to wireless carriers located throughout the United States and Canada.
The Company roaming customers are individuals who place wireless calls from
service areas, which are not covered by traditional roaming agreements. These
calls are forwarded by wireless carriers to the Company for processing. Each
transaction is small in size and the Company minimizes credit risk by validating
appropriate billing information. The Company sells its voice systems in North
America and its prepaid systems in North and South America.
-29 
The Company has roaming, teleservice and prepaid wireless service agreements
with, and sells its systems to numerous carriers.  During the years ended
December 31, 1998, 1997 and 1996, the Company top 10 customers accounted for
79%, 75% and 82% of the Company total revenues, respectively. The following
table summarizes sales in excess of 10% of total revenues only, as a percentage
of total revenues, to major customers:

S - Systems
Inventory, which consists of computer hardware and electronic components, is
recorded at the lower of cost first-in, first-out method or market. Inventory
is categorized as follows in thousands:

Finished goods                     --       309
- 
$3,525      $1,550
Property and Equipment
Property and equipment are recorded at cost and depreciated on a straight-line
basis over the estimated useful lives of the assets, which range from 3 to 7
years. Systems in development represent the cost of purchased hardware and
software to be used in switching equipment not yet placed into service and will
be depreciated between 3 and 5 years.
In accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board Statement No. 121,
Accounting for the Impairment of Long-Lived Assets and for Long-Lived Assets to
be Disposed Of, the Company reviews its long-lived assets for impairment
whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of
an asset may not be recoverable. If it is determined that the carrying amount of
an asset cannot be fully recovered, an impairment loss is recognized. During
1998 and 1997, the Company recorded impairment losses of $698,000 and $569,000,
respectively, for the writedown of equipment which could no longer be used in
its business to its fair market value. These assets were sold during 1998 at
their impaired carrying value of $265,000.
Goodwill
Goodwill represents the excess of cost of acquired businesses over the fair
market value of all net assets acquired. Goodwill is being amortized on a
straight-line basis over an eight-year period. Accumulated amortization totaled
approximately $14 million and $786,000 as of December 31, 1998 and 1997,
respectively.
-30 
Engineering, Research and Development
Costs associated with engineering, research and development are expensed as
incurred.
Reclassifications
Certain items on the financial statements have been reclassified from the prior
year to be comparable with the current year presentation.
Stock-Based Compensation
The Company has elected to follow Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 25,
Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees APB 25 in accounting for its stock-
based compensation plans, rather than the alternative fair value accounting
method provided for under Financial Accounting Standards Board Statement SFAS
No. 123, Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation, as this alternative requires
the use of option valuation models that were not developed for use in valuing
employee stock options. Under APB 25, since the exercise price of options
granted under these plans equals the market price of the underlying stock on the
date of grant, no compensation expense is required.
Accounting Pronouncements
In June 1998, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued SFAS No. 133,
Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities, which
establishes standards for the recognition, measurement, and reporting of
derivatives and hedging activities and is effective for the Company year
ended December 31, 2000. The Company anticipates that the adoption of this new
accounting standard will not have a material impact on the Company
consolidated financial statements. 3. ACQUISITIONS
In February 1996, the Company acquired the net assets of Voice Systems
Technology Inc. VST, now the Systems Division, a company which develops and
markets prepaid and voice processing systems, for approximately $25 million
$500,000 cash and 265,373 shares of common stock. VST had revenues and net
income for the 11 months ended February 29, 1996 of $21 million and $9,000,
respectively. The allocation of the purchase price was based on the fair market
value of assets and liabilities acquired and the excess over those amounts is
accounted for as goodwill. On January 31, 1996, the Company acquired 175% of
the stock in Wireless America Corp. WAC for $35,000. WAC marketed and sold
prepaid equipment in Latin America. On October 23, 1996, the Company acquired an
additional 625% of the stock of WAC for $916,500. In August 1997, the Company
paid $14 million to purchase the final 20% interest in WAC and recorded this
amount as goodwill, which is being amortized over eight years. WAC was
subsequently merged into VST. The acquisitions have been accounted for under
the purchase method of accounting and the results of operations have been
included in the Company results of operations from the date of acquisition.
The following unaudited pro forma information has been prepared assuming that
these acquisitions had taken place at the beginning of 1996. The unaudited pro
forma information includes adjustments for interest expense that would have been
incurred to finance the purchase, amortization of goodwill resulting from the
purchase, elimination of the effect of transactions between the Company and
acquired companies and income taxes. The unaudited pro forma financial

5. SEGMENT REPORTING
The Company adopted SFAS No. 131, Disclosures about Segments of an Enterprise
and Related Information in 1998. SFAS No. 131 established standards for
reporting information about operating segments in annual financial statements
and requires selected information about operating segments in interim financial
reports issued to stockholders. It also established standards for related
disclosures about products and services, and geographic areas. Operating
segments are defined as components of an enterprise about which separate
financial information is available that is evaluated regularly by the chief
operating decision maker, or decision making group, in deciding how to allocate
resources and in assessing performance. The Company chief operating decision-
maker is the Chief Executive Officer. The operating segments are managed
separately because each operating segment represents a strategic business unit
that offers different products and serves different niches in the wireless
industry.
The Company reportable operating segments consist of the Prepaid Wireless
Services, Teleservices, Roaming Services and Systems Divisions. The Company
Prepaid Wireless Services Division offers prepaid wireless service that allows
carriers to access the Company prepaid C/2/C platform, enabling the carriers
to offer prepaid wireless calling to their subscribers. The Company
Teleservices Division provides customer support teleservices to wireless
carrier customers, which allows carriers to outsource all or a portion of
their customer service activities. The Company Roaming Services Division
provides carriers with ROAMERplus call processing services which provides
carriers the ability to generate revenues from subscribers who are not covered
under traditional roaming agreements by arranging payment for roaming calls. The
Company Systems Division manufactures and markets voice processing platforms
to wireless and wireline carriers throughout North and South America with
enhanced features including prepaid wireless, voice messaging and fax mail
services. The Systems Division also sells prepaid systems to international
carriers and manufactures the voice nodes used to support the Company C/2/C
network. The other segment assets include cash equivalents and short-term
investments and other assets not allocated to the reportable operating segments.
The accounting policies of the operating segments are the same as those
described in the summary of significant accounting policies except that the
financial results for the Company operating segments have been prepared using
a management approach. This is consistent with the basis and manner in which the
Company management internally analyzes financial information for the purposes
of assisting in making internal operating decisions. The Company evaluates
performance based on stand-alone operating segment income loss before interest
and taxes and allocates corporate level operating expenses to the operating
segments. All revenues are generated from external customers and there are no
intersegment revenues. Revenues are attributed to geographic areas based on the
location of the customers to whom the services were provided or the location
where the systems were shipped. Capital expenditures include equipment purchased
directly from vendors or acquired through a capital lease. The summary of
operating segment information is as follows at December 31, in thousands                    -32                     Prepaid

The Company utilized $20 million in 1996 of federal net operating loss
carryforwards to offset taxable income. The valuation allowance decreased
$162,000 during 1996 due primarily to the utilization of net operating loss
carryforwards. At December 31, 1998, the Company has approximately $47 million
of net operating loss carryforwards for federal income tax return purposes
available for use in future years that expire beginning in 2006.

Common Stock
On April 26, 1996, the Company authorized 35,000,000 shares of a new class of
common stock and effected a recapitalization of the Company the 1996
Recapitalization. All outstanding shares of the Company class A, B, C and D
common stock were exchanged for an aggregate of Stock. In addition, the terms
and conditions of the Company three classes of convertible preferred stock
were modified, without changing the total number of shares of Common Stock into
which the preferred stock can be converted. The convertible preferred shares
were converted to 5,004,608 shares of Common Stock upon the closing of the
initial public offering.
Public Offerings
In 1996, the Company sold in its initial public offering IPO 3,918,555 shares
of its common stock yielding net proceeds to the Company of $498 million. The
proceeds were used to redeem preferred stock and to repay an existing line of
credit and capital leases. Upon the closing of the IPO, the Company redeemed
all 11,871 outstanding shares of redeemable preferred stock at a redemption
price of $1,000 per share. In addition, the Company paid approximately $45
million in accreted dividends on the redeemable preferred stock.
-34 
In 1997, the Company sold in a public offering 3,000,000 shares of its common
stock yielding net proceeds to the Company of $358 million. The proceeds are
being used for capital and other expenditures in connection with the expansion
of the C/2/C network.
Preferred Stock
The Board of Directors are authorized, subject to certain limitations prescribed
by law, without further shareholder approval, to issue from time to time up to
an aggregate of 2,000,000 shares of Preferred Stock in one or more series and to
fix or alter the designations, preferences, rights and any qualifications,
limitations or restrictions of the shares of each such series thereof, including
the dividend rights, dividend rates, conversion rights, voting rights, terms of
redemption including sinking fund provisions, redemption price or prices,
liquidation preferences and the number of shares constituting any series or
designations of such series. The issuance of Preferred Stock may have the effect
of delaying, deferring or preventing a change of control of the Company. The
Company has no present plans to issue any shares of Preferred Stock.
Stock Option Plans
The Company 1996 and 1998 Stock Option Plans the Plans were adopted by the
Board of Directors and approved by the stockholders of the Company in 1996 and
1998, respectively. The Plans provide for the grant of stock options to
employees, officers and directors, consultants and advisors to, the Company and
its subsidiaries. Under the Plans, the Company may grant options that are
intended to qualify as incentive stock options within the meaning of Section 422
of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended the Code incentive stock
options, or options not intended to qualify as incentive stock options non-
statutory options. Incentive stock options may only be granted to employees
of the Company. A total of 1,264,792 and 600,000 shares of Common Stock may be
issued upon the exercise of options granted under the 1996 and 1998 Stock Option
Plans, respectively. The maximum number of shares with respect to which options
may be granted to any employee under the 1996 and 1998 Stock Option Plans shall
not exceed 200,000 and 60,000 shares of Common Stock, respectively, during any
calendar year. All options granted have 10 year terms and generally vest and
become exercisable over five years.
In 1996, the Company granted non-qualified options to purchase 653,278 and
93,551 shares of common stock at exercise prices of $575 and $1000,
respectively. In 1998, the Company granted 400,000 non-qualified options to
purchase shares of common stock at an exercise price of $706. The exercise
prices of all non-qualified options were equal to the fair market value as
determined by the Company on the date of grant.
Pro forma information regarding net income and earnings per share is required by
Statement 123, and has been determined as if the Company had accounted for its
employee stock options under the fair value method of that statement. The fair
value for these options was estimated at the date of grant using a Black-Scholes
option pricing model with the following weighted average assumptions for 1997
and 1998: risk-free interest rates of 64% and 54% respectively, no dividend
yield, the volatility factor of the expected market price of the Company
common stock was 05 and a weighted-average expected life of the option of 4 to
5 years.
The Black-Scholes option valuation model was developed for use in estimating the
fair value of traded options which have no vesting restrictions and are fully
transferable. In addition, option valuation models require the input of highly
subjective assumptions including the expected stock price volatility. Because
the Company employee stock options have characteristics significantly
different from those of traded options, and because changes in the subjective
input assumptions can materially affect the fair value estimate, in management
opinion, the existing models do not necessarily provide a reliable single
measure of the fair value of its employee stock options.
For purposes of pro forma disclosures, the estimated fair value of the options
is amortized to expense over the options' vesting period. The Company pro
forma information follows in thousands, except for per share information                    -35                               December 31,

Employee Stock Purchase Plan
The Company 1996 Employee Stock Purchase Plan the Purchase Plan was
adopted by the Board of Directors and approved by the shareholders of the
Company in April 1996. The Purchase Plan authorizes the issuance of up to a
total of 225,000 shares of Common Stock to participating employees.
All full-time employees of the Company who have been employed by the Company for
a minimum of twelve months, including directors of the Company who are
employees, are eligible to participate in the Purchase Plan. On the first day of
a designated payroll deduction period the Offering Period, the Company will
grant to each eligible employee who has elected to participate in the Purchase
Plan an option to purchase shares of Common Stock as follows: the employee may
authorize an amount up to a maximum of 10% of such employee regular pay to
be deducted by the Company from such pay during the Offering Period. On the last
day of the Offering Period, the employee is deemed to have exercised the option,
at the option exercise price, to the extent of accumulated payroll deductions.
Under the terms of the Purchase Plan, the option price is an amount equal to 90%
of the fair market value per share of the Common Stock on either the first day
or the last day of the Offering Period, whichever is lower. In no event may an
employee purchase in any one Offering Period a number of shares which has an
aggregate market value determined on the last day of the Offering Period in
excess of $25,000. The Compensation Committee may, in its discretion, choose an
Offering Period of 12 months or less for each of the Offerings and choose a
different Offering Period for each Offering.

The operating leases include $24 million per year payable through May 2003 for
a call center facility and equipment. The Company has the option to buyout the
lease for the call center facility and equipment beginning in May 1999 for $59
million.
Significant Contracts
In 1998, the Company entered into an agreement with a vendor to jointly develop
two products for the Company. The Company will pay this vendor $17 million for
the development effort and the exclusive license of the first product. In
addition, the Company is required to pay $9 million for the second product
during the next three years.
10. RELATED-PARTY TRANSACTIONS
Pursuant to a management agreement, the Company paid annual fees of $252,000 in
1996 to a management company affiliated with certain shareholders of the
Company. This amount represents the payroll and certain benefit costs of six
senior management personnel responsible for the operations of the Company.
The management agreement was terminated in March 1996 and the employees of the
management company became employees of the Company. The management fees
previously incurred by the Company under the management agreement closely
approximate the actual payroll and related benefits currently being directly
incurred by the Company, and the Company believes that these amounts are
reasonable and comparable to those that would have been incurred with an
unrelated third party. Additionally, the Company leased office space from
another company affiliated with certain shareholders of the Company under a
leasing arrangement which was terminated in August 1996. The Company recorded
rent expense of $40,000 in 1996 in connection with this lease. Another company,
affiliated with certain shareholders of the Company, received $462,000 in 1996
in connection with the repurchase of redeemable preferred stock of the
affiliated company investment and its accreted dividends.
