To the Stockholders
Citation Corporation and Subsidiaries
In our opinion, the accompanying consolidated balance sheets and the related
consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, stockholders' equity,
and cash flows present fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated
financial position of Citation Corporation and subsidiaries the Company at
October 3, 1999 and September 27, 1998, and the consolidated results of their
operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended
October 3, 1999, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in
the United States. These financial statements are the responsibility of the
Company management; our responsibility is to express an opinion on these
financial statements based on our audits. We conducted our audits of these
statements in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in the
United States, which require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material
misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting
the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the
accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, and
evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our
audits provide a reasonable basis for the opinion expressed above. s/ PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP

-  2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies
Fiscal Year - The Company operates on a fifty-two/fifty-three week fiscal
year which ends on the Sunday nearest to September 30. Fiscal years 1997 and
1998 each consisted of fifty-two weeks while fiscal year 1999 consisted of
fifty-three weeks.
Revenue Recognition - The Company records sales upon shipment of the related
products, net of any discounts.
Cash Equivalents - The Company considers all highly liquid debt instruments
purchased with an original maturity of three months or less at the date of
purchase to be cash equivalents.
Cash Overdraft - In conjunction with the credit facility discussed in Note 6,
the Company entered into a consolidated cash management system with the
administrative agent and lead bank of the credit facility. As a result of
maintaining this consolidated cash management system, the Company maintains a
zero balance at the lead bank, resulting in book cash overdrafts. Such
overdrafts are included in current liabilities.
Inventories - Raw materials inventories are stated at the lower of cost
principally first-in, first-out basis or market. Supplies and containers
inventories are stated primarily at the lower of cost principally average
cost or market. Castings and forgings inventories are stated primarily at
the lower of cost determined principally at standard cost or under the
retail method or market.
Property, Plant, and Equipment - Property, plant, and equipment are carried
at cost, less accumulated depreciation, and include expenditures that
substantially increase the useful lives of existing assets. Maintenance,
repairs, and minor renovations are charged to expense as incurred. Upon sale,
retirement, or other disposition of these assets, the cost and related
accumulated depreciation are removed from the respective accounts, and any
gain or loss on the disposition is included in income.

-   The Company provides for depreciation of property, plant, and equipment using
primarily the straight-line method designed to depreciate costs over
estimated useful lives as shown below                       Estimated Useful Life
Buildings                     10 - 50 years
Plant equipment                  3 - 20 years
Office equipment                  2 - 12 years
Transportation equipment              3 - 7 years  Property, plant, and equipment acquired under capital lease agreements are
carried at cost less accumulated depreciation. These assets are depreciated
in a manner consistent with the Company depreciation policy for purchased
assets.
Intangible Assets - Goodwill, the excess of purchase price over the fair
value of net assets acquired in purchase transactions, is being amortized on
a straight-line basis primarily over 20 years but with various amortization
periods ranging from 18 to 36 years. The Company assesses the recoverability
and the amortization period of the goodwill by determining whether the amount
can be recovered through undiscounted net cash flows of the businesses
acquired over the remaining amortization period. Amounts paid or accrued for
noncompetition and consulting agreements are amortized using the straight-
line method over the term of the agreements. Debt financing costs, which are
included in other assets, are amortized to interest expense using the
straight-line method, which approximates the effective interest method, over
the term of the related debt issues.
Long-Lived Assets - In accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting
Standards SFAS No. 121, Accounting for the Impairment of Long-Lived Assets
and for Long-Lived Assets to be Disposed Of, the Company recognizes
impairment losses on long-lived assets used in operations when indicators of
impairment are present and the undiscounted cash flows estimated to be
generated by those assets are less than the assets' carrying amounts. During
fiscal year 1998, the Company recognized such a loss related to the write
down of certain assets of its Oberdorfer division in Syracuse, New York see
Note 18. There were no such losses recognized during fiscal years 1997 or
1999.
Derivative Financial Instruments - The Company enters into interest rate swap
agreements to limit the effect of changes in the interest rates on floating
debt. The differential is accrued as interest rates change and is recognized
over the lives of the swap agreements as adjustments to interest expense.

-   Investment in Joint Venture - The Company investment in joint venture
discussed in Note 14 is accounted for under the equity method and is included
in other assets in the consolidated balance sheets.
Accounting for Income Taxes - The Company accounts for income taxes in
accordance with SFAS No. 109, Accounting for Income Taxes. Under SFAS No.
109, deferred income taxes are recognized for the tax consequences in future
years of differences between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and
their financial reporting amounts at each year end. The amounts recognized
are based on enacted tax laws and statutory tax rates applicable to the
periods in which the differences are expected to affect taxable income.
Valuation allowances are established when necessary to reduce deferred tax
assets to the amounts expected to be realized. Income tax expense is the tax
payable for the period and the change during the period in deferred tax
assets and liabilities.
Earnings Per Share - Earnings per common share and earnings per common share
assuming dilution are computed in compliance with SFAS No. 128, Earnings Per
Share. Generally, SFAS No. 128 requires a calculation of basic and diluted
earnings per share. The calculation of basic earnings per share only takes
into consideration income loss available to common shareholders and the
weighted average of shares outstanding during the period while diluted
earnings per share takes into effect the impact of all additional common
shares that would have been outstanding if all potential common shares
related to options, warrants, and convertible securities had been issued, as
long as their effect is dilutive. SFAS No. 128 requires dual presentation of
basic and diluted earnings per share on the face of the statement of income
as well as a reconciliation of the numerator and denominator of the basic
calculation to the diluted calculation see Note 10.
Comprehensive Income - Comprehensive income is computed in accordance with
SFAS No. 130, Reporting Comprehensive Income, which the Company adopted
during fiscal year 1998. During fiscal years 1997 and 1998, there were no
differences between net income and comprehensive income. During fiscal year
1999, comprehensive income consists of the Company minimum pension
liability adjustment, net of tax effects.
Segments - In fiscal year 1999, the Company adopted SFAS No. 131, Disclosures
about Segments of an Enterprise and Related Information. SFAS No. 131
management approach designates the internal organization that is used by
management for making operating decisions and assessing performance as the
source of the Company reportable segments. SFAS No. 131 also requires
disclosures about products and services, geographic areas, and major
customers. The adoption of SFAS No. 131 did not affect the Company
consolidated financial position or results of operations.
Use of Estimates - The preparation of financial statements in conformity with
generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make
estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and
liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets

-   and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported
amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results
could differ from those estimates.
Recently Issued Accounting Standards - In June 1998, the Financial Accounting
Standards Board the FASB issued SFAS No. 133, Accounting for Derivative
Instruments and Hedging Activities. SFAS No. 133 requires all derivatives to
be measured at fair value and recognized as either assets or liabilities on
the balance sheet. Changes in such fair value are required to be recognized
immediately in net income loss to the extent the derivatives are not
effective as hedges. SFAS No. 133, as amended by SFAS No. 137, Accounting for
Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities - Deferral of the Effective
Date of SFAS No. 133, is effective for fiscal years beginning after June 15,
2000, and is effective for interim periods in the initial year of adoption.
The impact of the adoption of SFAS No. 133 and SFAS No. 137 on the Company is
not expected to be material.

The Company has a $400,000 revolving credit facility, increased from $300,000
in fiscal year 1999, with a consortium of banks, led by the First National
Bank of Chicago, to be used for working capital purposes and to fund future
acquisitions. The facility consists of a swing line of credit of up to
$15,000 bearing interest at prime, a $40,000 revolving loan bearing interest
at prime, and revolving credit borrowings which bear interest at LIBOR plus
625% to LIBOR plus 175% based upon the Company ratio of debt to its cash
flows, measured by earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and
amortization EBITDA. At September 27, 1998 and October 3, 1999, the Company
was able to borrow at LIBOR plus 1% and 175%, respectively. The facility
calls for an unused commitment fee payable quarterly, in arrears, at a rate
of 20% and 375% based upon the Company ratio of debt to EBITDA. At
September 27, 1998 and October 3, 1999, the Company unused commitment fee
rate was 25% and 375%, respectively. The facility is collateralized by the
stock of the Company subsidiaries and expires on October 15, 2001. At
September 27, 1998 and October 3, 1999, the total outstanding balance under
this credit facility was $232,993 and

-   $316,891, respectively, and $67,007 and $83,109, respectively, were available
for borrowing.
As of September 27, 1998, the Company had $2,993 outstanding under the swing
line of credit at the prime rate of 85%. The remaining $230,000 outstanding
under this facility related to four revolving loans. At September 27, 1998,
the Company had one loan of $150,000 at an interest rate of 660%, which
repriced during fiscal year 1999 at interest rates ranging from 613% to
688%. The remaining $80,000 outstanding under this credit facility at
September 27, 1998 consists of one $40,000 and two $20,000 five-year interest
rate swap agreements that were entered into during fiscal year 1996. These
agreements have fixed interest rates plus a margin of 625% to 150%, based
on the Company leverage ratio on the date the agreements are repriced. The
Company fixed interest rates, including margins, were 791% and 809% on
the two $20,000 swap agreements and 785% on the $40,000 swap agreement at
September 27, 1998.
As of October 3, 1999, the Company had $1,891 outstanding under the swing
line of credit at the prime rate of 825%. The remaining $315,000 outstanding
under this facility related to ten revolving loans. At October 3, 1999, the
Company had four loans totaling $185,000 at an interest rate of 713%, one
loan of $10,000 at an interest rate of 711% and one loan of $40,000 bearing
interest at prime. The remaining $80,000 outstanding under this facility at
October 3, 1999 consists of one $40,000 and two $20,000 five-year interest
rate swap agreements that were entered into during fiscal year 1996. These
agreements have fixed interest rates plus a margin of 625% to 150%, based
on the Company leverage ratio on the date the agreements are repriced. The
Company fixed interest rates, including margins, were 866% and 884% on
the two $20,000 swap agreements and 860% on the $40,000 swap agreement at
October 3, 1999. The Company is exposed to credit risk in the event of
nonperformance by the counterparty to the interest rate swap agreements. The
Company mitigates credit risk by dealing only with financially sound banks.
Accordingly, the Company does not anticipate loss for nonperformance by these
counterparties.
The Company credit facility contains certain restrictive covenants that
require maintenance of a funded debt to EBITDA ratio; a specified fixed
charge coverage ratio; and a minimum level of stockholders' equity; plus
places limitations on capital expenditures, and places limitations on
dividends and other borrowings. The credit facility also has a covenant
prohibiting a change in control in excess of 30% of the Company outstanding
stock other than by the Company current majority shareholder.
As discussed in Note 20, subsequent to fiscal year 1999, all amounts
outstanding under the Company credit facility were paid in full with the
proceeds received in connection with the merger of the Company. In addition,
the Company terminated its outstanding interest rate swap agreements. As a
result, the Company recorded an extraordinary loss on the early

costs associated with two separate terminated subordinated debt offerings,
including a loss of approximately $1,030 on a treasury lock transaction
during fiscal year 1998 that was intended to hedge against interest rate
exposure on the 1998 offering. Such costs have been included in Other, net

7. Common Stock Plans
The Company Incentive Award Plan the Award Plan provides for the grant of
incentive stock options, non-qualified stock options, stock appreciation
rights, and restricted stock, or a combination thereof, as determined by the
Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors at the time of grant, to
officers and certain employees. Under the Award Plan, 1,750,000 shares of the
Company common stock have been reserved for issuance. Options granted under
the Award Plan provide for the purchase of the Company common stock at not
less than the fair market value on the date the option is granted. In
conjunction with the Company initial public offering, options for 538,000
shares of common stock were granted at prices ranging from $800 to $880 per
share. The options granted became exercisable six months from the date of
grant and originally expired on August 2, 1999; however, expiration was
extended by two years until August 2, 2001 by action of the Board of
Directors due to the pending merger of the Company discussed in Note 20,
resulting in compensation expense of $1,590. Options subsequently granted
generally become exercisable over periods ranging from six months to four
years and have terms of five to ten years. The Company also issued 43,500
restricted shares under the Award Plan during fiscal year 1997 in connection
with the acquisition of Interstate.
On February 23, 1995, the shareholders approved the Non-Qualified Stock
Option Plan for Non-Employee Directors Non-Employee Directors Stock Option
Plan which provides for the grant of stock options to the non-employee
directors of the Company. Under this plan                    47 Citation Corporation and Subsidiaries

granted. The options issued under this plan are exercisable six months after
the date of grant and expire five years after the date of grant. As of
October 3, 1999, options for 50,000 shares of the Company stock had been
issued under this plan of which 40,000 were granted at $1525 per share,
became exercisable in January 1996, and expire in June 2000 and 10,000 were
granted at $1097 per share, became exercisable in August 1999, and expire in
February 2004. None of these options has been exercised as of October 3,

The number of stock options assumed to have been bought back by the Company
for computational purposes has been calculated by dividing gross proceeds
from all weighted average stock options outstanding during the period, as
if exercised, by the average common share market price during the period.
The average common share market prices used in the above calculations were
$1436, $1785, and $1287 for fiscal years ended 1997, 1998, and 1999,
respectively.

On October 23, 1998, the Company made distributions of $466 to the
Company former S corporation stockholders as a result of an Internal
Revenue Service audit of the 1993 and 1994 tax years prior to the
Company 1994 initial public offering, which resulted in an increase to
the Company taxable income for those years. This distribution was made in
accordance with the terms of the 1994 Tax Indemnification Agreement between
the Company and its former S corporation stockholders, by which the Company
and the former S corporation stockholders agreed to indemnify each other
for subsequent determinations of income tax liability or increased
earnings, respectively, attributable to fiscal periods prior to termination
of the S corporation status.

assets used in determining net pension expense ranged from 7% to 9% for 1998
and 7% to 9% for 1999.
Because the Company aggregates the disclosures of its pension plans with
plans with accumulated benefit obligations in excess of plan assets
underfunded plans, the following additional disclosures are applicable to

Interstate and elected to terminate the merged plan. The Company applied for
and received approval for the termination of the merged plan from the
Internal Revenue Service and is awaiting approval from the Pension Benefit
Guaranty Corporation. At that time, the plan assets will be distributed
according to the provisions of the merged plan document.
ADCC union employees are covered by a multi-employer defined benefit
pension plan sponsored by the union which represents the employees. The
Company makes contributions to the plan in accordance with the collective
bargaining agreement between the Company and the union. The Company
contributed $59, $69, and $101 to this plan in fiscal years 1997, 1998, and
1999, respectively. The actuarial present value of accumulated plan benefits
at January 1, 1999 the most recent valuation date for the multi-employer
union plan as a whole determined through an actuarial valuation performed as
of that date was $128,149. The market value of the union plan net assets
available for benefits on that date was $191,819.
Interstate union employees are covered by two multi-employer defined
benefit pension plans sponsored by two labor unions which represent the
employees. The Company makes contributions to the plans in accordance with
the collective bargaining agreements between Interstate and the unions. The
Company contributed $133, $155 and $148 to these plans in fiscal years 1997,
1998 and 1999, respectively. The actuarial present values of accumulated plan
benefits at January 1, 1999 the most recent valuation date for the multi-
employer union plans in the aggregate determined through actuarial valuations
performed as of that date were $3,000,284 and $4,098,203. The market values
of the union plans' net assets available for benefits on that date were
$4,952,306, and $5,592,308.
The Company maintains several defined contribution plans for certain hourly
and salaried employees. Company contributions to these plans vary based on
certain service and contribution requirements and on other applicable
discretionary factors.

On August 17, 1995, the Company Board of Directors approved the
nonqualified deferred compensation plan, which allows certain members of
management and highly compensated employees to defer a portion of their
compensation. The deferred compensation together with the Company
matching amounts and accumulated interest is distributable in cash after
retirement or termination of employment. The Company recognized expense
related to this plan of $110, $133 and $33 in fiscal years 1997, 1998 and
1999, respectively. All amounts outstanding under the deferred compensation
plan were paid out subsequent to fiscal year 1999 in connection with the
Company merger discussed in Note 20.
13. Postretirement Benefits Other Than Pensions
Interstate provides postretirement benefits other than pensions, including
health care and life insurance, to certain employee groups. Interstate
currently funds the cost of providing these benefits as incurred.
Employees governed by collective bargaining agreements receive health
insurance coverage to age 65 if they retire after age 62 and life insurance
coverage, in varying amounts, for the remainder of their lives.
Previously, certain salaried employees were eligible to receive health care
and life insurance benefits for the remainder of their lives if they
retired after age 60. This benefit was terminated in fiscal year 1999 and
the related obligation due to these employees of approximately $1,300 was
disbursed prior to the end of fiscal year 1999.

-    The measurement dates for the plan assets and obligations for fiscal
years 1998 and 1999 are July 1, 1998 and 1999, respectively. Health care
cost trend rate assumptions have a significant effect on the amounts
reported. For example, increasing and decreasing the health care cost
trend rate by one percentage point in each year would increase and
decrease the accumulated postretirement benefit obligation as of
September 27, 1998 and October 3, 1999 by $282 and $207, and $289 and
$213, respectively, and the aggregate of the service and interest cost

invested $1,441 and $11,599, respectively, in the joint venture. The facility
is expected upon completion to have a capacity of approximately $20,000
annually. A contract to purchase land in Mexico for the facility has been
executed and engineering design and construction have been completed. The
Company anticipates no significant additional costs in order to begin
production.
The Company is subject to legal proceedings and claims which arise in the
ordinary course of its business. In the opinion of management, the amount of
ultimate liability with respect to these actions will not materially affect
the consolidated financial position, results of operations, or cash flows of
the Company.
On June 25, 1999 and June 28, 1999, shareholder suits were filed against the
Company, certain directors of the Company, as well as Kelso & Company and RSJ
Acquisition Co., in connection with the merger of the Company discussed in
Note 20. Both complaints purport to be class actions brought on behalf of the
stockholders of the Company and both seek to enjoin the Company merger or,
in the alternative, rescind the merger transaction, and also seek unspecified
damages and attorneys' fees. The complaints allege that the price offered in
the Company merger to the public stockholders was inadequate and that the
defendants have breached their fiduciary duties to the Company and its
stockholders by approving the merger, or have aided and abetted a breach. On
October 18, 1999, the defendants answered one of the complaints, denying all
material allegations of wrongdoing. The second complaint has not been served
on the defendants. Although the Company believes the lawsuits are without
merit, the outcome cannot be predicted at this time. Additionally, there can
be no assurance that additional lawsuits will not be filed against the
Company or its subsidiaries, or that the resolution of those lawsuits will
not have a material adverse effect on the consolidated financial position,
results of operations, or cash flows of the Company.
The Company is subject to numerous federal, state, and local environmental
laws and regulations. Management believes that the Company is in material
compliance with such laws and regulations and that potential environmental
liabilities, if any, are not material to the consolidated financial position,
results of operations, or cash flows of the Company.
The divisions and subsidiaries are primarily self insured for workman
compensation claims and health plans. Stop loss insurance agreements are
utilized to limit the Company liability on both a specific and aggregate
basis for the period of coverage. The liability for unpaid claims included in
accrued insurance reserves in the consolidated balance sheets includes an
accrual for an estimate of claims incurred but not reported.

and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, and accounts payable approximate
fair value because of the immediate or short-term maturity of these
financial instruments. The carrying amounts reported for a portion of the
credit facility and certain of the other long-term debt approximate fair
value because the underlying instruments are at variable interest rates
which reprice frequently. Fair value for fixed rate long-term debt was
estimated using either quoted market prices for the same or similar issues
or the current rates offered to the Company for debt with similar
maturities.
As discussed in Note 6, the Company is party to three interest rate swap
agreements with durations of five years to hedge against interest rate
exposures on $80,000 of long-term debt. The fair value of the interest rate
swaps is estimated based on valuations from the Company lead bank. As
further discussed in Note 6, the interest rate swap agreements were
terminated subsequent to fiscal year 1999 in connection with the Company
merger.
17. Acquisitions
Effective October 29, 1996, the Company completed the purchase of the
outstanding stock of Interstate for $69,656 in cash. In addition, the
purchase agreement requires contingent payments equal to five times the

accordance with generally accepted accounting principles on a pre-acquisition
basis. During fiscal years 1997 and 1998, the Company distributed $2,542 and
$7,227, respectively, to the previous stockholders of Interstate representing
the Company contingent payments for calendar years 1996 and 1997 as
required by the purchase agreement. During fiscal year 1999, the Company
distributed $11,111 to the previous stockholders of Interstate representing
the preliminary contingent payment for calendar year 1998. The final portion
of the calendar year 1998 contingent payment of $2,329 was paid subsequent to
fiscal year 1999 and has been accrued as additional purchase price in the
Company consolidated financial statements. The payment made in fiscal year
1999 has been recorded in the Company consolidated financial statements as
additional purchase price and included in the calculation of the cash paid
for the Interstate acquisition of $69,656. The acquisition has been accounted
for under the purchase method of accounting and, accordingly, the purchase
price has been allocated to the assets and liabilities of Interstate based on
their estimated fair values at the date of acquisition. Operating results of
Interstate since October 29, 1996 are included in the Company consolidated
financial statements.
Effective December 1, 1997, the Company completed the purchase of the
outstanding stock of Camden for $2,100 in cash. The acquisition has been
accounted for under the purchase method of accounting and, accordingly, the
purchase price has been allocated to the assets and liabilities of Camden
based on their estimated fair values at the date of acquisition. Operating
results of Camden since December 1, 1997 are included in the Company
consolidated financial statements.
Effective January 8, 1998, the Company completed the purchase of the
outstanding stock of Dycast for $21,069 in cash. The acquisition has been
accounted for using the purchase method of accounting and, accordingly, the
purchase price has been allocated to the assets and liabilities of Dycast
based on their estimated fair values at the date of acquisition. Operating
results of Dycast since January 8, 1998 are included in the Company
consolidated financial statements.
Effective March 30, 1998, Citation Precision, a newly formed subsidiary of
the Company, acquired the net assets of Amcast Precision Products, Inc. for
$25,431 in cash. The acquisition has been accounted for under the purchase
method of accounting and, accordingly, the purchase price has been allocated

-    Pro forma earnings per share - basic for the years ended September 27, 1998
and October 3, 1999 is calculated by dividing pro forma net income by the
basic weighted average shares outstanding of 17,838,354 and 17,884,702,
respectively. Pro forma earnings per share - diluted for the years ended
September 27, 1998 and October 3, 1999 is calculated by dividing pro forma
net income by the diluted weighted average shares outstanding of 18,042,346
and 17,968,128, respectively.
18. Impairment Charge and Sale of Subsidiaries
During fiscal year 1998, the Company recognized an impairment loss, in
accordance with SFAS No. 121, on the long-lived assets of Oberdorfer, a
former division located in Syracuse, New York. The trends at Oberdorfer
indicated that the undiscounted future cash flows from this division would
be substantially less than the carrying value of the long-lived assets
related to that division. Accordingly, the Company recognized a non-cash
pre-tax charge of $10,000 in fiscal year 1998 to write the assets down to
their estimated fair value based on management estimate of the expected
net proceeds to be received upon the sale of Oberdorfer. The fiscal year
1998 charge consisted of $9,116 related to property, plant and equipment,
$780 related to goodwill, and $104 related to other long-lived assets.
On June 16, 1999, the Company completed the sale of Oberdorfer and recorded
a pre-tax loss of $1,815 in the consolidated statement of income for the
year ended October 3, 1999. The Company received proceeds of $3,453, which
included $1,000 in cash, a note receivable of $953 discounted at an
interest rate of 9% and payable in twenty quarterly installments commencing
on October 1, 2001, and membership interests in the purchaser a limited
liability company of $1,500. The note receivable and LLC membership
interests are included in other assets at October 3, 1999.
On October 31, 1996, the Company completed the sale of Pennsylvania Steel
Foundry and Machine Company, Inc. for cash proceeds of $9,006. The related
pre-tax loss on this sale of $1,807 was included in the Company
consolidated statement of income for the year ended September 29, 1996.
