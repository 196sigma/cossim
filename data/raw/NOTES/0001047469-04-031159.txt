UNITED NATURAL FOODS,INC.      NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS      Fiscal years ended July31, 2004, 2003 and 2002    
1SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES  a Nature of Business  United Natural Foods,Inc. and Subsidiaries the Company is a distributor and retailer of natural and organic products. The Company sells its products
primarily throughout the United States.  b Basis of Presentation  The accompanying financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its wholly owned subsidiaries. All significant intercompany transactions and
balances have been eliminated in consolidation. Certain prior year amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current year presentation. On
March17, 2004, the Company Board of Directors approved a two-for-one split of the Company common stock that was payable in the form of a stock
dividend. Stockholders received one additional share of the Company common stock for each share of common stock held on the record date of March29, 2004. The split became effective on
April20, 2004. The applicable share and per-share data for all periods included herein have been restated to give effect to this stock split. The par value of the common stock was
not affected by the stock split and remains at $001 per share.  c Cash Equivalents  Cash equivalents consist of highly liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less.  d Inventories and Cost of Sales  Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market, with cost being determined using the first-in, first-out FIFO method. Allowances
received from suppliers are recorded as reductions in cost of sales upon the sale of the related products.  e Property and Equipment  Property and equipment are stated at cost. Equipment under capital leases is stated at the lower of the present value of minimum lease payments at the inception
of the lease or the fair value of the asset. Depreciation and amortization are principally provided using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives.  f Income Taxes  The Company accounts for income taxes under the asset and liability method. Under the asset and liability method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are
recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases. Deferred tax
assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on
deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date. 
37  g Intangible Assets and Other Long-Lived Assets  Intangible assets consist principally of goodwill and covenants not to compete. Goodwill represents the excess purchase price over fair value of net assets
acquired in connection with purchase business combinations. Covenants not to compete are initially recorded at fair value and are amortized using the straight-line method over the lives of
the respective agreements, generally five years. 
Statement
of Financial Accounting Standards SFAS No142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, requires that companies no
longer amortize goodwill, but instead test goodwill for impairment at least annually and between annual tests if events occur or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair
value of a reporting unit below its carrying amount. The Company has elected to perform its annual tests for indications of goodwill impairment as of July31 of each year. Impairment losses are
determined based upon the excess of carrying amounts over discounted expected future cash flows of the underlying business. The assessment of the recoverability of long-lived assets will
be impacted if estimated future cash flows are not achieved. For reporting units that indicated potential impairment, we determined the implied fair value of that reporting unit using a discounted
cash flow analysis and compared such values to the respective reporting units' carrying amounts. 
As
of July31, 2004, the Company annual assessment of each of its reporting units indicated that no impairment of goodwill existed. The restructuring of the Hershey Imports
Company Hershey division during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2003 represented a triggering event that required the Company to evaluate Hershey goodwill for potential impairment. The Company
testing and subsequent analysis indicated that goodwill for Hershey was impaired. Accordingly, the Company recognized an impairment charge of approximately $14million on goodwill for the year
ended July31, 2003. 
Total
goodwill as of July31, 2004 was $572million. The Company recorded additional goodwill in the Wholesale operating segment of approximately $274million
during the year ended July31, 2003 as a result of the acquisitions of Blooming Prairie Cooperative Warehouse $138million and Northeast Cooperative $136million. As of
July31, 2003, the Company had goodwill of $574million after recording the Hershey impairment charge of approximately $14million. Other
intangibles consist of covenants not to compete and supply agreements with a weighted average amortization period of five years. The Company had other intangibles and related
accumulated amortization of $02million and $01million at July31, 2004, respectively, and $15million and $05million at July31, 2003, respectively.
Amortization expense was $09million, $04million and $01million for the years ended July31, 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively. Estimated amortization expense for the
next four fiscal years is as follows: Years ended July 31 
In thousands 2005 61 2006 60 2007 30 2008 3 154 h Revenue Recognition and Concentration of Credit Risk  The Company records revenue upon delivery of products. Revenues are recorded net of applicable sales discounts and estimated sales returns. Sales incentives
provided to customers are accounted for as reductions in revenue as the related revenue is recorded. The Company sales are primarily with customers located throughout the United States. The Company
had one customer in 2004 and 2003, Whole Foods Market,Inc. Whole Foods Markets, which provided more than 10% of the 
38 
Company
revenue. In 2002, two customers, Whole Foods Markets and Wild Oats Markets,Inc. Wild Oats Markets, generated 10% or more of the Company revenues. Net sales to Whole Foods
Markets were approximately 26%, 24% and 19% of net sales in 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively. Wild Oats Markets represented 14% of net sales net sales in 2002. 
The
Company analyzes customer creditworthiness, accounts receivable balances, payment history, payment terms and historical bad debt levels when evaluating the adequacy of its allowance
for doubtful accounts. In instances where a reserve has been recorded for a particular customer, future sales to the customer are conducted using either cash-on-delivery terms,
or the account is closely monitored so that as agreed upon payments are received, orders are released; a failure to pay results in held or cancelled orders.  iAdvertising  Advertising costs are expensed as incurred. Advertising expense was $64million, $66million and $52million for the years ended
July31, 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively.  j Fair Value of Financial Instruments  The carrying amounts of the Company financial instruments including cash, accounts receivable, accounts payable and accrued expenses approximate fair value due
to the short-term nature of these instruments. The carrying value of notes receivable, long-term debt and capital lease obligations are based on the instruments' interest rate,
terms, maturity date and collateral, if any, in comparison to the Company incremental borrowing rate for similar financial instruments. The
following estimated fair value amounts have been determined by the Company using available market information and appropriate valuation methodologies. However, considerable judgment
is required in interpreting market data to develop the estimates of fair value. Accordingly, the estimates presented herein are not necessarily indicative of the amounts that the Company could realize
in a current market exchange. July 31, 2003 July 31, 2004 Carrying Value Carrying Value

assets and liabilities to prepare these financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Actual results could differ from those
estimates.  l Notes Receivable, Trade  The Company issues notes receivable, trade to certain customers under two basic circumstances; inventory purchases for initial store openings and overdue accounts
receivable. Initial store opening notes are generally receivable over a period not to exceed twelve months. The overdue accounts 
39 
receivable
notes may extend for periods greater than one year. All notes are issued at a market interest rate and contain certain guarantees and collateral assignments in favor of the Company.  m Stock-Based Compensation  The Company grants stock options for a fixed number of shares to employees and certain other individuals with exercise prices equal to the fair value of the
shares at the dates of grant. The Company has adopted the disclosure only provisions of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No123, Accounting for Stock-based
Compensation SFAS123, and will continue to account for its stock option plans in accordance with the provisions of Accounting Principles Board Opinion 25, Accounting for Stock Issued to
Employees. In addition, the Company has made the appropriate disclosures as required under Statement of Financial
Accounting Standards No148, Accounting for Stock-Based CompensationTransition and Disclosurean amendment of FASB Statement
No123 SFAS148.
The
following table illustrates the effect on net income and earnings per share if the Company had applied the fair value recognition provision of SFAS123 and SFAS148 to

share are calculated by adding the dilutive potential common shares to the weighted average number of common shares that were outstanding during the period. For purposes of the diluted earnings per
share calculation, outstanding

2 1,202 o Comprehensive Income  Components of comprehensive income include net income and certain transactions that have generally been reported in the consolidated statement of stockholders'
equity. Comprehensive income is comprised of net income and the net change in fair value of derivative instruments designated as cash flow hedges.  p Derivative Financial Instruments  The Company is exposed to market risks arising from changes in interest rates. The Company uses derivatives principally in the management of interest rate
exposure. It does not utilize derivatives that contain leverage features. On the date on which the Company enters into a derivative transaction, the derivative is designated as a hedge of the
identified exposure. The Company formally documents all relationships between hedging instruments and hedged items, as well as its risk-management objective and strategy for undertaking
the hedge transaction. In this documentation, the Company specifically identifies the asset, liability, firm commitment, forecasted transaction, or net investment that has been designated as the
hedged item and states how the hedging instrument is expected to reduce the risks related to the hedged item. The Company measures effectiveness of its hedging relationships both at hedge inception
and on an ongoing basis.  q New Accounting Pronouncements  The Company has determined that there are no recently issued accounting standards that are expected to have a material impact on its consolidated financial
position, results of operations or cash flows. 2ACQUISITIONS

On April30, 2004, the Company entered into an amended and restated four-year $250million secured revolving credit facility with a bank
group that was led by Bank of America Business Capital formerly Fleet Capital Corporation as the administrative agent the amended credit facility. The amended credit facility increased the
amount available for borrowing from $150million to $250million, 
43  on
which interest accrues, at the Company option, at the New York Prime Rate 425% at July31, 2004 and 400% at July31, 2003 or at the London Interbank Offered Rate LIBOR plus
125%. The $250million credit facility matures on March31, 2008. The weighted average interest rate on the amended credit facility was 275% as of July31, 2004. As of
July31, 2004, the Company outstanding borrowings under the amended credit facility totaled $1070million with an availability of $1009million. As more fully discussed in
Note8, the Company entered into certain interest rate swap agreements to hedge this indebtedness which were assigned and transferred to a third party in December2003. The
credit agreement contains certain restrictive covenants. The Company was in compliance with all restrictive covenants at July31, 2004. The agreement also provides for the
bank to syndicate the credit facility to other banks and lending institutions. The Company has pledged the majority of its accounts receivable and inventory for its obligations under the credit
agreement. 
7LONG-TERM DEBT 
The Company entered into a $30million term loan agreement with a financial institution effective April30, 2003. The term loan is repayable over
seven years based on a fifteen year amortization schedule. Interest accrues at 30day LIBOR plus 150%. The Company has pledged certain real property as collateral for its obligations under the
term loan agreement. In December2003, the Company amended the term loan agreement with the financial institution, increasing the principal amount by $10million to $40million,
under the existing terms and conditions. The proceeds were used for the expansion of its distribution facilities. 
As
of July31, 2004 and 2003, the Company long-term debt consisted on the following: July 31 2004
2003 In thousands Term loans payable to bank, secured by real estate, due monthly and mature in April 2010, at a rate of 30 day LIBOR plus 15% 300% at July31, 2004 37,278 29,667 Promissory note due October 2005, at a rate of 30 day LIBOR plus 125% 275% at July 31, 2004 3,595 3,595 Equipment financing loans payable to bank, secured by the underlying assets, due monthly and maturing at various dates from March 2006 through July 2007, at rates ranging from 479% to 1157 3,652 5,279 Real estate term loans payable to bank and others, secured by building and other assets, due monthly and maturing at various dates from March 2005 through April 2015, at rates ranging from 750% to 860 2,157 2,494 Term loan for employee stock ownership plan, secured by stock of the Company, due $14 monthly plus interest at 100%, balance due May 1, 2015 1,768 1,931 Other 294 48,744 42,966 Less: current installments 4,766 4,459 Long-term debt, excluding current installments 43,978 38,507 44 
Certain
debt agreements contain restrictive covenants. The Company was in compliance with all of its restrictive covenants at July31, 2004. 
Aggregate
maturities of long-term debt for the next five years and thereafter are as follows at July31, 2004: Year 
In thousands 2005 4,766 2006 7,897 2007 3,699 2008 3,181 2009 2,896 2010 and thereafter 26,305 48,744 8FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS 
In October1998, the Company entered into an interest rate swap agreement that provided for it to pay interest for a five-year period at a
fixed rate of 5% on a notional principal amount of $60million while receiving interest for the same period at the LIBOR rate on the same notional principal amount. This swap had been entered
into as a hedge against LIBOR interest rate movements on current and anticipated variable rate indebtedness totaling $60million at LIBOR plus 150%, thereby fixing the effective rate at 650%.
In October2003, the counter party exercised its option to extend the original five-year term of the swap agreement to seven years. The inclusion of this
option prohibited accounting for the swap as an effective hedge under Statement of Financial Accounting Standards SFAS No133 SFAS133, Accounting for
Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities. 
The
Company entered into an additional interest rate swap agreement effective August2001. The additional agreement provided for it to pay interest for a four-year
period at a fixed rate of 481% on a notional principal amount of $30million while receiving interest for the same period at the LIBOR rate on the same notional principal amount. The
four-year term of the swap agreement could have been extended to six years at the option of the counter party, which prohibited accounting for the swap as an effective hedge under
SFAS133. The swap had been entered into as a hedge against LIBOR interest rate movements on current and anticipated variable rate indebtedness totaling $30million at LIBOR plus 150 thereby fixing the effective rate on the notional amount at 631%. If LIBOR exceeded 60% in a given period, the agreement was suspended for that period. 
On
December29, 2003, the Company assigned and transferred all of its obligations of its two ineffective interest rate swaps to a third party at a cost of $54million
plus accrued interest. As a result of this assignment, these ineffective swaps will no longer be included as a special item for future fiscal periods. These ineffective swaps were included as
special items for the first two quarters of fiscal 2004. 
In
May2003, the Company entered into an additional interest rate swap agreement. The agreement provides for it to pay interest for a seven-year period at a fixed rate
of 368% on a notional principal amount of $30million while receiving interest for the same period at the LIBOR rate on the same notional principal amount. The swap has been entered into as a
hedge against LIBOR interest rate movements on current variable rate indebtedness totaling $30million at LIBOR plus 150%, thereby fixing our effective rate on the notional amount at 518%.
LIBOR was 150% as of July31, 2004. The swap agreement qualifies as an effective hedge under SFAS No133, and the Company recorded an asset of $04million as of
July31, 2004 and 2003, and a corresponding credit to accumulated other comprehensive income in the statement of stockholders' equity. 
45  9CAPITAL LEASES 
The Company leases computer, office and warehouse equipment under capital leases expiring in various years through 2007. The assets and liabilities under capital
leases are recorded at the lower of the present value of the minimum lease payments or the fair value of the assets. The assets are depreciated over the shorter of their related lease terms or their
estimated productive lives. Total capital leased assets at July31, 2004 and 2003 were $5,965, and $6,262, respectively, less accumulated depreciation of $4,558 and $4,106, respectively.

The Company leases various facilities under operating lease agreements with varying terms. Most of the leases contain renewal options and purchase options at
several specific dates throughout the terms of the leases. 
Rent
and other lease expense for the years ended July31, 2004, 2003 and 2002 totaled approximately $168million, $164million, and $143million,
respectively. 
Future
minimum annual fixed payments required under non-cancelable operating leases having an original term of more than one year as of July31, 2004 are as follows: Year

commitments as of July31, 2004 for the purchase of inventory were approximately $138million. The Company had outstanding letters of credit of
approximately $82million at July31, 2004. 
The
Company may from time to time be involved in various claims and legal actions arising in the ordinary course of business. In the opinion of management, the ultimate disposition of
these matters will not have a material adverse effect on the Company consolidated financial position or results of operations. 
46  11RETIREMENT PLAN 
The Company has one defined contribution retirement plan, the 401k Plan. During fiscal 2004, the Company merged the defined contribution plans of Blooming
Prairie and Northeast Cooperatives into the 401k Plan. Under the 401k Plan, the employees may choose to reduce their compensation and have these amounts contributed to the 401k Plan on their
behalf. In order to become a participant in the 401k Plan, employees must meet certain eligibility requirements as described in the respective 401k Plan document. In addition to amounts
contributed to the 401k Plan by employees, the Company makes contributions to the 401k Plan on behalf of the employees. The Company contributions to the 401k Plan were approximately
$19million, $16million, and $13million for the years ended July31, 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively. 
12EMPLOYEE STOCK OWNERSHIP PLAN 
The Company adopted the UNFI Employee Stock Ownership Plan the ESOP Plan for the purpose of acquiring outstanding shares of the Company for the benefit of
eligible employees. The ESOP Plan was effective as of November1, 1988 and has received notice of qualification by the Internal Revenue Service. In
connection with the adoption of the ESOP Plan, a Trust was established to hold the shares acquired. On November1, 1988, the Trust purchased 40% of the then outstanding Common
Stock of the Company at a price of $41million. The trustees funded this purchase by issuing promissory notes to the initial stockholders, with the Trust shares pledged as collateral. These
notes bear interest at 10% and are payable through May2015. As the debt is repaid, shares are released from collateral and allocated to active employees, based on the proportion of debt
service paid in the year. 
The
Accounting Standards Executive Committee of the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants issued Statement of Position 93-6 SOP 93-6, Employers' Accounting for Employee Stock Ownership Plans, in November1993. The statement provides guidance on employers' accounting for ESOPs
and is required to be applied to shares purchased by ESOPs after December31, 1992, that have not been committed to be released as of the beginning of the year of adoption. In accordance with
SOP 93-6, the Company elected not to adopt the guidance in SOP 93-6 for the shares held by the ESOP, all of which were purchased prior to December31, 1992. The debt of
the ESOP is recorded as debt and the shares pledged as collateral are reported as unearned ESOP shares in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. During each of 2004, 2003 and 2002 contributions totaling
approximately $03million, $04million and $04million, respectively, were made to the Trust. Of these contributions, approximately $02million represented interest in
2004, 2003 and 2002.

July31, 2004, the Company had net operating loss carryforwards of approximately $26million for state income tax purposes that expire in years 2005 through 2024. 
In
assessing the recoverability of deferred tax assets, the Company considers whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized.
Due to the fact that the Company has sufficient taxable income in the federal carryback period and anticipates sufficient future taxable income over the periods which the deferred tax assets are
deductible, the ultimate realization of deferred tax assets for, with the exception of certain state operating loss carryforwards, federal and state tax purposes appears more likely than not. 
14BUSINESS SEGMENTS 
The Company has several operating segments aggregated under the wholesale segment, which is the Company only reportable segment. These operating segments have
similar products and services, customer types, distribution methods and historical margins. The wholesale segment is engaged in national distribution of natural foods and related products in the
United States. Other operating segments include the retail segment, which engages in the sale of natural foods and related products to the general public through retail storefronts on the east coast
of the United States, and a segment engaging in trading, roasting and packaging of nuts, seeds, dried fruit and snack items. These other operating segments do not meet the quantitative thresholds for
reportable segments and are therefore 
49  included
in an Other caption in the segment information. The Other caption also includes corporate expenses that are not allocated to operating segments.
