FalconStor
Software, Inc.:
We have
audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of FalconStor Software,
Inc. and subsidiaries as of December 31, 2009 and 2008, and the related
consolidated statements of operations, stockholders equity and comprehensive
income loss, and cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period
ended December 31, 2009.These consolidated financial statements are
the responsibility of the Companys management.Our responsibility is
to express an opinion on these consolidated financial statements based on our
audits.
We
conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company
Accounting Oversight Board United States. Those standards require that we plan
and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial
statements are free of material misstatement.An audit also includes
examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in
the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and
significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall
financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a
reasonable basis for our opinion.
In our
opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly,
in all material respects, the financial position of FalconStor Software, Inc.
and subsidiaries as of December 31, 2009 and 2008, and the results of their
operations and their cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period
ended December 31, 2009, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting
principles.
We have
also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting
Oversight Board United States, the effectiveness of FalconStor Software, Inc.
and subsidiaries internal control over financial reporting as of December 31,
2009, based on criteria established in Internal Control Integrated
Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the
Treadway Commission COSO, and our report, dated March 12, 2010, expressed an
unqualified opinion on the effectiveness of the Companys internal control over
financial reporting.

The Board
of Directors and Stockholders
FalconStor
Software, Inc.:
We have
audited FalconStor Software, Inc. and subsidiaries internal control over
financial reporting as of December 31, 2009, based on criteria established in
Internal Control - Integrated
Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the
Treadway Commission COSO. FalconStor Software, Inc. management is
responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting
and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial
reporting, included in the accompanying Managements Report on Internal Control
Over Financial Reporting.Our responsibility is to express an opinion
on the Companys internal control over financial reporting based on our
audit.
We
conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company
Accounting Oversight Board United States. Those standards require that we plan
and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective
internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material
respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over
financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and
testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal
control based on the assessed risk. Our audit also included performing such
other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe
that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.
A
company internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to
provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting
and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance
with generally accepted accounting principles. A company internal control over
financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that 1 pertain to
the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly
reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; 2
provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to
permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted
accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are
being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of
the company; and 3 provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely
detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the companys
assets that could have a material effect on the financial
statements.
Because
of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not
prevent or detect misstatements.Also, projections of any evaluation
of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may
become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of
compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
In our
opinion, FalconStor Software, Inc. and subsidiaries maintained, in all material
respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31,
2009, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated
Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the
Treadway Commission COSO.
We also
have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting
Oversight Board United States, the consolidated balance sheets of FalconStor
Software, Inc. and subsidiaries as of December 31, 2009 and 2008, and the
related consolidated statements of operations, stockholders equity and
comprehensive income loss, and cash flows for each of the years in the
three-year period ended December 31, 2009, and our report dated March 12, 2010,
expressed an unqualified opinion on those consolidated financial
statements.

Summary of Significant Accounting Policies
a
The
Company and Nature of Operations
FalconStor
Software, Inc., a Delaware Corporation the Company, develops, manufactures
and sells network storage software solutions and provides the related
maintenance, implementation and engineering services.
b
Principles
of Consolidation
The
consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its
wholly owned subsidiaries.All significant intercompany balances and
transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.
c
Use of Estimates
The
preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted
accounting principles requires management to make
estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and
liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of
the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses
during the reporting period.The Companys significant estimates
include
those related to revenue recognition, accounts receivable allowances,
share-based payment compensation, cost-based investments, marketable securities
and deferred income taxes. Actual results could differ from those
estimates.
The
financial market volatility and poor economic conditions beginning in the third
quarter of 2008 and continuing throughout 2009, both in the U.S. and in many
other countries where the Company operates, have impacted and may continue to
impact the Companys business. Such conditions could have a material impact to
the Companys significant accounting estimates discussed above, in particular
those around accounts receivable allowances, cost-based investments and
marketable securities.
d
Cash
Equivalents and Marketable
Securities
The
Company considers all highly liquid investments with maturities of three months
or less when purchased to be cash equivalents. The Company records its cash
equivalents and marketable securities at fair value in accordancewith
the authoritative guidance issued by the Financial Accounting Standards Board
FASB on fair value measurements and disclosures. As of December 31, 2009 and
December 31, 2008, the Companys cash equivalents consisted of money market
funds, government securities and/or commercial paper. At December 31, 2009 and
December 31, 2008, the fair value of the Companys
cash equivalents amounted to approximately $88 million and $159 million,
respectively. As of December 31, 2009 and December 31, 2008, the Companys
marketable securities consisted of corporate bonds, auction rate securities, and
government securities. As of December 31, 2009 and December 31, 2008, the fair
value of the Companys current marketable securities was approximately $250
million and $193 million, respectively. In addition, at December 31, 2009 and
December 31, 2008, the Company had an additional $11 million and $12 million,
respectively, of long-term marketable securities that required a higher level of
judgment to determine the fair value. All of the Companys marketable securities
are classified as available-for-sale, and accordingly, unrealized gains and
losses on marketable securities, net of tax, are reflected as a component of
accumulated other comprehensive loss in stockholders equity. Any
other-than-temporary impairments are recorded in other income in the
consolidated statement of operations. See Note 4 Fair Value
Measurements for additional information.
52
Table of Contents
e
Fair
Value of Financial Instruments
Fair
value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to
transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at
the measurement date. To increase the comparability of fair value measurements,
a three-tier fair value hierarchy, which prioritizes the inputs used in the
valuation methodologies, is as follows:
Level1 Valuations
based on quoted prices for identical assets and liabilities in active
markets.
Level2 Valuations
based on observable inputs other than quoted prices included in Level 1, such as
quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets, quoted
prices for identical or similar assets and liabilities in markets that are not
active, or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable
market data.
Level3 Valuations based
on unobservable inputs reflecting our own assumptions, consistent with
reasonably available assumptions made by other market participants. These
valuations require significant judgment.
As
of each December 31, 2009 and 2008, the fair value of the Companys financial
instruments including cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, accounts
payable, and accrued expenses, approximates book value due to the short maturity
of these instruments.
See Note 4 Fair Value
Measurements for additional information.

the authoritative guidance issued by the FASB on revenue recognition, the
Company recognizes revenue from software
licenses when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, the fee is fixed and
determinable and the software is delivered and collection of the resulting
receivable is deemed probable. Software delivered to a customer on a trial basis
is not recognized as revenue until a permanent key code is delivered to the
customer. Reseller customers typically send the Company a purchase order when
they have an end user identified. When a customer licenses software together
with the purchase of maintenance, the Company allocates a portion of the fee to
maintenance for its fair value. Software maintenance fees are deferred and
recognized as revenue ratably over the term of the contract. The long-term
portion of deferred revenue relates to maintenance contracts with terms in
excess of one year. The cost of providing technical support is included in cost
of maintenance, software service and other revenues. The Company provides an
allowance for software product returns as a reduction of revenue, based upon
historical experience and known or expected trends.
Revenues
associated with software implementation and software engineering services are
recognized when the services are performed. Costs of providing these services
are included in cost of maintenance, software services and other
revenues.
The
Company has entered into various distribution, licensing and joint promotion
agreements with OEMs and distributors, whereby the Company has provided to the
reseller a non-exclusive software license to install the Companys software on
certain hardware or to resell the Companys software in exchange for payments
based on the products distributed by the OEM or distributor. Such payments from
the OEM or distributor are recognized as revenue in the period reported by the
OEM or distributor.
The
Company has transactions in which it purchases hardware and bundles this
hardware with the Companys software and sells the bundled solution to its
customer. The Companys software is not essential to the functionality of the
bundled hardware. The amount of revenue allocated to the software and hardware
bundle is recognized as revenue in the period delivered provided all other
revenue recognition criteria have been met. The Company further separates the
software sales revenue from the hardware revenue for purposes of classification
in the consolidated statements of operations in a systematic and rational manner
based on their deemed relative fair values.

Property
and equipment are recorded at cost. Depreciation is recognized using the
straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets 3 to 7
years. Leasehold improvements are amortized on a straight-line basis over the
terms of the respective leases or over their estimated useful lives, whichever
is shorter.

Goodwill
and Other Intangible Assets
Goodwill
represents the excess of the purchase price over the estimated fair value of net
tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired in business combinations.
The Company has not amortized goodwill related to its acquisitions, but instead
tests the balance for impairment. The Companys annual impairment assessment is
performed during the fourth quarter of each year, and an assessment is made at
other times if events or changes in circumstances indicate that it is more
likely than not that the asset is impaired. Identifiable intangible assets,
which include i assets acquired through business combinations, which include
customer contracts and intellectual property, and ii patents amortized over
three years using the straight-line method.See Note 9 Acquisitions
for additional information.
Amortization expense

Software
Development Costs and Purchased Software
Technology
In
accordance with the authoritative guidance issued by the FASB on costs of
software to be sold, leased, or marketed, costs associated with the development
of new software products and enhancements to existing software products are
expensed as incurred until technological feasibility of the product has been
established. Based on the Companys product development process, technological
feasibility is established upon completion of a working model. Amortization of
software development costs is recorded at the greater of the straight-line basis
over the products estimated life, typically three years, or the ratio of current
revenue of the related products to total current and anticipated future revenue
of these products. During the first quarter of 2009, the Company capitalized
$80,703 related to software development projects. The Company did not capitalize
any other software development costs during 2009. Amortization expense was
$20,176 for the year ended December 31, 2009.
The
purchased software technology net carrying value of $510,000 and $102,540, after
accumulated amortization of $5,817,431 and $5,274,891, is included in other
assets in the consolidated balance sheets as of December 31, 2009 and December
31, 2008, respectively. Amortization expense was $542,540, $143,477 and $122,560
for the years ended December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively. Amortization
of purchased software technology is recorded at the greater of the straight-line
basis over the products estimated remaining life or the ratio of current period
revenue of the related products to total current and anticipated future revenue
of these products.

j
Income
Taxes
The
Company records income taxes under the liability method. Deferred tax assets and
liabilities are recognized for future tax consequences attributable to
differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets
and liabilities and their respective tax bases. Deferred tax assets and
liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable
income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be
realized or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a
change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the
enactment date. In determining the period in which related tax benefits are
realized for book purposes, excess share-based compensation deductions included
in net operating losses are realized after regular net operating losses are
exhausted.
Since
January 1, 2007, the Company
accounted for uncertain tax positions in accordance with the authoritative
guidance issued by the FASB on income taxes, which addresses the determination
of whether tax benefits claimed or expected to be claimed on a tax return should
be recorded in the financial statements. Pursuant to the authoritative guidance,
the Company may recognize the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if
it meets the more likely than not threshold that the position will be
sustained on examination by the taxing authority, based on the technical merits
of the position. The tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from
such a position should be measured based on the largest benefit that has a
greater than fifty percent likelihood of being realized upon ultimate
settlement. In addition, the authoritative guidance addresses de-recognition,
classification, interest and penalties on income taxes, accounting in interim
periods, and also requires increased disclosures. The Company includes interest
and penalties related to its uncertain tax positions as part of income tax
expense within its consolidated statement of operations. See Note 6 Income Taxes for additional
information.
k
Long-Lived
Assets
The
Company reviews its long-lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes
in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the asset may not be
recoverable.If the sum of the expected future cash flows,
undiscounted and without interest is less than the carrying amount of the asset,
an impairment loss is recognized as the amount by which the carrying amount of
the asset exceeds its fair value.
l
Share-Based
Payments
The
Company accounts for share-based payments in accordance with the authoritative
guidance issued by the FASB on stock compensation, which establishes the
accounting for transactions in which an entity exchanges its equity instruments
for goods or services. Under the provisions of the authoritative guidance,
share-based compensation expense is measured at the grant date, based on the
fair value of the award, and is recognized as an expense over the requisite
employee service period generally the vesting period, net of estimated
forfeitures. The Company estimates the fair value of share-based payments using
the Black-Scholes option-pricing model. The estimation of share-based awards
that will ultimately vest requires judgment, and to the extent actual results or
updated estimates differ from the Companys current estimates, such amounts will
be recorded as a cumulative adjustment in the period estimates are revised. The
Company considers many factors when estimating expected forfeitures, including
types of awards, employee class and historical experience. Additionally,
share-based awards to non-employees are expensed over the period in which the
related services are rendered at their fair value. All share-based awards are
expected to be fulfilled with new shares of common stock.

foreign currency transactions are included in the consolidated statements of
operations within interest and other income, net. During the years ended
December 31, 2009, 2008, and 2007, foreign currency realized losses gains

Earnings
Per Share EPS`
Basic EPS
is computed based on the weighted average number of shares of common stock
outstanding. Diluted EPS is computed based on the weighted average number of
common shares outstanding increased by dilutive common stock equivalents. Due to
the net loss for the year ended December 31, 2009, all common stock equivalents
of 13,791,999 were excluded from diluted net loss per share because they were
anti-dilutive. As of December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007, potentially dilutive
common stock equivalents included 13,791,999, 8,525,928, and 6,454,969

New
Accounting Pronouncements
In
January 2010, the FASB issued authoritative guidance that requires reporting
entities to make new disclosures about recurring or nonrecurring
fair-value measurements including significant transfers into and out of Level 1
and Level 2 fair value measurements, and information
on purchases, sales, issuances, and settlements on a gross basis
in the reconciliation of Level 3 fair value measurements. The guidance is
effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December15, 2009,
except for Level 3 reconciliation disclosures, which are effective for
annual periods
beginning after December15, 2010. The Company plans on providing
the additional required disclosures in its future consolidated financial
statements.

In October 2009, the FASB
issued authoritative guidance related to the recognition of revenue for
multiple-deliverable arrangements. Under the authoritative guidance, revenue may
be allocated to the different elements in an arrangement based on
relative selling price using the best estimate of selling price if
vendor-specific or other third-party evidence of value is not available. This
authoritative guidance will be effective prospectively for revenue arrangements
entered into or materially modified in fiscal years beginning on or after
June15, 2010. Early adoption is permitted. The Company is still assessing
the potential impact of adopting the new authoritative guidance.
In
October 2009, the FASB issued authoritative guidance altering the scope of
revenue recognition guidance for software deliverables to exclude items sold
that include hardware with software that is essential to the hardware
functionality. This authoritative guidance will be effective prospectively for
revenue arrangements entered into or materially modified in fiscal years
beginning on or after June15, 2010. Early adoption is permitted. The
Company is still assessing the potential impact of adopting the new
authoritative guidance.
In June 2009, the FASB
issued authoritative guidance to amend the manner in which entities evaluate
whether consolidation is required for variable interest entities VIE. The amended
authoritative guidance determines whether an entity is a VIE and requires
a company to perform an analysis to determine whether the companys variable
interest or interests give it a controlling financial interest in a VIE. The
amended authoritative guidance determines whether a company is required to
consolidate an entity based on, among other things, an entitys purpose and
design and a companys ability to direct the activities of the entity that most
significantly impact the entitys economic performance. The authoritative
guidance will be effective for annual reporting periods beginning after November
15, 2009. The Company is currently evaluating the impact, if any, the adoption
of the amended authoritative guidance will have on its consolidated financial
statements.
In June
2009, the FASB issued authoritative guidance related to the FASB Accounting
Standards Codification Codification, as the single source of authoritative
non-governmental
generally accepted accounting principles GAAP in the United States of
America. All existing accounting standard documents, such as FASB, American
Institute of Certified Public Accountants, Emerging Issues Task Force and other
related literature, excluding guidance from the Securities and Exchange
Commission SEC, have been superseded by the Codification. All other
non-grandfathered, non-SEC accounting literature not included in the
Codification has become non-authoritative. The
Codification did not change GAAP, but instead introduced a new structure that
combines all authoritative standards into a comprehensive, topically organized
online database. The Codification was effective for interim or
annual periods ending after September15, 2009, and the Company
adopted the Codification during the quarter ended September 30, 2009. The
adoption of the Codification did not have an impact on the Companys financial
condition or results of operations, but does impact the Companys financial
reporting process by eliminating all references to pre-codification
standards.
In May
2009, the FASB issued authoritative guidance establishing general standards for
accounting for and disclosures of events that occur after the balance sheet date
but before financial statements are issued or are available to be issued. This
authoritative guidance, among other things, sets forth the period after the
balance sheet date during which management should evaluate events or
transactions that may occur for potential recognition or disclosure in the
financial statements, the circumstances under which an entity should recognize
events or transactions occurring after the balance sheet date in its financial
statements, and the disclosures an entity should make about events or
transactions that occurred after the balance sheet date. The Company adopted the
authoritative guidance during the quarter ended June 30, 2009, and the adoption
did not have any impact on the Companys consolidated financial
position.

Fair
Value Measurements
The
Company measures its cash equivalents and marketable securities at fair value.
Fair value is an exit price, representing the amount that would be received on
the sale of an asset or that would be paid to transfer a liability in an orderly
transaction between market participants. As a basis for considering such
assumptions, a three-tier fair value hierarchy, which prioritizes the inputs
used in the valuation methodologies in measuring fair value:
Fair
Value Hierarchy
The
methodology for measuring fair value specifies a hierarchy of valuation
techniques based upon whether the inputs to those valuation techniques reflect
assumptions other market participants would use based upon market data obtained
from independent sources observable inputs or reflect the Companys own
assumptions of market participant valuation unobservable inputs. As a result,
observable and unobservable inputs have created the following fair value
hierarchy:
Level 1 Quoted prices
in active markets that are unadjusted and accessible at the measurement
date for identical, unrestricted assets or liabilities. The Level 1
category includes money market funds, which at December 31, 2009 and
December 31, 2008 totaled $64 million and $151 million, respectively,
which are included within cash and cash equivalents and marketable
securities in the consolidated balance
sheets.
Level 2 Quoted prices
for identical assets and liabilities in markets that are not active,
quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets or
financial instruments for which significant inputs are observable, either
directly or indirectly. The Level 2 category at December 31, 2009 includes
government securities and corporate debt securities totaling $273
million. The Level 2 category at December 31, 2008 included commercial
paper totaling $08 million, and government securities and corporate debt
securities totaling $193 million, which are included within cash and cash
equivalents and marketable securities in the consolidated balance
sheets.
Level 3 Prices or valuations that
require inputs that are both significant to the fair value measurement and
unobservable. The Level 3 category includes auction rate securities, which
at December 31, 2009 and December 31, 2008 totaled $11 million and $12
million, respectively, which are included within long-term marketable
securities in the consolidated balance
sheets.
Measurement
of Fair Value
The
Company measures fair value as an exit price using the procedures described
below for all assets and liabilities measured at fair value. When available, the
Company uses unadjusted quoted market prices to measure fair value and
classifies such items within Level 1. If quoted market prices are not available,
fair value is based upon financial models that use, when possible, current
market-based or independently-sourced market parameters such as interest rates
andcurrency rates. Items valued using financial generated models are
classified according to the lowest level input or value driver that is
significant to the valuation. Thus, an item may be classified in Level 3 even
though there may be inputs that are readily observable. If quoted market prices
are not available, the valuation model used generally depends on the specific
asset or liability being valued. The determination of fair value considers
various factors including interest rate yield curves and time value underlying
the financial instruments.
59
Table of Contents
As of
each December 31, 2009 and 2008, the Company held certain assets that are
required to be measured at fair value on a recurring basis. Included within the
Companys marketable securities portfolio are investments in auction rate
securities, which are classified as available-for-sale securities and are
reflected at fair value. However, due to events in the U.S. credit markets, the
auction events for these securities held by the Company failed commencing in the
first quarter of 2008, and continued to fail throughout both 2008 and 2009.
Therefore, the fair values of these securities are estimated utilizing a
discounted cash flow analysis and other type of valuation model as of both
December 31, 2009 and December 31, 2008. These analyses consider, among other
items, the collateral underlying the security, the creditworthiness of the
issuer, the timing of the expected future cash flows, including the final
maturity, and an assumption of when the next time the security is expected to
have a successful auction. These securities were also compared, when possible,
to other observable and relevant market data, which is limited at this
time.
As of December 31, 2009, the Company
recorded $40,000 cumulatively as an other-than-temporary impairment and a
cumulative temporary decline in fair value of approximately $282,534 in
accumulated other comprehensive loss. As of December 31, 2008, the losses
related to the Companys auction rate securities recorded in accumulated other
comprehensive loss totaled $333,055. During the first quarter of 2009, the
Company determined that a decline in the fair value of one of its particular
investments was the result of a downgrade in the credit rating of certain
underlying subordinate securities within the auction rate security. As a result,
the Company determined a portion of the overall decline in fair value of the
auction rate security to be other-than-temporary due to the creditworthiness of
the underlying securities, and accordingly recorded $40,000 in
other-than-temporary impairments on this auction rate security. Accordingly, any
future fluctuation in the fair value related to any of the auction rate
securities that the Company deems to be temporary, including any recoveries of
previous write-downs, would be recorded in accumulated other comprehensive loss,
net of tax. In addition, during the fourth quarter of 2009, $100,000 of the
Companys auction rate securities were called by the issuer at par value.
Finally, with the exception of the creditworthiness of one of the auction rate
securities, the Company believes that the remaining temporary declines in fair
value are primarily due to liquidity concerns and not to the creditworthiness of
the remaining underlying assets, because the majority of the underlying securities are almost
entirely backed by the U.S.Government. However, if at any time in
the future a determination that a valuation adjustment is other-than-temporary,
the Company will record a charge to earnings in the period of
determination.

model during the first quarter of 2008. Accordingly, these securities changed
from Level1 to Level3 within the three-tier fair value hierarchy,
which prioritizes the inputs used in the valuation methodologies in measuring
fair value. The following table presents the Companys assets measured at fair

During
the year ended December 31, 2009, the Companys deferred tax asset valuation
allowance decreased by $01 million. The decrease in the valuation allowance was
primarily attributable to the current year utilization of net operating losses
in China for which no tax benefit was previously recognized.
As of
December 31, 2009, the deferred tax asset valuation allowance of $16 million
relates to: i capital loss carryforwards and write-down of investments of $07
million; ii net operating losses related to excess share-based compensation
expense deductions of $01 million; iii foreign tax credits of $02 million;
and iv certain foreign net operating losses of $06 million. If the remaining
valuation allowance were to be reversed, approximately $01 million would be
allocated to additional paid-in-capital as such amounts are attributable to the
tax effects of excess compensation deductions from exercises of employee and
consultant stock options. The reversal of the remainder of the valuation
allowance of approximately $15 million would reduce income tax
expense.
As of
December 31, 2009, the Company had approximately $25 million of various tax
credit carryforwards, of which, approximately $18 million related to research
and development tax credit carryforwards. The research and development tax
credits may be carried forward 20 years for federal tax purposes and are set to
expire at various dates beginning in 2020 through 2029, if not
utilized.

relates to: i capital loss carry forwards of $07 million; ii net operating
losses related to excess share-based compensation expense deductions of $01
million; iii foreign tax credits of $02 million; and iv certain foreign net
operating losses of $08 million. If the remaining valuation allowance were to
be reversed, approximately $01 million would be allocated to additional
paid-in-capital as such amounts are attributable to the tax effects of excess
compensation deductions from exercises of employee and consultant stock options.
The reversal of the remainder of the valuation allowance of approximately $17
million would reduce income tax expense.

During
the first quarter of 2008, the Company issued restricted stock awards to certain
executives and other officers, which vested over three-year terms dependent upon
the Company achieving certain performance targets for the full-year 2008. During
the first and second quarters of 2008, the Company recorded the related
compensation costs associated with the performance awards. During the third
quarter of 2008, the Company determined the performance criteria to be
improbable of achievement and accordingly reversed compensation cost of
approximately $606,000 previously recognized within its consolidated statement
of operations.
During
the third quarter of 2008, certain executives and other officers of the Company
voluntarily forfeited 1,505,046 shares of previously granted stock option awards
the awards. No replacement stock option awards were made, nor did the
Company enter into any agreements for future replacement awards for the
voluntary forfeiture. The voluntarily forfeited awards were fully vested as of
the date of forfeiture, therefore, no adjustment to stock based compensation
expense was recorded.
The
Company estimates the fair value of share-based payments using the Black-Scholes
option-pricing model. The Company believes that this valuation technique and the
approach utilized to develop the underlying assumptions are appropriate in
estimating the fair value of the Companys share-based payments granted during
the years ended December 31, 2009, 2008, and 2007. Estimates of fair value are
not intended to predict actual future events or the value ultimately realized by
the employees who receive equity awards.
The per share weighted average fair
value of share-based payments granted during the years ended December 31, 2009,
2008, and 2007 was $177, $391 and $779, respectively. In addition to
the exercise and grant date prices of the awards, certain weighted average
assumptions that were used to estimate the fair value of share-based payment
grants in the respective periods are listed in the table below:

Options
granted to officers, employees and directors during fiscal 2009, 2008, and 2007
have exercise prices equal to the fair market value of the stock on the date of
grant, a contractual term of ten years, and a vesting period generally of three
years. Based on each respective groups historical vesting experience and
expected trends, the estimated forfeiture rate for officers, employees, and
directors, as adjusted, was 11%, 24% and 9%, respectively.
The
Company estimates expected volatility based primarily on historical daily
volatility of the Companys stock and other factors, if applicable. The
risk-free interest rate is based on the United States treasury yield curve in

ii replace or modify the software to eliminate the infringement while
providing substantially equivalent functionality; or iii if neither i nor
ii can be reasonably achieved, the Company may terminate the license agreement

Derivative
Financial Instruments
The
Company commenced the use of derivative financial instruments during the second
quarter of 2009 and continues to use such derivative financial instruments, such
as foreign currency forward contracts, as economic hedges to reduce exchange
rate risks arising
from the change in fair value of certain foreign currency denominated assets and
liabilities i.e., receivables and payables.The purpose of the
Companys foreign currency risk management program is to reduce
volatility in earnings caused by exchange rate
fluctuations.In accordance with the authoritative guidance
issued by the FASB on derivatives and hedging, companies are required to
recognize all of the derivative financial instruments as either assets or
liabilities at fair value in the consolidated balance
sheets.The Companys derivative instruments do not meet the
criteria for hedge accounting within the authoritative guidance. Therefore, the
foreign currency forward contracts are recorded at fair value, with the gain or
loss on these transactions recorded in the consolidated statements of operations
within interest and other income, net in the period in which they occur. The
Company does not use derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative
purposes.
As of
December 31,
2009, the Company had no foreign currency forward contracts outstanding. During
the year ended December 31, 2009, the Company recorded approximately $08
