Description of the Company and Operating Environment
SPACEHAB, Incorporated the Company is the first Company to
commercially develop, own and operate habitable modules that provide
space-based laboratory research facilities and cargo services aboard
the U.S. Space Shuttle system. The Company currently owns and operates
four pressurized laboratory and logistics supply modules, which
significantly enhance the capabilities of the Space Shuttle fleet. The
Company is currently constructing a module that will attach to the
International Space Station ISS and be primarily used for storage,
power and utility service and laboratory facilities for long-duration
research. The Company modules are unique to the Space Shuttle fleet
and ISS.
To date, the Company has successfully completed seventeen
missions aboard the Space Shuttle and substantially all of the
Company revenue has been generated under contracts with National
Aeronautics and Space Administration NASA. The Company contracts
are subject to periodic funding allocations by NASA. NASA funding is
dependent on receiving annual appropriations from the United States
government. During the years ended June 30, 2002, 2001, and 2000
approximately 81%, 83% and 86% of the Company revenues were generated
under U.S. Government contracts, respectively.
On February 12, 1997, the Company acquired the assets and
certain of the liabilities of Astrotech Space Operations, L.P.

Force Base in California, and are provided to launch service providers
on a fixed-price basis. Additionally, Astrotech provides management and
consulting services to The Boeing Company for its Sea Launch program at
the Sea Launch facility in Long Beach, California.
On July 1, 1998, the Company acquired all of the outstanding
shares of capital stock of Johnson Engineering Corporation JE. JE
performs several critical services for NASA including flight crew
support services, operations, training support and fabrication of
mockups at NASA Neutral Buoyancy Laboratory and at NASA Space
Vehicle Mockup Facility, where astronauts train for both Space Shuttle

as flight crew equipment and crew quarters' habitability outfitting as
well as providing stowage integration services. JE is also responsible
for configuration management of the ISS.
On April 11, 2000, the Company announced the formation of Space
Media, Inc. SMI, a majority-owned subsidiary that intends to create
proprietary space-themed content for education and commerce. During the
year ended June 30, 2001, SMI activities were refocused primarily to
develop content for the STARS AcademyTM, corporate promotion and
advertising opportunities and offering a library of content that can be
redistributed through various media channels. The STARS Academy is a
global education program offering students a scientific, cultural and
social adventure across the earth, into the oceans and aboard the
International Space Station. SMI offers retail products associated with
the STARS Academy. As part of Space Media, the STARS program currently
is planning to launch six experiments designed by students in
Australia, China, Israel, Japan, Liechtenstein and the United States on
Space Shuttle mission STS-107, currently scheduled to launch in
January, 2003. During the year ended June 30, 2000, SMI acquired The
Space Store, an online retail operation. The Space Store currently
offers an assortment of space-related products through its Space Store
website, www.spacestore.com.
In fiscal year 2000, SPACEHAB began design and construction of
a commercial space station habitat module, in partnership with RSC
Energia of Korolev, Russia. Named EnterpriseTM, this multipurpose
module is intended to be attached to the ISS and could provide space
station users habitation
30     space, stowage space, communications, power and other utilities, and
laboratory facilities for long-duration research. In the year ended
June 30, 2001, SPACEHAB and Energia formed the Space Station Enterprise
LLC SSE LLC, a Delaware limited liability corporation, to complete
development of Enterprise. SPACEHAB and Energia have an equal ownership
interest in the SSE LLC. The LLC will be responsible for completing
required financing for Enterprise and marketing and operating the
facility planned as part of the ISS Russian Segment. Enterprise, if
completed, would be launched in 2005 based upon the current ISS
assembly schedule. Currently the ISS can only accommodate a
three-person crew, which must spend most of its time maintaining the
ISS with very little time for science. At an ISS partners' meeting
currently scheduled for late 2002, four ISS configuration options will
be reviewed and one option path endorsed. The future utilization of
Enterprise is expected to be determined within the next 9-12 months.
Enterprise is actively being marketed to NASA and other potential
users. SSE LLC is actively pursuing additional investors to provide
investment funds and participate as owners of SSE LLC in completing
Enterprise.
2   Summary of Significant Accounting Policies
Principles of Consolidation and Basis of Presentation
The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of
SPACEHAB, Incorporated and its wholly owned and majority-owned
subsidiaries Astrotech, JE and SMI. All significant intercompany
transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.
Cash and Cash Equivalents
For purposes of its consolidated statements of cash flows, the
Company considers short-term investments with original maturities of
three months or less to be cash equivalents. Cash equivalents are
primarily made up of money market investments and overnight repurchase
agreements recorded at cost, which approximates market value.
Property and Equipment
Property and equipment are stated at cost. All furniture,
fixtures and equipment are depreciated using the straight-line method
over the estimated useful lives of the respective assets, which is
generally five years. The Company payload processing facilities are
depreciated using the straight-line method over their estimated useful
lives ranging from sixteen to forty-three years.
Effective January 1, 2002, the Company extended the estimated
useful lives of its space flight assets, which is a component of plant,
property and equipment, through June 30, 2016. This change in
accounting estimate is treated prospectively and is based on current
available space related programs and activities which extends the
expected life of the international space station and Space Shuttles
from 2012 through at least 2016.
Goodwill
The excess of the cost over the fair value of net tangible and
identifiable intangible assets acquired in business combinations
accounted for as a purchase has been assigned to goodwill. Goodwill has
been amortized on a straight-line basis over five to twenty-five years.
Beginning July 1, 2002, goodwill will no longer be amortized in
accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards SFAS
No. 142, Accounting for Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets.
The Company periodically evaluates whether changes have occurred
that would require revision of the remaining estimated useful life of
the assigned goodwill or render the goodwill not recoverable. If such
circumstances arise, the Company would use an estimate of the
undiscounted value of expected future operating cash flows to determine
whether the goodwill is recoverable.
31     Investments in Affiliates
The Company uses the equity method of accounting for its
investments in, and earnings of, investees in which it exerts
significant influence. In accordance with the equity method of
accounting, the carrying amount of such an investment is initially
recorded at cost and is increased to reflect the Company share of the
investor income and is reduced to reflect the Company share of the
investor losses. Investments in which the Company has less than 20%
ownership and no significant influence are accounted for under the cost
method and are carried at cost.
Impairment of Long- Lived Assets
The Company accounts for long-lived assets in accordance with
the provisions SFAS No. 121, Accounting for the Impairment of
Long-Lived Assets and for Long-Lived Assets to Be Disposed Of. This
Statement requires that long-lived assets and certain identifiable
intangibles be reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in
circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be
recoverable. Recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured
by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset to future net cash
flows expected to be generated by the asset. If such assets are
considered to be impaired, the impairment to be recognized is measured
by the amount by which the carrying amount of the assets exceeds the
fair value of the assets. Assets to be disposed of are reported at the
lower of the carrying amount or fair value less costs to sell.
Stock-Based Compensation
The Company accounts for stock-based employee compensation
arrangements using the intrinsic value method as prescribed in
Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 25, Accounting for Stock Issued
to Employees APB Opinion 25, and related interpretations.
Accordingly, compensation cost for options to purchase common stock
granted to employees is measured as the excess, if any, of the fair
value of common stock at the date of the grant over the exercise price
an employee must pay to acquire the common stock. The Company has
adopted the disclosure requirements of SFAS No. 123, Accounting for
Stock-based Compensation SFAS 123.
Warrants to purchase common stock granted to other than
employees as consideration for goods or services rendered are
recognized at fair value.
Revenue Recognition
Revenue generated under the REALMS Contract and for all other
contract awards for which the capability to successfully complete the
contract can be reasonably assured and costs at completion can be
reliably estimated at contract inception, is recognized under the
percentage-of-completion method based on costs incurred over the period
of the contract. Revenue provided by JE is primarily derived from
cost-plus award fee contracts, whereby revenue is recognized to the
extent of costs incurred plus estimates of award fee revenues using the
percentage-of-completion method. Award fees, which provide earnings
based on the Company contract performance as determined by NASA
evaluations, are recorded when the amounts can be reasonably estimated,
or are awarded. Changes in estimated costs to complete, provisions for
contract losses and estimated amounts recognized as award fees are
recognized in the period they become known. Revenue provided by
Astrotech payload processing services is recognized ratably over the
occupancy period of the satellite while in the Astrotech facilities.
For the multi-year contracts with Boeing and Lockheed, revenue is
billed and recognized on a quarterly basis for costs incurred.
Research and Development
Research and development costs are expensed as incurred.
32     Income Taxes
The Company recognizes income taxes under the asset and
liability method. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized
for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the
financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities
and their respective tax bases and operating loss and tax credit
carryforward. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using
enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in
which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or
settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change
in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the
enactment date.
Net Income Loss Per Share
Basic earnings loss per share are calculated by dividing net
income loss by the weighted average number of common shares
outstanding during the period. Diluted earnings loss per share
includes all common stock options and warrants and other common stock,
to the extent dilutive, that potentially may be issued as a result of
conversion privileges, including the convertible subordinated notes
payable note 8.
Accounting Estimates
The preparation of consolidated financial statements in
conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires
management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported
amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets
and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements
and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting
periods. Actual results could differ from these estimates.
Derivatives
The Company accounts for derivatives pursuant to SFAS No133,
Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities, as
amended. This standard requires that all derivative instruments be
recognized in the financial statements and measured at fair value
regardless of the purpose or intent for holding them. Changes in the
fair value of derivative instruments are either recognized periodically
in income or shareholders' equity as a component of accumulated other
comprehensive income, depending on their use and designation.
Reclassifications
Certain 2001 and 2000 amounts have been reclassified to conform
with the 2002 consolidated financial statement presentation.
New Accounting Pronouncements
In June 2001, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued
Statement of Financial Accounting Standards SFAS No. 142,
Accounting for Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets. The Statement
eliminates the requirement to amortize costs in excess of net assets
acquired goodwill under the purchase method of accounting, and sets
forth a new methodology for periodically assessing and, if warranted,
recording impairment of goodwill. The Company will be required to
adopt the new rules effective July 1, 2002. The elimination of
amortization of goodwill is expected to increase earnings by
approximately $10 million. The Company will analyze and assess the
impairment provisions of the new Statement, but has not yet determined
the impact, if any, of the adoption of those provisions.
In August 2001, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued
SFAS No. 144, Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived
Assets, which addresses financial accounting and reporting for the
impairment or disposal of long-lived assets and supersedes SFAS No.
121, Accounting for the
33     Impairment of Long-Lived Assets and for Long-Lived Assets to be
Disposed Of, and the accounting and reporting provisions of APB Opinion
No. 30, Reporting the Results of Operations- reporting the effects of
disposal of a segment of a business, and extraordinary, unusual and
infrequently occurring events and transactions. SFAS 144 is effective
for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2001. The Company expects
to adopt SFAS 144 as of July 1, 2002 and it does not expect that the
adoption of this statement will have a significant impact on the
Company financial position and results of operations.
3  Statements of Cash Flows - Supplemental Information
Cash paid for interest costs was approximately $73 million,
$70 million and $69 million for the years ended June 30, 2002, 2001
and 2000, respectively. The Company capitalized interest of
approximately $13 million, $27 million and $37 million during the
years ended June 30, 2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively, related to the
module improvements and a building in progress.
The Company paid no income taxes for the years ended June 30,
2002, 2001 and 2000.
4  Accounts Receivable
At June 30, 2002 and 2001, accounts receivable consisted of in
thousands                                 2002    2001
U.S. government contracts:
Billed               $ 6,371 $ 9,181
Unbilled                1,233   3,085
Total U.S. government contracts    7,604  12,266
Commercial contracts:
Billed                 6,168   4,378
Unbilled                 30    714
Total commercial contracts       6,198   5,092
Total accounts receivable      $ 13,802 $ 17,358
The Company anticipates collecting substantially all receivables
within one year. Unbilled receivables represent estimated future
revenue billings for contract milestones not achieved or amounts
accrued for future cost-based billings.
The accuracy and appropriateness of the Company direct and
indirect costs and expenses under its government contracts, and
therefore its accounts receivable recorded pursuant to such contracts,
are subject to extensive regulation and audit, including by the U.S.
Defense Contract Audit Agency or by other appropriate agencies of the
U.S. government. Such agencies have the right to challenge the
Company cost estimates or allocations with respect to any government
contract. Additionally, a substantial portion of the payments to the
Company under government contracts are provisional payments that are
subject to potential adjustment upon audit by such agencies. In the
opinion of management, any adjustments likely to result from inquiries
or audits of its contracts would not have a material adverse impact on
the Company financial condition or results of operations.
34  5  Acquisition
The Space Store
On June 28, 2000, the Company paid approximately $200,000
including transaction costs, to acquire all of the capital stock of The
Space Store. The business combination has been accounted for using the
purchase method under APB Opinion 16. The purchase price has been
allocated to the assets and liabilities acquired based on estimates of
fair value as of the date of acquisition. Based on the allocation of
the net assets acquired, goodwill of approximately $200,000 was
recorded. Such goodwill is being amortized on a straight-line basis
over 5 years. With the implementation of SFAS 142 goodwill will no
longer be amortized beginning July 1, 2002. Historical results of
operations of The Space Store are insignificant. The Space Store is a
wholly owned subsidiary of SMI. The Space Store is involved in
e-commerce and sells space related items.
6  Loans Payable Under Credit Agreement
Prior to an August 1996 amendment, the Company credit
agreement consisted of a $65 million term loan bearing interest at 1%
per month and a $55 million non-interest-bearing term loan with
several insurance companies. In addition, a revolving credit commitment
with a subcontractor and former shareholder provided a maximum
outstanding balance of $60 million and bore interest at a rate of 1%
per month.
In August 1996, the Company credit agreement was amended. In
exchange for the full satisfaction of the Company term loans with the
various insurance companies, the Company paid the insurance companies
$25 million and agreed to pay an additional $20 million under a new
non-interest-bearing term loan. In conjunction with a payment in
December 1998 of certain principal of notes payable due to Alenia
Spazio S.p.A., note 7, the annual interest rate on the outstanding
balances under the credit agreement was amended to be 825% per year.
Aggregate interest cost incurred on the debts due under the credit
agreement was approximately $5,000, $30,000 and $57,000 for the years
ended June 30, 2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively. As of June 30, 2001,
the remaining balance due under the term loan was $033 million. This
amount was paid in full August 1, 2002.
7  Convertible Notes Payable to Shareholder
The Company issued subordinated notes for a portion of the
amount due to Alenia Spazio S.p.A. Alenia, a shareholder, under a
previously completed construction contract for the Company flight
modules. Alenia may elect to convert, in whole or part, the remaining
principal amount into equity, on terms and conditions to be agreed with
the Company.
On November 15, 2001 the Company entered into an agreement with
Alenia to restructure the terms of this debt to provide for a $30
million payment of principal and interest on December 31, 2001 and
quarterly amortization of the remaining principal beginning March 2002
through December 2003. In addition, the interest rate was reduced from
10% to 8% beginning January 1, 2002. The obligation is collateralized
by one of the Company flight assets. The payments required under the
agreement were made on December 31, 2001, March 31, 2002, and June 30,
2002 and the outstanding balance is $39 million at June 30, 2002. The
Company paid approximately $584,000 interest during 2002 and
approximately $800,000 during each of the years ended June 30, 2001 and
2000.
8  Other Debt
Revolving Loan Payable
35         On June 16, 1997, the Company entered into a $100 million
revolving loan payable line of credit agreement with a financial
institution. Outstanding balances on the line of credit accrue interest
at either the lender prime rate or a LIBOR-based rate. Certain assets
of the Company collateralize this loan. The agreement expired on August
31, 2000.
On August 9, 2000, the Company entered into a $15 million
revolving credit facility with a financial institution that provides a
working capital line of credit with a letter of credit sub-limit of
$100 million. This new credit facility replaced the previous $10
million revolving line of credit. Certain assets of the Company
collateralize the new credit facility. The term of the agreement was
through August 2003.
In conjunction with the Astrotech financing Mortgage Loan
Payable of its satellite processing facility in Titusville, Florida,
in August 2001, the terms of the credit facility were amended. Space
Media, Inc. is no longer a party to the credit facility and the maximum
amount allowable to be drawn under the Credit Facility has been reduced
to $65 million. Effective as of October 24, 2001 the New Credit
Facility was further amended. New covenants were established and the
term of the agreement was revised to July 31, 2002 with a reduction in
the maximum amount allowable to be drawn under the New Credit Facility
to $65 million. Effective December 31, 2001, the New Credit Facility
was further amended. Certain collateral was released by the financial
institution and the maximum amount allowable to be drawn under the New
Credit Facility was to be reduced each month beginning January 1, 2002
through July 1, 2002 and matures on July 31, 2002. The Company also
provided certain flight assets as additional collateral to secure the
obligation. As of June 30, 2002, $215 million was drawn on the New
Credit Facility and the maximum amount allowable to be drawn under the
New Credit Facility was $225 million as of June 30, 2002. Subsequent
to the year end, the loan was paid in full.
Subsequent to the year ended June 30, 2002, the Company entered
into a $50 million line of credit with a new financial institution.
This credit facility replaces the New Credit Facility which was repaid
and expired subsequent to the year ended June 30, 2002. The term of
this new credit facility is through June 2005. Covenants under this
credit facility include, but are not limited to, tangible net worth,
debt to worth and debt service coverage.
Loans Payable
In July 1997, the Company subsidiary, Astrotech, obtained a
five-year loan the Term Loan Agreement, which is guaranteed by
SPACEHAB, and provided for loans of up to $150 million for general
corporate purposes and equipment financing. In conjunction with the
Astrotech financing of its satellite processing facility in Titusville,
Florida in August 2001, approximately $31 million of the Term Loan
Agreement was repaid. As of June 30, 2002, the Company had total loans
payable under the term loan agreement of $218,000.
Mortgage Loan Payable
On August 30, 2001, SPACEHAB Astrotech subsidiary completed a
$200 million financing of its satellite processing facility expansion
project in Titusville, Florida with a financial institution. The
proceeds of this financing were used to complete the construction of
the payload processing facility and supporting infrastructure. The loan
is collateralized primarily by the multi-year payload processing
contracts with The Boeing Company Boeing and Lockheed Martin
Corporation Lockheed Martin. Interest accrues on the outstanding
principal balance at a LIBOR-based rate, adjustable quarterly. The loan
matures on January 15, 2011. The loan was converted from a construction
loan to a term loan on December 31, 2001. Amortization of loan
principal began on January 15, 2002 and continues on a quarterly basis
through the loan maturity date. Interest is payable quarterly on the
outstanding principal balance at the rate of 562% plus 225 basis
points. For the year ended June 30, 2002, $200 million was drawn on
the loan and $883,500 of principal was repaid during the year. On June
30, 2002, $05 million of cash is restricted for payment on the
construction loan.
36         In conjunction with this financing, a swap agreement was
required to be entered into to provide for a fixed rate of interest
under the loan commitment beginning January 2002. The value of the swap
agreement declined by approximately $1 million during the year ended
June 30, 2002 due to declines in the market rate of interest. The
objective of the hedge was to eliminate the variability of cash flows
in the interest payments for the total amount of the variable rate
debt, the sole source of which is due to changes in the USD-LIBOR-BBA
interest rate. Changes in the cash flows of the interest rate swap are
expected to exactly offset the changes in cash flows attributable to
fluctuations in the USD-LIBOR-BBA interest rates on the total variable
rate debt.
Convertible Subordinated Notes
In October 1997, the Company completed a private placement
offering for $6325 million of aggregate principal of unsecured 8%
Convertible Subordinated Notes due October 2007. Interest is payable
semi-annually. The notes are convertible into the common stock of the
Company at a rate of $13625 per share. This offering provided the
Company with net proceeds of approximately $599 million which were
used for capital expenditures associated with the development and
construction of space related assets and for other general corporate
purposes.
Loan Covenants
For the year ended June 30, 2002 the Company was in compliance
with all of the loan covenants of the Term Loan and the New Credit
Facility. Covenants include, but are not limited to, tangible net
worth, debt to worth and debt service coverage.
9  Fair Value of Financial Instruments

receivable, and accounts payable and accrued expenses approximate their
fair market value because of the relatively short duration of these
instruments.
10 NASA Contracts
Research and Logistics Module Services Contract
On December 21, 1997, the Company entered into the REALMS
Contract to provide to NASA its flight modules and related integration
services over three missions at an aggregate fixed price of $449
37     million. This contract provides for NASA to use the flight modules for
both science and logistics missions. During the period from December
21, 1997 to June 30, 2002, this contract was amended whereby the REALMS
contract value was increased to $2245 million and the number of
missions was increased to nine.
During the years ended June 30, 2002, 2001 and 2000, the Company
recognized $430 million, $366 million and $333 million of revenue,
respectively, under this contract.
Subsequent to the year ended June 30, 2002, SPACEHAB negotiated
an equitable adjustment in excess of the REALMS contract value due to
an additional slip in the launch date of the Space Shuttle flight
STS-107 from July 19, 2002 to January 16, 2003.
Flight Crew Systems Development Contract FCSD
JE primarily operates under the FCSD Contract which is currently
a $3913 million multitask cost-plus-award and incentive-fee contract.
The contract commenced in May 1993 and was scheduled to conclude in
September 2002. Subsequent to June 30, 2002, NASA exercised its option
to extend the contract through December 2002. The contract is currently
in the recompete process with a contactor selection expected by NASA in
the fall of 2002. JE performs services under a cost-plus award and
incentive fee contract for government services that is requested and
directed by NASA.
11 Stockholder Rights Plan
On March 26, 1999, the Board of Directors adopted a Stockholder
Rights Plan designed to deter coercive takeover tactics and to prevent
a potential acquirer from gaining control of the Company without
offering a fair price to all of the Company stockholders. A dividend
of one preferred share purchase right a Right was declared on every
share of Common Stock outstanding on April 9, 1999. Each Right under
the Plan entitles the holder to buy one one-thousandth of a share of a
new series of junior participating preferred stock for $35. If any
person or group becomes the beneficial owner of 15% or more of common
stock with certain limited exceptions, then each right not owned by
the 15% stockholder will then entitle its holder to purchase, at the
Right then current exercise price, common shares having a market
value of twice the exercise price. In addition, if after any person has
become a 15% stockholder, and is involved in a merger or other business
combination transaction with another person, each Right will entitle
its holder other than the 15% stockholder to purchase, at the Right
then current exercise price, common shares of the acquiring Company
having a value of twice the Right then current exercise price. The
rights were granted to each shareholder of record on April 9, 1999. At
any time before a person or group acquires a 15% position, the Company
generally will be entitled to redeem the Rights at a redemption price
of $001 per Right. The Rights will expire on April 9, 2009.
12 Common Stock Option and Stock Purchase Plans
As of June 30, 2002, approximately 2,156,602 shares of common
stock were reserved for future grants of stock options under the
Company three stock option plans.
Non-qualified Options
Non-qualified options are granted at the sole discretion of the
Board of Directors. Prior to the adoption of the 1994 Stock Incentive
Plan the 1994 Plan, stock options granted to the Company officers
and employees were part of their employment contract or offer. The
number and price of the options granted was defined in the employment
agreements and such options vest incrementally over a period of four
years and generally expire within ten years of the date of grant.
38     The 1994 Plan
Under the terms of the 1994 Plan, the number and price of the
options granted to employees is determined by the Board of Directors
and such options vest, in most cases, incrementally over a period of
four years and expire no more than ten years after the date of grant.
The Directors' Stock Option Plan
Each new non-employee director receives a one-time grant of an
option to purchase 10,000 shares at an exercise price equal to fair
market value on the date of grant. In addition, effective as of the
date of each annual meeting of the Company stockholders, each
non-employee director who is elected or continues as a member of the
Board of Directors of the Company shall be awarded an option to
purchase 5,000 shares of common stock. Options under the Director
Plan vest after one year and expire seven years from the date of grant.
1997 Employee Stock Purchase Plan
The Company adopted an employee stock purchase plan that permits
eligible employees to purchase shares of common stock of the Company at
prices no less than 85% of the current market price. Eligible employees
may elect to participate in the plan by authorizing payroll deductions
from 1% to 10% of gross compensation for each payroll period. On the
last day of each quarter, each participant contribution account is
used to purchase the maximum number of whole and fractional shares of
common stock determined by dividing the contribution account balance
by the lesser of 85% of the price of a share of common stock on the
first day of the quarter or the last day of a quarter. The number of
shares of common stock that may be purchased under the plan is
1,500,000. Through June 30, 2002, employees have purchased
approximately 774,000 shares under the plan.
Space Media, Inc. Stock Option Plan
During the year ended June 30, 2000, Space Media, Inc., a
majority owned subsidiary of the Company, adopted an option plan SMI
Plan for employees, officers, directors and consultants of Space
Media, Inc. Under the terms of the SMI Plan, 1,500,000 shares have been
reserved for future grants for which the number and price of the
options granted is determined by the Board of Directors and such
options vest, in most cases, incrementally over a period of four years
and expire no more than ten years after the date of grant. At June 30,
2002, there were 394,750 options issued and outstanding under the SMI

-                     40         The Company applies APB Opinion 25 and related interpretations
in accounting for its plans. Accordingly, as all options have been
granted at exercise prices equal to the fair market value as of the
date of grant, no compensation cost has been recognized under these
plans in the accompanying consolidated financial statements. Had
compensation cost been determined consistent with SFAS 123, the
Company net income loss and earnings loss per common share would
have been reduced increased to the pro forma amounts indicated below

The fair value of each option granted and each employee stock
purchase right is estimated using the Black-Scholes option-pricing
model with the following weighted average assumptions used for grants
in fiscal years 2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively: 00% dividend rate;
expected volatility ranging from 35% to 50%; risk-free interest rates
ranging from 3875% to 7875%; and expected lives ranging from three
months to seven years.
The effects of compensation cost as determined under SFAS 123 on
pro forma net income loss in years ended June 30, 2002, 2001 and 2000
may not be representative of the effects on pro forma net income loss
in future periods.
Warrants
The Company also has 53,000 currently exercisable warrants
outstanding to purchase the Company common stock at $900 per share,
with an expiration date of July 1, 2002. The fair market value of these
warrants was recognized at issuance. All such warrants were issued at
exercise prices equivalent to, or in excess of, the determined fair
market value of the Company common stock at the date of issuance. No
warrants were exercised as of June 30, 2002.
13   Income Taxes
The Company accounts for taxes under Statement of Financial
Accounting Standards No. 109, Accounting for Income Taxes SFAS 109.
Under SFAS 109, deferred tax liabilities and assets are determined
based on the difference between the financial statement and tax basis
of assets and liabilities using enacted rates expected to be in effect
during the year in which the differences reverse.

42      At June 30, 2002, the Company had accumulated net operating losses of
approximately $407 million for Federal income tax purposes, which are
available to offset future regular taxable income. These operating loss
carryforwards expire between the years 2007 and 2022. Utilization of these
net operating losses may be subject to limitations in the event of
significant changes in stock ownership of the Company.
Additionally, the Company has approximately $22 million and $05
million of research and experimentation and alternative minimum tax credit
carryforwards, respectively, available to offset future regular tax
liabilities. The research and experimentation credits expire between the
years 2002 and 2008; the alternative minimum tax credits carry-forward
indefinitely.
In assessing the realizability of its net deferred tax assets,
management considers whether it is more likely than not that some portion
or all of the net deferred tax assets are realizable. Management considers
the scheduled reversal of deferred tax liabilities, projected future
taxable income, and tax planning strategies in making this assessment. As
of June 30, 2002, the Company provided a full valuation allowance of
approximately $32 million against its net deferred tax assets.
The Company has received approximately $21 million in refund claims
related to net operating loss carryforwards for alternative minimum taxes
paid in prior years.

All options and warrants to purchase shares of common stock were
excluded from the computations of diluted earnings loss per share for the
years ended June 30, 2002, 2001 and 2000, because the impact of such
options and warrants is anti-dilutive.
15 Employee Benefit Plan
The Company has a defined contribution retirement plan, which covers
all employees and officers. For the years ended June 30, 2002, 2001 and
2000, the Company contributed $14 million, $18 million and
43    $15 million, respectively, to the plan. The Company has the right, but
not the obligation, to make contributions to the plan in future years at

1998, this letter agreement became a cost plus incentive fee contract
whereby Boeing will provide integration and operations services required
to successfully complete four research missions one single module mission
and three double module missions and seven logistics double module
missions. Additionally, there are several tasks that are separately priced

17 Segment information
Based on its organization, the Company operates in four business
segments: SPACEHAB, now designated Flight Services for Company management
reporting, JE, Astrotech and SMI. SPACEHAB was founded to commercially
develop space habitat modules to operate in the cargo bay of the Space
Shuttles. Flight Services provides access to the modules and integration
and operations support services for both NASA and commercial customers. JE
is primarily engaged in providing engineering services and products to the
Federal Government and NASA, primarily under the FCSD Contract. Astrotech

space launch companies and satellite manufacturers. SMI was established in
April 2000, to develop space themed commercial business activities.
The Company chief operating decision maker utilizes both revenue
and income before taxes, including allocated interest based on the
investment in the segment, in assessing performance and making overall
operating decisions and resource allocations. As such, other
income/expense items including taxes and corporate overhead have not been
allocated from Flight Services to the various segments.
The accounting policies of the segments are the same as those
described in the summary of significant accounting policies, see note 2.

SpaceDRUMS facility with an unrelated party.
The joint venture agreement contained an option whereby the Company
could exchange its interest in the joint venture and the $20 million note
for a common equity interest in Guigne Inc. GI, the ultimate parent of
GTL. In accordance with the terms of the joint venture agreement, in
December 1999 the Company notified GI of its intention to exercise its
option. Under the option, the equity interest obtained in GI was
determined by dividing the $20 million contributed by the Company by the
fair market value of GI, as determined by independent appraisal, at the
date of exchange. However, such equity interest could not exceed 19% of
the outstanding equity of GI. The independent appraisal and conversion
were finalized subsequent to June 30, 2000, with an effective date of
January 1, 2000, and resulted in the Company obtaining a 15% common equity
interest in GI. The Company accounts for its investment in GI on the cost
method. Upon the exchange, the joint venture was dissolved and all
property, rights, assets and liabilities of the joint venture became the
property, rights, assets and liabilities of GI.
The Company did not have the ability to exclusively control the
operational and financial policies of the joint venture, although the
Company did exert significant influence and as such recognized its
investment in the joint venture prior to the exchange using the modified
equity method of accounting. During the year ended December 31, 1999, no
revenues and no expenses were recognized by the joint venture. During the
quarter ended December 31, 1999, at the time of the Company exercise of
its option, the Company recognized a $02 million valuation allowance
against its investment in GI based on the Company estimate of the fair
value of GI.
