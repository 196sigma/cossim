FIRM
To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of ArQule,Inc. We have completed
integrated audits of ArQule Inc.s 2005 and 2004 consolidated financial
statements and of its internal control over financial reporting as of December31,
2005, and an audit of its 2003 consolidated financial statements in accordance
with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board United
States. Our opinions, based on our
audits, are presented below.
Consolidated financial statements
In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements listed in
the accompanying index present
fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of ArQule,Inc.
and its subsidiaries at December31, 2005 and 2004, and the results of
their operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period
ended December31, 2005 in conformity with accounting principles generally
accepted in the United States of America. These financial statements are the
responsibility of the Companys management. Our responsibility is to express an
opinion on these financial statements based on our audits. We conducted our
audits of these statements in accordance with the standards of the Public
Company Accounting Oversight Board United States. Those standards require
that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether
the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit of
financial statements includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting
the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the
accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, and
evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our
audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
Internal control
over financial reporting
Also, in our opinion, managements assessment,
included in Managements Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting
appearing under Item 9A, that the
Company maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of December31,
2005 based on criteria established in Internal
ControlIntegrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring
Organizations of the Treadway Commission COSO, is fairly stated, in all material
respects, based on those criteria. Furthermore, in our opinion, the Company
maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial
reporting as of December31, 2005, based on criteria established in Internal ControlIntegrated Framework issued by the COSO. The
Companys management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control
over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of
internal control over financial reporting. Our responsibility is to express
opinions on managements assessment andon the effectiveness of the
Companys internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We
conducted our audit of internal control over financial reporting in accordance
with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board United
States. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial
reporting was maintained in all material respects. An audit of internal control
over financial reporting includes obtaining an understanding of internal
control over financial reporting, evaluating managements assessment, testing
and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control, and
performing such other procedures as we consider necessary in the circumstances.
We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinions.
A companys internal control over financial reporting
is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability
of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external
purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A companys
internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and
procedures that ipertain to the maintenance of records that, in
reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and
dispositions of the  45 assets of the company; iiprovide
reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit
preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted
accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are
being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors
of the company; and iiiprovide reasonable assurance regarding
prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition
of the companys assets that could have a material effect on the financial
statements.
Because of its inherent
limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or
detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to
future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate
because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the
policies or procedures may deteriorate.

1. ORGANIZATION
AND NATURE OF OPERATIONS
We are a biotechnology company engaged in the research
and development of small molecules cancer therapies. We apply our proprietary
technology platforms to develop small molecule compounds that we believe will selectively
kill cancer cells while sparing normal cells. Our oncology portfolio consists
of our lead clinical candidate, ARQ 501, based on our proprietary ACT platform, ARQ 197 based on our
c-MET program, and several preclinical oncology programs.
We also provide chemistry
services to collaborators and customers for their discovery programs, which has
been part of our business since inception. In September2005, we announced
a strategic decision to exit our chemistry services business in order to focus
operationally on developing our oncology portfolio. On December2, 2005,
we received notice that Pfizer Inc, pursuant to the terms of the Collaborative
Agreement Agreement with ArQule, was terminating the Agreement effective on
May22, 2006. ArQule will continue to provide chemistry services to Pfizer
through the effective date of termination.
2. SUMMARY OF
SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
Significant accounting
policies followed in the preparation of these financial statements are as
follows Basis of Consolidation
The consolidated financial
statements include the accounts of ArQule,Inc. and its wholly-owned
subsidiaries Camitro Corporation and Camitro U.K. Ltd. subsequently renamed
ArQule U.K. Ltd., which were acquired on January29, 2001 collectively, we,
us, our and the Company. All intercompany transactions and balances have
been eliminated. In September2002, Camitro Corporation was merged into,
and made part of, ArQule,Inc. In February2005, ArQule U.K. Ltd. was
formally dissolved. We acquired Cyclis Pharmaceuticals,Inc. Cyclis on
September8, 2003, at which time Cyclis was merged into ArQule and ceased
to be a separate entity. The results of Cyclis operations and the estimated
fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed are included in the
financial statements from the date of acquisition.
Use of Estimates
The preparation of
financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting
principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect
the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent
assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported
amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results
could differ from these estimates.
Cash Equivalents
and Marketable Securities
We consider all highly
liquid investments purchased within three months of original maturity date to
be cash equivalents. We invest our available cash primarily in money market
mutual funds, U.S. federal and state agency backed certificates, including
auction rate certificates, corporate bonds and other investment grade debt
securities that have strong credit ratings. As a matter of policy, we determine
on a quarterly basis the fair market value of our investment portfolio. Our
securities are recorded on our balance sheet at fair market value. Unrealized
gains and losses on securities are included in stockholders  51  ARQULE, INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Continued IN THOUSANDS, EXCEPT SHARE AND PER SHARE DATA equity,
net of related tax effects. If the fair market value of a marketable security
declines below its cost basis, and, based upon our consideration of all
available evidence, we conclude such decline is other than temporary, we mark
the investment to market through a charge to current earnings. At December31,
2004 and 2005, we have classified these investments as available-for-sale.
Fair Value of
Financial Instruments
At December31, 2004
and 2005, our financial instruments consist of cash, cash equivalents,
marketable securities, accounts receivable, accounts payable, accrued expenses
and debt. The carrying amounts of these instruments approximate their fair
values.
Investments in
Non-Marketable Equity Securities
Investments in
non-marketable equity securities are accounted for under the cost method if
ArQule owns less than 20 percent of the outstanding stock of the investee and
our management determines we do not exert significant influence over the
management of the investee. We assess the fair value of investments in
non-marketable equity securities quarterly, or whenever events or changes in circumstances
indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable. In the event fair value is
determined to be less than the carrying value of an investment, the carrying
value is written down to fair value if the decline in value is significant and
is deemed to be other than temporary. Since there is no readily available
market information concerning the fair value of these investments, such
assessments require significant management judgment in analyzing the investees
financial position and projected future financial results and cash flows.
Although the estimates used to reflect our best estimates of fair value based
upon available information, the use of different estimates could yield
different conclusions concerning the recoverability of the carrying value of
investments.
Foreign Currency
Our former foreign
subsidiary, ArQule U.K. Ltd., designated the Great Britain Pound Sterling as
its functional currency. Financial statements of this foreign subsidiary were
translated to U.S. dollars for consolidation purposes using current rates of
exchange for monetary assets and liabilities and historical rates of exchange
for non-monetary assets and related elements of expense. Revenue and other
expense elements were translated at rates that approximate the rates in effect
on the transaction dates. Related cumulative translation adjustments were
included as a component of equity in the consolidated balance sheet. As of December31,
2004, all activity in ArQule U.K. Ltd. had ceased and all assets and
liabilities have been transferred to the parent company. ArQule U.K. Ltd. was
dissolved effective February1, 2005.
Property and
Equipment
Property and equipment are
recorded at cost and depreciated using the straight-line method over their
estimated useful lives. Assets under capital leases and leasehold improvements
are amortized over the shorter of their estimated useful lives or the term of
the respective leases by use of the straight-line method. Maintenance and
repair costs are expensed as incurred. 52  ARQULE, INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Continued IN THOUSANDS, EXCEPT SHARE AND PER SHARE DATA Revenue
RecognitionCompound Development Revenue
Historically, ArQule has
entered into various chemistry-based collaborative agreements with
pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies under which ArQule produces and
delivers compound arrays and other research and development services. Revenue
from collaborative agreements includes non-refundable technology transfer fees,
funding of compound development work, payments based upon delivery of
specialized compounds meeting the collaborators specified criteria, and certain
milestones and royalties on product sales. Non-refundable technology transfer
fees are recognized as revenue when we have the contractual right to receive
such payment, provided a contractual arrangement exists, the contract price is
fixed or determinable, the collection of the resulting receivable is reasonably
assured and we have no further performance obligations under the license
agreement. When we have performance obligations under the terms of a contract,
non-refundable fees are recognized as revenue as we complete our obligations.
Where our level of effort is relatively constant over the performance period,
the revenue is recognized on a straight-line basis. Funding of compound
development work is recognized over the term of the applicable contract using
the proportional achievement of deliveries against a compound delivery schedule
or the development labor expended against a total research and development
labor plan as the measure of progress toward completion. Any significant
changes in the assumptions underlying our estimates to complete a contract
e.g., changes in the number of person hours to develop compounds, or changes
in throughput capacity of our machinery and equipment could impact our revenue
recognition. Payments based upon delivery of specialized compounds meeting the
collaborators specified criteria are recognized as revenue upon delivery of
these compounds and collection is reasonably assured. Revenues from milestone
payments related to chemistry-based collaboration arrangements under which we have
no continuing performance obligations are recognized upon achievement of the
related milestone. Revenues from milestone payments related to arrangements
under which the Company has continuing performance obligations are recognized
as revenue upon achievement of the milestone only if all of the following
conditions are met: the milestone payments are non-refundable; achievement of
the milestone was not reasonably assured at the inception of the arrangement;
substantive effort is involved in achieving the milestone; and the amount of
the milestone is reasonable in relation to the effort expended or the risk
associated with achievement of the milestone. If any of these conditions are
not met, the milestone payments are deferred and recognized as revenue over the
term of the arrangement as we complete our performance obligations. Payments
received under these arrangements prior to the completion of the related work
are recorded as deferred revenue.
In May2003, the
Financial Accounting Standards Board reached a consensus on Emerging Issues
Task Force No00-21, Accounting
for Revenue Arrangements with Multiple Deliverables EITF 00-21.
EITF 00-21 addresses how to determine whether an arrangement involving
multiple deliverables contains more than one unit of accounting. In applying
the guidance, revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables can only be
considered as separate units of accounting if: a the delivered item has value
to the customer on a standalone basis, b there is objective and reliable evidence
of the fair value of the undelivered items and c if the right of return
exists, delivery of the undelivered items is considered probable and
substantially in the control of the vendor. If these criteria are not met, the
revenue elements must be considered a single unit of accounting for purposes of
revenue recognition. EITF 00-21 became effective for new revenue
arrangements entered into in fiscal periods beginning after June15, 2003.
In February2004, the
Company entered into an amended contract with Pfizer. The amendment modified
the quantity and composition of compounds to be produced and delivered by
ArQule, with a  53  ARQULE, INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Continued IN THOUSANDS, EXCEPT SHARE AND PER SHARE DATA corresponding
adjustment to the remaining contractual billings for undelivered elements under
the contract. We concluded that the modification was substantial enough to
require evaluation of the contract to determine if EITF 00-21 applied. We
concluded that because the contract does contain multiple deliverables license
to technology, research services and compound deliveries EITF 00-21 did
apply. We determined that there was not sufficient evidence of fair value of
the undelivered elements compounds, and therefore the amended contract
represented a single unit of accounting for revenue recognition purposes. As a
result, in Q1 2004 ArQule began treating the amended Pfizer Agreement as a
single unit of accounting and recognizing revenue based on the actual delivery
of compounds against the estimated total compound deliveries over the remaining
term of the contract. The total
estimated number of compounds that ArQule delivers to Pfizer is based on
managements best estimate; changes in estimates of compounds to be delivered
to Pfizer may result in adjustments to the amount of revenue we recognize per
compound delivered.
Pfizer notified us in December2005
that, in accordance with the provisions of the Agreement, it was terminating
their collaboration with us effective May22, 2006. In accordance with the terms of the Agreement
we received $19,750 in December2005 in connection with the termination. We
are required to perform under the terms of the contract during the period from
Pfizers termination notification to us through the effective termination date
of the contract, and we will recognize revenue based on the total number of
compounds delivered to Pfizer during that time.

Before 2004, ArQule
recognized revenue from Pfizer based on the individual contractual elements of
the collaborative Agreement. As noted above, in 2004 as a result of the amended
Pfizer Agreement and the adoption of EITF 00-21, the Company began to
account for Pfizer revenue as a single unit of accounting. In 2004 and 2005,
Pfizer revenue in the above table is fully included in Payments based on
delivery of specialized compounds.
Revenue RecognitionResearch and Development Revenue
On April2, 2004,
ArQule announced an alliance with Hoffmann-La Roche Roche to discover and
develop drug candidates targeting the E2F biological pathway. The alliance
includes a compound which is currently in phase 1 clinical development. Under
the terms of the agreement, Roche obtained an option to license ArQules E2F
program in the field of cancer therapy. Roche provided immediate research
funding of $15,000, and financial support for ongoing research and development.
ArQule is responsible for advancing drug candidates from early stage
development and commercialization of products resulting from this collaboration
by paying an option fee. Assuming the successful development and
commercialization of a compound under the program, ArQule could receive up to
$276,000 in pre-determined payments, plus royalties based on net sales. Additionally,
ArQule has the option to co-promote products in the U.S. 54  ARQULE, INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Continued IN THOUSANDS, EXCEPT SHARE AND PER SHARE DATA ArQule considers the
development portion of the arrangement to be a single unit of accounting under
EITF 00-21 for purposes of revenue recognition, and will recognize the
initial and ongoing development payments as research and development revenue
over the maximum estimated development period. We estimate the maximum
development period could extend until December2009, although this period
may ultimately be shorter depending upon the outcome of the development work,
which would result in accelerated recognition of the development revenue. Milestone
and royalty payments will be recognizes as revenue when earned. The cost
associated with satisfying the Roche contract is included in research and
development expense in the Consolidated Statement of Operations as incurred.
Cost of Compound Development Revenue
Cost of compound
development revenue represents the actual costs incurred in connection with
performance pursuant to our chemistry-based collaborative agreements and the
costs incurred to develop and produce compounds under these agreements. These
costs consist primarily of payroll and payroll-related costs, chemicals,
supplies and overhead expenses.
Research and Development Costs
Costs of internal research
and development, which are expensed as incurred, are comprised of the following
types of costs incurred in performing research and development activities and
those incurred in conjunction with research and development revenue: salaries
and benefits, allocated overhead and occupancy costs, clinical trial and
related clinical manufacturing costs, contract services, and other outside
costs. Development costs incurred in connection with chemistry services
collaborations are included in cost of compound development revenue. We
incurred research and development expenses of $49,291, $20,287, and $24,751 in
2003, 2004 and 2005, respectively, including amounts assigned to acquired
in-process technology of $30,359 in 2003. The value assigned to acquired
in-process technology, which was charged to operations upon acquisition, was
determined by identifying and valuing those acquired in-process research
projects for which atechnological feasibility had not been established
at the acquisition date, bthere was no alternative future use, and cthe
fair value was estimable with reasonable reliability. See Note 4 for additional
information.
Restructuring Charges/Credits
The Company accounts for
restructuring charges/credits in accordance with Statement of Financial
Accounting Standards No146, Accounting
for Costs Associated with Exit or Disposal Activities. Accruals are
established for one-time employee termination benefits in the same period that
the appropriate level of management and the Board of Directors approve and
commit the Company to a termination that meets the following criteria and has
been communicated to employees: a
specifically identifies the number, location and job level of employees to be
terminated, b specifies the benefits terminated employees are to receive, c
assures that employees will be terminated within one year. Accruals are
established for property and equipment and facility-related costs for
facilities that have been abandoned and which have no future economic benefit
to the Company at the time the Company ceases to occupy the facility.
Accruals for property and
equipment and facility related costs of abandoned facilities require
significant management judgment and the use of estimates, including assumptions
concerning our ability to sublease certain operating leases for abandoned real
estate and the ability of a sublessee to fulfill its contractual sublease
obligation. Estimates of the time required to sublease facilities and sublease
rates the  55  ARQULE, INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Continued IN THOUSANDS, EXCEPT SHARE AND PER SHARE DATA Company will
receive are based on managements analysis of the local real estate markets and
general economic conditions in the regions of the abandoned facilities. If either the time it takes to sublease these
facilities or the actual sublease rates achieved differ from the Companys
assumptions, we may be required to adjust our restructuring accrual and record
a restructuring charge or credit. When abandoned facilities are subleased, the
Company must estimate the ability of the sublessee to satisfy the contractual
lease obligation based on its financial position and projected ability to
generate future working capital. If the sublessees actual performance on the
sublease is different from the Company estimates, we may be required to adjust
our restructuring accrual and record a restructuring charge or credit.
Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets
We assess our long-lived
assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances a triggering
event indicate that the carrying value of a group of long-lived assets may
not be recoverable in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting
Standards No144, Accounting for the
Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets SFAS 144.
On September27,
2005, we announced our intention to exit our chemistry services business when
the Agreement with Pfizer ended in 2008. We concluded that our intention to
exit our chemistry services business was a triggering event and that an
impairment review was required. As a result of that review, we determined that
the anticipated undiscounted future cash flows from our chemistry services
business exceeded the net carrying value of the group of long-lived assets
attributed to that business, and therefore there was no impairment in the
quarter ended September30, 2005.
On December2, 2005,
we received notice that Pfizer had elected to terminate the Agreement, pursuant
to the Agreement terms, effective May22, 2006. We concluded that
notification from Pfizer was also a triggering event and performed a second
impairment review. As a result of this second review, we again determined that
the anticipated undiscounted future cash flows from our chemistry services
business exceeded the net carrying value of the group of long-lived assets
attributed to that business, and therefore there was no impairment in the
quarter ended December31, 2005.
We are contractually
required to perform under the terms of the Agreement until May22, 2006
and, as such, the assets of the chemistry services business are considered held
for use at December31, 2005. Although we are actively seeking a
potential buyer for the chemistry services business, the uncertainty of us
successfully completing a sale transaction within one year, or deciding to
abandon the assets, precludes us from classifying the assets of the chemistry
services business as assets to be disposed of by sale at December31,
2005. If it becomes probable that we will sell the chemistry services business,
eliminate the associated cash flows, and have no continuing involvement, or we
abandon the chemistry services assets and eliminate the associated cash flows
with no intention of continuing involvement, we will at that time classify the
chemistry services business as assets to be disposed of by sale on our
balance sheet, and would report the chemistry services business as discontinued
operations in our statements of operations in accordance with SFAS 144.
Based on our decision to
exit our chemistry services business, we adjusted the depreciation lives on
fixed assets used exclusively in that business in order to fully depreciate the
remaining book value of those assets over the remaining period that we will
provide services to Pfizer. 56 ARQULE, INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Continued IN THOUSANDS, EXCEPT SHARE AND PER SHARE DATA
Interest Rate Swap
Agreement
We utilized interest rate
swap agreements that expired on June30, 2003 and June30, 2004 in
order to reduce the impact of changes in interest rates on our term loans. Any
differences paid or received on interest rate swap agreements were recognized
as adjustments to interest expense over the life of each swap, thereby
adjusting the effective interest rate of the underlying obligations. There were
no swap agreements outstanding at December31, 2005.
Segment Data
Management uses consolidated
financial information in determining how to allocate resources and assess
performance. For this reason, we have determined that we are principally
engaged in one operating segment. See Note 16 with respect to significant
customers. Substantially all of our revenue since inception has been generated
in the United States and substantially all of our long-lived assets are located
in the United States.
Income Taxes
Income taxes have been
accounted for using the asset and liability method. Under the asset and
liability method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the
future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial
carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax
bases and operating loss and tax credit carryforwards. Deferred tax assets and
liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable
income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be
recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a
change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the
enactment date. A valuation allowance against deferred tax assets is recorded
if, based upon the weight of all available evidence, it is more likely than not
that some or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized.
Earnings Loss Per Share
The computations of basic
and diluted earnings loss per common share are based upon the weighted
average number of common shares outstanding and potentially dilutive
securities. Potentially dilutive securities include stock options. Options to
purchase of 3,895,918, 4,228,511, and 4,084,265 shares of common stock were not
included in the 2003, 2004 and 2005 computations of diluted net loss per share,
respectively, because inclusion of such shares would have an anti-dilutive
effect.
Stock-Based Compensation
Statement
of Financial Accounting Standards No123, Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation SFAS123
as amended by Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No148, Accounting for Stock-Based CompensationTransition
and Disclosure requires that companies either recognize
compensation expense for grants of stock options and other equity instruments
based on fair value, or provide pro forma disclosure of net income loss and
net income loss per share in the notes to the financial statements. At December31,
2005, we had three stock-based compensation plans, which are described more
fully in Note13. We account for those plans under the recognition and
measurement principles of Accounting Principles Board Opinion No25,
Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees, and related interpretations.
Accordingly, no compensation cost has been recognized under SFAS123 for
our employee stock option  57  ARQULE, INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Continued IN THOUSANDS, EXCEPT SHARE AND PER SHARE DATA plans. Had compensation cost for the awards under
those plans been determined based on the grant date fair values, consistent
with the method required under SFAS123, the Companys net loss and net
loss per share would have been reduced to the pro forma amounts indicated
below

For the purposes of pro
forma disclosure, the estimated value of each employee and non-employee option
grant was calculated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes
option-pricing model. In addition, option-pricing models require the use of
highly subjective assumptions, including the expected stock price volatility.
The model was calculated using the following weighted-average assumptions: no
dividend yield for all years; volatility of 95% for 2003 and 2004, and 80% for
2005; risk-free interest rates of 20% in 2003, 370% in 2004, and 439% in
2005; expected lives of 6 to 18 months for options granted under the Employee
Stock Purchase Program; and expected lives of 5 years in 2003 and 2004, and 45
years in 2005 for all other options granted.
Comprehensive Income Loss
Other comprehensive income
loss refers to revenues, expenses, gains and losses that under accounting
principles generally accepted in the United States of America are included in
comprehensive income loss but are excluded from net income loss as these
amounts are recorded directly as an adjustment to stockholders equity, net of
tax. Our other comprehensive income losses were $62, $249, and $462 in
2003, 2004 and 2005 respectively, and is composed of unrealized gains and
losses on marketable securities and interest rate swaps and foreign currency
translation adjustments.
Reclassifications
Amortization of
premium/discount on marketable securities in the Consolidated Statements of
Cash Flow for the years ended December31, 2004 and 2003 have been
reclassified to conform with the 2005 presentation.
Recent Accounting Pronouncements
In December2004, the FASB issued Statement of
Financial Accounting Standards No123R, Accounting
for Stock-Based Compensation SFAS No123R. SFAS No123R
establishes standards for the accounting for transactions in which an entity
exchanges its equity instruments for goods or services.  58  ARQULE, INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Continued IN THOUSANDS, EXCEPT SHARE AND PER SHARE DATA This Statement focuses
primarily on accounting for transactions in which an entity obtains employee
services in share-based payment transactions. SFAS No123R requires that
the fair value of such equity instruments be recognized as an expense in the
historical financial statements as services are performed. Prior to SFAS No123R,
only certain pro forma disclosures of fair value were required. The provisions
of this Statement are effective for ArQule in the first interim period
beginning after December15, 2005. Accordingly, we will adopt SFAS No123R
commencing with the quarter ending March31, 2006. If we had included the
fair value of employee stock options in our financial statements for the years
ended December31, 2003, 2004 and 2005, our net loss would have been as
disclosed under Stock-Based Compensation above. We anticipate using the
modified prospective method upon adoption, and expect the adoption of SFAS No123R
to have a material effect on our financial statements.
On June7, 2005, the
FASB issued Statement No154, Accounting
Changes and Error Corrections, a replacement of APB Opinion No20,
Accounting Changes, and Statement No3, Reporting Accounting Changes in
Interim Financial Statement SFAS 154. SFAS
154 changes the requirements for the accounting for and reporting of a change
in accounting principle. Previously, most voluntary changes in accounting
principles were required recognition via a cumulative effect adjustment within
net income of the period of the change. SFAS 154 requires retrospective
application to prior periods financial statements, unless it is impracticable
to determine either the period-specific effects or the cumulative effect of the
change. SFAS 154 is effective for accounting changes made in fiscal years
beginning after December15, 2005; however, SFAS 154 does not change the
transition provisions of any existing accounting pronouncements. We do not
believe adoption of SFAS 154 will have a material effect on our financial
position, results of operations or cash flows.
3. RELATED PARTIES
We have entered into a
number of license, research and development agreements the Agreements with
corporate collaborators. Two separate agreements were entered into with Solvay
Duphar B.V. Solvay, and Novartis Institute for BioMedical Research,Inc.,
an affiliate of Novartis AG Novartis. Revenue related to these agreements
is included in compound development revenue-related parties during the period
that certain members of our Board of Directors were employed at those
companies. One current member of our Board of Directors is currently employed
by Solvay, and one current member of our Board of Directors was employed by
Novartis until August2004. There are no amounts due to or from related
parties as of December31, 2005 and 2004, or revenue from related parties
in 2005.
4. ACQUISITIONS
CYCLIS
PHARMACEUTICALS, INC.
On September8, 2003, ArQule acquired all of the
outstanding securities of Cyclis, a privately held, development stage
cancer-therapeutics company based in Norwood, Massachusetts, in a transaction
accounted for as a purchase business combination. At that time, Cyclis was
merged with and into ArQule and Cyclis ceased to exist as a separate entity. Pursuant
to the terms of the acquisition agreement, ArQule issued approximately 46
million shares of common stock, paid cash of $5,000 and forgave notes receivable
of $500. ArQule incurred consulting, legal, accounting and other third-party
costs of approximately $1,631 in order to close the transaction. The shares
issued were valued at $18,808 based on the Companys share price on the
measurement date of acquisition, resulting in a total purchase price of
$25,939. The results of  59  ARQULE, INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Continued IN THOUSANDS, EXCEPT SHARE AND PER SHARE DATA the acquired Cyclis
operations and the estimated fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities
assumed are included in the financial statements from the date of acquisition.
The purchase price was allocated to the identifiable
tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on the
Companys estimates of fair value at the acquisition date. The purchase price
exceeded the amounts allocated to the identifiable tangible and intangible
assets acquired and liabilities assumed by approximately $17,057. Since Cyclis
was a development stage enterprise it is not considered a business under
Emerging Issues Task Force No98-3, and therefore the excess
purchase price cannot be allocated to goodwill. Consequently, the excess
purchase price was allocated on a pro rata basis to the carrying value of the
acquired long-lived assets, resulting in a step-up in basis of property and
equipment and in-process research and development IPRD of $699 and
$16,359, respectively.
The

Upon consummation of the
Cyclis acquisition, we immediately charged to income $30,359 representing
purchased IPRD that had not yet reached technical feasibility and had no
alternative future use. Approximately $14,000 of the charge represents the fair
value of the IPRD; the remaining $16,359 of the charge represents the
aforementioned step-up adjustment. The value assigned IPRD before the
step-up adjustment was composed of the projected value of three Cyclis
preclinical drug development projects based on various mechanisms of actions
associated with the ACT technology. The valuation was determined using the
income approach. Potential revenue and drug development expenses were projected
through 2020 based on information obtained from management and from published
third-party industry statistics for similar drug development businesses. The
expenditures that will be necessary to complete the clinical trials are subject
to numerous uncertainties. Completion of clinical trials may take several years
or more, and the estimate of time and cost to complete can be affected by
factors such as the number of patients required to participate in the trials,
the number of clinical sites involved in the trials, the length of time
required to enroll a suitable number of patients and the type, complexity,
novelty and intended use of a product. We estimate that the development of
these acquired projects through clinical trials to commercial viability will
take approximately nine years and cost in excess of $500,000. The discounted
cash flow method was applied to the projected cash flows, adjusted for the
probability of success, using a discount rate of 30%. The discount rate takes
into consideration the uncertainty surrounding successful development and
commercialization of the IPRD. Since the acquisition, nothing has occurred
that would lead us to believe that the original estimates of the cost to
develop these compounds, or their revenue potential, is materially different
from the estimates used at the time of the acquisition for purposes of purchase
accounting. 60  ARQULE, INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Continued IN THOUSANDS, EXCEPT SHARE AND PER SHARE DATA 5. COLLABORATIONS AND ALLIANCES
Chemistry-Based
Collaborations
Pfizer. Our
largest chemistry-based collaboration is with Pfizer. Since the inception of
this relationship in 1999, we have managed and staffed a facility that produces
collections of chemical compounds exclusively for Pfizer using our automated
high-speed compound production system. Pfizer received a non-exclusive license
to use this system in its internal production program. The original contract
with Pfizer was expanded in December2001 and renegotiated in February2002.
Since December2001, we produced for Pfizer annually an average of
approximately 160,000 chemical compounds. We have received payments of
approximately $285 million from Pfizer since the inception of the relationship
in 1999. Pfizer made an equity investment in our company of $10,000 in 2001, at
the onset of the expanded agreement, plus investments totaling $8,000 in 2003
based on the achievement of certain delivery milestones. Pfizer owns all rights
in compounds produced pursuant to the collaboration.
We received notice on December2, 2005 that
Pfizer had elected to terminate the Agreement, pursuant to the Agreement terms,
effective May22, 2006. We will continue to provide chemistry services to
Pfizer pursuant to the Agreement through the effective date of termination. The Agreement provides for six months prior
written notice by either party to the other for termination without cause and,
in the event of termination by Pfizer, certain payments to us. In accordance
with these provisions, we received approximately $19,750 in December2005
in connection with the termination. This amount was recorded as deferred
revenue and is being recognized to revenue as compounds are delivered through
the termination date of the collaboration.
Also, we successfully completed
major collaborations with Bayer, Solvay, GlaxoSmithKline, Pharmacia, Wyeth
Pharmaceuticals, Johnson Johnson, Sankyo, and Novartis. The
collaboration agreements contain trailing obligations of our collaborators to,
under specified circumstances, make milestone and royalty payments. 
Bayer. In October1999, we entered into a three-year
collaboration with Bayer AG to produce large collections of compounds designed
exclusively for Bayer in accordance with its specifications. We refer to such
collections as Custom ArrayTMlibraries. In December2002, we extended
the production period until September30, 2003. Bayer owns all rights in
compounds for an initial period, after which we will co-own rights in compounds
that Bayer has not claimed in a patent application. We received a $3,000
upfront payment and an additional $28,017 during the term of the agreement for
delivery and success fees. As of December31, 2005, we have completed our
contractual obligations and have received a total of $31,017 under this
agreement. Bayer will pay no milestones or royalties to us on compounds that
they develop and market.
Solvay. In November1995, we entered into a
five-year agreement with Solvay Duphar B.V. Under this agreement, Solvay
subscribed to our Mapping ArrayTMand
Directed ArrayTMPrograms
and received a non-exclusive license to our AMAP Chemistry Operating System. This
agreement was superseded by an amended and restated agreement with Solvay
Pharmaceuticals, B.V., which became effective on January1, 2001. The
amended agreement extended the collaboration through December31, 2003. Under
the amended agreement, Solvay received our Compass ArrayTMlibraries and continued to access our Directed
ArrayTMPrograms. As
of December31, 2005, we have received $20,700 under the original and
amended agreements, both of which are complete. Solvay must also make
additional payments if we achieve certain  61  ARQULE, INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Continued IN THOUSANDS, EXCEPT SHARE AND PER SHARE DATA development
milestones and pay royalties on sales of any drugs that result from the
relationship. To date, we have not received any milestone or royalty payments.
In connection with the original collaboration in 1995, an affiliate of Solvay,
Physica B.V., made a $7,000 equity investment in ArQule. 
GlaxoSmithKline. In November2000, we entered into a
five-year collaboration and license agreement with SmithKline Beecham
Corporation now GlaxoSmithKline. Under the terms of the agreement,
GlaxoSmithKline received access to our Compass Array libraries and Mapping
Array libraries for screening primarily in the anti-infective field.
GlaxoSmithKline elected to terminate the agreement in November2002,
before the end of the five-year term. As of December31, 2005, we have
received $1,469 under this collaboration. GlaxoSmithKline has agreed to pay us
development milestones and royalties on sales of products resulting from the
collaboration. To date, we have not received any milestone or royalty payments.
Pharmacia. We entered into a five-year collaboration with
Monsanto Company now Pharmacia Corporation in December1996. Under this
agreement, we provided Monsanto with access to our Mapping and Directed Array
Programs and Compass Array and Mapping Array libraries. Pharmacia has made
payments totaling $12,718 under this agreement. In addition, Monsanto has
agreed to pay us development milestones and royalties from the sales of
products resulting from the collaboration. In July1998, we received a
milestone payment for a Mapping Array compound selected by Monsanto for entry
into field trials. In March2002, we entered into a one-year technical
access agreement with Pharmacia Corporation that granted Pharmacia
non-exclusive access to our proprietary ADMET simulation technology. In March2003,
we extended the technical access agreement to June30, 2003. As of December31,
2005, we have satisfied our contractual obligations with Pharmacia.
Sankyo. In November1997, we entered into a
three-year agreement with Sankyo Company, Ltd. to discover and optimize drug
candidates. Under the terms of the agreement, Sankyo received a subscription to
our Mapping ArrayTMProgram. The
program involved a large collection of compounds provided on a non-exclusive
basis to several pharmaceutical companies as a tool to discover new lead
compounds. Sankyo also committed to a minimum number of Directed ArrayTMPrograms during the term of the
agreement. In April2001, we extended our agreement with Sankyo through June2004
to include access to the Compass ArrayTMlibraries, which are a subset of the Mapping
ArraysTM, in addition to continuing to use our Directed
ArrayTMProgram,
which involves a target-focused library. The total value of the extended
agreement is up to $14,892 in committed payments of which, as of December31,
2005, we have received the entire balance. To date, we have not received any
milestone or royalty payments under this agreement.
Wyeth
Pharmaceuticals. In July1997, we entered into a four and one
half year agreement with Wyeth Pharmaceuticals Wyeth. Under this agreement,
Wyeth subscribed to our Mapping Array and Directed Array Programs. We
discontinued our Mapping Array Program as of 2002, and as a consequence and in
agreement with Wyeth, we did not renew our collaboration. Wyeth has continuing
rights to screen the compounds from the Mapping and Directed Array Programs and
continuing obligations to pay us development milestones and royalties from the
sales of products resulting from compounds we shipped during the collaboration.
Wyeth has filed two INDs based upon compounds from our Direct Array Program;
one is currently in phase 1 clinical trials, while Wyeth has ceased development
on the second. A third compound derived from our collaboration is progressing
within Wyeths internal development track. Through December31, 2004,
Wyeth has made milestone payments to us in connection with these  62  ARQULE, INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Continued IN THOUSANDS, EXCEPT SHARE AND PER SHARE DATA compounds
in October2002, February2004, December2004, and February2005.
As of December31, 2005, we have received $28,384 under this agreement.
Johnson
Johnson. In December1998,
we entered into a three-year collaboration with R.W. Johnson Pharmaceutical
Research Institute, a division of Johnson Johnson,Inc., in
which R.W. Johnson subscribed to our Mapping Array Program. We discontinued our
Mapping Array Program as of 2002, and, as a consequence and in agreement with
R.W. Johnson, we did not renew our collaboration. As of December31, 2005,
we have received $8,995 under this agreement. In addition, R.W. Johnson has
agreed to pay us developmental milestones and royalties from sales of any
products resulting from this collaboration. To date, we have not received any
milestone or royalty payments.
Novartis Institute for
BioMedical Research,Inc. On September3,
2003, we entered into a one year chemistry services collaboration with Novartis
Institute for BioMedical Research,Inc. Novartis, an affiliate of
Novartis AG. As part of the collaboration we applied our integrated chemistry
technology platform to generate and optimize small molecule compounds for NIBRIs
anti-infective drug discovery program. In September2004, this contact was
extended six months. As of December31, 2005, we have received $1,500 from
NIBRI, under the collaborative agreement, which is now complete.
Research and Development Alliance
On April2, 2004, ArQule announced an alliance
with Hoffmann-La Roche Roche to discover and develop drug candidates
targeting the E2F biological pathway. The alliance includes a compound, which
is currently in phase 1 clinical development. Under the terms of the agreement,
Roche obtained an option to license ArQules E2F program in the field of cancer
therapy. Roche provided immediate research funding of $15,000, and financial
support for ongoing research and development. ArQule is responsible for
advancing drug candidates from early stage development into phase 2 trials.
Roche may opt to license worldwide rights for the development and
commercialization of products resulting from this collaboration by paying an
option fee. Assuming the successful development and commercialization of a
compound under the program, ArQule could receive up to $276,000 in
pre-determined payments, plus royalties based on net sales. Additionally,
ArQule has the option to co-promote products in the U.S. Revenue from the Roche alliance is included in
research and development revenue in the consolidated statements of operations. 63 ARQULE, INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Continued IN THOUSANDS, EXCEPT PER SHARE AND PER SHARE DATA

The securities summarized above represent a total
of 49 investments purchased by the Company in order to maximize its return on
liquid assets in excess of its immediate needs. The temporary impairments
relate to unfavorable market interest rate fluctuations that have decreased the
fair value of the investments below the original investment cost. The Company
believes these fluctuations are temporary and therefore has not realized an
impairment loss on these investments at December31, 2005.

On May2, 2005, we
completed a transaction to sell our Woburn headquarters facility and two
parcels of land in exchange for a cash payment, net of commissions and closing
costs, of $39,331. Simultaneous with that sale, we entered into an agreement to
lease back the entire facility and the associated land. The lease was
subsequently amended on June30, 2005. The amended lease has a term of ten
years with an average annual rental rate of $3,409. We also have options to
extend the lease term for up to an additional ten years. In accordance with
Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No98, Accounting for Leases, we are applying
sale leaseback accounting to the transaction and are treating the lease as an
operating lease. As a result of this transaction, we reduced our net fixed
assets by $33,709, representing the net book  65  ARQULE, INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Continued IN THOUSANDS, EXCEPT PER SHARE AND PER SHARE DATA value of
the assets sold on the date of the lease amendment, and realized a gain on the

In July2001, we
purchased approximately 18 million preferred shares of a privately owned
proteomics company for $5,000. This represented an approximately 8% ownership
interest. We accounted for this under the cost method as we did not exert
significant influence in the company. This investment was included in other
assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. We assessed the fair value of this
investment quarterly or whenever events or changes in circumstance indicate
that the investment value may not be recoverable. At December31, 2003, we
performed such an assessment based on an analysis of the investments current
financial condition, its prospects of generating additional cash flow from
operating activities, the current market conditions for raising capital funding
for companies in this industry and the likelihood that any funding raised would
significantly dilute our ownership percentage. As a result of this analysis it
was our judgment that a permanent impairment had occurred and that the fair
value of our investment was $250, resulting in a non-cash loss on investment of
$4,750. In the second quarter of 2005, events affecting the financial condition
of the investment caused us to conclude that the fair value of the investment
had further declined, and as such, we recorded a non-cash loss on investment of
$250 million to write-off the remaining carrying value of this investment.

10. RESTRUCTURING ACTIONS
In December2002, we announced a major
restructuring of our operations in order to realign our workforce and expedite
the transition towards becoming a drug discovery company. The restructuring
actions included closing our facilities in Redwood City, California and
Cambridge, United Kingdom, along with the termination of 128 employees in these
facilities and our Massachusetts facilities. The Company recorded a
restructuring charge of approximately $12,695, including a facility-related
charge of $9,607. Facility-related costs relate to the remaining lease payment
obligations associated with the abandonment of our facilities in Redwood City,
California and Cambridge and the non-cash write-off of leasehold improvements
and equipment no longer expected to provide future economic benefit at the
abandoned facilities, less assumed proceeds from sale.
In October2003, we completed an agreement with
InPharmatica Ltd. to sell certain assets of our former operations in the United
Kingdom. As a result, we reversed $290 of restructuring accrual to reflect a
change in its original estimate of the remaining lease obligations and assumed
sublease income in the United Kingdom. Throughout the latter half of 2003, we
were in negotiations with a third-party to sublease its facility in California
on favorable terms. Those negotiations were terminated in January2004. As
a result, the adequacy of the accrual relative to the lease obligation and
assumed sublease income for the California facility was reassessed, and based
on continued deterioration in the local real estate market, an additional
provision of $1,529 was recorded in the fourth quarter of 2003.
In the first quarter of 2004, we implemented a
restructuring to shift resources from our chemistry services business to our
internal cancer therapy research. The restructuring included the termination of
53 staff and managerial employees, or approximately 18% of the workforce, in
the following areas: 30 in chemistry production positions, 7 in chemistry-based
research and development positions and 16 in administrative positions. In
connection with these actions we recorded a restructuring charge of $1,072 in
the first quarter of 2004 for termination benefits.
In the third quarter of 2004, we entered into a sublease
for the California facility. The term of the sublease extends through 2010, the
remaining term of the Companys primary lease obligation. As a result of signing the sublease, we
reassessed the remaining restructuring accrual and, since the sublease was on
terms more favorable than previously estimated, we recorded a $1,496
restructuring credit in the third quarter of 2004.
The original facility-related restructuring charge for
abandoning the California and United Kingdom facilities took place in 2002 and
was accounted for in accordance with Emerging Issues Task Force Issue No94-3,
Liability Recognition for Certain Employee Termination Benefits and Other Costs
to Exit an Activity. This guidance required liabilities for future obligations
for abandoned real estate to be recorded based on the estimated, non-discounted
future net cash flows. Consequently, the subsequent adjustments to the
facility-related accrual in 2003 and 2004 were also recorded on the basis of
non-discounted future net cash flows. 67  ARQULE, INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Continued IN THOUSANDS, EXCEPT PER SHARE AND PER SHARE DATA Activities

The facility-related
accrual, which primarily represents the difference between the Companys lease
and other facility related obligations for its California facility and the
amount of sublease and other payments it will receive under its sublease
agreement, will be paid out through 2010. The portions of the restructuring
accrual that are expected to be paid out within one year and longer than one
year are included in the Consolidated Balance Sheet under Accounts payable and
accrued expenses and Restructuring
accrual - long-term portion, respectively.
Accruals for abandoned
facilities under lease requires significant management judgment and the use of
estimates, including assumptions concerning the ability of a sublessee to
fulfill its contractual sublease obligation. As a result of signing the
sublease for the California facility, we adjusted our accrual for abandoned
facilities to reflect the full amount of the anticipated sublease income to be
received. This assumption about the subleasees ability to fulfill its
contractual obligation is based on an analysis of their financial position and
ability to generate future working capital. If the subleasee is unable to meet its
obligations, and the Company is unable to enter into another sublease for the
facility, ArQule may be required to adjust its restructuring accrual and record
additional restructuring expense of up to $3,529.
On January19, 2006,
our Board of Directors authorized severance payments for employees in
connection with a plan of termination for our chemistry services business. The
severance benefits to be provided each affected employee approximately 125
employees in total will consist of cash payments and continuation of health
care coverage. The amount of each individual employees benefit will be
determined by the employees service level and tenure with the Company. The
cost associated with the plan of termination is estimated to be approximately
$2,700, and will be recorded as a restructuring charge in 2006. It is expected
that the severance benefits will be fully paid by December31, 2006.
11. DEBT
Beginning in 1999, the Company entered into various
term loan agreements with Fleet National Bank now Bank of America to finance
equipment purchases, the acquisition of its facility and land in Woburn,
Massachusetts and the build out of its leased facility in Redwood City,
California. These amounts were fully repaid in 2004. 68  ARQULE, INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Continued IN THOUSANDS, EXCEPT PER SHARE AND PER SHARE DATA In connection with the
Cyclis acquisition, ArQule assumed total long term debt of $2,572. Of this
amount, $2,500 plus accrued interest was repaid at closing. The remaining
obligation represents two promissory notes with a lender that were fully repaid
in 2005.
12. STOCKHOLDERS EQUITY
Preferred Stock
We are authorized to issue
up to one million shares of preferred stock. As of December31, 2005 and
2004 there were no outstanding shares of preferred stock. Our Board of
Directors will determine the terms of the preferred stock if and when the
shares are issued.
Common Stock
Our amended Certificate of Incorporation authorizes
the issuance of up to 50 million shares of $001 par value common stock.
At December31, 2005, we have 3,560,252 common
shares reserved for future issuance under the Employee Stock Purchase Plan and
for the exercise of common stock options pursuant to the Equity Incentive Plan
and the Directors Plan.
On January28, 2005,
we completed a stock offering whereby we sold 579 million shares of common
stock at $525 per share for aggregate net proceeds of $28,349 after
commissions and offering expenses.
13. STOCK OPTION PLANS
During 2005, our Shareholders approved an amendment to
the 1994 Amended and Restated Equity Incentive Plan the Equity Incentive Plan
to increase the number of shares available to 9,600,000. All shares are awarded
at the discretion of our Board of Directors in a variety of stock based forms
including stock options and restricted stock. Pursuant to the Equity Incentive
Plan, incentive stock options may not be granted at less than the fair market
value of our common stock at the date of the grant, and the option term may not
exceed ten years. For holders of 10% or more of our voting stock, options may
not be granted at less than 110% of the fair market value of the common stock
at the date of the grant, and the option term may not exceed five years. Stock
appreciation rights granted in tandem with an option shall have an exercise
price not less than the exercise price of the related option. As of December31,
2005, no stock appreciation rights have been issued. At December31, 2005,
there were 3,035,160 shares available for future grant under the Equity
Incentive Plan.
During 2005, our Shareholders approved an amendment to
the 1996 Amended and Restated Director Stock Option Plan Director Plan to
increase the number of shares available to 500,500. During 2003, our
shareholders approved and amended the Director Plan to: iincrease the
number of shares of our common stock automatically granted to a director upon
his or her initial election to our board of directors from 7,500 shares to
10,000 shares and iiincrease the number of shares of our common stock
automatically granted to directors upon their continuation on our board
immediately after each annual meeting from 3,500 shares to 5,000 shares. All
options granted pursuant to the Director Plan have a term of ten years with
exercise prices equal to fair market value on the date of grant. Through December31,
2005, options to purchase 317,500 shares of common stock have been granted
under this plan of which  69  ARQULE, INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Continued IN THOUSANDS, EXCEPT PER SHARE AND PER SHARE DATA 285,668 shares are
currently exercisable. As of December31, 2005, 183,000 shares are
available for future grant.
During 2005, we issued 13,500 fully-vested options to
certain members of our Scientific Advisory Board under the Equity Incentive
Plan. In 2004, we issued 12,000 such grants. There were no such grants in 2003.
Compensation expense in 2005 and 2004 was $58 and $54, respectively. In 2005,
we amended the terms of certain options awarded to employees whose positions
were terminated, resulting in a non-cash charge of $289. In connection with our
restructuring actions in February2004, the Company amended the terms of
certain options awarded to employees whose positions were eliminated, resulting
in a non-cash restructuring charge of $76.

In 1996, the stockholders adopted the 1996 Employee
Stock Purchase Plan the Purchase Plan. This plan enables eligible employees
to exercise rights to purchase our common stock at 85% of the fair market value
of the stock on the date the right was granted or the date the right is
exercised, whichever is lower. Rights to purchase shares under the Purchase
Plan are granted by the Board of Directors. The rights are exercisable during a
period determined by the Board of Directors; however, in no event will the
period be longer than twenty-seven months. The Purchase Plan is available to
substantially all employees, subject to certain limitations. As of December31,
2005, 887,908 shares have been purchased pursuant to the Purchase Plan. In May2005,
our shareholders approved an amendment to the Purchase Plan to increase the
aggregate number of shares of the Companys common stock that may be issued
from 1,020,000 shares to 1,230,000 shares. As of December31, 2005, there
were 342,092 shares available for future sale under the Employee Stock Purchase

deferred tax consequences of temporary differences in reporting items for
financial statement and income tax purposes are recognized, if appropriate.
Realization of the future tax benefits related to the deferred tax assets is
dependent on many factors, including our ability to generate taxable income
within the net operating loss carry-forward period. Management has considered
these factors in reaching its conclusion as to the valuation allowance for
financial reporting purposes. The income tax effect of temporary differences
comprising the deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities on the
accompanying balance sheets is a result of the following

Of the $55,180 valuation

options will be credited to paid-in capital, if realized.
As of December31, 2005, we
had federal net operating loss NOL and research and development credit
carryforwards of approximately $95,655 and $6,806, respectively, which can be
used to offset future federal income tax liabilities and expire at various
dates through 2025. As required by Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No109,
Accounting for Income Taxes, we
evaluated positive and negative evidence bearing upon the realizability of its
deferred tax assets, which are comprised principally of NOL and research
development credit carryforwards. We have determined that it is more likely
than not that we will not recognize the benefits of federal and state deferred
tax assets and, as a result, a valuation allowance of approximately $55,180 has
been established at December31, 2005.
Our
ability to utilize our NOL and credit carryforwards may be limited in the event
of an ownership change as defined in Internal revenue Code section 382 and 383.
Generally, an ownership change occurs when the ownership percentage of 5% or greater
shareholders increase by more than 50% over a three-year period. Accordingly,
purchase of our stock in amounts greater than specified levels could
inadvertently limit our ability to utilize our NOL and credit carryforwards for
tax purposes. 73  ARQULE, INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Continued IN THOUSANDS, EXCEPT SHARE AND PER SHARE DATA 15. COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES

2003, 2004 and 2005, respectively. Sublease income, which is recorded as a
reduction of rent expense, was approximately $391, $410, and $316 for the years
ended December31, 2003, 2004 and 2005 respectively.
On January16, 2002,

Commonwealth of Massachusetts for declaratory relief and damages against
Cummings Properties, LLC Cummings arising from a dispute over increased
lease rates related to approximately 35,500 square feet of laboratory and
office space in Medford, Massachusetts. As a result of developments in the
pre-trial phase of our litigation, in the fourth quarter of 2004, we recorded
an expense of $637 to accrue the difference between our contractual lease
obligations for a portion of the Medford facility and the amount of contractual
sublease income we expected to receive over the term of the lease accrued
loss on sublease. On October11, 2005, the parties agreed to settle the
lawsuit and file with the Court a stipulation of dismissal of the lawsuit with
prejudice. In exchange for Cummings forgiving a portion of the rental payment
obligations for the period from November1, 2005 through July30,
2006, we paid Cummings $262 and assigned our sublease rent payments during that
period to Cummings and guaranteed those payments. The total amount of those
remaining sublease payments at December31, 2005 is approximately $217.
