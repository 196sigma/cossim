Item 8. Financial Statements. Contractual Obligations The aggregate amount of long-term debt maturing by year
is presented in the table below. During 2004, the Company incurred rental expense of
approximately $596,000, primarily due to operating leases for the facilities in
Martinsburg, West Virginia; Berryville, Virginia and Atlanta, Georgia and for
equipment at the herring and salmon product processing facility in Chicago,
Illinois. Future commitments under all
operating leases are presented in the table below. In connection with the Halifax acquisition, the Company
acquired the licensing rights to various brand names. Along with these rights, the Company has
assumed the commitment to make minimum royalty payments under the terms of
these licensing agreements. These
agreements fully expire in 2006 and the commitments are presented in the table
below.

The ratio of long-term debt-to-total capitalization was
71% at both December 31, 2004 and December 31, 2003. The Company believes its financial resources
are adequate to fund its needs for at least the next twelve months. 16 Cash Flow Cash flows from
operating activities. Net cash provided by operating activities was
$2,420,000 for the year ended December 31, 2004, compared to net cash used of
$1,388,000 for the year ended December 31, 2003. The $2,420,000 of operating cash provided was
primarily a reflection of $1,426,000 decrease in accounts receivable due to
lower sales especially of the Vita Specialty Foods products; $580,000 of
non-cash asset impairment and depreciation charges less the net loss; a
decrease in income tax receivable of $519,000 and a $249,000 decrease in
inventories. The cash provided by these
items was partially offset by a $105,000 reduction in accounts payable and
accrued expenses. During 2003, $1,248,000 of cash was used to increase
accounts receivable, and another $529,000 used to increase inventories 1,785,000 was used to lower accounts payable and accruals and $145,000 for
higher prepaid expenses. These balance
sheet uses of operating cash were partially offset by operating cash sources
totaling $2,319,000 and representing net income and depreciation plus a net
increase in income tax liabilities. Cash flows from investing
activities. Net cash used in investing activities was $1,196,000
and $1,173,000 for the years ended December 31, 2004 and 2003, respectively.
During both years, this cash was used primarily for capital additions totaling
$1,178,000 during 2004 and $1,136,000 during 2003. The capital expenditures for both years
primarily reflect investment in production equipment at the Chicago and the
Martinsburg facilities; similar usages are anticipated for the year ending December
31, 2005. Cash flows from financing
activities. Net cash used by financing activities was $1,293,000 for
the year ended December 31, 2004, compared to cash provided of $2,640,000 for
the year ended December 31, 2003. The
most recent year activity includes $139,000 of cash provided from stock and
stock option proceeds net of $50,000 used to purchases treasury stock plus
$1,382,000 used to pay down bank debt.
There was net bank borrowing required during 2003 to cover the cash used
in the operating and investing activities described above. Inflation Inflation has historically not had a material effect on
the Companys operations. Impact of Recently Issued Accounting Standards In January 2003, FASB issued Interpretation No. 46, Consolidation of
Variable Interest Entities FIN 46. In general, a variable interest entity
is a corporation, partnership, trust or any other legal structure used for
business purposes that either a does not have equity investors with voting
rights or b has equity investors that do not provide significant financial
resources for the entity to support its activities. FIN 46 requires certain
variable interest entities to be consolidated by the primary beneficiary of the
entity if the investors do not have the characteristics of a controlling
financial interest or do not have sufficient equity at risk for the entity to
finance its activities without additional subordinated financial support from
other parties. The consolidation requirements of FIN 46 apply immediately to
variable interest entities created after January 31, 2003. In December 2003, the FASB issued FIN 46R,
which amended FIN 46 and added additional guidance and interpretation. The Company adopted the provisions of FIN 46
and FIN 46R in 2003 and such adoption did not have a material impact on its consolidated
financial statements since it currently has no variable interest entities. In
December 2004, the FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards 123
revised 2004 Share-Based Payment SFAS 123R. Among other things, SFAS 123R requires
expensing the fair value of stock options, which was previously optional. SFAS 123R is effective as of July 1,
2005. The Company expects the impact of
adopting SFAS 123R will be similar to the pro forma impacts as described in
Note 2 Stock Options. Critical
Accounting Policies and Estimates The Companys financial
statements reflect the selection and application of accounting policies that
require management to make significant estimates and assumptions. The Company believes that the following are
some of the more critical judgment areas in the application of its accounting
policies that currently affect the Companys financial condition and results of
operations. 17 Preparation of the consolidated
financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally
accepted in the United States requires management to make estimates and
assumptions affecting the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and
expenses and related contingent liabilities.
On an on-going basis, the Company evaluates its estimates, including
those related to revenues, returns, bad debts, income taxes and contingencies
and litigation. The Company bases its
estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are
believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results may differ from these
estimates under different assumptions or conditions. Revenue
Recognition and Merchandise Returns Revenue is recognized upon the passing of title to the customers, which
occurs upon shipment of product to customers in fulfillment of customer
orders. In accordance with industry
practices, inventory is sold to customers often with the right to return or dispose
if the merchandise is not resold prior to the expiration of its shelf
life. In order to support the Companys
products, various marketing programs are offered to customers, which reimburse
them for a portion, or all of their promotional activities related to the
Companys products. The Company
regularly reviews and revises, when it deems necessary, estimates of costs to
the Company for these marketing and merchandising programs based on estimates
of what has been incurred by customers.
Actual costs incurred by the Company may differ significantly if factors
such as the level and success of the customers programs or other conditions
differ from expectations. Sales are
reduced by a provision for estimated future returns, disposals and promotional
expense. Income Tax
Assets and Liabilities The
Company recognizes deferred income tax assets and liabilities for the expected
future tax consequences of temporary differences between the tax basis and
financial reporting basis of certain assets and liabilities and certain income
tax credit carryforwards. In estimating
future tax consequences, the Company generally considers all expected future
events other than enactments of changes in tax laws or rates. A valuation reserve is recognized based on
the evidence available; if it is more likely than not that some portion or all
of the deferred income tax asset will not be realized. See Note 5 of Item 8. Financial Statements
for a further description of income taxes. 18 Acquisition
and Exit Costs Shortly after the
acquisition of Halifax, the Companys management finalized plans to restructure
the operations of pre-acquisition Halifax to eliminate redundant facilities and
headcount, reduce cost structure and better align the operating expenses with existing
economic conditions. Consequently, in
2003, the Company recorded $724,503 of costs relating to activities of
pre-acquisition Halifax such as severance and related benefits, the cost of
abandoned leasehold improvements, the cost to vacate the leased facilities and
other pre-acquisition liabilities. These
costs were accounted for under EITF 95-3, Recognition of Liabilities in
Connection with Purchase of Business Combinations. These costs were recognized as a liability
assumed in the acquisition and included in the allocation of the purchase
price. See Note 2 of Item 8. Financial
Statements for a further description of acquisition and exit costs. Goodwill
Carrying Value The Company assesses the
impairment of goodwill, at least, whenever events or changes in circumstances
indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable. Factors the Company considers important,
which could trigger an impairment review include the following Significant underperformance relative to
expected historical or projected future operating results Significant changes in the manner of the
Companys use of the acquired assets or the strategy for the Companys overall
business Significant negative industry or economic
trends Significant decline in the Companys stock
price for a sustained period; and
The Companys market capitalization relative
to net book value. When the Company determines
that the carrying value of goodwill may not be recoverable based upon the
existence of one or more of the above indicators of impairment, the Company
will review for impairment under the provisions of SFAS 142. The provisions of SFAS 142
also required an annual impairment test for goodwill. See Note 1 of Item 8. Financial Statements
for a further description of the annual goodwill impairment assessment. Item
7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk. The Company is exposed to
interest rate fluctuations, primarily as a result of its $18 million credit
agreement the Credit Agreement with interest rates subject to market
fluctuations. The Company does not
currently use derivative instruments to alter the interest rate characteristics
of any of its debt. The Credit Agreement
includes a revolving line of credit with a bank, which at December 31, 2004
bore interest at the prime rate minus 050% resulting in a 475% rate for a
portion of the debt and at LIBOR plus 225% resulting in a 418% rate for
another portion. This rate remains
constant until December 31, 2005. On
that date, the interest rate may be adjusted based upon certain financial
covenants and may range from prime minus 050% to LIBOR plus 175% or, to LIBOR
plus 225%. In addition, the Credit
Agreement includes two term loan facilities, one of which is active, and which
at December 31, 2004 bore interest at the prime rate minus 050% resulting in a
475% rate for this debt. On December
31, 2005, the interest rate may be adjusted based on certain financial
covenants, and may range from prime minus 050% to LIBOR plus 200% or, to LIBOR
plus 250%. A 10% fluctuation in
interest rates would not have a material impact on the Companys financial
statements. Forward-Looking Statements This annual report on Form 10-K, including Description
of Business, Description of Property, Legal Proceedings and Managements
Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations,
contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of the safe-harbor
provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Such statements are based on managements
current expectations and are subject to a number of factors and uncertainties
which could cause actual results to differ materially from those described in
the forward-looking statements. Such
factors and uncertainties include: i the impact of the level of the Companys
indebtedness; ii restrictive covenants contained in the Companys various
debt documents; iiigeneral economic conditions and conditions in the
retail environment; iv the Companys dependence on a few large customers; v
relationships with retailers; vi price fluctuations in the raw materials used
by the Company, particularly herring and salmon; vii whether the Company will
be capable of increasing sales of Halifax products; viii selling its Vita
seafood products for higher prices to take account of increased costs incurred
by the Company; ix competitive conditions in the 19 Companys
markets; xthe seasonal nature of the Companys business; xi the
Companys ability to execute its acquisition strategy; xii fluctuations in
the stock market; xiii the extent to which the Company is able to retain and
attract key personnel; xiv relationships with key vendors; xv consolidation
of the Companys supplier base; xvi successful integration of Virginia Honey
and Halifax and xvii the impact of federal, state and local environmental
requirements including the impact of current or future environmental claims
against the Company. As a result, the
Companys operating results may fluctuate, especially when measured on a
quarterly basis. The Companys business strategy contemplates that the
Company will pursue potential acquisitions.
The Company currently has no agreements or understandings with respect
to any acquisitions and there can be no assurance that the Company will be
successful in pursuing other potential acquisitions. However, the costs associated with this
strategy, means of financing any potential acquisitions, and consummation and
integration of any potential acquisitions could significantly impact the
Companys financial and operating performance. 20 Item 8.

21 Report of Independent
Registered Public Accounting Firm To the Board of Directors of
Vita Food Products, Inc.
Chicago, Illinois We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance
sheets of Vita Food Products, Inc. and Subsidiary, as of December 31, 2004 and
2003, and the related consolidated statements of operations, shareholders
equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December
31, 2004. These financial statements are
the responsibility of the Companys management. Our responsibility is to
express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audits. We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards
of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board United States. Those standards require that we plan and
perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial
statements are free of material misstatement.
The Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an
audit of its internal controls over financial reporting. Our audits included consideration of internal
controls over financial reporting as a basis for designing audit procedures
that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of
expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Companys internal controls
over financial reporting. Accordingly,
we express no such opinion. An audit
also includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and
disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles
used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the
overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a
reasonable basis for our opinion. In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements
referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial
position of Vita Food Products, Inc. and Subsidiary, at December 31, 2004 and
2003, and the results of their operations and cash flows for each of the three
years in the period ended December 31, 2004, in conformity with accounting
principles generally accepted in the United States of America.

Products,Inc. Vita Seafood processes and sells various herring, cured
and smoked salmon products and other complementary specialty food products
throughout the United States. Vita
Seafood has one processing plant located in Chicago, Illinois. Vita Specialty Foods,Inc. VSF, a wholly owned subsidiary of
Vita Seafood, manufactures and distributes salad dressings, gourmet sauces,
honey, jams and jellies. VSF has two
manufacturing plants located in Martinsburg, West Virginia and Berryville,
Virginia. Management considers Vita
Seafood and VSF as a separate business segments which are collectively referred
to herein as the Company. A summary of the significant
accounting policies utilized in the preparation of the accompanying financial
statements follows. Principles of Consolidation The consolidated financial
statements include the accounts of Vita Seafood and VSF. VSF includes the now integrated results of
The Virginia Honey Company,Inc. Virginia Honey, acquired in 2001 and
The Halifax Group,Inc. Halifax, acquired in 2002. All significant intercompany transactions and
balances have been eliminated. Concentration
of Credit Risk Financial instruments that potentially subject the
Company to significant concentrations of credit risk consist principally of
trade accounts receivable. The Company
primarily provides credit in the normal course of business. The Company performs ongoing credit
evaluations of its customers and maintains allowances for potential credit
losses, if necessary. Revenue
Recognition and Merchandise Returns Revenue is
recognized upon the passing of title to the customers, which occurs upon
shipment of product to customers in fulfillment of customer orders. In accordance with industry practices,
inventory is sold to customers often with the right to return or dispose if the
merchandise is not resold prior to the expiration of its shelf life. In order to support the Companys products,
various marketing programs are offered to customers, which reimburse them for a
portion, or all of their promotional activities related to the Companys
products. The Company regularly reviews
and revises, when it deems necessary, estimates of costs to the Company for
these marketing and merchandising programs based on estimates of what has been
incurred by customers. Actual costs
incurred by the Company may differ significantly if factors such as the level
and success of the customers programs or other conditions differ from
expectations. Sales are reduced by a
provision for estimated future returns, disposals and promotional expense. Accounts Receivable and Allowance for
Doubtful Accounts Accounts receivable are
customer obligations due under normal trade terms. The Company sells products to distributors
and retailers throughout the food industry.
The Company performs continuing credit evaluations of its customers
financial condition. Senior management reviews
accounts receivable on a regular basis to determine if any receivables will
potentially be uncollectible. The
Company provides an allowance sufficient to cover any accounts receivable
balances that are potentially uncollectible, along with a general reserve based
on historic experience. After attempts
to collect the receivable have failed and it is considered to be uncollectible,
it is written off against the allowance.
Based on the information available, the Company believes the allowance
for doubtful accounts as of December31, 2004 to be adequate and not
excessive. However, it is still possible
that in the future, actual write offs may exceed the recorded balance. The allowance for discounts,
returns and doubtful accounts has fluctuated as follows over the last three
years 26 Allowance for Discounts, Returns and Doubtful Accounts

Inventories Inventories are stated at
the lower of cost or market. Costs are
determined by the first-in, first-out method and include raw materials, labor
and plant overhead. Property,
Plant and Equipment Property, plant and
equipment are stated at cost.
Depreciation and amortization are being provided, on straight-line
methods, over the estimated useful lives of the assets as follows 
Buildings and improvements
15 to 315 years
Machinery and equipment
5 to 15 years
Office and transportation equipment
3 to 7 years
Leasehold improvements are
being amortized on a straight-line basis over the lives of the respective
leases or the service lives of the improvements whichever is shorter. Amortization of assets under capital lease is
included in depreciation and amortization.
Repair and maintenance items are expensed as incurred. Long-Lived
Assets The Company reviews the
carrying values of its long-lived assets for possible impairment whenever
events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the
assets may not be recoverable. Any
long-lived assets held for disposal are reported at the lower of their carrying
amounts or fair value less cost to sell.
As of December31, 2004 there has been no impairment of long-lived
assets. Goodwill The changes in the carrying
amount of goodwill related to the VSF acquisitions for the years ended
December31, 2004, 2003 and 2002 were as follows

27 On January1, 2002, the
Company adopted SFAS No142 Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets SFAS
142, which addresses the financial accounting and reporting standards for
goodwill and other intangible assets subsequent to their acquisition. This accounting standard requires that
goodwill no longer be amortized, and instead be tested for impairment on at
least an annual basis. During the fourth quarters
of 2003 and 2002, the Company completed its annual assessment of impairment
regarding the goodwill recorded as a result of the Virginia Honey acquisition
$6,004,000 and the Halifax acquisition $2,307,000. Those assessments, supported by independent
appraisals of the fair value of VSF, did not identify any impairment. However, the 2004 independent appraisal 
made using customary valuation methodologies including discounted cash flows
and fundamental analysis, did reveal impairment issues. The revised appraisal reflects a decreased
fair value of VSF, principally caused by the decline in operating income of VSF
during 2004. That decline was primarily
a result of a substantial decline in the sales of Halifax products which were
down $1,600,000 or 21% in 2004. Based on
the appraised value of VSF, the resulting impairment charge of approximately
$2,314,000 was recorded in the fourth quarter of 2004. The adjustment to the
original Halifax purchase price allocation made in 2003 is more fully described
in Note 2. Estimates The accompanying financial
statements include estimated amounts and disclosures based on managements
assumptions about future events. Actual
results may differ from those estimates. Advertising Advertising costs are
expensed as incurred and included in selling, marketing and distribution
expenses. Advertising expenses amounted
to approximately $349,000, $393,000 and $370,000 in 2004, 2003 and 2002,
respectively. Shipping
and Handling Fees The Company classifies
shipping and handling costs billed to customers as revenue. Costs related to shipping are classified as
part of selling, marketing and distribution expenses and were $3,539,000 2,851,000 and $2,447,000 in 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively. Income
Taxes The Company recognizes
deferred income tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax
consequences of temporary differences between the tax basis and financial
reporting basis of certain assets and liabilities and certain income tax credit
carryforwards. In estimating future tax
consequences, the Company generally considers all expected future events other
than enactments of changes in tax laws or rates. A valuation reserve is recognized based on
the evidence available, if it is more likely than not that some portion or all
of the deferred income tax asset will not be realized. Basic and
Diluted Earnings Loss Per Common Share Basic earnings loss per
share is computed by dividing income loss available to common shareholders by
the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding for the period. Diluted earnings loss per share follows the
computation of basic earnings loss per share but also gives effect to all
dilutive potential common shares equivalents that were outstanding during the
year. The following is a
reconciliation from basic earnings/loss per share to diluted earnings loss
per share for each of the last three years 28

In 2004, 2003 and 2002 there
were an additional 82,500, 29,000 and 30,000 common shares respectively
issuable upon exercise stock options that were not considered in the
computation because they would have been anti-dilutive. Accounting
for Stock Based Compensation The Company applies the
intrinsic value method under Accounting Principals Board Opinion 25 and related
interpretations in accounting for its stock based compensation plans. No compensation cost has been recognized for
the Companys stock compensation plans as the market price of the common stock
underlying the grant did not exceed the exercise price of the grant on the
measurement date. The Company is required to
provide pro forma disclosures of net income and earnings per share had the
Company adopted the fair value method under Statement of Financial Accounting
Standards No123. The
weighted-average, grant date fair value of stock options granted to employees
during the year and the weighted-average significant assumptions used to

Recent Accounting Pronouncements In January2003, FASB
issued Interpretation No46, Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities
FIN 46. In general, a variable interest entity is a corporation,
partnership, trust or any other legal structure used for business purposes that
either adoes not have equity investors with voting rights or
bhas equity investors that do not provide significant financial
resources for the entity to support its activities. FIN 46 requires certain
variable interest entities to be consolidated by the primary beneficiary of the
entity if the investors do not have the characteristics of a controlling
financial interest or do not have sufficient equity at risk for the entity to
finance its activities without additional subordinated financial support from
other parties. The consolidation requirements of FIN 46 apply immediately to
variable interest entities created after January31, 2003. In December2003, the FASB issued FIN
46R, which amended FIN 46 and added additional guidance and
interpretation. The Company adopted the
provisions of FIN 46 and FIN 46R in 2003 and such adoption did not have a
material impact on its consolidated financial statements since it currently has
no variable interest entities. In December2004, the
FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards 123 revised 2004
Share-Based Payment SFAS 123R.
Among other things, SFAS 123R requires expensing the fair value of stock
options, which was previously optional.
SFAS 123R is effective as of July1, 2005. The Company expects the impact of adopting
SFAS 123R will be similar to the pro forma impacts as displayed in the table
above. 2.
Acquisitions The Virginia Honey Company,Inc.
Effective July1, 2001, Vita Seafood acquired
100% of the outstanding shares of capital stock of Virginia Honey from Terry W.
Hess. The results of Virginia Honey have
been included in the 30 Companys consolidated financial statements since
the effective date. The aggregate purchase price, including direct costs of the
acquisition, of $4,884,437 was paid in cash. The Halifax Group,Inc. Effective November1, 2002, Vita Seafood
acquired all of the issued and outstanding shares of capital stock of Halifax,
a Georgia corporation, from Robert J. Budd and certain affiliates or associates
of Mr.Budd. Since the effective
date, the results of Halifax have been fully integrated with the results of
Virginia Honey to form the Companys wholly owned subsidiary, VSF. On the November6, 2002 closing date, as a
direct cost of the acquisition, the Company paid cash of $450,000 to
Mr.Budd in partial payment of the $795,781 preexisting debt owed to him
by Halifax. The Company has recorded the
discounted value of the remaining debt as a long-term obligation as described
in Note 4. The Company also assigned to
Mr.Budd any potential rights or exposure associated with an unresolved
legal case involving Halifax. The case
remains unresolved and the Company and its subsidiary, VSF, have since been
named as co-defendants in that case. The following table summarizes the preliminary fair

The pro forma financial information is not

the Halifax acquisition been consummated as of the above dates, nor are they
indicative of future operating results. Acquisition and Exit Costs
Shortly after the acquisition of Halifax, the
Companys management finalized plans to restructure the operations of
pre-acquisition Halifax to eliminate redundant facilities and headcount, reduce
cost structure and better align the operating expenses with existing economic
conditions. Consequently, in 2003, the
Company recorded $724,503 of costs relating to activities of pre-acquisition
Halifax such as severance and related benefits, the cost of abandoned leasehold
improvements, the cost to vacate the leased facilities and other
pre-acquisition liabilities. These costs
were accounted for under EITF 95-3, Recognition of Liabilities in
Connection with Purchase of Business Combinations. These costs were recognized as a liability
assumed in the acquisition and included in the allocation of the purchase
price. The acquisition and exit costs consisted of the

Earn Out Provision under Acquisition
Agreements
Pursuant to the Companys acquisitions of Virginia
Honey and Halifax in 2001 and 2002, respectively, the previous owners of those
businesses, both of whom were employees as of December31, 2004 one of
whom continues to be an employee, and one of whom is a director of the
Company, are subject to earn out provisions that may result in additional
proceeds paid by the Company for the acquired businesses. As amended, the earn out provisions for Terry
Hess, the previous owner of Virginia Honey, have resulted in an additional
amount due to Mr.Hess of approximately $832,000 as of December31,
2004 with an interest rate of 42% payable in April2005. This additional payment is based on the
operating results of Virginia Honey for the period from January1, 2001 to
December31, 2002. Potential
remaining earn out payments to Mr.Hess will be based on the earnings of
VSF, as computed by a predefined allocation formula, for two separate periods 
January1, 2003 to December31, 2005 and January1, 2006 to
December31, 2007. Should VSF
maintain its current profitability levels throughout these periods, management
estimates that additional payments with a net present value as of
December31, 2004 of approximately $1,000,000 would be due to
Mr.Hess. Any future 32 payments will be recorded as additional goodwill,
and be subject to impairment analysis, when and if such payments are finally
determined at the end of each of the periods described above. Similarly, Mr.Budd, the previous owner of
Halifax, had two separate earn out periods January1, 2003 to
December31, 2005 and January1, 2006 to December31, 2007. Potential remaining earn out payments to
Mr.Budd were to be based on earnings of VSF, as computed by a pre-defined
allocation formula. On January7,
2005, Vita Food Products,Inc. terminated the Employment Agreement the
Employment Agreement made as of November1, 2002, between Halifax and
Mr.Budd. The Company alleged a for
cause termination and, accordingly, filed suit against Mr.Budd which
was settled in accordance with the terms and conditions of the Confidential
Settlement Agreement and Mutual Release entered into on March28, 2005
the Settlement Agreement. Pursuant
to the Settlement Agreement, the remaining potential earn out payments to
Mr.Budd have been eliminated entirely. The Settlement Agreement also amended the
Non-Competition and Non-Solicitation Agreement entered into by Budd in
connection with the Companys acquisition of Halifax. Pursuant to the Non-Competition Agreement, as
amended, Budd is prohibited from competing with the Company and soliciting its
employees and customers until March1, 2010, provided, that Budd may
freely engage in any business that is not producing products competitive with
the products of the Company as of February28, 2005. 3. Accrued Expenses Accrued expenses consist of

a On September9, 2003, the Company
entered into a loan agreement the Loan with a new bank and paid off the
existing credit facility. The Loan
provides for a two-year $8,500,000 revolving line of credit 33 revolving loan facility for working capital
needs; a five-year $6,500,000 term loan term loan facility that represents
the Companys long-term financing and a six-year $3,000,000 term loan that has
not yet been utilized. Borrowing under the
revolving loan facility is limited to 80% of eligible receivables and 60% of
eligible inventory as such terms are defined in the Loan. The revolving loan facility matures
January31, 2006 as amended in December2004. Availability under this line is $521,000 as
of December31, 2004. The term loan
facility is payable in monthly installments of $54,000 through July31,
2008, with a balloon payment of $3,368,000 due on August30, 2008. The loans are collateralized by all of the
assets of the Company. According to the terms of the Loan, interest is paid
monthly and interest rates are subject to adjustment at certain predetermined
dates based upon the Funded Debt to EBITDA ratio, as each such term is defined
in the Loan. Under these terms, the
revolving loan facility bears interest at rates ranging from LIBOR plus 175%
to 225% or prime minus 050% at the Companys option. The term loan facility bears interest at
rates ranging from LIBOR plus 200% to 250% or prime minus 050%. As of December31, 2004, a portion of
the revolving loan facility bore interest at 418%, which was equal to LIBOR of
193% plus 225% and another portion at 475%, which equaled prime of 525%
minus 050%. At that date, the term loan
facility also bore interest at 475%, which equaled prime minus 050%. The Loan imposes certain restrictions upon the
Company and requires the Company to maintain certain financial covenants and
ratios, including Tangible Net Worth and Cash Flow Coverage Ratio, as each such
term is defined in the Loan. At
December31, 2003, the Company was in compliance with these covenants,
however, at June30 and September30, 2004, the impact of the loss on
earnings before income taxes, depreciation and amortization as defined in the
agreement for the respective twelve months then ended resulted in
non-compliance with certain of the Companys financial covenants. The Company received a permanent waiver from
its lender with respect to these instances of non-compliance and an amendment,
which changed the financial covenants through December31, 2004. The Company was in compliance with the
revised covenants at December31, 2004.
The Company intends to closely monitor its financial covenants going
forward and is currently in discussions with its lender to further amend the
facility, including the scheduled revolving loan facility maturity date. b As part of the acquisition agreement for
Virginia Honey, the Company assumed a 70% note payable to a former Virginia
Honey shareholder. At December31,
2004 the balance due was $2,599,846.
This note is secured and is payable in monthly installments through
2018. c As described in Note 2, Mr.Hess earned
additional purchase price on his sale of Virginia Honey to Vita Seafood based
on a measurement date of December31, 2002. That obligation, at a 42% interest rate, is
payable in April2005. d The merger agreement with Halifax provided
that, as part of the acquisition price, the Company would repay the balance of
a note due to the former owner by Halifax, to that individual on April1,
2006. The Settlement Agreement entered
into between the Company and such former owner in connection with the Companys
institution of litigation against the former owner amended the terms of the
note to provide for payment in 78 bi-weekly equal installments of $4,241. The principle amount did not change and no
interest accrues on this debt. See Note
14 for further information regarding this obligation. Scheduled annual maturities
of long-term obligations as of December31, 2004 are as follows

6. Commitments and Contingencies A. In the ordinary course of business, the
Company becomes involved in litigation as a defendant in 35 various lawsuits.
In the opinion of management, after considering the advice of counsel,
the ultimate resolution of these legal proceedings will not have a material
effect on the financial statements taken as a whole and thus no provision has
been made in the financial statements for any loss contingencies. B. The Company leases two of its Virginia Honey
facilities from a former owner of Virginia Honey, who is now an officer of
VSF. During 2003, the Company renewed
both of these leases, one through December31, 2008 and the second through
December31, 2018. Additional
renewal options are available. Future
payments under these leases amount to approximately $508,000 for each of 2005
through 2007, $520,000 for 2008 and $409,000 each of the subsequent
periods. Rent expense under these
agreements totaled $306,000, $358,000 and $451,000 in, 2002, 2003 and 2004,

10. Employment Contracts In 2002, the Company entered
into employment agreements with two officers of the Company. Under the terms of these agreements, the
officers were each entitled to be paid a salary of $240,030 annually adjusted
annually for increases of at least the cost of living index, plus bonuses, if
any, and certain perquisites. During
2003, one of the officers had his employment agreement renewed on substantially
the same terms and conditions through December2007, and during 2004 the
other had his agreement renewed on substantially the same terms and conditions
through December2006. The Company also entered
into an employment agreement with an officer of Virginia Honey in conjunction
with the purchase of Virginia Honey. The agreement extended to
December31, 2004 and calls for the officer to receive a salary of
$300,000 per year with, at the sole discretion of Virginia Honeys board of directors,
a maximum raise equal to the percentage increase in the cost of living
index. The agreement was extended in
2004 under the present terms and conditions through December31, 2007. 37 In addition, in
January2005 the Company terminated an employment agreement with an
officer of Halifax that was entered into in conjunction with the purchase of
Halifax. The agreement had a term that
extended to December31, 2007 and called for the officer to receive a salary
of $242,500 per year with a 3% per year increase starting January1,
2004. See Note 14 for a further
description of the termination of employment agreement and the settlement that
was entered into between the parties in respect of the litigation commenced by
the Company against the former Halifax officer. 11. Fair Value of Financial Instruments The carrying amounts of cash, accounts receivable,
accounts payable and short-term obligations approximate fair value due to the
short-term nature of these instruments.
The carrying value of the Companys long-term obligations, based on
rates currently available for instruments with similar terms and maturities,
also approximates fair value. 12.
Business Segments The Company reports two
operating business segments in the same format as reviewed by the Companys
senior management. Segment one, Vita Seafood, processes and sells various
herring, and cured and smoked salmon products throughout the United States and
Mexico. Segment two, VSF, combines the
products of Virginia Honey and Halifax and manufactures and distributes honey,
salad dressings, sauces, marinades, jams and jellies and gift baskets
throughout North America. Management
predominately uses operating profit as the measure of profit or loss by business
segment. The significant accounting
policies as described in Note 1 were utilized in the preparation of the
financial statements for both segments. Business segment information is as follows $000s

Subsequent Event unaudited On
January7, 2005, the Company terminated the Employment Agreement the
Budd Employment Agreement, made as of November1, 2002, between Halifax
and Robert J. Budd Budd in connection with the Companys acquisition of
Halifax. Pursuant to the Budd Employment
Agreement, Budd served as the president of Halifax. The Company alleged a for cause termination
and, accordingly, filed suit against Budd which was settled in accordance with
the terms and conditions of the Confidential Settlement Agreement and Mutual
Release, entered into on March28, 2005, among the Company, VSF, Virginia
Honey, Halifax and Budd the Settlement Agreement. Pursuant
to the Settlement Agreement, the Promissory Note, dated November1, 2002,
in the original principal amount of $345,781 issued by Halifax to Budd, payable
in a lump sum on April1, 2006, which was assumed by the Company in
connection with its acquisition of Halifax, was amended to provide for payment
in 78 bi-weekly installments of $4,24078, without interest the Budd
Note. In addition, the Budd Employment
Agreement remained terminated but the Company agreed to reinstate Budd as an
employee of the Company for three years at a reduced annual salary of $51,500 plus health insurance 40 coverage
and participation in all other Company employee benefits programs on the same
terms and conditions as other employees.
Budd will perform those duties specified by Mr.Hess from time to
time, but such duties will be limited so as to permit Budd to assume other
responsibilities for other employers.
The Settlement Agreement also provides that if, by April30, 2005,
the lawsuit brought against Halifax prior to its acquisition by the Company and
to which the Company and VSF were added as defendants in 2004 the Lawsuit is
not fully settled so as to preclude the Company from having any liability or if
the Company is not dismissed with prejudice from the Lawsuit as a defendant,
Budd will pay the fees and costs incurred by the Company with respect to the
Lawsuit as of the date hereof and provide the Company with documentation
reasonably sufficient to demonstrate Budds ability to indemnify the Company
from any further expenditures that the Company may incur in the Lawsuit. In the event that any such amounts are not
paid by Budd, the Company will be entitled to offset such amounts against any
payments due to Budd under the Budd Note.
Finally, the Settlement Agreement contains a mutual release by the
parties. 41 Item 4. Submission of
Matters to a Vote of Security Holders. No
matters were submitted to a vote of security holders during the fourth quarter
2004. 10 PART II Item 5. Controls and Procedures. Under the supervision and with the
participation of the Companys management team, the principal executive officer
and principal financial officer have evaluated the effectiveness of the design
and operation of the Companys disclosure controls and procedures as defined in
Rules13a 15eand 15d 15eunder the Securities Exchange
Act of 1934, as amended the Exchange Act, as of December31, 2004 and,
based on their evaluation, have concluded that these controls and procedures
are effective. There were no changes in
the Companys internal control over financial reporting during the fiscal
quarter ended December31, 2004 that have materially affected, or are
reasonably likely to materially affect, the Companys internal control over
financial reporting. Disclosure controls and procedures are designed to
ensure that information required to be disclosed by the Company in the reports
that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed,
summarized and reported, within the time periods specified in the Securities
and Exchange Commissions rulesand forms.
Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls
and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by
the Company in the reports that it files under the Exchange Act is accumulated
and communicated to the Companys management, including its principal executive
officer and principal financial officer, as appropriate to allow timely
decisions regarding required disclosure. It should be noted that any system of controls,
however well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable, and not
absolute, assurance that the objectives of the system are met. In addition, the
design of any control system is based in part upon certain assumptions about
the likelihood of future events. Because of these and other inherent limitations
of control systems, there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in
achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions, regardless of
how remote. Item 4. Submission of
Matters to a Vote of Security Holders. No
matters were submitted to a vote of security holders during the fourth quarter
2004. 10 PART II Item 5. Directors and Executive Officers of the Registrant. The information required by
this Item 10 is incorporated herein by reference to the information set forth
under the captions Election of Directors, Executive Officers and
Section16aBeneficial Ownership Reporting Compliance in the
Companys definitive Proxy Statement for the 2005 Annual Meeting of
Stockholders.
