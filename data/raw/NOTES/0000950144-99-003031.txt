REPORT OF INDEPENDENT ACCOUNTANTS
To the Board of Directors and Stockholders
of Medical Manager Corporation
In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements listed in the index
appearing under item 14a 1 present fairly, in all material respects, the
financial position of Medical Manager Corporation and its subsidiaries the
Company at December 31, 1998 and 1997, and the results of their operations
and of their cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December
31, 1998 in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles. In
addition, in our opinion, the financial statement schedule listed in the index
appearing under Item 14a2 presents fairly, in all material respects, the
information set forth therein when read in conjunction with the related
consolidated financial statements. These financial statements and financial
statement schedule are the responsibility of the Company management; our
responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements and
financial statement schedule based on our audits. We conducted our audits of
these statements in accordance with generally accepted auditing standards which
require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about
whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit
includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and
disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles
used and significant estimates made by management, and evaluating the overall
financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a
reasonable basis for the opinion expressed above.

MEDICAL MANAGER CORPORATION
NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
1. ORGANIZATION AND BASIS OF PRESENTATION
Medical Manager Corporation MMC was founded on July 10, 1996 to bring
together the research and development, sales, marketing and support resources
for The Medical ManagerR software, a leading physician practice management
system for independent physicians, physician groups, management service
organizations MSOs, Physician Practice Management companies PPMs,
independent practice associations IPAs, managed care organizations and other
providers of health care services in the United States. On February 4, 1997, MMC
acquired in separate mergers the Mergers simultaneously with the
consummation of the initial public offering IPO, five companies: i Medical
Manager Research & Development, Inc. formerly Personalized Programming, Inc.
MMR, the owner and developer of The Medical Manager software; ii Medical
Manager Sales & Marketing, Inc. formerly Systems Plus, Inc. MMS, the
long-time national distributor of the software; iii Medical Manager Southeast
formerly National Medical Systems, Inc. MMSE, a national dealer located in
Tampa, Florida; iv Medical Manager Northeast formerly RTI Business Systems,
Inc. MMNE, a large, regional dealership in Albany, New York; and v
Medical Manager Midwest, Inc. formerly Systems Management, Inc. MMMW, a
large, regional dealership in South Bend, Indiana collectively, the Founding
Companies, which became separate, wholly-owned subsidiaries of MMC. The
aggregate consideration paid by MMC for the Founding Companies was approximately
$469 million in cash and 117 million shares of MMC common stock par value
$01 per share the Common Stock for an aggregate value of $1757 million.
The acquisitions were accounted for as a combination of the Founding Companies
at historical cost for accounting purposes. MMR is identified as the acquirer
for financial statement presentation purposes and is presented on a combined
basis with MMC from July 10, 1996. MMC conducted no significant operations and
generated no revenue prior to the closing of the IPO.
During the year ended December 31, 1997, MMC or its affiliates executed and
closed agreements to acquire 10 resellers the 1997 Acquired Companies of The
Medical Manager software. These acquisitions were accounted for using the

2. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
Principles of Consolidation. The accompanying financial statements have
been presented on a consolidated basis for the years ended December 31, 1998,
1997 and 1996. The consolidated financial statements include MMC and its wholly
owned subsidiaries. All significant intercompany balances and intercompany
transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. The accompanying
consolidated financial statements
43
46
MEDICAL MANAGER CORPORATION
NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS -- CONTINUED
include MMC, MMR and the Acquired Companies through February 4, 1997, the date
of MMC acquisition of the Founding Companies, after which the historical
financial statements reflect the results of MMC, MMR, the Acquired Companies,
and the other Founding Companies. The results of the Purchased Companies are
reflected subsequent to their respective acquisition date. The accompanying
financial statements have been adjusted retroactively to show the effect of the
acquisitions of the Acquired Companies as if they had occurred on January 1,
1996.
Revenue Recognition. Revenue from software licenses is recognized upon
sale and shipment. For the years ended December 31, 1997 and 1996, revenue from
the sale of systems was recognized when the system was installed and when the
related client training was completed, as established in Statement of Position
SOP 91-1, Software Revenue Recognition. Beginning January 1, 1998, revenue
from the sale of systems is recognized in accordance with SOP 97-2, Software
Revenue Recognition. SOP 97-2 requires the total contract revenue to be
allocated to the various elements of the contract based upon objective evidence
of the fair values of such elements and allows for only the allocated revenue to
be recognized upon completion of those elements. The effect of the adoption of
SOP 97-2 was not significant to the Company results of operations for the year
ended December 31, 1998. Amounts billed in advance of recognized revenue are
deferred. Revenue from support and maintenance contracts is recognized as the
services are performed ratably over the contract period, which typically does
not exceed one year. Revenue from other services are recognized as they are
provided. Certain expenses are allocated between the cost of revenue for systems
and maintenance and other based upon revenue, which basis management believes to
be reasonable.
Goodwill and Other Intangibles. Goodwill and other intangibles consist of
covenants not to compete and goodwill arising from business acquisitions,
detailed as follows in thousands:
1998   1997
Goodwill arising from business acquisitions. $30,032  $24,523
Covenants not to    300    227
Total gross goodwill and other intangibles.  30,332  24,750
Accumulated   2,066    975
Total net goodwill and other  $28,266  $23,775
The covenants not to compete are being amortized over periods of two to
three years and the goodwill arising from business acquisitions is being
amortized over a 20 year period.
Asset Impairment. Statement of Financial Accounting Standards SFAS No.
121, Accounting for the Impairment of Long-Lived Assets and for Long-Lived
Assets to be Disposed Of, requires that long-lived assets and certain
intangibles to be held and used by the Company be reviewed for impairment. The
Company periodically assesses whether there has been a permanent impairment of
its long-lived assets, in accordance with SFAS No. 121. No write-down of assets
due to impairment was required in the years ended December 31, 1998 or 1997.
Approximately $500,000 of goodwill was recorded by one of the Acquired
Companies, prior to their acquisition by the Company, and was written off in the
year ended December 31, 1996.
Property and Equipment. Property and equipment are stated at cost.
Additions and major renewals are capitalized. Repairs and maintenance are
charged to expense as incurred. Upon disposal, the related cost and accumulated
depreciation are removed from the accounts, with the resulting gain or loss
included in income. Depreciation is provided principally on the straight-line
method over the estimated useful lives of the assets. Amortization of leasehold
improvements is provided for over the shorter of the estimated service life of
the leased asset or the lease term using the straight-line method.
44
47
MEDICAL MANAGER CORPORATION
NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS -- CONTINUED
Inventory. Inventory primarily consists of peripheral computer equipment.
Inventory cost is accounted for on the first-in, first-out basis and reported at
the lower of cost or market.
Research and Development. Software development costs are included in
research and development and are expensed as incurred. SFAS No. 86, Accounting
for the Costs of Computer Software to be Sold, Leased, or Otherwise Marketed,
requires the capitalization of certain software development costs once
technological feasibility is established. The capitalized cost is then amortized
over the estimated product life. To date, the period between achieving
technological feasibility and the general availability of such software has been
short and software development costs qualifying for capitalization have been
insignificant.
Cash and Cash Equivalents. The Company considers all highly liquid
investments with maturity dates of three months or less when purchased to be
cash equivalents. These cash equivalents are predominantly in U.S. dollar
domestic tax free municipal instruments.
Income Taxes. The Company utilizes the asset and liability method of
accounting for income taxes. Under this method, deferred income taxes are
recorded to reflect the tax consequences on future years differences between the
tax basis of assets and liabilities and their financial reported amounts at each
year end based on enacted laws and statutory rates applicable to the periods in
which differences are expected to affect taxable income. A valuation allowance
is provided against the future benefits of deferred tax assets if it is
determined that it is more likely than not that the future tax benefits
associated with the deferred tax asset will not be realized. See Note 11.
Use of Estimates. The preparation of financial statements in conformity
with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make
estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and
liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of
the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during
the reported period. Actual results could differ from those estimates; however,
management does not believe these differences would have a material effect on
operating results.
Concentration of Credit Risk. The Company financial instruments that are
exposed to concentrations of credit risk consist primarily of cash and cash
equivalents and accounts receivable. With regard to accounts receivables, credit
risk is limited due to the wide variety of customers in the health care industry
and the geographic areas into which the Company systems and services are sold.
With regards to cash, the Company places its funds with high credit quality
institutions. At times, such monies may be in excess of the FDIC or other
insurance limits, however, the Company has not experienced any losses in such
accounts.
Non-cash Transactions. Non-cash investing and financing activities during
the year ended December 31, 1998 included the purchase of approximately $23
million of assets of the 1998 Purchased Companies through the assumption of
liabilities and the issuance of Common Stock and the purchase of equipment
through the assumption of a lease obligation. Non-cash transactions during the
year ended December 31, 1997 included the purchase of approximately $237
million of assets of the other Founding Companies and the 1997 Purchased
Companies through the assumption of liabilities and the issuance of Common
Stock.
Reclassifications. Certain prior year amounts have been reclassified to
conform with 1998 presentations. These reclassifications had no impact on net
income or stockholders' equity.
Segment Reporting. In 1998, the Company adopted SFAS 131, Disclosures
about Segments of an Enterprise and Related Information. SFAS 131 supersedes
SFAS 14, Financial Reporting for Segments of a Business Enterprise, replacing
the industry segment approach with the managementapproach. The management
approach designates the internal organization that is used by management for
making operating decisions and assessing performance as the source of the
Company reportable segments. SFAS 131 also requires disclosures about products
and services, geographic areas, and major customers. The adoption of

FAS 131 did not affect results of operations or financial position but did
affect the disclosure of segment information. See Note 12.
Comprehensive Income. SFAS No. 130, Reporting Comprehensive Income. In
June 1997, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued SFAS No. 130,
effective for fiscal periods beginning after December 15, 1997. The new standard
requires that comprehensive income, which includes net income as well as certain
changes in assets and liabilities recorded in common equity, be reported in the
financial statements. The Company adopted SFAS No. 130 during the year ended
December 31, 1998. For the years ended December 31, 1998, 1997 and 1996 there
were no components of comprehensive income other than net income.
Employee Benefits Disclosures. SFAS No. 132, Employers' Disclosures about
Pensions and Other Postretirement Benefits. In February 1998, the Financial
Accounting Standards Board issued SFAS No. 132 which is effective for periods
ending after December 15, 1998. The new standard revises employers' disclosures
about pensions and other postretirement benefits. For the years ended December
31, 1998, 1997 and 1996, there was no impact on the Company financial
statements.
SFAS No. 133, Accounting for Derivative Investments and Hedging
Activities. SFAS No. 133 is effective for all fiscal quarters of fiscal years
beginning after June 15, 1999. This statement establishes accounting and
reporting standards for derivative instruments and hedging activities. The
Company does not maintain any derivative investments nor does it conduct any
hedging activities, therefore, SFAS 133 is not expected to impact the Company.

Upon the consummation of the IPO and the acquisition of the Acquired
Companies, MMR and certain of the Acquired Companies which were S-Corporations
collectively, the S-Corporations terminated their S-Corporation status.
Accordingly, current and deferred income taxes reflecting the tax effects of
temporary differences between the Company financial statement tax bases of
certain assets and liabilities became assets and liabilities of the Company.
Accordingly, the above provisions for 1998 and 1997 income taxes include a
$548,000 and $650,000, respectively, nonrecurring benefit resulting from the
termination of the S-Corporation election and the corresponding required
adoption of SFAS 109.
The significant components of deferred tax assets liabilities as of

12. SEGMENT REPORTING
In 1998, the Company adopted SFAS 131. The segment information below
presents the Company three reportable segments -- 1 Research & Development,
2 Sales & Marketing and 3 Dealer Network, which represents the Company-owned
dealers.
The Company is organized primarily on the basis of the production,
distribution and service processes broken into nine production or distribution
units. Six of the distribution and service units have been aggregated into the
Dealer Network segment. These units derive their revenue from the sale and
service of The Medical Manager software. The Sales & Marketing unit consists
of a single distribution and service unit and derives its revenue from the sale,
licensing and distribution of The Medical Manager software to the Dealer Network
segment and the independent dealer network. Two of the production units have
been aggregated to form the Research & Development segment. These units derive
their revenue primarily from license royalties fees for The Medical Manager
software and other software packages.
The accounting policies of the segments are the same as those described in
footnote 2. Segment data includes intersegment revenues. Revenues and net income
reported in the Research & Development segment and the Sales & Marketing segment
are derived primarily from intersegment sales. The Dealer Network segment
purchases software and licenses from the Sales & Marketing segment, which
recognizes these sales as revenue. The Research & Development segment then
collects royalties from the Sales & Marketing segment as it primary source of
revenues. Sales to the Dealer Network segment by the Sales & Marketing segment
are made at the same wholesale price sold to independent dealers. Royalties to
the Research & Development segment are based on royalty agreements with Sales &
Marketing. The Company evaluates the performance of all three of its segments
based on revenues and net income, and additionally, it evaluates the Dealer
Network on operating margins.
The table below presents information about reported segments and the
reconciliation of total segment information to the consolidated information as
reflected on the accompanying financial statements for the years ending December
31, 1998, 1997 and 1996 in thousands:

13. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS
A class action lawsuit was brought against the Company alleging Year 2000
issues regarding The Medical Manager software in versions prior to Version 90.
Seven additional lawsuits were also brought against the Company, each purporting
to sue on behalf of those similarly situated and raising essentially the same
issues. In December 1998, the Company preliminarily entered into an agreement to
settle the class action lawsuit, as well as five of the seven other similar
cases. The settlement created a settlement class of all purchasers of Version 7
and 8 and upgrades to Version 9 of The Medical Manager software, and released
the Company from Year 2000 claims arising out of the sales of these version of
the Company product. Under the terms of the settlement, Version 812,
containing the Company upgraded Version of 811 software in addition to the
Year 2000 patch, will be licensed without a license fee to Version 7 and 8 users
who participate in the settlement. In addition, the settlement also provides
that participating users who purchased a Version 9 upgrade will have the option
to obtain one of four optional modules from the Company without a license fee,
or to elect to take a share of a settlement cash fund. The settlement required
the Company to make a cash payment of $1455 million. See Note 14.
The Company has received notice of a lawsuit which was filed against the
Company and certain of its officers and directors, among other parties, on
October 23, 1998 in the United States District Court for the Middle District of
Florida. The lawsuit, styled George Ehlert, et al. vs. Michael A. Singer, et
al., purports to bring an action on behalf of the plaintiffs and others
similarly situated to recover damages for alleged violations of the federal
securities laws and Florida laws arising out of the Company issuance of
allegedly materially false and misleading statements concerning its business
operations, including the development and sale of its principal product, during
the class period. An amended complaint was served on March 2, 1999. The class
period is alleged to be between April 23, 1998 and August 5, 1998. The lawsuit
seeks, among other things, compensatory damages in favor of the plaintiffs and
the other purported class members and reasonable

costs and expenses. The Company believes that this lawsuit is without merit and
intends to vigorously defend against it.
The Company is from time to time involved in other routine litigation
incidental to the conduct of its business. The Company believes that no such
currently pending routine litigation to which it is party will have a material
adverse effect on its financial condition or results of operations.
14. SUBSEQUENT EVENTS
Subsequent to December 31, 1998, the Company executed and closed agreements
to acquire the following resellers of The Medical Manager software: i Advanced
Medical Office Systems, Inc. d/b/a I.E. Corporation, based in Stockton,
California, ii Specialized Computer Systems, Inc., based in DuBois,
Pennsylvania and iii Shared Business Services, Inc., based in Clearwater,
Florida. The acquisitions were accounted for using the pooling of interests
method of accounting. The aggregate consideration paid was 98,911 shares of
Common Stock. These acquisitions, in aggregate, had revenues of $24 million and
net income of $03 million for the year ended December 31, 1998. The
acquisitions closed on February 26, 1999 and March 17, 1999.
The settlement of the Company Year 2000 class action lawsuit was approved
by the District Court of New Jersey on March 15, 1999. Pursuant to the
settlement, the Company was released from liability due to the Year 2000
non-compliance of Versions 7 and 8 by all users of Versions 7 and 8 except 29
users who opted-out of the class settlement.
