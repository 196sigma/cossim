REPORT OF INDEPENDENT PUBLIC ACCOUNTANTS
To American Residential Services, Inc.   We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of American
Residential Services, Inc. a Delaware corporation and subsidiaries as of
December 31, 1995 and 1996, and the related consolidated statements of
operations, stockholders' equity and cash flows for each of the three years in
the period ended December 31, 1996. These consolidated financial statements are
the responsibility of the Company management. Our responsibility is to express
an opinion on these consolidated financial statements based on our audits.
We conducted our audits in accordance with generally accepted auditing
standards. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are
free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis,
evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial
statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and
significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall
financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a
reasonable basis for our opinion.
In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above
present fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated financial position of
American Residential Services, Inc., and subsidiaries as of December 31, 1995
and 1996, and the consolidated results of their operations and their cash flows
for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 1996, in conformity
with generally accepted accounting principles.
As discussed in Note 1, the accompanying consolidated financial statements
reflect the Company on a historical basis with Atlas Services, Inc. as the
accounting acquiror.

AMERICAN RESIDENTIAL SERVICES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
1. BASIS OF PRESENTATION   In October 1995, American Residential Services, Inc. ARS or the
Company was founded to create a leading national provider of i
comprehensive maintenance, repair and replacement services for heating,
ventilation and air conditioning, plumbing, electrical and other systems in
homes and small commercial buildings and ii new installation of those systems
in homes and small commercial facilities under construction. On September 27,
1996, ARS acquired in separate transactions seven residential service businesses
together with Enterprises Holding Company EHC, which is the common parent
of two of the businesses, the Founding Companies in exchange for
consideration consisting of a combination of cash and shares of its common
stock, par value $001 per share the Common Stock. The Company initial
public offering the Offering of ARS Common Stock closed simultaneously
with the closing of the acquisitions.
For financial statement presentation purposes, Atlas Services, Inc.
Atlas, one of the Founding Companies, has been identified as the accounting
acquiror. The acquisition of the remaining Founding Companies was accounted for
using the purchase method of accounting, with the results of operations included
from September 30, 1996, the effective closing date of the acquisitions for
accounting purposes. The allocation of purchase price to the assets acquired and
liabilities assumed has been initially assigned and recorded based on
preliminary estimates of fair value and may be revised as additional information
concerning the valuation of such assets and liabilities becomes available. The
accompanying consolidated financial statements reflect the Company on a
historical basis with Atlas as the accounting acquiror.
During the fourth quarter of 1996, ARS acquired an additional 13
residential service businesses the Purchased Companies which were also
accounted for using the purchase method of accounting. The Founding Companies
and Purchased Companies are referred to herein collectively as the Acquired
Businesses.
In connection with the purchase of EHC, the purchase price paid to the
shareholders of EHC in excess of the purchase price paid by EHC for its previous
acquisition of Service Enterprises, Inc. and Adcot, Inc. is recorded as
nonrecurring compensation expense of $3,356,000 and financing fees of $4,818,000
in the accompanying statements of operations for the year ended December 31,
1996.
2. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES  PRINCIPLES OF CONSOLIDATION
The accompanying consolidated financial statements include the accounts of
ARS and its wholly owned subsidiaries. All significant intercompany accounts and
transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.
CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS
The Company considers all highly liquid debt instruments purchased with an
original maturity of three months or less to be cash equivalents.
INVENTORIES
Inventories consist of parts and supplies held for use in the ordinary
course of business and are valued at the lower of cost or market using
principally a weighted-average method.
36
AMERICAN RESIDENTIAL SERVICES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS -- CONTINUED
PROPERTY AND EQUIPMENT
Property and equipment are recorded at cost, and depreciation is computed
using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets.
Leasehold improvements are capitalized and amortized over the lesser of the life
of the lease or the estimated useful life of the asset.
Expenditures for repairs and maintenance are charged to expense when
incurred. Expenditures for major renewals and betterments, which extend the
useful lives of existing equipment, are capitalized and depreciated. Upon
retirement or disposition of property or equipment, the cost and related
accumulated depreciation are removed from the accounts and any resulting gain or
loss is recognized in the statements of operations.
Included in property and equipment are certain assets subject to capital
leases. These assets are amortized using the straight-line method over the
lesser of the life of the leases or the estimated useful life of the asset.
GOODWILL
Goodwill represents the excess of the aggregate purchase price paid by the
Company in the acquisition of businesses accounted for as purchases over the
fair market value of the net assets acquired. Goodwill is amortized on a
straight-line basis over 40 years. As of December 31, 1996, accumulated
amortization was approximately $584,000.
The Company periodically evaluates the recoverability of intangibles
resulting from business acquisitions and measures the amount of impairment, if
any, by assessing current and future levels of income and cash flows as well as
other factors, such as business trends and prospects and market and economic
conditions.
DEBT ISSUE COSTS
Debt issue costs related to the Company Credit Facility see Note 7 are
included in other noncurrent assets and are amortized to interest expense over
the scheduled maturity of the debt. As of December 31, 1996, accumulated
amortization was approximately $49,000.
REVENUE RECOGNITION
The Company recognizes revenue when the services are performed except when
work is being performed under a construction contract. Revenues on residential
and commercial service and maintenance contracts are recorded and collected
monthly. Revenues from sales of extended warranties are recognized over the life
of the warranty on a straight-line basis.
Revenues from construction contracts are recognized on a
percentage-of-completion method measured primarily on the basis of percentage of
costs incurred to total estimated costs for each contract. Provisions for the
total estimated losses on uncompleted contracts are made in the period in which
such losses are determined. Changes in job performance, job conditions,
estimated profitability and final contract settlements may result in revisions
to costs and income and are recognized in the period in which the revisions are
determined.
WARRANTY COSTS
The Company typically warrants labor for the first year after installation
on new air conditioning and heating units. The Company also generally warrants
labor for 30 days after servicing of existing air conditioning and heating
units. An allowance for warranty costs is recorded upon completion of
installation or service.
37
AMERICAN RESIDENTIAL SERVICES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS -- CONTINUED
STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION
The disclosure requirements of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards
No. 123 SFAS No. 123, Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation, are
effective for transactions entered into in fiscal years that begin after
December 15, 1995. This statement encourages entities to account for employee
stock option or similar equity instruments using a fair value approach for all
such plans. However, it also allows an entity to continue to measure
compensation costs for those plans using the method prescribed by APB Opinion
No. 25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees. Those entities which elect
to remain with the accounting in APB No. 25 are required to include pro forma
disclosures of net income and earnings per share as if the fair value-based
method of accounting had been applied. The Company has elected to account for
such plans under the provisions of APB No. 25. Therefore, there is no effect on
the Company financial position and results of operations as a result of this
pronouncement. Reference is made to Note 8 for the SFAS No123 disclosures.
INCOME TAXES
The Company files a consolidated federal income tax return, which includes
the operations of all acquired businesses for periods subsequent to the
respective date of acquisition. Acquired companies each file a short period
federal income tax return through their respective acquisition date.
The Company follows the liability method of accounting for income taxes in
accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards SFAS No. 109.
Under this method, deferred income taxes are recorded based upon differences
between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities and are
measured using the enacted tax rates and laws that will be in effect when the
underlying assets or liabilities are recovered or settled.
USE OF ESTIMATES
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally
accepted accounting principles requires the use of estimates and assumptions by
management in determining the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and
disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial
statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the
reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.
NEW ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENT
Effective January 1, 1995, the Company adopted SFAS No. 121, Accounting
for the Impairment of Long-Lived Assets and for Long-Lived Assets to Be Disposed
Of. Accordingly, in the event that facts and circumstances indicate that
property and equipment, and intangible or other assets, may be impaired, an
evaluation of recoverability would be performed. If an evaluation is required,
the estimated future undiscounted cash flows associated with the asset is
compared to the asset carrying amount to determine if a write-down to market
value or discounted cash flow value was necessary. Adoption of this standard did
not have a material effect on the financial position or results of operations of
the Company.

fourth quarter of 1996, the Company acquired the Purchased Companies for an
aggregate of approximately $412 million in cash and short-term notes and
1,282,910 shares of Common Stock. Funding of the cash portion of the purchase
prices and repayment of indebtedness assumed in connection with the acquisitions
was provided by borrowings under the Company Credit Facility. The accompanying
consolidated balance sheet includes preliminary allocations of the respective
purchase price which are subject to final adjustment. Also, the purchase price

and therefore revenues, costs of sales, selling, general and administrative
expenses, other income and expense, and income taxes exclude amounts associated
with the discontinued division. Revenues from this division were approximately
$29 million from the date of acquisition by ARS through December 31, 1996.
Certain expenses have been allocated to discontinued operations, which were
allocated based upon estimated divisional usage. All assets of the operations
are expected to be sold in 1997.

On March 3, 1997, the Company increased the total commitment of its credit
facility the Credit Facility from $55 million, which was in place at
December 31, 1996, to $100 million. The Credit Facility provides the Company
with a revolving line of credit up to $100 million, which may be used for
general corporate purposes, including the funding of any cash that may be paid
in connection with acquisitions, the refinancing of indebtedness of businesses
acquired, capital expenditures and working capital. Loans under the Credit
Facility bear interest, at the Company option, at the designated variable base
rate plus margins ranging from 0 to 50 basis points, or at a designated London
interbank offering rate LIBOR plus a margin ranging from 100 to 200 basis
points, depending on the ratio of the Company interest-bearing debt to its
trailing earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization. The
margin is reset on a quarterly basis and also may be reset upon the closing of
an acquisition involving cash consideration in excess of $5 million or upon a
principal repayment in excess of $5 million. Commitment fees of 30 to 50 basis
points per annum are payable on the unused portion of the line of credit. The
Credit Facility contains a sublimit for standby letters of credit of up to $50
million. The Credit Facility also requires the consent of the lenders for
acquisitions exceeding a certain level of cash consideration, prohibits the
payment of dividends by the Company except for dividends payable in Common
Stock and certain preferred stock, does not permit the

Company to incur or assume other indebtedness in excess of 5% of consolidated
net worth and will require the Company to comply with certain financial
covenants. The Credit Facility will terminate and all amounts outstanding, if
any, thereunder will be due and payable in September 1999. The Company
subsidiaries have guaranteed the repayment of all amounts due under the Credit
Facility. ARS has also pledged the stock of its subsidiaries to guarantee
repayment of the indebtedness under the Credit Facility. As of December 31,
1996, the Company had $272 million in outstanding borrowings under the Credit
Facility, bearing interest at a weighted average rate of approximately 740%.
Prime rate at December 31, 1996 was 825%. LIBOR rates were 550%, 553 556% and 559% for the 30 day, 60 day, 90 day and 180 day LIBOR, respectively.
The aggregate maturities of long-term debt as of December 31, 1996 are as

8. STOCK OPTIONS AND WARRANTS  STOCK OPTIONS
The Company has approved a 1996 Incentive Plan the Plan, which amended
and restated a prior stock option plan and provides for the granting or awarding
of stock options and stock appreciation rights to non-employee directors,
officers and other key employees and independent contractors. The Company
accounts for this Plan under APB Opinion No. 25, and no compensation expense has
been recognized. The number of shares authorized and reserved for issuance under
the Plan is limited to the greater of 1,550,000 shares or 15 percent of the
number of shares of Common Stock outstanding on the last day of the preceding
calendar quarter 1,550,000 shares at December 31, 1996. In general, the terms
of the option awards including vesting schedules will be established by the
Compensation Committee of the Company Board of Directors. As of December 31,
1996, the Company has granted 10 year options covering an aggregate of 1,504,500
shares of Common Stock.
The following table summarizes activity under the Plan for the year ended

At December 31, 1996, no option shares were exercisable. Unexercised
options expire at various dates from January 2006 through December 2006.
If the Company had recorded compensation cost for the Plan consistent with
SFAS No. 123, net loss and loss per share would have been increased by the
following pro forma amounts in thousands, except per share data                      YEAR ENDED

Net Loss:

Loss Per Share:

Pro forma.    $ 200
The pro forma compensation cost may not be representative of that to be
expected in future years because options vest over several years and additional
awards may be made each year.
The fair value of each option grant is estimated on the date of grant using
the Black-Scholes option pricing model, with the following weighted average
assumptions used for grants in 1996: dividend yield of 0%; expected volatility
of 3219%; risk-free interest rate of 672%; and expected lives of 10 years.
STOCK WARRANT
During 1996, the Company issued a warrant to purchase 100,000 shares of
Common Stock exercisable at $1500 per share. The warrant is exercisable, in
whole or in part, at any time until September 27, 2001. The number of shares
represented by the warrant is subject to adjustment for stock dividends, stock
splits and similar events.

11. COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES  LITIGATION
The Company is involved in legal actions arising in the ordinary course of
business. Management does not believe that the outcome of such legal actions
will have a material adverse effect on the Company financial position or
consolidated results of operations.
INSURANCE
The Company carries a broad range of insurance coverage, including general
and business auto liability, commercial property, workers' compensation and a
general umbrella policy. During the fourth quarter of 1996, the Company
established a self-insurance retention program for a portion of its medical
claims. The Company is now responsible for the first $75,000 per employee of
medical claims filed under its medical insurance policy. In addition, the
Company established a self-insurance retention program for damages to
Company-owned vehicles. The accrued insurance claims payable represents
management estimate of the Company potential claims costs in satisfying the
self-insurance retention for claims occurring through December 31, 1996. The
accrual is based on known facts and historical trends, and management believes
such accrual to be adequate.
12. EMPLOYEE BENEFIT PLANS   Prior to the Offering, Atlas maintained a defined contribution
profit-sharing plan which covered substantially all employees. Atlas
contributions during the years ended 1994 and 1995 and the nine months ended
September 30, 1996 were $42,000, $21,000 and $35,000, respectively.
On September 26, 1996, effective with the Offering, the Company established
a defined contribution profit-sharing plan which qualifies under Section 401k
of the Internal Revenue Code. Participation in the plan is available to
substantially all employees. Eligible employees may contribute up to the lesser
of 15 percent of their annual compensation or the maximum amount permitted under
IRS regulations to their 401k account. The Company matches the contributions
of participating employees on the basis of the percentages specified in the
plan. Company matching contributions to this plan, which may be invested in the
Common Stock, were approximately $91,000 in 1996. The Company also may make
additional discretionary contributions.

AMERICAN RESIDENTIAL SERVICES, INC.
NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
1. BUSINESS AND ORGANIZATION   American Residential Services, Inc. ARS or the Company, was founded on
October 24, 1995 to create a leading national provider of i comprehensive
maintenance, repair and replacement services for heating, ventilating and air
conditioning, plumbing, electrical, and other systems in homes and commercial
buildings and ii new installation services of those systems in homes and
commercial facilities under construction. ARS intends to acquire seven local and
regional residential services companies the Acquisitions, complete an initial
public offering the Offering of its common stock and, subsequent to the
Offering, continue to acquire, through merger or purchase, similar companies to
expand its national and regional operations. In June 1996, ARS filed a
registration on Form S-1 for the sale of its common stock.
ARS primary assets at December 31, 1995 and June 30, 1996 are cash and
deferred offering costs. ARS has not conducted any operations, and all
activities to date have related to the Acquisitions and the Offering. Cash of
$1,000 was generated from the initial capitalization of the Company see Note
4. There is no assurance that the Acquisitions discussed below will be
completed and that ARS will be able to generate future operating revenues.
Funding for the deferred offering costs has been provided by Equus II
Incorporated Equus II. ARS is dependent upon the Offering to fund the amounts
due to Equus II, the pending acquisitions and future operations.
2. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES  PROPERTY AND EQUIPMENT
Property and equipment are stated at cost, and depreciation is computed
using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets.
Expenditures for repairs and maintenance are charged to expense when
incurred. Expenditures for major renewals and betterments, which extend the
useful lives of existing equipment, are capitalized and depreciated. Upon
retirement or disposition of property and equipment, the cost and related
accumulated depreciation are removed from the accounts and any resulting gain or
loss is recognized in the statements of operations.
INCOME TAXES
The Company follows the liability method of accounting for income taxes in
accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards SFAS No. 109.
Under this method, deferred income taxes are recorded based upon differences
between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities and are
measured using the enacted tax rates and laws that will be in effect when the
underlying assets or liabilities are received or settled.
The Company has recorded a full valuation allowance against all deferred
tax assets due to the uncertainty of ultimate realizability. Accordingly, no
income tax benefit has been recorded for current year losses.
USE OF ESTIMATES
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally
accepted accounting principles requires the use of estimates and assumptions by
management in determining the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and
disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial
statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the
reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.
CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS
The Company considers all highly liquid debt instruments purchased with an
original maturity of three months or less to be cash equivalents.

NEW ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS
Effective January 1, 1996, the Company adopted SFAS No. 121, Accounting
for the Impairment of Long-Lived Assets and for Long-Lived Assets to Be Disposed
Of. Accordingly, in the event that facts and circumstances indicate that
property and equipment, and intangible or other assets, may be impaired, an
evaluation of recoverability would be performed. If an evaluation is required,
the estimated future cash flows associated with the asset is compared to the
asset carrying amount to determine if a write-down to market value or
discounted cash flow value was necessary. Adoption of this standard did not have
a material effect on the financial position or results of operations of the
Company.
As of January 1, 1996, SFAS No. 123, Accounting for Stock-Based
Compensation, will be effective for the Company. SFAS No. 123 permits, but
does not require, a fair value-based method of accounting for employee stock
option plans which results in compensation expense recognition when stock
options are granted. As permitted by SFAS No. 123, the Company will provide pro
forma disclosure of net income and earnings per share, as applicable, in the
notes to future consolidated financial statements.

4. SHAREHOLDERS' DEFICIT   In connection with the organization and initial capitalization of ARS, the
Company issued 1,000 shares of common stock for $1,000 see Note 7.
5. COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES  BONUS AWARDS
In June 1996, the Board of Directors granted certain key employees
incentive cash bonus awards for 1996 which are based, subject to the overall
performance of the Company, on the performance of the Common Stock after the
Offering as compared to the performance of each of the stocks included in the
Standard & Poor 500 Stock Index the S 500. The amount of each award will
be determined by multiplying the officer annual base salary by a percentage
determined by ranking the Common Stock price performance, including reinvested
dividends, if any Total Stockholder Return, among Total Stockholder Returns of
all the stocks in the S 500.
6. RELATED PARTY TRANSACTION   The Company has signed a definitive agreement to acquire Enterprises
Holding Company EHC, a related company through common ownership, to be
effective with the Offering. EHC will be acquired for a total consideration,
subject to a working capital adjustment, consisting of 378,400 shares of Common
Stock and the assumption and/or repayment of approximately $173 million of
indebtedness and other obligations including $26 million of EHC preferred
stock being converted into 137,139 shares of Common Stock and $05 million
cash, approximately $143 million of which will be repaid either out of a
portion of the net proceeds of the Offering or through bank borrowings.
7. CAPITAL STOCK, STOCK OPTIONS AND WARRANTS   ARS effected a 333-for-one-stock split on February 2, 1996, and an
approximately 135 for-one-stock split on June 14, 1996 of its common stock for
each share of common stock then outstanding. In addition, on February 2, 1996,
authorized shares were increased from 1,000 to 50,000,000. The effects of the
common stock dividends have been retroactively reflected on the balance sheet
and in the accompanying notes.

The Company has approved the 1996 Incentive Plan the Plan, which amends
and restates the 1996 Stock Option Plan and provides for the granting or
awarding of stock options and stock appreciation rights to nonemployee
directors, officers and other key employees including officers of the Founding
Companies and independent contractors. The number of shares authorized and
reserved for issuance under the Plan is limited to the greater of 1,550,000
shares or 15 percent of the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding on the
last day of the preceding calendar quarter. In general, the terms of the option
awards including vesting schedules will be established by the Compensation
Committee of the Company Board of Directors. As of September 9, 1996, the
Company has granted 10 year options covering an aggregate of 1,445,000 shares of
common stock. Management believes the option price of the options granted is
equal to or in excess of the market value of the stock at the date of grant.

ARS and separate wholly owned subsidiaries have signed definitive
agreements to acquire by merger seven companies the Founding Companies to be
effective with the Offering. The Founding Companies are General Heating
Engineering Company, Inc.; Atlas Services, Inc., and Subsidiary; Service
Enterprises, Inc. and subsidiaries Crown; Florida Heating and Air
Conditioning, Inc., and Related Companies; DIAL ONE Meridian and Hoosier, Inc.;
ADCOT, Inc. A-ABC; and Climatic Corporation of Vero Beach. Crown and A-ABC
will be acquired indirectly through the direct acquisition of their parent
corporation, EHC. The aggregate consideration that will be paid by ARS to
acquire the Founding Companies is, subject to working capital adjustments,
approximately $348 million in cash and 2,805,065 shares of ARS common stock
based on an assumed initial public offering price of $15 per share, the
midpoint of the estimated initial public offering price range.
On March 19, 1996, the Company issued to Equus II a warrant to purchase
100,000 shares of Common Stock exercisable at the Offering price. The warrants
are exercisable at any time after the closing of the Offering of the Company
until five years from such date. The number of shares represented by the warrant
is subject to adjustment for stock dividends and stock splits.
Subsequent to December 31, 1995, the Company has incurred additional costs,
including professional fees and travel, associated with the acquisition of the
Founding Companies and the Offering. Accordingly, accrued liabilities and
amounts due to Equus II have increased to approximately $12 million as of June
30, 1996. A portion of this note will be converted into 844,965 shares of ARS
Common Stock in connection with the Offering.
8. EVENTS SUBSEQUENT TO DATE OF REPORT OF INDEPENDENT PUBLIC ACCOUNTANTS
UNAUDITED   On September 27, 1996, ARS completed the Offering, which involved the

purchase prices relating to the acquisitions of the Founding Companies. The
Company also has paid to the former owners approximately $47 million as working
capital adjustments of which approximately $18 million was paid in the fourth
quarter of 1996. In addition, a portion of the Equus II note was converted to
844,965 shares of ARS Common Stock.

replacement of air conditioning, heating and fireplace systems in new and
preexisting residential and commercial buildings in Washington, D.C. and the

public offering the Offering of the common stock of ARS.
2. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES  INTERIM FINANCIAL INFORMATION
The interim financial statements for the nine months ended September 30,
1995 and 1996 are unaudited and certain information and footnote disclosures,
normally included in financial statements prepared in accordance with generally
accepted accounting principles, have been omitted. In the opinion of management,
all adjustments, consisting only of normal recurring adjustments, necessary to
fairly present the results of operations and cash flows with respect to the
interim financial statements, have been included. The results of operations for
the interim periods are not necessarily indicative of the results for the entire
fiscal year.
INVENTORIES
Inventories consist of duct materials, air conditioning equipment,
refrigeration supplies and accessories held for use in the ordinary course of
business and are valued at the lower of cost or market using the average cost
method.
PROPERTY AND EQUIPMENT
Property and equipment are recorded at cost, and depreciation is computed
using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of assets.
Leasehold improvements are capitalized and amortized over the lesser of the life
of the lease or the estimated useful life of the asset.
Expenditures for repairs and maintenance are charged to expense when
incurred. Expenditures for major renewals and betterments, which extend the
useful lives of existing equipment, are capitalized and depreciated. Upon
retirement or disposition of property and equipment, the cost and related
accumulated depreciation are removed from the accounts and any resulting gain or
loss is recognized in the statements of operations.
REVENUE RECOGNITION
The Company recognizes revenue when the services are performed except when
work is being performed under a construction contract. Revenues from the sale of
residential and commercial service and maintenance contracts are recognized over
the life of the contract on a straight-line basis.
Revenues from construction contracts are recognized on the
percentage-of-completion method measured by the percentage of costs incurred to
total estimated costs for each contract. Provisions for the total estimated
losses on uncompleted contracts are made in the period in which such losses are
determined. Changes in job performance, job conditions, estimated profitability
and final contract settlements may result in revisions to costs and income and
are recognized in the period in which the revisions are determined.

WARRANTY COSTS
The Company warrants labor for the first year after installation on new air
conditioning and heating units. A reserve for warranty costs is recorded upon
completion of installation or service.
INCOME TAXES
The Company has elected S Corporation status as defined by the Internal
Revenue Code, whereby the Company is not subject to taxation for federal
purposes. Under S Corporation status, each shareholder reports his share of the
Company taxable earnings or losses in his personal federal and state tax
returns.
USE OF ESTIMATES
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally
accepted accounting principles requires the use of estimates and assumptions by
management in determining the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and
disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial
statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the
reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.
CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS
The Company considers all highly liquid debt instruments purchased with
original maturities of three months or less to be cash equivalents.
NEW ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENT
Effective January 1, 1995, the Company adopted Statement of Financial
Accounting Standards SFAS No. 121, Accounting for the Impairment of
Long-Lived Assets and for Long-Lived Assets to Be Disposed Of. Accordingly, in
the event that facts and circumstances indicate that property and equipment, and
intangible or other assets, may be impaired, an evaluation of recoverability
would be performed. If an evaluation is required, the estimated future
undiscounted cash flows associated with the asset is compared to the asset
carrying amount to determine if a write-down to market value or discounted cash
flow value was necessary. Adoption of this standard did not have a material
effect on the financial position or results of operations of the Company.

operations, shareholders' equity and cash flows for each of the three years in
the period ended June 30, 1995, and the year ended December 31, 1995. These
consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the Company
management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated
financial statements based on our audits.
We conducted our audits in accordance with generally accepted auditing
standards. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are
free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis,
evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial
statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and
significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall
financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a
reasonable basis for our opinion.
In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above
present fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated financial position
of Atlas Services, Inc., and subsidiary as of June 30, 1994 and 1995, and
December 31, 1995, and the consolidated results of their operations and their

ATLAS SERVICES, INC., AND SUBSIDIARY
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
1. BUSINESS AND ORGANIZATION   Atlas Services, Inc., a South Carolina corporation and subsidiary the
Company, are primarily engaged in the installation and maintenance, repair and
replacement of plumbing, air conditioning and heating and electrical systems in
new and preexisting residential and commercial buildings throughout South
Carolina.
The Company and its shareholders intend to enter into a definitive
agreement with American Residential Services, Inc. ARS, pursuant to which all
outstanding shares of the Company common stock will be exchanged for cash and
shares of ARS common stock concurrent with the consummation of the initial
public offering the Offering of the common stock of ARS.
2. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES  BASIS OF PRESENTATION
The consolidated financial statements include the accounts and results of
operations of Atlas Services, Inc., and its wholly owned subsidiary. All
significant intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated in
consolidation.
INTERIM FINANCIAL INFORMATION
The interim consolidated financial statements for the nine months ended
September 30, 1995 and 1996 are unaudited, and certain information and footnote
disclosures, normally included in financial statements prepared in accordance
with generally accepted accounting principles, have been omitted. In the opinion
of management, all adjustments, consisting only of normal recurring adjustments,
necessary to fairly present the results of operations and cash flows with
respect to the consolidated interim financial statements, have been included.
The results of operations for the interim periods are not necessarily indicative
of the results for the entire fiscal year.
INVENTORIES
Inventories consist of parts and supplies held for use in the ordinary
course of business and are valued at the lower of cost or market using the
weighted-average method.
PROPERTY AND EQUIPMENT
Property and equipment are recorded at cost, and depreciation is computed
using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets.
Leasehold improvements are capitalized and amortized over the lesser of the life
of the lease or the estimated useful life of the asset.
Expenditures for repairs and maintenance are charged to expense when
incurred. Expenditures for major renewals and betterments, which extend the
useful lives of existing equipment, are capitalized and depreciated. Upon
retirement or disposition of property or equipment, the cost and related
accumulated depreciation are removed from the accounts and any resulting gain or
loss is recognized in the statements of operations.
Included in property and equipment are certain assets subject to capital
leases. These assets are amortized using the straight-line method over the
lesser of the life of the leases or the estimated useful life of the asset.
REVENUE RECOGNITION
The Company recognizes revenue when the services are performed except when
work is being performed under a construction contract. Revenues on residential
and commercial service and maintenance contracts are recorded and collected
monthly. Revenues from sales of extended warranties are recognized over the life
of the contract on a straight-line basis.
73
ATLAS SERVICES, INC., AND SUBSIDIARY
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS -- CONTINUED
Revenues from construction contracts are recognized on the
percentage-of-completion method measured by the percentage of costs incurred to
total estimated costs for each contract. Provisions for the total estimated
losses on uncompleted contracts are made in the period in which such losses are
determined. Changes in job performance, job conditions, estimated profitability
and final contract settlements may result in revisions to costs and income and
are recognized in the period in which the revisions are determined.
WARRANTY COSTS
The Company warrants labor for the first year after installation on new air
conditioning and heating units. The Company generally warrants labor for 30 days
after servicing of existing air conditioning and heating units. A reserve for
warranty costs is recorded upon completion of installation or service.
INCOME TAXES
The Company follows the liability method of accounting for income taxes in
accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards SFAS No. 109.
Under this method, deferred income taxes are recorded based upon differences
between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities and are
measured using the enacted tax rates and laws that will be in effect when the
underlying assets or liabilities are recovered or settled.
STOCK-SPLIT
During 1995, the Company effected a ten-for-one stock split of the
Company Common Stock.
USE OF ESTIMATES
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally
accepted accounting principles requires the use of estimates and assumptions by
management in determining the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and
disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial
statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the
reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.
CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS
The Company considers all highly liquid debt instruments purchased with an
original maturity of three months or less to be cash equivalents.
NEW ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENT
Effective January 1, 1995, the Company adopted SFAS No. 121, Accounting
for the Impairment of Long-Lived Assets and for Long-Lived Assets to Be Disposed
Of. Accordingly, in the event that facts and circumstances indicate that
property and equipment, and intangible or other assets, may be impaired, an
evaluation of recoverability would be performed. If an evaluation is required,
the estimated future undiscounted cash flows associated with the asset is
compared to the asset carrying amount to determine if a write-down to market
value or discounted cash flow value was necessary. Adoption of this standard did
not have a material effect on the financial position or results of operations of
the Company.

1. BUSINESS AND ORGANIZATION   Enterprises Holding Company EHC or the Company a Texas corporation,
and subsidiaries was formed February 16, 1996 solely for the purpose of
acquiring the operations of Service Enterprises, Inc. SEI and subsidiaries.
On March 19, 1996, EHC acquired all of the outstanding stock of SEI and
certain real estate owned by the former shareholder of SEI for $17,500,000. See
SEI financial statements elsewhere herein. SEI is primarily engaged in the
maintenance, repair and replacement service-related activities of plumbing, air
conditioning, electrical repair and other home improvement services in Houston
and the surrounding areas.
On May 28, 1996, SEI purchased all of the outstanding common stock of
ADCOT, Inc. ADCOT for $2,000,000. See ADCOT financial statements included
elsewhere herein.
In June 1996, EHC entered into a definitive agreement with American
Residential Services, Inc. ARS, pursuant to which EHC will be acquired by ARS.
All outstanding shares of EHC common stock and preferred stock will be
exchanged for cash and shares of ARS common stock concurrent with the
consummation of the initial public offering of the common stock of ARS.
2. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES  BASIS OF PRESENTATION
The consolidated financial statements include the accounts and results of
operations of Enterprises Holding Company and its wholly owned subsidiaries. All
significant intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated in
consolidation.
INTERIM FINANCIAL INFORMATION
The interim consolidated financial statements for the period from
inception, February 16, 1996, through September 30, 1996 are unaudited. In the
opinion of management, all adjustments, consisting only of normal recurring
adjustments, necessary to fairly present the financial position, results of
operations and cash flows with respect to the consolidated interim financial
statements, have been included. The results of operations for the interim
periods are not necessarily indicative of the results for the entire fiscal
year.
INVENTORIES
Inventories consist of parts and service related supplies held for use in
the ordinary course of business and are valued at the lower of cost or market
using the first-in, first-out FIFO method.
PROPERTY AND EQUIPMENT
Property and equipment are recorded at cost, and depreciation is computed
using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets.
Leasehold improvements are capitalized and amortized over the lesser of the
lease life or the estimated useful life of the asset.
Expenditures for repairs and maintenance are charged to expense when
incurred. Expenditures for major renewals and betterments, which extend the
useful lives of existing equipment, are capitalized and depreciated. Upon
retirement or disposition of property and equipment, the cost and related
accumulated depreciation are removed from the accounts and any resulting gain or
loss is recognized in the statements of operations.

EXCESS OF PURCHASE PRICE OVER FAIR VALUE OF NET ASSET ACQUIRED
The excess of the aggregate purchase price paid by the Company in the
acquisition of businesses, accounted for as a purchase, over the fair market
value of the net assets acquired is amortized on a straight-line basis over 40
years. As of June 30, 1996, accumulated amortization was approximately $87,000.
REVENUE RECOGNITION
The Company recognizes service revenue and parts sales revenue when a
product is delivered or the services are performed. Revenues from sales of
extended warranties are recognized over the life of the contract on a
straight-line basis.
INCOME TAXES
The Company follows the liability method of accounting for income taxes in
accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards SFAS No. 109.
Under this method, deferred income taxes are recorded based upon differences
between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities and are
measured using the enacted tax rates and laws that will be in effect when the
underlying assets or liabilities are recovered or settled.
USE OF ESTIMATES
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally
accepted accounting principles requires the use of estimates and assumptions by
management in determining the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and
disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial
statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the
reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.
CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS
The Company considers all highly liquid debt instruments purchased with an
original maturity of three months or less to be cash equivalents.
NEW ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENT
Effective January 1, 1995, the Company adopted SFAS No. 121, Accounting
for the Impairment of Long-Lived Assets and for Long-Lived Assets to Be Disposed
Of. Accordingly, in the event that facts and circumstances indicate that
property and equipment, and intangible or other assets may be impaired, an
evaluation of recoverability would be performed. If an evaluation is required,
the estimated future undiscounted cash flows associated with the asset is
compared to the asset carrying amount to determine if a write-down to market
value or discounted cash flow value is necessary. Adoption of this standard did
not have a material effect on the financial position or consolidated results of
operations of the Company.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT PUBLIC ACCOUNTANTS
To Service Enterprises, Inc.   We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Service
Enterprises, Inc. a Texas corporation, and subsidiaries as of December 31,
1994 and 1995, and the related consolidated statements of operations,
shareholder equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period
ended December 31, 1995. These consolidated financial statements are the
responsibility of the Company management. Our responsibility is to express an
opinion on these consolidated financial statements based on our audits.
We conducted our audits in accordance with generally accepted auditing
standards. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are
free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis,
evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial
statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and
significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall
financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a
reasonable basis for our opinion.
In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above
present fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated financial position of
Service Enterprises, Inc., and subsidiaries as of December 31, 1994 and 1995,
and the consolidated results of their operations and their cash flows for each
of the three years in the period ended December 31, 1995, in conformity with

SERVICE ENTERPRISES, INC., AND SUBSIDIARIES
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
1. BUSINESS AND ORGANIZATION   Service Enterprises, Inc. SEI a Texas corporation, and subsidiaries
the Company are primarily engaged in the maintenance, repair and replacement
service-related activities of plumbing, air conditioning, electrical repair and
other home improvement services in Houston and the surrounding areas.
On March 19, 1996, all of the outstanding stock of SEI and certain real
estate owned by the former shareholder of SEI was acquired by Enterprises
Holding Company EHC for $17,500,000. EHC was formed solely for the purpose of
acquiring the Company and has no other operations. The accompanying unaudited
financial statements of the Company for the quarter ended March 31, 1996, do not
reflect the effect of the purchase of the Company by EHC.
In April 1996, the Company entered into a stock purchase agreement with
ADCOT, Inc. ADCOT, to purchase all of the outstanding common stock of ADCOT
for $2,000,000. See ADCOT financial statements included elsewhere herein.
EHC intends to enter into a definitive agreement with American Residential
Services, Inc. ARS, pursuant to which EHC will be acquired by ARS. All
outstanding shares of EHC common stock and a portion of EHC preferred stock
will be exchanged for cash and shares of ARS common stock concurrent with the
consummation of the initial public offering of the common stock of ARS.
2. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES  BASIS OF PRESENTATION
The consolidated financial statements include the accounts and results of
operations of Service Enterprises, Inc., and its wholly owned subsidiaries. All
significant intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated in
consolidation.
INTERIM FINANCIAL INFORMATION
The interim consolidated financial statements for the three months ended
March 31, 1995 and March 31, 1996, are unaudited, and certain information and
footnote disclosures, normally included in financial statements prepared in
accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, have been omitted. In
the opinion of management, all adjustments, consisting only of normal recurring
adjustments, necessary to fairly present the results of operations and cash
flows with respect to the consolidated interim financial statements, have been
included. The results of operations for the interim periods are not necessarily
indicative of the results for the entire fiscal year.
INVENTORIES
Inventories consist of parts and supplies held for use in the ordinary
course of business and are valued at the lower of cost or market using the
first-in, first-out FIFO method.
PROPERTY AND EQUIPMENT
Property and equipment are recorded at cost, and depreciation is computed
using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets.
Leasehold improvements are capitalized and amortized over the lesser of the
lease life or the estimated useful life of the asset.
Expenditures for repairs and maintenance are charged to expense when
incurred. Expenditures for major renewals and betterments, which extend the
useful lives of existing equipment, are capitalized and depreciated. Upon
retirement or disposition of property and equipment, the cost and related
accumulated depreciation are removed from the accounts and any resulting gain or
loss is recognized in the statements of operations.

SERVICE ENTERPRISES, INC., AND SUBSIDIARIES
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS -- CONTINUED
REVENUE RECOGNITION
The Company recognizes revenues when services are performed.
INCOME TAXES
The Company follows the liability method of accounting for income taxes in
accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards SFAS No. 109.
Under this method, deferred income taxes are recorded based upon differences
between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities and are
measured using the enacted tax rates and laws that will be in effect when the
underlying assets or liabilities are recovered or settled.
STOCK SPLIT
During 1994, the Company effected a seven-for-one stock split of Company
Common Stock.
USE OF ESTIMATES
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally
accepted accounting principles requires the use of estimates and assumptions by
management in determining the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and
disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial
statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the
reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.
CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS
The Company considers all highly liquid debt instruments purchased with an
original maturity of three months or less to be cash equivalents.
NEW ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENT
Effective January 1, 1995, the Company adopted SFAS No. 121, Accounting
for the Impairment of Long-Lived Assets and for Long-Lived Assets to Be Disposed
Of. Accordingly, in the event that facts and circumstances indicate that
property and equipment, and intangible or other assets may be impaired, an
evaluation of recoverability would be performed. If an evaluation is required,
the estimated future undiscounted cash flows associated with the asset is
compared to the asset carrying amount to determine if a write-down to market
value or discounted cash flow value is necessary. Adoption of this standard did
not have a material effect on the financial position or consolidated results of
operations of the Company.
3. PROPERTY AND EQUIPMENT   Property and equipment consist of the following                     ESTIMATED      DECEMBER 31

4. INVESTMENT IN AFFILIATED COMPANY   During July 1994, the Company sold a portion of its investment in American
Natural Gas Power, Inc. ANGP, for $225,000 and an unsecured
noninterest-bearing note receivable for $35,000 due on demand or, if no demand
is made, due in June 1996. After the sale, the Company interest in ANGP
decreased from approximately 33 percent at December 31, 1993, to approximately 8
percent at December 31, 1994, and accordingly is no longer accounted for under
the equity method. Included in other income is a net realized gain on sale of
$228,353 for the year ended December 31, 1994.
5. NOTE RECEIVABLE   In January 1994, the Company sold an investment in real estate to an
individual. The consideration included a note receivable for $300,000,
collateralized by a second lien on the real estate, which bears interest at 4
percent, payable monthly, with principal due January 1999.
In the event that the aggregate of all principal payments made on or before
the third anniversary of this note, January 25, 1997, equals $200,000, this note
shall be discounted such that the note is fully discharged by the prepayment of
such $200,000 within the initial three-year period. This note has been recorded
at its prepayment value of $200,000, discounted to a market rate of interest,
and is included in other noncurrent assets on the accompanying consolidated
balance sheet.
Management estimates that the fair value of its note receivable
approximates its discounted historical carrying value of $193,000 at December
31, 1995.

including certain required financial ratios and restrictions on retained
earnings. As of December 31, 1995, the Company was in compliance with these
covenants.
The notes payable have been personally guaranteed by the Company
shareholder.
Management estimates that the fair value of its debt obligations
approximates the historical value of $747,013 at December 31, 1995.
8. LEASES   The Company operates in leased facilities under an agreement with its
shareholder and affiliates. The amount paid under these leases was $291,600 291,600 and $301,600 in 1993, 1994 and 1995, respectively. These leases were
canceled concurrent with the purchase of the Company and the leased facilities
by EHC.

FLORIDA HEATING AND AIR CONDITIONING, INC.,
AND RELATED COMPANIES
NOTES TO COMBINED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
1. BUSINESS AND ORGANIZATION   Florida Heating and Air Conditioning, Inc. a Florida corporation and its
three affiliated companies collectively, the Company, are primarily engaged in
the installation and maintenance, repair and replacement of air conditioning and
heating systems in new and preexisting residential and commercial buildings in
Southeast Florida.
The Company and its shareholders intend to enter into a definitive
agreement with American Residential Services, Inc. ARS, pursuant to which all
outstanding shares of the Company common stock will be exchanged for cash and
shares of ARS common stock concurrent with the consummation of the initial
public offering the Offering of the common stock of ARS.
2. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES  BASIS OF PRESENTATION
The combined financial statements include the accounts and results of
operations of Florida Heating and Air Conditioning, Inc., and its affiliated
companies see Note 11 which are under common control and management of two
individuals. All significant intercompany transactions and balances have been
eliminated in combination.
INTERIM FINANCIAL INFORMATION
The interim combined financial statements for the nine months ended
September 30, 1995 and 1996 are unaudited and certain information and footnote
disclosures, normally included in financial statements prepared in accordance
with generally accepted accounting principles, have been omitted. In the opinion
of management, all adjustments, consisting only of normal recurring adjustments,
necessary to fairly present the financial position, results of operations and
cash flows with respect to the interim combined financial statements, have been
included. The results of operations for the interim periods are not necessarily
indicative of the results for the entire fiscal year.
INVENTORIES
Inventories consist of duct materials, air conditioning equipment,
refrigeration supplies and accessories held for use in the ordinary course of
business and are stated at the lower of cost or market using the first-in,
first-out FIFO method.
PROPERTY AND EQUIPMENT
Property and equipment are stated at cost, and depreciation is computed
using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets.
Leasehold improvements are capitalized and amortized over the lesser of the life
of the lease or the estimated useful life of the asset.
Expenditures for repairs and maintenance are charged to expense when
incurred. Expenditures for major renewals and betterments, which extend the
useful lives of existing equipment, are capitalized and depreciated. Upon
retirement or disposition of property and equipment, the cost and related
accumulated depreciation are removed from the accounts and any resulting gain or
loss is recognized in the statements of operations.
REVENUE RECOGNITION
The Company recognizes revenue when the services are performed except when
work is being performed under a construction contract. Revenues on residential
and commercial service and maintenance contracts are recorded and collected
monthly.
110
FLORIDA HEATING AND AIR CONDITIONING, INC., AND RELATED COMPANIES
NOTES TO COMBINED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS -- CONTINUED
Revenues from construction contracts are recognized on the
percentage-of-completion method measured by the percentage of costs incurred to
total estimated costs for each contract. Provisions for the total estimated
losses on uncompleted contracts are made in the period in which such losses are
determined. Changes in job performance, job conditions, estimated profitability
and final contract settlements may result in revisions to costs and income and
are recognized in the period in which the revisions are determined.
WARRANTY COSTS
The Company warrants labor for the first year after installation on new air
conditioning and heating units. The Company generally warrants labor for 30 days
after servicing of existing air conditioning and heating units. A reserve for
warranty costs is recorded upon completion of installation or service.
INCOME TAXES
The Company follows the liability method of accounting for income taxes in
accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards SFAS No. 109.
Under this method, deferred income taxes are recorded based upon differences
between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities and are
measured using the enacted tax rates and laws that will be in effect when the
underlying assets or liabilities are recovered or settled.
Certain of the companies in the affiliated group have elected S Corporation
status as defined by the Internal Revenue Code, whereby the Company is not
subject to taxation for federal purposes. Under S Corporation status, the
shareholders report their share of the Company taxable earnings or losses in
their personal tax returns.
USE OF ESTIMATES
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally
accepted accounting principles requires the use of estimates and assumptions by
management in determining the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and
disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial
statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the
reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.
CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS
The Company considers all highly liquid debt instruments purchased with an
original maturity of three months or less to be cash equivalents.
NEW ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENT
Effective January 1, 1996, the Company adopted SFAS No. 121, Accounting
for the Impairment of Long-Lived Assets and for Long-Lived Assets to Be Disposed
Of. Accordingly, in the event that facts and circumstances indicate that
property and equipment, and intangible or other assets, may be impaired, an
evaluation of recoverability would be performed. If an evaluation is required,
the estimated future undiscounted cash flows associated with the asset is
compared to the asset carrying amount to determine if a write-down to market
value or discounted cash flow value was necessary. Adoption of this standard did
not have a material effect on the financial position or results of operations of
the Company.

DIAL ONE MERIDIAN AND HOOSIER, INC.
NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
1. BUSINESS AND ORGANIZATION   DIAL ONE Meridian and Hoosier, Inc., an Indiana corporation the
Company, is primarily engaged in the installation and maintenance, repair and
replacement of residential and commercial air conditioning and heating systems
in Indianapolis and the surrounding areas.
The Company and its shareholder intend to enter into a definitive agreement
with American Residential Services, Inc. ARS, pursuant to which all
outstanding shares of the Company common stock will be exchanged for cash and
shares of ARS common stock concurrent with the consummation of the initial
public offering the Offering of the common stock of ARS.
2. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES:
INTERIM FINANCIAL INFORMATION
The interim financial statements for the nine months ended September 30,
1995 and 1996 are unaudited and certain information and footnote disclosures,
normally included in financial statements prepared in accordance with generally
accepted accounting principles, have been omitted. In the opinion of management,
all adjustments, consisting only of normal recurring adjustments, necessary to
fairly present the results of operations and cash flows with respect to the
interim financial statements, have been included. The results of operations for
the interim periods are not necessarily indicative of the results for the entire
fiscal year.
INVENTORIES
Inventories consist of parts and supplies for use in the ordinary course of
business and are valued at the lower of cost or market using the first-in,
first-out FIFO method.
PROPERTY AND EQUIPMENT
Property and equipment are stated at cost, and depreciation is computed
using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets.
Leasehold improvements are capitalized and amortized over the lesser of the life
of the lease or the estimated useful life of the asset.
Expenditures for repairs and maintenance are charged to expense when
incurred. Expenditures for major renewals and betterments, which extend the
useful lives of existing equipment, are capitalized and depreciated. Upon
retirement or disposition of property and equipment, the cost and related
accumulated depreciation are removed from the accounts and any resulting gain or
loss is recognized in the statements of operations.
Included in property and equipment are certain assets subject to capital
leases. These assets are amortized using the straight-line method over the
lesser of the life of the leases or the estimated useful life of the asset.
REVENUE RECOGNITION
The Company recognizes revenue when the services are performed except when
work is being performed under a construction contract. Revenues on residential
and commercial service and maintenance contracts are recorded and collected
monthly.
Revenues from construction contracts are recognized on the
percentage-of-completion method measured by the percentage of costs incurred to
total estimated costs for each contract. Provisions for the total estimated
losses on uncompleted contracts are made in the period in which such losses are
determined. Changes in job performance, job conditions, estimated profitability
and final contract settlements may result in revisions to costs and income and
are recognized in the period in which the revisions are determined.

DIAL ONE MERIDIAN AND HOOSIER, INC.
NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS --CONTINUED
WARRANTY COSTS
The Company warrants labor for one or five years after installation on new
air conditioning and heating units. The Company generally warrants labor for 30
days after servicing of existing air conditioning and heating units. A reserve
for warranty costs is recorded upon completion of installation or service.
INCOME TAXES
The Company follows the liability method of accounting for income taxes in
accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards SFAS No. 109.
Under this method, deferred income taxes are recorded based upon differences
between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities and are
measured using the enacted tax rates and laws that will be in effect when the
underlying assets or liabilities are received or settled.
USE OF ESTIMATES
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally
accepted accounting principles requires the use of estimates and assumptions by
management in determining the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and
disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial
statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the
reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.
CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS
The Company considers all highly liquid debt instruments purchased with an
original maturity of three months or less to be cash equivalents.
NEW ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENT
Effective January 1, 1996, the Company adopted SFAS No. 121, Accounting
for the Impairment of Long-Lived Assets and for Long-Lived Assets to Be Disposed
Of. Accordingly, in the event that facts and circumstances indicate that
property and equipment, and intangible or other assets, may be impaired, an
evaluation of recoverability would be performed. If an evaluation is required,
the estimated future undiscounted cash flows associated with the asset is
compared to the asset carrying amount to determine if a write-down to market
value or discounted cash flow value was necessary. Adoption of this standard did
not have a material effect on the financial position or results of operations of
the Company.

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
1. BUSINESS AND ORGANIZATION   ADCOT, Inc. a Texas corporation the Company d.b.a. A-ABC Appliance,
is primarily engaged in the sales of consumer appliances and the service-related
activities of plumbing, air conditioning, appliance and electrical repair and
other home improvement services in Houston and the surrounding areas.
In April 1996, the Company and its shareholder entered into a stock
purchase agreement with Service Enterprises, Inc. SEI to sell all of its
outstanding common stock for $2,000,000 to SEI.
2. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES  INTERIM FINANCIAL INFORMATION
The interim financial statements for the six months ended June 30, 1995 and
the five months ended May 31, 1996, are unaudited, and certain information and
footnote disclosures, normally included in financial statements prepared in
accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, have been omitted. In
the opinion of management, all adjustments, consisting only of normal recurring
adjustments, necessary to fairly present the financial position, results of
operations and cash flows with respect to the interim financial statements, have
been included. The results of operations for the interim periods are not
necessarily indicative of the results for the entire fiscal year.
INVENTORIES
Inventories consist of appliances and service-related parts and supplies
held for use in the ordinary course of business and are valued at the lower of
cost or market using the weighted-average cost method.
PROPERTY AND EQUIPMENT
Property and equipment are recorded at cost, and depreciation is computed
using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets.
Leasehold improvements are capitalized and amortized over the lesser of the life
of the lease or the estimated useful life of the asset.
Expenditures for repairs and maintenance are charged to expense when
incurred. Expenditures for major renewals and betterments, which extend the
useful lives of existing equipment, are capitalized and depreciated. Upon
retirement or disposition of property or equipment, the cost and related
accumulated depreciation are removed from the accounts and any resulting gain or
loss is recognized in the statements of operations.
INCOME TAXES
The Company has elected S Corporation status as defined by the Internal
Revenue Code, whereby the Company is not subject to taxation for federal
purposes. Under S Corporation status, the shareholder reports his share of the
Company taxable earnings or losses in his personal tax return.
The Company is subject to Texas franchise tax which is an income-based tax.
Accordingly, the Company has recorded a provision for this tax in the
accompanying statement of operations for 1995. No provision for franchise taxes
was recorded in the 1993 or 1994 statement of operations as the Company
franchise tax was offset by a business loss carryover.
REVENUE RECOGNITION
The Company recognizes service revenue and parts sales revenue when a
product is delivered or the services are performed. Revenues from sales of
extended warranties are recognized over the life of the contract on a
straight-line basis.
133
ADCOT, INC.
NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS -- CONTINUED
USE OF ESTIMATES
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally
accepted accounting principles requires the use of estimates and assumptions by
management in determining the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and
disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial
statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the
reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.
CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS
The Company considers all highly liquid debt instruments purchased with an
original maturity of three months or less to be cash equivalents.
NEW ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS
Effective January 1, 1995, the Company adopted Statement of Financial
Accounting Standards SFAS No. 121, Accounting for the Impairment of
Long-Lived Assets and for Long-Lived Assets to Be Disposed Of. Accordingly, in
the event that facts and circumstances indicate that property and equipment, and
intangible or other assets, may be impaired, an evaluation of recoverability
would be performed. If an evaluation is required, the estimated future
undiscounted cash flows associated with the asset is compared to the asset
carrying amount to determine if a write-down to market value or discounted cash
flow value was necessary. Adoption of this standard did not have a material
effect on the financial position or results of operations of the Company.
3. PROPERTY AND EQUIPMENT   Property and equipment consist of the following                               DECEMBER 31

4. DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS   Subsequent to the purchase of the Company by SEI, the board of directors of
SEI parent company Enterprises Holding Company approved the disposition of
the Company retail appliance sales division. The allocation of purchase price
to the fair market value of the net assets of the Company acquired by SEI will
be based on preliminary estimates of fair value and may be revised when
additional information concerning asset and liability valuations is obtained.
Accordingly, any gain or loss on the sale of the appliance sales division will
be considered an adjustment of purchase price.
The net losses of these operations prior to April 1, 1996, are included in
the statements of operations under discontinued operations. Revenues, cost of
sales, selling, general and administrative expenses, other income and expense,
and income taxes for fiscal years 1993, 1994 and 1995 exclude amounts associated
with the discontinued division. Revenues from such operations were approximately
$12,185,000, $12,101,000 and $11,915,000 for the years ended December 31, 1993,
1994 and 1995, respectively. Certain expenses have been allocated to
discontinued operations, which were allocated based upon estimated divisional
usage. All assets of the operations are expected to be sold in 1996.

at a rate of prime plus 25 percent on the remaining unpaid balance. Payment is
due as the inventory is sold.
The Company also has floor plan financing available from three other
companies with similar terms. However, the Company does not utilize these, and
had no balances outstanding at December 31, 1994 and 1995.
The inventory floor plan facilities are personally guaranteed by the sole
shareholder and/or an officer of the Company.

METRO HEATING AND AIR CONDITIONING, INC.
NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
1. BUSINESS AND ORGANIZATION   Metro Heating and Air Conditioning, Inc. the Company, is primarily
engaged in the installation and maintenance, repair and replacement of air
conditioning and heating systems in new and preexisting residential and
commercial buildings in North Carolina.
The Company and its shareholders intend to enter into a definitive
agreement with American Residential Services, Inc. ARS, pursuant to which all
outstanding shares of the Company common stock will be exchanged for cash and
shares of ARS common stock.
2. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES   INTERIM FINANCIAL INFORMATION
The interim financial statements as of September 30, 1996, and for the nine
months ended September 30, 1995 and 1996, are unaudited, and certain information
and footnote disclosures, normally included in financial statements prepared in
accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, have been omitted. In
the opinion of management, all adjustments, consisting only of normal recurring
adjustments, necessary to fairly present the financial position, results of
operations and cash flows with respect to the interim financial statements, have
been included. The results of operations for the interim periods are not
necessarily indicative of the results for the entire fiscal year.
INVENTORIES
Inventories consist of duct materials, air conditioning and heating
equipment, refrigeration supplies and accessories held for use in the ordinary
course of business and are stated at the lower of cost or market using the
first-in, first-out FIFO method.
PROPERTY AND EQUIPMENT
Property and equipment are stated at cost, and depreciation is computed
using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets.
Leasehold improvements are capitalized and amortized over the lesser of the life
of the lease or the estimated useful life of the asset.
Expenditures for repairs and maintenance are charged to expense when
incurred. Expenditures for major renewals and betterments, which extend the
useful lives of existing equipment, are capitalized and depreciated. Upon
retirement or disposition of property and equipment, the cost and related
accumulated depreciation are removed from the accounts and any resulting gain or
loss is recognized in the statements of operations.
REVENUE RECOGNITION
The Company recognizes revenue when the services are performed except when
work is being performed under a construction contract. Revenues from the sale of
residential and commercial service and maintenance contracts are recognized over
the life of the contract on a straight-line basis.
Revenues from construction contracts are recognized on the
percentage-of-completion method measured by the percentage of costs incurred to
total estimated costs for each contract. Provisions for the total estimated
losses on uncompleted contracts are made in the period in which such losses are
determined. Changes in job performance, job conditions, estimated profitability
and final contract settlements may result in revisions to costs and income and
are recognized in the period in which the revisions are determined.
WARRANTY COSTS
The Company warrants labor for the first year after installation on new air
conditioning and heating units. The Company generally warrants labor for twelve
months after servicing of existing air conditioning and heating units. A reserve
for warranty costs is recorded upon completion of installation or service.

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS -- CONTINUED
INCOME TAXES
The Company has elected S Corporation status as defined by the Internal
Revenue Code, whereby the Company is not subject to taxation for federal
purposes. Under S Corporation status, the shareholders report their share of the
Company taxable earnings or losses in their personal tax returns.
USE OF ESTIMATES
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally
accepted accounting principles requires the use of estimates and assumptions by
management in determining the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and
disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial
statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the
reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.
CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS
The Company considers all highly liquid debt instruments purchased with an
original maturity of three months or less to be cash equivalents.
NEW ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENT
Effective January 1, 1996, the Company adopted Statement of Financial
Accounting Standard SFAS No. 121, Accounting for the Impairment of
Long-Lived Assets and for Long-Lived Assets to Be Disposed Of. Accordingly, in
the event that facts and circumstances indicate that property and equipment, and
intangible or other assets, may be impaired, an evaluation of recoverability
would be performed. If an evaluation is required, the estimated future
undiscounted cash flows associated with the asset is compared to the asset
carrying amount to determine if a write-down to market value or discounted cash
flow value was necessary. Adoption of this standard did not have a material
effect on the financial position or results of operations of the Company.
