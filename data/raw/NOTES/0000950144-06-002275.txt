36 Table of Contents MANAGEMENTS ANNUAL REPORT ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING Management of the Company is responsible for establishing and maintaining effective internal
control over financial reporting as defined in Rules13a-15f under the Securities Exchange Act of
1934. The companys internal control over financial reporting is designed to provide reasonable
assurance regarding the preparation and fair presentation of published financial statements.
Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or
detect misstatements. Therefore, even those systems determined to be effective can provide only
reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement preparation and presentation. Under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Chief
Financial Officer and Principal Accounting Officer, we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness
of our internal control over financial reporting as of December31, 2005 based on the framework in
Internal Control Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the
Treadway Commission COSO. Based on that evaluation, our management concluded that our internal
control over financial reporting was not effective as of December31, 2005 due to material
weaknesses. A material weakness is a control deficiency, or a combination of control deficiencies, that
results in more than a remote likelihood that a material misstatement of the annual or interim
financial statements will not be prevented or detected. As of December31, 2005, management has
determined that   
The Companys controls over monitoring the completeness and
accuracy of the determination and reporting of sales taxes
payable were insufficient. Specifically, the Company did not have
personnel with sufficient skills and experience to enable the
Company to properly determine whether certain consulting and
maintenance services were considered taxable transactions in
certain states. These control deficiencies resulted in material
adjustments to the general and administrative expense and accrued
liability accounts in the 2005 annual and quarterly consolidated
financial statements and the restatement of the annual
consolidated financial statements for 2002, 2003 and 2004, and
for each of the quarters in the years ended December31, 2003 and
2004 for which an amended Annual Report on Form 10-K was filed
with the Securities and Exchange Commission on March1, 2006.   
The Companys review and approval controls over the accounting
for income taxes, including the determination and reporting of
income taxes payable, deferred income tax assets and liabilities
and the related income tax provision were insufficient.
Specifically, the Company did not have personnel with sufficient
skills and experience to enable the Company to properly consider
and apply generally accepted accounting principles for taxes, and
ensure that the rationale for certain tax positions was
adequately documented and appropriately communicated.
Additionally, the Company did not maintain effective controls to
review and monitor the accuracy of the components of the income
tax provision calculations and the related deferred income taxes
and income taxes payable. These control deficiencies resulted in
the restatement of the annual consolidated financial statements
for 2002, 2003 and 2004, and for each of the quarters in the
years ended December31, 2003 and 2004 for which an amended
Annual Report on Form 10-K was filed with the Securities and
Exchange Commission on March1, 2006. No adjustments were
necessary to the 2005 annual or interim financial statements as a
result of these deficiencies. However, until this material
weakness is remediated, there is a more than remote likelihood
that a misstatement of the income tax provision and the related
deferred income taxes and income taxes payable accounts could
occur that would not be prevented or detected by the Companys
internal controls. Because of these material weaknesses, we have concluded that the Company did not maintain
effective internal control over financial reporting as of December31, 2005 based on the criteria
in the Internal Control Integrated Framework. 37 Table of Contents Managements assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting as
of December31, 2005 has been audited by Ernst Young LLP, the independent registered public
accounting firm who also audited the Companys consolidated financial statements. Ernst Youngs
attestation report on managements assessment of the Companys internal controls over financial
reporting appears beginning on page 39 hereof.

38 Table of Contents REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM
ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING The Board of Directors and Shareholders
Manhattan Associates, Inc. We have audited managements assessment, included in the accompanying Managements Annual
Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting, that Manhattan Associates, Inc. did not
maintain effective internal control over financial reporting as of December31, 2005, because of
the effect of the material weaknesses identified in managements assessment and described below,
based on criteria established in Internal Control Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of
Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission the COSO criteria. Manhattan Associates,
Inc.s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial
reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting.
Our responsibility is to express an opinion on managements assessment and an opinion on the
effectiveness of the Companys internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting
Oversight Board United States. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to
obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was
maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal
control over financial reporting, evaluating managements assessment, testing and evaluating the
design and operating effectiveness of internal control, and performing such other procedures as we
considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis
for our opinion. A companys internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide
reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of
financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting
principles. A companys internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and
procedures that 1pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately
and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; 2provide
reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial
statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and
expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and
directors of the company; and 3provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely
detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the companys assets that could have
a material effect on the financial statements. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent
or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are
subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that
the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. A material weakness is a control deficiency, or combination of control deficiencies, that
results in more than a remote likelihood that a material misstatement of the annual or interim
financial statements will not be prevented or detected. The following material weaknesses have been
identified and included in managements assessment The Companys controls over monitoring the completeness and accuracy of the determination and
reporting of sales tax payable were insufficient. Specifically, the Company did not have personnel
with sufficient skills and experience to enable the Company to properly determine whether certain
consulting and maintenance services were considered taxable transactions in certain states. These
control deficiencies resulted in material adjustments to the general and administrative expense and
accrued liability accounts in the 2005 annual and quarterly consolidated financial statements and
the restatement of the annual consolidated financial statements for 2002, 2003 and 2004, and for
each of the quarters in the years ended December31, 2003 and 2004, for which an amended Annual
Report on Form 10-K was filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on March1, 2006. The Companys review and approval controls over the accounting for income taxes, including the
determination and reporting of income taxes payable, deferred income tax assets and liabilities and
the related income tax provision were insufficient. Specifically, the Company did not have
personnel with sufficient skills and experience to enable the Company to properly consider and
apply generally accepted accounting principles for taxes, and ensure 39 Table of Contents that the rationale for certain tax positions was adequately documented and appropriately
communicated. Additionally, the Company did not maintain effective controls to review and monitor
the accuracy of the components of the income tax provision calculations and the related deferred
income taxes and income taxes payable. These control deficiencies resulted in the restatement of
the annual consolidated financial statements for 2002, 2003 and 2004, and for each of the quarters
in the years ended December31, 2003 and 2004, for which an amended Annual Report on Form 10-K was
filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on March1, 2006. No adjustments were necessary
to the 2005 annual or interim financial statements as a result of these deficiencies. However,
until this material weakness is remediated, there is a more than remote likelihood that a
misstatement of the income tax provision and the related deferred income taxes and income taxes
payable accounts could occur that would not be prevented or detected by the Companys internal
controls. These material weaknesses were considered in determining the nature, timing, and extent of
audit tests applied in our audit of the 2005 consolidated financial statements, and this report
does not affect our report dated March13, 2006 on those consolidated financial statements. In our opinion, managements assessment that Manhattan Associates, Inc. did not maintain
effective internal control over financial reporting as of December31, 2005, is fairly stated, in
all material respects, based on the COSO control criteria. Also, in our opinion, because of the
effect of the material weaknesses described above on the achievement of the objectives of the
control criteria, Manhattan Associates, Inc. has not maintained effective internal control over
financial reporting as of December31, 2005, based on the COSO control criteria. s/ ERNST YOUNG LLP Atlanta, Georgia

ON THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS The Board of Directors and Shareholders
Manhattan Associates, Inc. and Subsidiaries We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Manhattan Associates, Inc. and
subsidiaries the Company as of December31, 2004 and 2005, and the related consolidated
statements of income, shareholders equity, comprehensive income and cash flows for each of the
three years in the period ended December31, 2005. Our audits also included the financial
statement schedule listed in the Index at a. These financial statements and schedule are
the responsibility of the Companys management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on
these financial statements and schedule based on our audits. We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting
Oversight Board United States. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to
obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material
misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and
disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles
used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial
statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all
material respects, the consolidated financial position of the Company at December31, 2004 and
2005, and the consolidated results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three
years in the period ended December31, 2005, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting
principles. Also, in our opinion, the related financial statement schedule, when considered in
relation to the basic financial statements taken as a whole, presents fairly in all material
respects the information set forth therein. We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting
Oversight Board United States, the effectiveness of the Companys internal control over financial
reporting as of December31, 2005, based on criteria established in Internal Control Integrated
Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission and our
report dated March13, 2006 expressed an unqualified opinion on managements assessment and an
adverse opinion on the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting.

Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Cash and Cash Equivalents The Company considers all highly liquid investments purchased with original maturities of
three months or less to be cash or cash equivalents. 47 Table of Contents 1. Organization and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies continued Concentrations of Credit Risk Financial instruments that potentially subject the Company to significant concentrations of
credit risk consist principally of cash and cash equivalents, short- and long-term investments and
accounts receivable. The Company maintains cash and cash equivalents and short- and long-term
investments with various financial institutions. The Companys sales are primarily to companies
located in the United States, Europe and Asia. The Company performs periodic credit evaluations of
its customers financial condition and does not require collateral. Accounts receivable are due
principally from large U.S., European and Asia Pacific companies under stated contract terms.
Accounts receivable as of December31, 2004 for the United States, Europe and Asia Pacific
companies were $323million, $110million and $27million, respectively. Accounts receivable as
of December31, 2005 for the United States, Europe and Asia Pacific companies were $455million 91million and $40million, respectively. The Companys top five customers in aggregate accounted for 16%, 14% and 14% of total revenue
in the period the related sales were recorded for each of the years ended December31, 2003, 2004,
and 2005, respectively. No single customer accounted for more than 10% of revenue in the years
ended December31, 2003, 2004, and 2005 or for more than 10% of accounts receivable as of December
31, 2004 and 2005. On January22, 2002, a significant customer for 2001 filed for bankruptcy under
Chapter11 of the United States Bankruptcy Code. As a result of the filing, the uncertainties
around the bankruptcy proceedings and the ultimate timing of payment, we recorded an allowance of
$43million in 2001 to effectively defer revenues arising in the fourth quarter of 2001 from the
significant customer, but unpaid at the time of the bankruptcy declaration. The allowance included
approximately $23million of software fees, $16million of fees for professional services and
$04million of hardware. In September2002, the United States Bankruptcy Court for the Northern
District of Illinois Eastern Division authorized the significant customers request to assume the
software license, services, support and enhancement agreement. With the appeals process completed
in October2002, the Company recovered approximately $23million of the receivable during the
fourth quarter of 2002. Upon receiving the final cash settlement in June2003, subsequent to the
significant customer emerging from bankruptcy, the Company recovered an additional $848,000 of the
receivable during the second quarter of 2003. The recoveries were recorded as separate revenue line
items in the Consolidated Statements of Income and reductions to the allowance for doubtful
accounts in the Consolidated Balance Sheets during the respective quarters. Investments The Companys investments in marketable securities consist of debt instruments of the U.S.
Treasury, U.S. government agencies, state and local government agencies and corporate commercial
paper. These investments are categorized as available-for-sale securities and recorded at fair
market value, as defined by SFAS No115, Accounting for Certain Investments in Debt and Equity
Securities. Investment gains and losses are determined on a specific identification basis.
Investments with original maturities of 90days or less are classified as cash equivalents;
investments with original maturities of greater than 90days but less than one year are generally
classified as short-term investments; and those with original maturities of greater than one year
are generally classified as long-term investments. The long-term investments consist of corporate
or U.S. government debt instruments and mature after one year through five years. The Company
holds investments in Auction Rate Securities, which have original maturities greater than one year,
but which have auctions to reset the yield every 7 to 35days. The Company has classified these
assets as short-term investments as the assets are viewed as available to support current
operations, based on the provisions of Accounting Research Bulletin No43, Chapter3A, Working
Capital-Current Assets and Liabilities. Unrealized holding gains and losses are reflected as a
net amount in a separate component of shareholders equity until realized. For the purposes of
computing realized gains and losses, cost is identified on a specific identification basis. 48 Table of Contents 1. Organization and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies continued The following is a summary of the available-for-sale securities in thousands

As of December31, 2005, $100million, $365million, $0 and $352million of the
Companys investments mature within 1year, after 1year through 5years, after 5years through 10
years and after 10years, respectively. On July11, 2003, the Company made a cash investment of $2million in Alien Technology Corp.
Alien, a provider of ultra-low cost radio frequency identification RFIDtags and hardware.
The investment represents approximately a 15% ownership interest in the privately-held
corporation. The Companys maximum exposure to loss as a result of its involvement with Alien is
its investment of $2million. The investment has been accounted for under the cost method, and is
included in Other Assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. The Company has not identified any
events or changes in circumstances that could have had a significant adverse effect on the fair
value of the investment. Accordingly, the carrying value of the investment as of December31, 2005
is its cost of $2million. Use of Estimates The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally
accepted in the United States requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the
reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the
date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the
reporting period. Significant estimates include the allowance for doubtful accounts, which is
based upon an evaluation of historical amounts written-off, the Companys customers ability to pay
and general economic conditions; the useful lives of intangible assets; self insurance accruals;
legal accruals; the recoverability or impairment of intangible asset values; and the Companys
effective income tax rate and deferred tax assets, which are based upon the Companys expectations
of future taxable income, allowable deductions, and projected tax credits. Actual results could
differ from these estimates. Fair Value of Financial Instruments The carrying values of cash, accounts receivable, accounts payable, and other financial
instruments included in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets approximate their fair values
principally due to the short-term maturities of these instruments. Unrealized gains and losses on
investments are included as a separate component of Accumulated other comprehensive income, net
of any related tax effect, in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. 49 Table of Contents 1. Organization and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies continued Risks Associated with Single Business Line, Technological Advances, and Foreign Operations The Company currently derives a substantial portion of its revenues from sales of its software
and related services and hardware. The markets for supply chain execution and supply chain
planning solutions are subject to rapid technological change, changing customer needs, frequent new
product introductions, and evolving industry standards that may render existing products and
services obsolete. As a result, the Companys position in these markets could be eroded rapidly by
unforeseen changes in customer requirements for application features, functions, and technologies.
The Companys growth and future operating results will depend, in part, upon its ability to enhance
existing applications and develop and introduce new applications that meet changing customer
requirements that respond to competitive products and that achieve market acceptance. Any factor
adversely affecting the markets for supply chain execution and supply chain planning solutions
could have an adverse effect on the Companys business, financial condition, and results of
operations. The Companys international business is subject to risks typical of an international business,
including, but not limited to: differing economic conditions, changes in political climate,
differing tax structures, other regulations and restrictions, and foreign exchange rate volatility.
Accordingly, the future results could be materially adversely impacted by changes in these or
other factors. The Company recognized foreign exchange rate gains on intercompany balances of
approximately $1,283,000 in 2003 and $927,000 in 2004 and a foreign exchange rate loss on
intercompany balances of $1,144,000 in 2005, classified in Other income loss, net on the
Consolidated Statements of Income. Revenue Recognition The Companys revenue consists of revenues from the licensing and hosting of software; fees
from consulting, implementation and training services collectively, professional services, plus
customer support services and software enhancement subscriptions; and sales of hardware. The Company recognizes software license revenue under Statement of Position No97-2,
Software Revenue Recognition SOP 97-2, as amended, specifically when the following criteria
are met: 1a signed contract is obtained; 2delivery of the product has occurred; 3the
license fee is fixed or determinable; and 4collectibility is probable. The Company recognizes
revenue using the residual method when 1there is vendor-specific objective evidence of the
fair values of all undelivered elements in a multiple-element arrangement that is not accounted for
using long-term contract accounting; 2vendor-specific objective evidence of fair value does not
exist for one or more of the delivered elements in the arrangement; and 3all revenue-recognition
criteria in SOP 97-2, other than the requirement for vendor-specific objective evidence of the fair
value of each delivered element of the arrangement are satisfied. For those contracts that contain
significant customization or modifications, license revenue is recognized using contract
accounting. The Companys services revenue consists of fees generated from professional services, customer
support services and software enhancement subscriptions related to the Companys software products.
Fees from professional services performed by the Company are generally billed on an hourly basis,
and revenue is recognized as the services are performed. Professional services are sometimes
rendered under agreements in which billings are limited to contractual maximums or based upon a
fixed-fee for portions of or all of the engagement. Revenue related to fixed-fee based contracts
is recognized on a proportional performance basis based on the hours incurred. Project losses are
provided for in their entirety in the period in which they become known. Revenue related to
customer support services and software enhancement subscriptions are generally paid in advance and
recognized ratably over the term of the agreement, typically 12months. 50 Table of Contents 1. Organization and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies continued Hardware revenue is generated from the resale of a variety of hardware products, developed and
manufactured by third parties, that are integrated with and complementary to the Companys software
solutions. As part of a complete solution, the Companys customers frequently purchase hardware
from the Company in conjunction with the licensing of software. These products include computer
hardware, radio frequency terminals networks, RFID chip readers, bar code printers and scanners,
and other peripherals. Hardware revenue is recognized upon shipment to the customer when title
passes. The Company generally purchases hardware from its vendors only after receiving an order
from a customer. As a result, the Company does not maintain significant hardware inventory. In accordance with the FASBs Emerging Issues Task Force Issue No01-14 EITF No01-14,
Income Statement Characterization of Reimbursements Received for Out-of-Pocket Expenses Incurred,
the Company recognizes amounts associated with reimbursements from customers for out-of-pocket
expenses as revenue. Such amounts have been classified to hardware and other revenue. The total
amount of expense reimbursement recorded to revenue was $65million, $70million and $81million
for 2003, 2004 and 2005, respectively. Deferred Revenue Deferred revenue represents amounts collected prior to having completed performance of
professional services, customer support services and software enhancement subscriptions and
significant remaining obligations under license agreements. The Company expects to complete such
services or obligations within the next twelve months. Returns and Allowances The Company has not experienced significant returns or warranty claims to date and, as a
result, has not recorded a provision for the cost of returns and product warranty claims at
December31, 2004 or 2005. The Company records an allowance for doubtful accounts based on the historical experience of
write-offs and a detailed assessment of accounts receivable. Additions to the allowance for
doubtful accounts generally represent a sales allowance on services revenue, which are recorded to
operations as a reduction to services revenue. The total amounts charged to operations were $35
million, $40million and $38million for 2003, 2004 and 2005, respectively. In estimating the
allowance for doubtful accounts, management considers the age of the accounts receivable, the
Companys historical write-offs, and the credit worthiness of the customer, among others. Should
any of these factors change, the estimates made by management will also change accordingly, which
could affect the level of the Companys future provision for doubtful accounts. Uncollectible
accounts are written off when it is determined that the specific balance is not collectible. During 2005,
the Company recorded a $28million bad debt provision for the entire amount of the
accounts receivable due from a large German customer with which the
Company terminated its business
relationship during 2005. Due to the challenging relationship with the customer and the
difficulties encountered during the software implementation process,
collection was determined to be
doubtful. The $28million bad debt provision is the best estimate of costs to be incurred from
the termination of this business relationship. However, this amount
may change if the issue results in litigation or if a settlement is
reached that is not covered by corporate insurance policies. It is
not possible at this time to estimate the amount
of any such potential costs. 51 Table of Contents 1. Organization and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies continued Property and Equipment Property and equipment is recorded at cost and consists of furniture, computers, other office
equipment, purchased software for internal use, and leasehold improvements recorded at cost. The
Company depreciates the cost of furniture, computers, other office equipment and purchased software
on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives three years for computer equipment and
software, five years for office equipment, seven years for furniture. Leasehold improvements are
depreciated over the lesser of their useful lives or the term of the lease. Included in computer
equipment and software are assets under a capital lease of approximately $247,000 as of December
31, 2004 and 2005. Accumulated depreciation relating to the assets under a capital lease was
$82,000 and $165,000 as of December31, 2004 and 2005, respectively. Depreciation and amortization
expense for property and equipment, including assets under a capital lease, for the years ended
December31, 2003, 2004 and 2005 was approximately $7,639,000, $7,207,000 and $7,582,000,
respectively, and was included in general and administrative expenses in the Consolidated
Statements of Income. Property and equipment, at cost, consist of the following in thousands

Acquisition-Related Intangible Assets Acquisition-related intangible assets are stated at historical cost and include acquired
software and certain other intangible assets with definite lives. The acquired software is being
amortized over the greater of the amount computed using athe ratio that current gross revenues
for a product bear to the total of current and anticipated future gross revenues for that product
or bthe straight-line method over the remaining estimated economic life of the product including
the period being reported on. The other intangible assets are being amortized on a straight-line
basis over a period of two to ten years. Total amortization expense related to acquisition-related
intangible assets was approximately $3,432,000, $3,575,000 and $4,492,000 for the years ended
December31, 2003, 2004 and 2005, respectively, and is included in amortization of acquired

Goodwill Goodwill represents the excess of purchase price over fair value of net identified tangible
and intangible assets and liabilities acquired. The Company does not amortize goodwill, but
instead tests goodwill for impairment on at least an annual basis. Goodwill as of December31, 2004
and December31, 2005 was $32,469,000 and $54,607,000, respectively. Approximately $360million
of the gross Goodwill is deductible for income tax purposes. Software Development Costs Research and development expenses are charged to expense as incurred. The Company determines
the amount of development costs capitalizable under the provisions of SFAS No86, Accounting for
Costs of Computer Software to Be Sold, Leased, or Otherwise Marketed. Computer software
development costs are charged to research and development expense until technological feasibility
is established, after which remaining software production costs are capitalized in accordance with
SFAS No86. The Company has defined technological feasibility as the point in time at which the
Company has a detailed program design or a working model of the related product, depending on the
type of development efforts. For the years ended December31, 2003, 2004 and 2005, the Company
capitalized no internal research and development costs because the costs incurred between the
attainment of technological feasibility for the related software product through the date when the
product was available for general release to customers has been insignificant. Total amortization
expense related to software development costs capitalized prior to 2002 was approximately $343,000 0 and $0 for the years ended December31, 2003, 2004 and 2005, respectively, and is included in
cost of software and hosting fees in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Income. As of
December31, 2004, all capitalized development costs were fully amortized. Impairment of Long-Lived and Intangible Assets The Company periodically reviews the values assigned to long-lived assets, including property
and certain intangible assets, to determine whether events and circumstances have occurred which
indicate that the remaining estimated useful lives may warrant revision or that the remaining
balances may not be recoverable. In such reviews, undiscounted cash flows associated with these
assets are compared with their carrying value to determine if a write-down to fair value is
required. During 2004 and 2005, the Company did not recognize any impairment charges associated
with its long-lived or intangible assets. The evaluation of asset impairment requires management to make assumptions about future cash
flows over the life of the asset being evaluated. These assumptions require significant judgment,
and actual results may differ from assumed and estimated amounts. 53 Table of Contents 1. Organization and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies continued Impairment of Goodwill The Company evaluates the carrying value of goodwill and other intangible assets annually as
of December31 and between annual evaluations if events occur or circumstances change that would
more likely than not reduce the fair value of the reporting unit below its carrying amount. Such
circumstances could include, but are not limited to, 1a significant adverse change in legal
factors or in business climate, 2unanticipated competition, or 3an adverse action or
assessment by a regulator. When evaluating whether the goodwill or other intangible asset is
impaired, the Company compares the fair value of the reporting unit to which the goodwill or other
intangible asset is assigned to its carrying amount, including goodwill and the other intangible
assets. If the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value, then the amount of the
impairment loss must be measured. The impairment loss would be calculated by comparing the implied
fair value of reporting unit goodwill to its carrying amount. In calculating the implied fair
value of goodwill or other intangible assets, the fair value of the reporting unit is allocated to
all of the other assets and liabilities of that unit based on their fair values. The excess of the
fair value of a reporting unit over the amount assigned to its other assets and liabilities is the
implied fair value of goodwill. The Company performed its periodic review of its goodwill and
other intangible assets for impairment as of December 31, 2003, 2004 and 2005, and did not identify
any asset impairment as a result of the review. Accrued Liabilities As of December31, 2004 and 2005, accrued liabilities consisted of the following in

Guarantees and Indemnifications The Company accounts for guarantees in accordance with Financial Interpretation No45 FIN
45, Guarantors Accounting and Disclosure Requirements for Guarantees, Including Indirect
Guarantees of Indebtedness of Others. The Companys sales agreements with customers generally
contain infringement indemnity provisions. Under these agreements, the Company agrees to
indemnify, defend and hold harmless the customer in connection with patent, copyright or trade
secret infringement claims made by third parties with respect to the customers authorized use of
the Companys products and services. The indemnity provisions generally provide for the Companys
control of defense and settlement and cover costs and damages finally awarded against the customer,
as well as the Companys modification of the product so it is no longer infringing or, if it cannot
be corrected, return of the product for a refund. The sales agreements with customers sometimes
also contain indemnity provisions for death, personal injury or property damage caused by the
Companys personnel or contractors in the course of performing services to customers. Under these
agreements, the Company agrees to indemnify, defend and hold harmless the customer in connection
with death, personal injury and property damage claims made by third parties with respect to
actions of the Companys personnel or contractors. The indemnity provisions generally provide for
the Companys control of defense and settlement and cover costs and damages finally awarded against
the customer. The indemnity obligations contained in sales agreements generally have no specified
expiration date and no specified monetary limitation on the amount of award covered. The Company
has not previously incurred costs to settle claims or pay awards under these indemnification
obligations. The Company accounts for these indemnity obligations in accordance with SFAS No5,
Accounting for Contingencies, and records a liability for these obligations when a loss is probable
and reasonably estimable. The Company has not recorded any liabilities for these agreements as of
December31, 2005. The Company warrants to its customers that its software products will perform in all material
respects in accordance with the standard published specifications in effect at the time of delivery
of the licensed products to the customer for 90days after first use of the licensed products, but
no more than 24months after execution of the license agreement. Additionally, the Company
warrants to its customers that services will be performed consistent with generally accepted
industry standards or specific service levels through completion of the agreed upon services. If
necessary, the Company will provide for the estimated cost of product and service warranties based
on specific warranty claims and claim history. However, the Company has not incurred significant
recurring expense under product or service warranties. As a result, the Company believes the
estimated fair value of these agreements is nominal. Accordingly, the Company has no liabilities
recorded for these agreements as of December31, 2005. 54 Table of Contents 1. Organization and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies continued Segment Information The Company has three operating segments: Americas, EMEA, and Asia Pacific as defined by SFAS
No131, Disclosures about Segments of an Enterprise and Related Information. See Note 8 for
discussion of our operating segments. Advertising Costs Advertising costs are expensed as incurred and totaled approximately $855,000, $534,000 and
$380,000 in 2003, 2004 and 2005, respectively. Advertising costs are included in sales and
marketing on the Consolidated Statements of Income. Basic and Diluted Net Income Per Share Basic net income per share is computed using net income divided by the weighted average number

Options to purchase 1,866,351 shares, 3,020,952 shares and 5,873,108 shares of common
stock were outstanding during the years ended December31, 2003, 2004 and 2005, respectively, but
were not included in the computation of diluted earnings per share because the options exercise
price was greater than the average market price of the common shares during the respective years.
See Note 3 for further information on those securities. Stock-Based Compensation The Company accounts for its stock-based compensation plan for stock issued to employees under
Accounting Principles Board APB Opinion No25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees,
and, accordingly, records deferred compensation for options granted at an exercise price below the
fair value of the underlying stock. The deferred compensation is presented as a component of
equity in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets and is amortized over the periods to be
benefited, generally the vesting period of the options. Effective in fiscal year 1996, the Company
adopted the pro forma disclosure option for stock-based compensation issued to employees of SFAS
No123, Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation. Pro forma information regarding net income and net income per share is required by SFAS No.
123, which also requires that the information be determined as if the Company had accounted for its
employee stock option grants under the fair value method required by SFAS No123. The fair value

On December12, 2005, the Board of Directors approved an Option Acceleration Agreement
that accelerated the vesting of unvested stock options held by the Companys employees with an
exercise price of $2209 or higher. As a result of the acceleration, the Company recorded pro
forma expense of approximately $269million equal to the unamortized fair value of the options. On December16, 2004, the FASB issued FASB Statement No123 revised 2004, Share-Based
Payment, which is a revision of FASB Statement No123, Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation.
Statement 123R supersedes APB Opinion No25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees, and
amends FASB Statement No95, Statement of Cash Flows. Generally, the approach in Statement 123R
is similar to the approach described in Statement 123. However, Statement 123R requires all
share-based payments to employees, including grants of employee stock options, to be recognized in
the income statement based on their fair values. Pro forma disclosure is no longer an alternative. Statement 123R must be adopted no later than January1, 2006. Early adoption will be
permitted in periods in which financial statements have not yet been issued. Statement 123R permits public companies to adopt its requirements using one of two methods 1. A modified prospective method in which compensation cost is recognized beginning with the
effective date abased on the requirements of Statement 123R for all share-based payments
granted after the effective date and bbased on the requirements of Statement 123 for all
awards granted to employees prior to the effective date of Statement 123R that remain unvested
on the effective date. 2. A modified retrospective method, which includes the requirements of the modified
prospective method described above, but also permits entities to restate based on the amounts
previously recognized under Statement 123 for purposes of pro forma disclosures either aall
prior periods presented or bprior interim periods of the year of adoption. We will adopt Statement 123R beginning on January1, 2006 using the modified prospective
method. 56 Table of Contents 1. Organization and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies continued As permitted by Statement 123, the Company currently accounts for share-based payments to
employees using Opinion 25s intrinsic value method and, as such, generally recognize no
compensation cost for employee stock options. Accordingly, the adoption of Statement 123Rs fair
value method will have a significant impact on the Companys
results of operations. The Company expects to incur an additional
$6million to $8million of after tax expense in 2006 for
employee stock compensation. This estimated range could be impacted
by significant changes in the Companys stock price, changes in
the level of share-based payments, and changes in employee turnover
rates. Statement 123R also requires the benefits of tax deductions in excess of recognized compensation cost to be
reported as a financing cash flow, rather than as an operating cash flow as required under current
literature. This requirement will reduce net operating cash flows and increase net financing cash
flows in periods after adoption. While the Company cannot estimate what those amounts will be in
the future because they depend on, among other things, when employees exercise stock options, the
amount of operating cash flows recognized in prior periods for such excess tax deductions were
$142million, $97million, and $19 million in 2003, 2004 and 2005, respectively. Comprehensive Income The Companys comprehensive income includes net income, foreign currency translation
adjustments and unrealized gains and losses on short-term investments. The components of
accumulated other comprehensive income lossas of December31, 2004 and 2005, net of tax, are as

New Accounting Pronouncements In December2004, the FASB issued FASB Staff Position FSP Financial Accounting Standard
FAS 109-1, Application of FASB Statement No109, Accounting for Income Taxes, to the Tax
Deduction on Qualified Production Activities Provided by the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004
the Act that provides tax relief to U.S. domestic manufacturers. The FSP states that the
manufacturers deduction provided for under the Act should be accounted for as a special deduction
in accordance with Statement 109 rather than as a tax rate reduction. Also in December2004, the
FASB issued FSP FAS 109-2, Accounting and Disclosure Guidance for the Foreign Earnings
Repatriation Provision within the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004, addressing accounting and
disclosure guidance relating to a companys repatriation program. The additional disclosures
required under this staff position are included in Note 2, Income Taxes. Both FSPs were effective
upon issuance. In December2004, the FASB issued SFAS 153, Exchange of Non-monetary Assets SFAS 153.
SFAS 153 addresses the measurement of exchanges of non-monetary assets. The guidance in APB
Opinion No29, Accounting for Non-monetary Transactions APB 29, is based on the principle
that exchanges of non-monetary assets should be measured based on the fair value of the assets
exchanged. The guidance in APB 29, however, included certain exceptions to that principle. SFAS
153 amends APB 29 to eliminate the exception for non-monetary exchanges of similar productive
assets and replaces it with a general exception for exchanges of non-monetary assets that do not
have commercial substance. A non-monetary exchange has commercial substance if the future cash
flows of the entity are expected to change significantly as a result of the exchange. This
Statement is effective for financial statements for fiscal years beginning after June15, 2005.
The adoption of this statement is not expected to have a material impact on our consolidated
financial statements. In May2005, the FASB issued SFAS 154, Accounting Changes and Error Corrections A
replacement of APB Opinion No20 and FASB Statement No3 SFAS 154. The FASB issued SFAS 154
to provide guidance on the accounting for and reporting of error corrections. Unless otherwise
impracticable, it establishes retrospective application as the required method for reporting a
change in accounting principle in the absence of explicit transition requirements specific to the
newly adopted accounting principle. SFAS 154 also provides guidance for determining whether
retrospective application is impracticable and for reporting an accounting change when
retrospective application is impracticable. Furthermore, this statement addresses the reporting of
a correction of an error in previously issued financial statements by restating previously issued
financial statements. This Statement is effective for financial statements for fiscal years
beginning after December15, 2005. The adoption of this statement is not expected to have a
material impact on our consolidated financial statements. 57 Table of Contents 2. Income Taxes The Company is subject to future federal and state income taxes and has recorded net deferred
tax assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheets at December31, 2004 and 2005. Deferred tax assets

The income tax benefits related to the exercise of stock options were allocated to
additional paid-in capital. Such amounts were approximately $14,170,000, $9,686,000, and
$1,920,000 for 2003, 2004 and 2005, respectively. As a result of losses in foreign locations, the Company has net operating loss carry-forwards
NOLs of approximately $57million available to offset future income. Approximately
$14 million of the NOLs expire in 2010 to 2012, and the remainder does not expire. The Company currently has a tax holiday in India through March2009. As a result of this
holiday, the Company had income of approximately $771,000, $2,028,000 and $2,417,000 in 2003, 2004,
and 2005 that was not subject to tax. The impact on diluted earnings per share if the income had
been taxable was decreases of $001, $002 and $003 per share in 2003, 2004, and 2005,
respectively. 58 Table of Contents 2. Income Taxes continued Deferred taxes are not provided for temporary differences of approximately $55million, $87
million, and $131million as of December31, 2003, 2004 and 2005, respectively, representing
earnings of non-U.S. subsidiaries that are intended to be permanently reinvested. Those earnings
are considered to be indefinitely reinvested; accordingly, no provision for U.S. federal and state
income taxes has been provided thereon. Upon repatriation of those earnings, in the form of
dividends or wise, the Company would be subject to both U.S. income taxes subject to
adjustment for foreign tax credits and withholding taxes payable to various foreign countries. In October2004, the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004 the Act was signed into law. The
Act provides for a special one-time deduction of 85% of certain foreign earnings that are
repatriated. This provision did not impact the Company as the Company did not repatriate any funds
in 2005. The following is a summary of the items that cause recorded income taxes to differ from taxes
computed using the statutory federal income tax rate for the years ended December31, 2003, 2004

As

and development credits and intercompany transactions. 3. Stock Option Plans The Manhattan Associates LLC Option Plan the LLC Option Plan became effective on January
1, 1997. The LLC Option Plan is administered by a committee appointed by the Board of Directors.
The options are granted at terms determined by the committee; however, the options cannot have a
term exceeding ten years. Options granted under the LLC Option Plan have vesting periods ranging
from immediately to six years. Subsequent to February28, 1998, no additional options could be
granted pursuant to the LLC Option Plan. Prior to the establishment of the LLC Option Plan, the Company issued options to purchase
661,784 shares of common stock to certain employees. These grants contain provisions similar to
options issued under the LLC Option Plan. The Manhattan Associates, Inc. 1998 Stock Incentive Plan the Stock Incentive Plan was
adopted by the Board of Directors and approved by the shareholders in February1998. The Stock
Incentive Plan provides for the grant of incentive stock options. Optionees have the right to
purchase a specified number of shares of common stock at a specified option price and subject to
such terms and conditions as are specified in connection with the option grant. The Stock
Incentive Plan is administered by the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors. The
committee has the authority to adopt, amend and repeal the administrative rules, guidelines and
practices relating to the Stock Incentive Plan generally and to interpret the provisions thereof.
Options granted under the Stock Incentive Plan cannot have a term exceeding ten years and typically
vest over a period of two to six years. 59 Table of Contents 3. Stock Option Plans continued As of December31, 2005, the Stock Incentive Plan provides for issuance of up to 14,962,257
shares of common stock subject to adjustment in the event of stock splits and other similar
events, less the number of shares issued under the LLC Option Plan, in the form of stock options
and other stock incentives. The number of shares available for issuance under the Plan is
automatically adjusted, without shareholder approval, on the first day of each fiscal year,
beginning with the 2000 fiscal year, by a number of shares such that the total number of shares
reserved for issuance under the Plan equals the sum of ithe aggregate number of shares
previously issued under the Plan and the LLC Option Plan; iithe aggregate number of shares
subject to then outstanding stock incentives granted under the Plan and the LLC Option Plan; and
iii5% of the number of shares of common stock outstanding on the last day of the preceding
fiscal year. However, no more than 1,000,000 of the shares available for grant each year shall be
available for issuance pursuant to incentive stock options, and no more than 10,000,000 shares
resulting from such automatic adjustments may ever be issued during the term of the Plan. A summary of changes in outstanding options is as follows

As of December31, 2003 and 2004, the Company had options exercisable of 2,977,321 and
4,084,665, respectively. At December31, 2005, the Company has 8,416,654 shares of common stock reserved for issuance
and 250,488 shares available for future grant under the Stock Incentive Plan. On January1, 2006,
the number of shares of common stock available for future grant under the Stock Incentive Plan was
increased by 1,047,853 in accordance with the automatic adjustment described above. 60 Table of Contents 3. Stock Option Plans continued On December12, 2005, the Board of Directors approved an Option Acceleration Agreement that
accelerated the vesting of unvested stock options held by the Companys employees with an exercise
price of $2209 or higher. The accelerated vesting affected options for approximately 19million
shares of the Companys common stock, including options for approximately 570,000 shares held by
the Companys executive officers. In order to prevent unintended personal benefits to individuals
resulting from the accelerated vesting of options, the Company imposed sales restrictions on shares
acquired upon exercise of these options that parallel the vesting requirements of the original
options. These sales restrictions on the shares acquired continue following termination of
employment until the original vesting dates are reached. The decision to accelerate vesting of these stock options with exercise prices greater than
the then-current market value underwater when the acceleration agreement was approved was made
primarily to avoid recognizing compensation expense in the Companys future income statements upon
the Companys adoption on January1, 2006 of SFAS No123 revised 2004, Share-Based Payment
SFAS 123R. SFAS 123R will require all share-based payments to Company employees and
non-management directors, including grants of stock options, to be recognized in the Companys
financial statements based on their fair values. Because the options subject to the accelerated
vesting are underwater, the Company believes that these options may not be offering a sufficient
incentive to its employees when compared to the future compensation expense that the Company would
incur under SFAS 123R with respect to these options. The Company recorded deferred compensation of $232,000 and $1,290,000 during 2003 and 2004,
respectively, for the issuance of 8,109 and 45,803 shares of restricted stock under the stock
incentive plan. No shares of restricted stock were issued during 2005. The weighted average grant
date fair value of the restricted stock issued during 2003 and 2004 was $2859 and $2816,
respectively. The Company amortizes deferred compensation over the vesting periods on a
straight-line basis. The Company recorded compensation expense of $52,000, $1,101,000 and $184,000
for the years ended December31, 2003, 2004 and 2005, respectively, and had deferred compensation
expense of $387,000 and $203,000 at December31, 2004 and 2005, respectively. 4. Shareholders Equity During 2004 and 2005, the Company purchased 885,400 and 2,827,200 shares of the Companys
common stock for approximately $21,763,000 and $61,011,000, respectively, through open market
transactions as part of a publicly-announced buy-back program. No shares of the Companys common
stock were purchased during 2003. 5. Commitments and Contingencies Leases Rents charged to expense were approximately $5,020,000, $5,907,000 and $6,257,000 for the
years ended December31, 2003, 2004 and 2005, respectively. The leases for the Companys
headquarters in Atlanta, Georgia expire on March31, 2008, at which time the Company has the option
to renew for an additional five years at then current market rates. The lease on the Companys
headquarters included a lease incentive which was recorded as an increase in leasehold improvements
and deferred rent. The Company assumed a facility lease through the Evant acquisition with
rates in excess of market value. The Company recorded the fair value of this unfavorable lease
obligation in deferred rent and is amortizing the amount over the remaining lease term. 61 Table of Contents 5. Commitments and Contingencies continued Aggregate future minimum lease payments under the capital lease and noncancellable operating

Employment Agreements The Company has
entered into employment contracts with certain executives and other key
employees. The agreements provide for total severance payments of up to approximately $20million
for termination of employment for any reason other than cause. Payment terms vary from a lump sum
payment to equal monthly installments over a period of not more than 24months. No amounts have
been accrued because the amounts cannot be reasonably estimated. Legal and Other Matters The Company
has continued to have challenging discussions with a large German customer
regarding their delayed implementation of Manhattans warehouse management system. During the
second quarter of 2005, the Company recorded a $28million bad debt provision for the entire
amount of the accounts receivable due from the large customer, as the collection was determined to be
doubtful. The $28million bad debt provision is the
Companys best estimate of costs to be incurred from
the termination of this business relationship. However, this amount may change
if the issue results in litigation or if a settlement is reached that
is not covered by corporate insurance policies. It is not possible at this time to estimate the amount
of any such potential costs. While no assurance can be given regarding the outcome of the matter
discussed, because of the nature and inherent uncertainties of disputes, should the outcome of this
matter be unfavorable, the Companys business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows
could be materially adversely affected. From time to
time, the Company may be involved in litigation relating to claims arising out of
its ordinary course of business. Many of the Companys installations involve products that are
critical to the operations of its clients businesses. Any failure in a Company product could
result in a claim for substantial damages against the Company, regardless of the Companys
responsibility for such failure. Although the Company attempts to limit contractually its liability
for damages arising from product failures or negligent acts or omissions, there can be no assurance
the limitations of liability set forth in its contracts will be enforceable in all instances. Other
than the matter with the large German customer, the Company is not presently involved in any
material litigation. However, it is involved in various legal proceedings. The Company believes
that any liability that may arise as a result of these proceedings will not have a material adverse
effect on its financial condition. The Company expenses legal costs associated with loss
contingencies as such legal costs are incurred. 62 Table of Contents 6. Acquisitions ReturnCentral On June30, 2003, the Company acquired certain assets of ReturnCentral for a cash payment of
approximately $175million. The purchase price includes the earnout of approximately $12million
recorded through December31, 2005, based upon the total ReturnCentral software and services fees
received and recognized prior to August31, 2005. The earnout payment for the first twelve months
was the sum of: i30% of all ReturnCentral software fees up to and including $800,000; plus 33%
of all ReturnCentral software fees greater than $800,000 and up to and including $13million; plus
36% of all ReturnCentral software fees greater than $13million and up to and including $20
million; plus 40% of all ReturnCentral software fees greater than $20million; and ii13% of all
ReturnCentral service fees. The earnout payment for the following fourteen month period was the
sum of: i30% of all ReturnCentral software fees up to and including $20million; plus 33% of
all ReturnCentral software fees greater than $20million and up to and including $30million;
plus 36% of all ReturnCentral software fees greater than $30million and up to and including $40
million; plus 40% of all ReturnCentral software fees greater than $40million; and ii13% of all
ReturnCentral service fees. The results of operations are included in operations after June30,
2003. The entire purchase price has been recorded as acquired developed technology and is being
amortized over the greater of the amount computed using athe ratio that current gross revenues
for a product bear to the total of current and anticipated future gross revenues for that product
or bthe straight-line method over the remaining estimated economic life of the product 5years
including the period being reported on. Streamsoft On October14, 2003, the Company closed an Asset Purchase Agreement with Streamsoft, a
provider of warehouse optimization software. The Company acquired substantially all of the assets
of Streamsoft for a purchase price of approximately $22million. The purchase price includes the
earnout of approximately $425,000 recorded through December31, 2005, based upon the total
Streamsoft software fees received and recognized prior to September30, 2005. The earnout payment
was calculated as 10% of all net software fees recognized, subject to additional terms and
conditions, as defined in the purchase agreement. The acquisition has been accounted for under the
purchase method of accounting, and the results of operations are included in operations after
October14, 2003. The purchase price has been allocated to net assets acquired of $02million,
acquired developed technology of $02million, and other
intangible assets of $18million.
Acquired developed technology is being amortized over the greater of the amount computed using a
the ratio that current gross revenues for a product bear to the total of current and anticipated
future gross revenues for that product or bthe straight-line method over the remaining estimated
economic life of the product 5years including the period being reported on. Approximately $01
million of other intangible assets is being amortized over a ten-year useful life. The remaining
$17million of other intangible assets is goodwill, which is not being amortized, but is being
reviewed for impairment on an annual basis. Avere On January23, 2004, the Company acquired certain assets of Avere, Inc. Avere, a provider
of order management software. The Company completed the acquisition to enhance its product

Avere software fees greater than $2million and up to and including $4million; and iii35% of
the Avere software fees greater than $4million. The entire purchase price has been recorded as
acquired developed technology and is being amortized over the greater of the amount computed using
athe ratio that current gross revenues for a product bear to the total of current and
anticipated future gross revenues for that product or bthe straight-line method over the

$472million includes $23million of bonuses paid to employees not retained by Manhattan pursuant
to an employee bonus plan approved by Evants management the Evant Bonus Plan. In addition to
the $472million cash paid, the Company paid $28million into escrow at closing for employee
retention purposes pursuant to the Evant Bonus Plan. These funds are being distributed to
employees upon completion of up to 12months of service with Manhattan. The $28million has been
recorded as a prepaid asset, and is being recorded as compensation expense ratably over the
required employee retention period. As of December31, 2005, the prepaid asset balance was $16
million relating to the bonuses. Of the cash paid, $40million is being held in escrow for 14

recorded deferred tax assets of $152million for deductible research and development costs
previously capitalized by Evant for tax purposes as well as book and tax basis differences in
property and equipment. The Company also adjusted and reduced the value assigned to customer
contracts by $03million. Goodwill decreased by a corresponding amount of $149million. The allocation of purchase price is based on preliminary estimates of fair value and is
subject to revision mainly based upon the finalization of managements assessment of the fair value
of the acquired deferred tax assets. The weighted average amortization period of the intangible assets subject to amortization is
approximately 56years. Goodwill of $22million was allocated to the EMEA operating segment; the
remaining goodwill of $201million was allocated to the Americas operating segment. The Goodwill
will not be amortized, but will be reviewed for impairment on an annual basis. Goodwill is not
deductible for tax purposes. Unaudited pro forma operating results for the years ended December31, 2004 and 2005, assuming
that the Evant acquisition had occurred at the beginning of each respective year, is as follows in

7. Severance, Restructuring, Acquisition, and Accounts Receivable Charges During the third quarter of 2003, the Company recorded expenses of approximately $885,000 in
the Americas relating to fees incurred in connection with two potential acquisitions that the
Company decided not to consummate. The acquisition-related expenses are presented as a separate
line item in the Consolidated Statements of Income. The expenses consist primarily of legal,
accounting and travel expenses associated with the two transactions. During the second quarter of 2003, the Company recorded a restructuring charge relating to an
internal reorganization of $893,000 in the Americas. The restructuring charge is presented as a
separate line item in the Consolidated Statements of Income. The reorganization more closely
aligns the Companys customer advocates with implementation teams, and the customer support
organization with the technical teams. The charge consists primarily of one-time severance
payments to 25 employees. The Company anticipates no further costs relating to this reorganization.
Approximately $857,000 of the charge was paid during 2003 and the remaining $36,000 was paid
during 2004. During 2005, the Company recorded $63million of severance, restructuring, acquisition, and
accounts receivable charges. Included in the charges were: ia $28million EMEA bad debt
provision for the entire amount of the accounts receivable due from a large German customer with which the
Company has had a challenging relationship and for which collection is considered to be doubtful;
iiapproximately $11million in EMEA severance-related costs associated with the consolidation
of the Companys European operations into the Netherlands, United Kingdom and France; iii $19
million of Americas severance-related costs and amortization of prepaid retention bonuses
associated with the acquisition of Evant; and iv $05million in Americas acquisition-related
costs associated with an attempted acquisition that did not close. The $28million bad debt
provision is the Companys best estimate of costs to be incurred from the termination of the
business relationship with the large challenging customer.
However, this amount may change if the issue results in litigation or
if a settlement is reached that is not covered by corporate insurance policies.
It is not possible at this time to estimate the amount of any such potential costs. As part of the
restructuring in Europe, the Company eliminated 17 sales and professional services positions
throughout Europe. All payments relating to the restructuring of the European operations were paid
during 2005. The Company does not anticipate any further costs relating to the restructuring in
future quarters. The severance-related 65 Table of Contents 7. Severance, Restructuring, Acquisition, and Accounts Receivable Charges continued costs and amortization of prepaid retention bonuses associated with Evant consisted primarily of
one-time payments to employees not retained due to duplicative functions. Approximately $16
million of the $19million of Americas severance-related costs and amortization of prepaid
retention bonuses was paid prior to December31, 2005, and the remaining $03million will be paid
during 2006. The acquisition-related costs incurred consisted of outside legal and accounting due
diligence expenses. 8. Operating Segments In 2003 and 2004, the Company conducted business in one operating segment, providing supply
chain execution solutions. During 2005, the Company changed its management structure and began
managing the business by geographic segment. The Company has identified its Americas segment, its
EMEA segment and its Asia Pacific segment as operating segments. The information for all periods
presented reflects these new segments. All segments derive revenue from the sale and
implementation of the Companys supply chain execution and planning solutions, of which the
individual products are similar in nature and help companies manage the effectiveness and
efficiency of their supply chain. The Company uses the same accounting policies for each operating
segment. The chief executive officer and chief financial officer evaluate performance based on
revenue and operating results for each region. The Americas segment charges royalty fees to the other segments based on software licenses
sold by those operating segments. The royalties, which totaled
$15million, $15million, and
$21million in 2003, 2004, and 2005, respectively, are included in cost of revenue for each
segment with a corresponding reduction in Americas cost of revenue. The revenues represented below
are from external customers only. The geographical-based costs consist of costs of professional
services personnel, direct sales and marketing expenses, cost of infrastructure to support the
employees and customer base, billing and financial systems and management and support team. There
are certain corporate expenses included in the Americas region that are not charged to the other
segments including research and development, certain marketing and general and administrative costs
that support the global organization and the amortization of acquired developed technology.
Included in the Americas costs are all research and development costs including the costs
associated with the offshore development center in India. The operating expenses for the Americas
segment include $34million, $36million, and $45million of amortization expense of intangible
assets in 2003, 2004 and 2005, respectively. In accordance with SFAS No131, Disclosures about Segments of an Enterprise and Related
Information, the Company has included a summary of the financial information by operating segment.

The quarterly data above for the quarters ended March31, 2005, June30, 2005 and
September30, 2005 have been restated from what was previously reported in the Form 10-Qs for the
respective periods. The restatement resulted from the Company not providing the appropriate sales
tax liability for sales taxes in certain states during the years ended December31, 2000 through
December31, 2004. General and administrative expenses decreased by $327,000, $291,000, and
$241,000 from what was previously reported in the Form 10-Qs for the quarters ended March31,
2005, June30, 2005, and September30, 2005, respectively, due to recoveries of previously expensed
sales tax resulting from the expiration of sales tax audit statutes in certain states. As a
direct result of the decrease in general and administrative expenses, income taxes increased by
$127,000, $112,000, and $94,000 from what was previously reported in the Form 10-Qs for the
quarters ended March31, 2005, June30, 2005, and September30, 2005, respectively. See the Form
10-K/A filed on March1, 2006 for further details on the restatement. 68 Table of Contents Item1. Business

PART II
Item 5. Controls and Procedures Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures We have established disclosure controls and procedures to ensure that material information
relating to the Company, including its consolidated subsidiaries, is made known to the officers who
certify the Companys financial reports and to other members of senior management and the Board of
Directors. Based on their evaluation as of December31, 2005, the principal executive officer and
principal financial officer of the Company have concluded that, due to the material weaknesses
discussed in Managements Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting on pages 37 and 38
hereof, the Companys disclosure controls and procedures as defined in Rules13a-15e and
15d-15e under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 were not effective to ensure that the
information required to be disclosed by the Company in the reports that it files or submits under
the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time
periods specified in SEC rules and forms. The material weaknesses identified by management relate to the accounting for sales taxes and
the accounting for income taxes. Accounting for Sales Taxes. As of December31, 2005, the Companys controls over monitoring
the completeness and accuracy of sales taxes, including the determination and reporting of sales
taxes payable were insufficient. Specifically, the Company did not have personnel with sufficient
skills and experience to enable the Company to properly determine whether certain consulting and
maintenance services were considered taxable transactions in certain states. These control
deficiencies resulted in material adjustments to the general and administrative expense and accrued
liability accounts in the 2005 annual and quarterly consolidated financial statements and the
restatement of the annual consolidated financial statements for 2002, 2003 and 2004, and for each
of the quarters in the years ended December31, 2003 and 2004 for which an amended Annual Report on
Form 10-K was filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on March1, 2006. Accounting for Income Taxes. As of December31, 2005, the Companys review and approval
controls over the accounting for income taxes, including the determination and reporting of income
taxes payable, deferred income tax assets and liabilities and the related income tax provision were
insufficient. Specifically, the Company did not have personnel with sufficient skills and
experience to enable the Company to properly consider and apply generally accepted accounting
principles for taxes, and ensure that the rationale for certain tax positions was adequately
documented and appropriately communicated. Additionally, the Company did not maintain effective
controls to review and monitor the accuracy of the components of the income tax provision
calculations and the related deferred income taxes and income taxes payable. These control
deficiencies resulted in the restatement of the annual consolidated financial statements for 2002,
2003 and 2004,and for each of the quarters in the years ended December31, 2003 and 2004 for which
an amended Annual Report on Form 10-K was filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on
March1, 2006. No adjustments were necessary to the 2005 annual or interim financial statements as
a result of these deficiencies. However, until this material weakness is remediated, there is a
more than remote likelihood that a misstatement of the income tax provision and the related
deferred income taxes and income taxes payable accounts could occur that would not be prevented or
detected by the Companys internal controls. We have improved our internal controls over our tax function related to accounting for income
taxes and sales taxes by   
Increasing the Companys internal tax resources through the hiring of a Sales and Use Tax Manager   
Retaining external tax advisors to prepare the quarterly tax provision and offer tax technical advice   
Expanding the level of review and discussion of significant tax matters and supporting
documentation with senior finance management; and   
Reviewing, with a third-party tax expert, our sales tax systems and the criteria set for
the identification of transactions subject to sales tax liability. 69 Table of Contents However, since these improved internal controls have not been put in place and functioning for more
than 1 quarter of the year, it was not practically possible to appropriately test the controls and
ensure their effectiveness during the year. Managements Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting Managements assessment of the effectiveness of the Companys internal control over financial
reporting as of December31, 2005 and the attestation report of Ernst Young LLP on managements
assessment of the Companys internal control over financial reporting are contained on pages 37
through 40 of this report. Change in Internal Control over Financial Reporting There are no changes in the Companys internal control over financial reporting that occurred
during the Companys last fiscal quarter that have materially affected or are reasonably likely to
materially affect the Companys internal control over financial reporting, other than as described
above relating to the improved controls over our tax function related to accounting for income
taxes and sales taxes. Item1. Business
