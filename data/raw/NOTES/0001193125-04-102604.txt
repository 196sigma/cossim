AND FINANCIAL DISCLOSURE  None.  Item 9A. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES  The Company carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the
participation of the Companys management, including the Companys Chief Executive Officer and its Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of the Companys disclosure
controls and procedures as defined in Rule 13a-15e of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. Based upon that evaluation, the Companys Chief Executive Officer along with the Companys Executive Vice President and Chief

fiscal quarter ended March 31, 2004, there has been no change in our internal control over financial reporting as defined in Rule 13a 15f under the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934, as amended that has materially affected, or is
reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
