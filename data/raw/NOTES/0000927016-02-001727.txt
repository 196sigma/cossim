ITEM 8:  FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA
REPORT OF INDEPENDENT ACCOUNTANTS
To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of Waters Corporation In our opinion, the accompanying consolidated balance sheets and the related
consolidated statements of operations, of stockholders' equity and comprehensive
income, and of cash flows present fairly, in all material respects, the
financial position of Waters Corporation and Subsidiaries at December 31, 2001
and 2000, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of
the three years in the period ended December 31, 2001, in conformity with
accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. In
addition, in our opinion, the accompanying financial statement schedule presents
fairly, in all material respects, the information set forth therein when read in
conjunction with the related consolidated financial statements. These financial
statements and financial statement schedule are the responsibility of the
Company management; our responsibility is to express an opinion on these
financial statements and financial statement schedule based on our audits. We
conducted our audits of these statements in accordance with auditing standards
generally accepted in the United States of America, which require that we plan
and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial
statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a
test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial
statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates
made by management, and evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.
We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. s/ PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP

24          NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
In thousands, except per share data
1 | DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS, ORGANIZATION AND
BASIS OF PRESENTATION
Waters Corporation Waters or the Company, an analytical instrument
manufacturer, is the world largest manufacturer and distributor of high
performance liquid chromatography HPLC instruments, chromatography columns
and other consumables, and related service. The Company believes it has the
largest HPLC market share in the United States, Europe and non-Japan Asia and
believes it has a leading position in Japan. HPLC, the largest product segment
of the analytical instrument market, is utilized in a broad range of industries
to detect, identify, monitor and measure the chemical, physical and biological
composition of materials, and to purify a full range of compounds. Through its
Micromass Limited Micromass subsidiary, the Company believes it is a market
leader in the development, manufacture, and distribution of mass spectrometry
MS instruments, which are complementary products that can be integrated and
used along with other analytical instruments, especially HPLC. Through its TA
Instruments, Inc. TAI subsidiary, the Company believes it is also the
world leader in thermal analysis, a prevalent and complementary technique used
in the analysis of polymers. As discussed in Note 15 to the financial
statements, these three operating segments have been aggregated into one
reporting segment for financial statement purposes.
2 | SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
Use Of Estimates
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted
accounting principles in the Unites States of America requires management to
make estimates and assumptions that affect i the reported amounts of assets
and liabilities, ii disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the
dates of the financial statements and iii the reported amounts of revenues and
expenses during the reporting periods. Actual results could differ from those
estimates.
Risks And Uncertainties
The Company is subject to risks common to companies in the analytical instrument
industry, including, but not limited to, development by the Company or its
competitors of new technological innovations, dependence on key personnel,
protection of proprietary technology, and compliance with regulations of the
U.S. Food and Drug Administration and similar foreign regulatory authorities and
agencies.
Reclassification
Certain amounts in previous years' financial statements have been reclassified
to conform to current presentation.
Principles Of Consolidation
The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and
its subsidiaries, most of which are wholly owned. The Company consolidates
entities in which it owns or controls fifty percent or more of the voting shares
unless control is likely to be temporary. All material intercompany balances and
transactions have been eliminated.
Translation Of Foreign Currencies
For most of the Company foreign operations, assets and liabilities are
translated into U.S. dollars at exchange rates prevailing on the balance sheet
date while revenues and expenses are translated at average exchange rates
prevailing during the period. Any resulting translation gains or losses are
included in accumulated other comprehensive loss in the consolidated balance
sheets. During 2001, approximately 57% of the Company net sales were derived
from operations outside the United States. Gains and losses from foreign
currency transactions are included in selling, general and administrative
expenses in the consolidated statements of operations and were not material in
2001 and 2000.
Cash And Cash Equivalents
Cash equivalents primarily represent highly liquid investments, with original
maturities of 90 days or less, in repurchase agreements and money market funds
which are convertible to a known amount of cash and carry an insignificant risk
of change in value. The Company has periodically maintained balances in various
operating accounts in excess of federally insured limits.
Concentration Of Credit Risk
The Company sells its products and service to a significant number of large and
small customers throughout the world, with approximately 63% of 2001 net sales
to the pharmaceutical industry. None of the Company individual customers
account for more than 3% of annual Company sales. The Company performs
continuing credit evaluation of its customers and generally does not require
collateral, but in certain circumstances may require letters of credit or
deposits. Historically, the Company has not experienced significant bad debt
losses.
25 Inventory
The Company values all of its inventories at the lower of cost or market on a
first-in, first-out basis FIFO.
Income Taxes
Deferred income taxes are recognized for temporary differences between financial
statement and income tax basis of assets and liabilities.
Property, Plant And Equipment
Property, plant and equipment is recorded at cost. Expenditures for maintenance
and repairs are charged to expense while the costs of significant improvements
are capitalized. Depreciation is provided using the straight-line method over
the following estimated useful lives: buildings and improvements - thirty years,
leasehold improvements - fifteen years or life of lease, and production and
other equipment - three to ten years. Upon retirement or sale, the cost of
assets disposed and the related accumulated depreciation are eliminated from the
balance sheet and related gains or losses are reflected in income.
Software Development Costs
The Company capitalizes software development costs for products offered for sale
in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standard SFAS 86.
Capitalized costs are amortized to cost of sales on a straight-line basis over
the estimated useful lives of the related software products, generally three to
five years. Capitalized software costs included in other assets were $21,585 and
$16,975 at December 31, 2001 and 2000, net of accumulated amortization of
$13,177 and $8,419, respectively.
The Company capitalizes internal software development costs in accordance
with Statement of Position 98-1, Accounting for the Costs of Computer Software
Developed or Obtained for Internal Use. Capitalized internal software
development costs are amortized on a straight-line basis over ten years. For the
years ended December 31, 2001 and 2000, capitalized internal software included
in property, plant and equipment totaled $2,505 and $2,890, net of accumulated
amortization of $1,345 and $960, respectively.
Patent, Trademark And Intellectual Property Costs
Other assets includes costs associated with acquiring and successfully defending
Company patents, trademarks and intellectual properties such as licenses. These
costs are amortized over their expected useful lives. Patent, trademark and
intellectual property costs included in other assets totaled $14,561 and $7,245,
net of accumulated amortization of $3,487 and $1,858, at December 31, 2001 and
2000, respectively.
Purchased Technology And Goodwill
Purchased technology and other intangibles are recorded at their fair market
value as of the acquisition date and amortized over estimated useful lives
ranging from four to fifteen years. Goodwill has been amortized on a
straight-line basis over its useful life, primarily forty years for current
goodwill components. Purchased technology and other intangibles included in
other assets totaled $24,287 and $24,703, net of accumulated amortization of
$19,308 and $16,668, at December 31, 2001 and 2000, respectively.
Debt Issuance Costs
Debt issuance costs are amortized over the life of the related debt using the
effective interest method. At December 31, 2001 and 2000, debt issuance costs
included in other assets amounted to $124 and $336, net of accumulated
amortization of $3,539 and $3,327, respectively.
Investments
The Company accounts for its investments that represent less than twenty percent
ownership using SFAS 115, Accounting for Certain Investments in Debt and Equity
Securities. This standard requires that certain debt and equity securities be
adjusted to market value at the end of each accounting period. Unrealized market
gains and losses are charged to earnings if the securities are traded for
short-term profit. Otherwise, these securities are considered available-for-sale
investments and unrealized gains and losses are charged or credited to other
comprehensive income loss in stockholders' equity. Realized gains and losses
on sales of investments are included in the consolidated statements of
operations.
Investments for which the Company does not have the ability to exercise
significant influence and for which there is not a readily determinable market
value are accounted for under the cost method of accounting. The Company
periodically evaluates the carrying value of its investments accounted for under
the cost method of accounting and carries them at the lower of cost or estimated
net realizable value. For investments in which the Company owns or controls
between twenty and forty-nine percent of the voting shares, or over which it
exerts significant influence over operating and financial policies, the equity
method of accounting is used. The Company share of net income or losses of
equity investments is included in the consolidated statements of operations and
was not material in any period presented. All investments at December 31, 2001
and 2000 are included in other assets.
Asset Impairment
The Company reviews its long-lived assets and goodwill for impairment in
accordance with SFAS 121, Accounting for the Impairment of Long-Lived Assets and
for Long-Lived Assets to be Disposed of. Whenever events or circumstances
indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable, the
Company evaluates the net realizable value of the asset, relying on a number of
factors including but not limited to operating results, business plans, economic
projections and anticipated future cash flows. Any change in the carrying amount
of an asset as a result of the Company evaluation is recorded in other expense
in the consolidated statements of operations.
26 Stockholders' Equity
On February 27, 2001, the Board of Directors approved an amendment to the
Company Certificate of Incorporation to increase authorized common stock from
two hundred million to four hundred million shares, which was approved by
shareholders at the Annual Meeting on May 3, 2001.
On July 13, 2000, the Board of Directors approved a two-for-one common
stock split, in the form of a 100% stock dividend. Shareholders of record on
August 4, 2000 received the stock dividend on or about August 25, 2000. All
share and per share amounts have been retroactively restated to reflect the
stock split.
On February 29, 2000, the Board of Directors approved an amendment to the
Company Certificate of Incorporation to increase authorized common stock from
one hundred million to two hundred million shares, and on May 4, 2000,
shareholders approved the amendment.
Hedge Transactions
Effective January 1, 2001, the Company adopted SFAS 133, Accounting for
Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities, as amended, which establishes
accounting and reporting standards for derivative instruments, including certain
derivative instruments embedded in other contracts, and for hedging activities.
All derivatives, whether designated in hedging relationships or not, are
required to be recorded on the balance sheet at fair value as either assets or
liabilities. If the derivative is designated as a fair value hedge, the changes
in the fair value of the derivative and of the hedged item attributable to the
hedged risk are recognized in earnings. If the derivative is designated as a
cash flow hedge, the effective portions of changes in the fair value of the
derivative are recorded in other comprehensive income OCI and are recognized
in earnings when the hedged item affects earnings; ineffective portions of
changes in fair value are recognized in earnings. The impact of adopting SFAS
133 on January 1, 2001 was not material to the Company.
The Company currently uses derivative instruments to manage exposures to
foreign currency risks. The Company objectives for holding derivatives are to
minimize foreign currency risk using the most effective methods to eliminate or
reduce the impact of foreign currency exposure. The Company documents all
relationships between hedging instruments and hedged items, and links all
derivatives designated as fair value, cash flow or foreign currency hedges to
specific assets and liabilities on the balance sheet or to specific forecasted
transactions. The Company also assesses and documents, both at the hedges'
inception and on an ongoing basis, whether the derivatives that are used in
hedging transactions are highly effective in offsetting changes in fair values
or cash flows associated with the hedged items.
The Company has operations in various countries and currencies throughout
the world. As a result, the Company financial position, results of operations
and cash flows are affected by fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates.
The Company uses debt swap agreements to partially mitigate such effects, and
these agreements are designated as foreign currency hedges of a net investment
in foreign operations. These agreements effectively swap higher U.S. dollar
fixed rate borrowings for lower fixed rate borrowings denominated in the
respective currencies. The effects of these debt swap agreements are included in
interest income for the years presented. During 2001, the Company opened and
subsequently closed debt swap agreements, in European and Japanese currencies.
In December 2001, the Company entered into new debt swap agreements in Japanese
yen, with a notional amount totaling $27,000, with a term of three months and an
interest rate of 15%. For the year ended December 31, 2001, the Company
recorded a cumulative net pre-tax gain of $7,800 in OCI, which consisted of a
realized gain of $6,803 relating to the closed debt swap agreements and an
unrealized gain of $997 relating to the new Japanese yen swap agreements, both
of which partially offset hedged foreign exchange impacts. At December 31, 2000,
the Company did not have any open debt swap agreements and for the year ended
December 31, 2000, a realized gain of $15,202 was recognized in accumulated
other comprehensive loss.
The Company also enters into forward foreign exchange contracts, not
designated as cash flow hedging instruments under SFAS 133, principally to hedge
the impact of currency fluctuations on certain intercompany balances. Principal
hedged currencies include the euro and British pound. The periods of these
forward contracts typically range from three to six months and have varying
notional amounts which are intended to be consistent with changes in
intercompany balances. Gains and losses on these forward contracts are recorded
in selling, general and administrative expenses in the consolidated statements
of operations. Foreign currency gains and losses from currency fluctuations on
intercompany balances and these forward contracts were not material for the
years presented. At December 31, 2001 and December 31, 2000, the Company held
forward foreign exchange contracts with notional amounts totaling approximately
$54,100 and $60,000, respectively.
Revenue Recognition And Change In Accounting
Sales of products and services are generally recorded based on product shipment
and performance of service, respectively. Proceeds received in advance of
product shipment or performance of service are recorded as deferred revenue in
the consolidated balance sheets.
Effective January 1, 2000, the Company changed its method of revenue
recognition for certain products requiring installation in accordance with Staff
Accounting Bulletin SAB 101, Revenue Recognition in Financial Statements.
Previously, the Company recognized revenue related to both the sale and the
installation of certain products at the time of shipment. The larger of the
contractual cash holdback or the fair value of the installation service is now
deferred when the product is shipped and recognized as a multiple element
arrangement in accordance with SAB 101 when installation is complete. The
cumulative effect of the change on prior years resulted in a charge to income of
$10,771 net of an income tax benefit of $3,785, which is included in income
for the year ended December 31, 2000. The adoption of SAB 101 had virtually no
effect on the Company 2000 results of operations excluding the cumulative
effect. For the year ended December 31, 2000, the Company recognized $17,561 in
revenue, which is the entire amount of revenue associated with the cumulative
effect adjustment as of January 1, 2000.
27   The following unaudited Pro Forma results of operations for the year ended
December 31, 1999 give effect to the adoption of SAB 101 as if the change in
accounting occurred at the beginning of that period.
Year Ended
Unaudited Pro Forma Results            December 31, 1999
-             Net income available to common stockholders        $ 118,860
Net income per basic common share               $97
Net income per diluted common share              $90
Product Warranty Costs
The Company provides for estimated warranty costs at the time of sale which are
included in cost of sales in the consolidated statements of operations.
Field Service Expenses
All expenses of the Company field service organization are included in
selling, general and administrative expenses in the consolidated statements of
operations.
Advertising Costs
All advertising costs are expensed as incurred and included in selling, general
and administrative expenses in the consolidated statements of operations.
Advertising expenses for 2001, 2000 and 1999 were $7,621, $7,774 and $7,161,
respectively.
Research And Development Costs
Internal research and development costs are expensed as incurred. Third-party
research and development costs are expensed when the contracted work is
performed.
Income Loss Per Share
In accordance with SFAS 128, Earnings Per Share, the Company presents two
earnings per share EPS amounts. Income loss per basic common share is
based on income available to common shareholders and the weighted average number
of common shares outstanding during the periods presented. Income loss per
diluted common share includes additional dilution from potential common stock,
such as stock issuable pursuant to the exercise of stock options outstanding and
the conversion of debt. Accretion, cumulative dividends and gain on redemption
of preferred stock have been included in computing income loss per share.
Comprehensive Income Loss
The Company accounts for comprehensive income loss in accordance with SFAS
130, Reporting Comprehensive Income. The statement establishes standards for
reporting and displaying comprehensive income and its components in a full set
of general-purpose financial statements. The statement requires that all
components of comprehensive income be reported in a financial statement that is
displayed with the same prominence as other financial statements.
Retirement Plans
The Company adopted SFAS 132, Employers' Disclosures about Pensions and Other
Postretirement Benefits. The statement standardizes employer disclosure
requirements about pension and other postretirement benefit plans by requiring
additional information on changes in the benefit obligations and fair values of
plan assets and eliminating certain disclosures that are no longer useful. It
does not change the measurement or recognition of those plans.
Recent Accounting Standards Changes
In June 2001, the Financial Accounting Standards Board FASB issued SFAS 141,
Business Combinations and SFAS 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets. SFAS
141 requires that all business combinations be accounted for under the purchase
method only and that certain acquired intangible assets in a business
combination be recognized as assets apart from goodwill. SFAS 142 requires that
ratable amortization of goodwill be replaced with periodic tests of the
goodwill impairment and that intangible assets other than goodwill be
amortized over their useful lives. SFAS 141 is effective for all business
combinations initiated after June 30, 2001 and for all business combinations
accounted for by the purchase method for which the date of acquisition is after
June 30, 2001. The provisions of SFAS 142 will be effective for fiscal years
beginning after December 15, 2001, and will thus be adopted by the Company, as
required, in fiscal year 2002. Goodwill amortization was approximately $40
million in fiscal year 2001. The impact of impairment, if any, of goodwill on
the Company financial statements has not yet been determined.
In June 2001, the FASB issued SFAS 143, Accounting for Asset Retirement
Obligations. The provisions of SFAS 143 apply to all entities that incur
obligations associated with the retirement of tangible long-lived assets. SFAS
143 is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning
after June 15, 2002, and will thus be adopted by the Company, as required, in
fiscal year 2003. The Company does not expect the application of SFAS 143 to
have a material impact on its financial position or results of operations.
28   In August 2001, the FASB issued SFAS 144, Accounting for the Impairment or
Disposal of Long-Lived Assets. SFAS 144 provides guidance on the accounting for
the impairment or disposal of long-lived assets. The objectives of SFAS 144 are
to address significant issues relating to the implementation of SFAS 121,
Accounting for the Impairment of Long-Lived Assets and for Long-Lived Assets to
be Disposed of, and to develop a single model based on the framework
established in SFAS 121 for long-lived assets to be disposed of by sale,
whether previously held or newly acquired. SFAS 144 is effective for financial
statements issued for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2001 and,
generally, its provisions are to be applied prospectively. The Company does not
expect the application of SFAS 144 to have a material impact on its financial
position or results of operations.
3 | BUSINESS INVESTMENTS AND ACQUISITIONS
In June 2000, the Company formed a strategic alliance with Variagenics, Inc.
Variagenics to develop and commercialize genetic variance reagent kits for
use in the clinical development of pharmaceutical products. Variagenics is a
leader in applying genetic variance information to the drug development process.
In July 2000, the Company paid Variagenics $75 million for a minority common
stock equity ownership and $30 million for a license to manufacture and sell
reagents, and warrants to purchase common stock. The warrants to purchase
Variagenics common stock are exercisable at $14 per share for a period of 5
years. The warrants were valued at approximately $7 million using the
Black-Scholes model. The Company could pay up to $40 million in future
milestone payments and is obligated to pay royalties on net sales of the reagent
kits. The common stock and warrant investments in Variagenics are included in
other assets and carried at fair value with unrealized gains and losses reported
as a separate component of other comprehensive income loss. The carrying
amount of the common stock and warrants in Variagenics was approximately $17
million and $69 million at December 31, 2001 and 2000, respectively. The
license is being amortized on a straight-line basis over its useful life of 15
years.
In the fourth quarter of 2001, the Company recorded a $71 million charge
to other expense, in the consolidated statements of operations, for the
impairment of certain equity investments, primarily the equity investment in
Variagenics, Inc. At December 31, 2001, no other investments and long-lived
assets were determined to be impaired.
In November 2000, the Company entered into an agreement to make a minority
equity investment in GeneProtTM, Inc. GeneProt of $36 million Series B
Preferred Stock, which is included in other assets at December 31, 2001 and 2000
and accounted for under the cost method of accounting. In December 2001, the
Company formed a strategic alliance with GeneProt to collaborate on product
development in the application of mass spectrometry equipment to
industrial-scale proteomics drug discovery. As part of the strategic alliance,
the Company will purchase $100 million of Series B Preferred Stock equity
securities and GeneProt will purchase up to $200 million of mass spectrometry
equipment, related systems, and services. The additional investment in GeneProt
equity securities was made in February 2002 as part of a second round of equity
financing and will be accounted for under the cost method of accounting. The
shipment of mass spectrometry products is planned for later in 2002 and will be
recognized as sales. The products' prices were at fair values consistent with
other orders of this magnitude. The equity investment and sales arrangement were
considered on an arms-length basis.
In December 2000, the Company entered into an agreement to make a minority
equity investment of $75 million in Caprion Pharmaceuticals Inc. Caprion.
Caprion applies proprietary processes in sub-cellular biology in combination
with its use of the Company mass spectrometry products. As of December 31,
2001 and 2000, the Company had paid $75 million and $35 million, respectively,
under this agreement. The investment in Caprion is included in other assets and
has been accounted for under the cost method of accounting. Sales to Caprion
during 2001 were approximately $40 million.
During 2001 and 2000, the Company also made business acquisitions totaling
$26 million and $17 million, respectively. The business acquisitions were
accounted for as purchases and the results of operations of the acquired
companies have been included in the consolidated results of the Company from the
acquisition date. The purchase price of the acquisitions have been allocated to
tangible and intangible assets and any assumed liabilities based on respective
fair market values. Any excess purchase price after this allocation has been
accounted for as goodwill. Fixed assets and intangible assets are being
amortized over their expected useful lives.
In the first quarter of 2002, the Company made a business acquisition
totaling approximately $55 million for the net assets of a foreign distributor
and other minority equity investments totaling $35 million.

6 | DEBT
The Company Bank Credit Agreement Agreement provided a $4500 million line
of credit through June 2002. Loans under the Agreement bore interest for each
calendar quarter at an annual rate equal to, at the Company option, 1 the
applicable LIBOR rate plus a varying margin between 30% and 100% or 2 prime
rate. Margins on LIBOR borrowings varied with the Company financial
performance. At December 31, 2001 and 2000, the Company had no aggregate
borrowings outstanding under the Agreement and had additional amounts available
to borrow of $4426 million and $4428 million, respectively, after outstanding
letters of credit. Borrowings were collateralized by substantially all of the
Company assets. The Company was also required to meet certain covenants, none
of which was considered restrictive to operations. In February 2002, the Company
entered into an agreement to replace its existing credit facility. The new
credit facility provides a $2500 million line of credit, is unsecured in nature
and has a five year term.
The Company foreign subsidiaries also had available short-term lines of
credit totaling $329 million at December 31, 2001 and $332 million at December
31, 2000. At December 31, 2001 and 2000, related short-term borrowings were $11
million at a weighted average interest rate of 5154% and $20 million at a
weighted average interest rate of 770%, respectively. In addition, at December
31, 2000 the Company had a short-term note payable of $28 million related to an
acquisition which bore interest at a fixed rate of 60%.

The tax effects of temporary differences and carryforwards
which gave rise to deferred tax assets and deferred tax
liabilities were as follows:
Tax benefit of net operating losses and credits                $103,831   $ 96,534   $ 27,778

Total deferred taxes                            $ 1,800   $ 3,641   $ 18,958
The income tax benefits associated with nonqualified stock option
compensation expense recognized for tax purposes and credited to additional
paid-in capital were $127 million, $123 million and $97 million for the years
ended December 31, 2001, 2000 and 1999, respectively. The deferred tax benefit
of net operating losses and credits is broken out as follows: $654 million in
U.S. operating loss carryforwards that begin to expire in 2019; $296 million in
foreign tax credits that begin to expire in 2005; $33 million in research and
development credits that begin to expire in 2009; $35 million in Alternative
Minimum Tax credits with no expiration date; and $20 million in foreign net
operating losses with no expiration date. Because of the magnitude of the stock
option exercises, the Company believes that it is more likely than not that the
U.S. deferred tax assets will not be realized, therefore, a valuation allowance
has reduced to zero all the deferred tax assets relating to U.S. income. The
remaining deferred tax assets relate to foreign deferred tax assets which are
expected to be utilized. To the extent that the deferred tax assets relate to
stock option deductions, the resultant benefits, if and when realized, will be
credited to stockholders' equity.
Deferred tax assets included in other current assets totaled $18 million 36 million and $56 million at December 31, 2001, 2000 and 1999, respectively.
Deferred tax assets included in other assets were zero at December 31, 2001 and
2000 and $134 million at December 31, 1999. The goodwill amortization amount
arises from the difference between the book and tax treatment of goodwill and
in-process research and development charges.
At December 31, 2001, there were unremitted earnings of foreign
subsidiaries of approximately $2405 million. The Company has not provided U.S.
income taxes or foreign withholding taxes on these earnings as it is the
Company intention to permanently reinvest the earnings outside the U.S. The
Company effective tax rate for the years ended December 31, 2001, 2000 and
1999 was 223%, 26% and 27%, respectively.
31               8 | COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES
Lease agreements, expiring at various dates through 2019, cover buildings,
office equipment and automobiles. Rental expense was approximately $12,355 in
2001, $12,695 in 2000 and $11,812 in 1999. Future minimum rents payable as of
December 31, 2001 under non-cancelable leases with initial terms exceeding one
year are as follows         
2002                   $13,024
2003                    11,054

2005                    6,260
2006 and thereafter            25,698
The Company has disbursed $19,000 in the first quarter of 2002 as part of
minority equity investments and an acquisition. This is described in more detail
in Note 3, Business Investments and Acquisitions.
From time to time, the Company and its subsidiaries are involved in various
litigation matters arising in the ordinary course of business. The Company
believes it has meritorious arguments and any outcome, either individually or
in the aggregate, with the exception of the current litigation with Applera
Corporation, will not be material to the financial position or results of
operations. See Note 17, Subsequent Event, for further information.
9 | REDEEMABLE PREFERRED STOCK
In conjunction with the August 18, 1994 acquisition of the predecessor HPLC
business of Millipore Corporation Millipore, the Company authorized and
issued one hundred shares of Redeemable Preferred Stock Preferred Stock with
a par value of $01 per share. The Preferred Stock had a liquidation value of
$10,000 and earned an annual 6% cumulative dividend on the liquidation value
with any accumulated but unpaid dividends added to the liquidation value. The
Company could, at any time, redeem the Preferred Stock at the current
liquidation value but in no event later than August 18, 2006. The Preferred
Stock was recorded at its estimated fair value of $5,000 on the date of
issuance. The excess of the liquidation value over the fair market value was
being accreted by periodic charges to additional paid-in capital or available
retained earnings since the date of issue.
On November 2, 1999, the Company redeemed all outstanding shares of
Preferred Stock, including cumulative unpaid dividends, for $9,500 in cash. The
carrying value of the one hundred shares of Preferred Stock and cumulative
dividends payable was $9,883 on that date and the transaction resulted in a gain
on redemption of $383 which was credited to additional paid-in capital.
During the year ended December 31, 1999, $322 for accretion and $503 for
unpaid dividends were charged against additional paid-in capital or available
retained earnings.
10 | STOCK COMPENSATION AND PURCHASE PLANS
Basis of Accounting
The Company has four stock-based compensation plans, which are described below.
The Company uses the intrinsic value method of accounting prescribed by
Accounting Principles Board Opinion 25, Accounting for Stock Issued to
Employees, and related interpretations, including FASB Interpretation 44,
Accounting for Certain Transactions Involving Stock Compensation, for its plans.
Accordingly, no compensation expense has been recognized for its fixed employee
stock option plans and its employee stock purchase plan under SFAS 123,
Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation. Had compensation expense for the
Company four stock-based compensation plans been recorded based on the fair
value of awards at grant date consistent with the alternative method prescribed
by SFAS 123, the Company pro forma net income for 2001, 2000 and 1999, would
have been $95,589, $135,404 and $115,857, respectively. Basic income per share
for 2001, 2000, and 1999 would have been $73, $106 and $94, respectively.
Diluted income per share for 2001, 2000, and 1999 would have been $70, $99 and
$87, respectively. The pro forma amounts include amortized fair values
attributable to options granted after December 31, 1994 only and, therefore, are
not likely to be representative of the effects on reported net income for future
years.
The fair value of each option grant under SFAS 123 was estimated on the
date of grant using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model. Relevant data are
described below

Stock Option Plans
On May 7, 1996, the Company shareholders approved the 1996 Long-Term Incentive
Plan 1996 Plan, which provides for the granting of 4,000 shares of Common
Stock, in the form of incentive or non-qualified stock options, stock
appreciation rights SARs, restricted stock or other types of awards. Under
the 1996 Plan, the exercise price for stock options may not be less than the
fair market value of the underlying stock at the date of grant. On December 2,
1997, the Board of Directors approved an additional 8,000 shares of Common Stock
for issue under the 1996 Plan. The 1996 Plan is scheduled to terminate on May 7,
2006, unless extended for a period of up to five years by action of the Board of
Directors. Options generally will expire no later than ten years after the date
on which they are granted and will become exercisable as directed by the
Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors. A SAR may be granted alone or
in conjunction with an option or other award. No SARs, restricted stock, or
other types of awards were outstanding as of December 31, 2001.
The Company 1994 Stock Option Plan 1994 Plan provided for the
granting of 20,141 options to purchase shares of Common Stock to certain key
employees of the Company. The exercise price of the options was determined by a
committee of the Board of Directors of the Company. Options granted have a term
of ten years and vest in five equal installments on the first five anniversaries
after the grant.
On May 7, 1996, the Company shareholders approved the 1996 Non-Employee
Director Deferred Compensation Plan Deferred Compensation Plan and the 1996
Non-Employee Director Stock Option Plan Director Stock Option Plan. Under
the Deferred Compensation Plan, outside directors may elect to defer their fees
and credit such fees to either a cash account which earns interest at a
market-based rate or to a common stock unit account, for which four hundred
thousand shares of Common Stock have been reserved. Under the Director Stock
Option Plan, each outside director will receive an annual option to purchase
four thousand shares of Common Stock. Two hundred thousand shares of Common
Stock may be issued under the plan. Options have a term of ten years and, with
the exception of options granted in 1996, which vest in one year, vest in five
equal installments on the first five anniversaries following the date of grant
and have option prices no less than fair market value at the date of grant.

35               13 | RETIREMENT PLANS
The Company has two retirement plans for U.S. employees: the Waters Employee
Investment Plan, a defined contribution plan, and the Waters Retirement Plan, a
defined benefit cash balance plan.
U.S. employees are eligible to participate in the Waters Employee
Investment Plan after one month of service. Employees may contribute from 1% to
20% of eligible pay on a pre-tax basis. In 2002, the maximum employee
contribution percentage of eligible pay increased from 20% to 30%. After one
year of service, the Company makes a matching contribution of 50% for
contributions up to 6% of eligible pay. Employees are 100% vested in employee
and company matching contributions. For the years ended December 31, 2001, 2000
and 1999, the Company matching contributions amounted to $2,431, $2,136 and
$1,984, respectively.
U.S. employees are eligible to participate in the Waters Retirement Plan
after one year of service. Annually, the Company credits each employee account
as a percentage of eligible pay based on years of service. In addition, each
employee account is credited for investment returns at the beginning of each
year for the prior year at the average 12 month Treasury Bill rate plus 05 limited to a minimum rate of 5% and a maximum rate of 10%. An employee does not
vest until the completion of five years of service at which time the employee
becomes 100% vested.
The net periodic pension cost under SFAS 87, Employers' Accounting for
Pensions, is made up of several components that reflect different aspects of the
Company financial arrangements as well as the cost of benefits earned by
employees. These components are determined using the projected unit credit
actuarial cost method and are based on certain actuarial assumptions. The
Company accounting policy is to reflect in the projected benefit obligation
all benefit changes to which the Company is committed as of the current
valuation date; use a market-related value of assets to determine pension
expense; amortize increases in prior service costs on a straight-line basis over
the expected future service of active participants as of the date such costs are
first recognized; and amortize cumulative actuarial gains and losses in excess
of 10% of the larger of the market-related value of plan assets and the
projected benefit obligation over the expected future service of active
participants. Summary data for the Waters Retirement Plan are presented in the
following tables

37               15 | BUSINESS SEGMENT INFORMATION
SFAS 131 establishes standards for reporting information about operating
segments in annual financial statements of public business enterprises. It also
establishes standards for related disclosures about products and service,
geographic areas and major customers. The Company evaluated its business
activities that are regularly reviewed by the Chief Executive Officer for which
discrete financial information is available. As a result of this evaluation, the
Company determined that it has three operating segments: Waters, Micromass and
TAI.
Waters is in the business of manufacturing and distributing HPLC
instruments, columns and other consumables, and related service; Micromass is in
the business of manufacturing and distributing mass spectrometry instruments
that can be integrated and used along with other analytical instruments,
particularly HPLC; and TAI is in the business of manufacturing and distributing
thermal analysis and rheology instruments. For all three of these operating
segments within the analytical instrument industry; economic characteristics,
production processes, products and services, types and classes of customers,
methods of distribution, and regulatory environments are similar. Because of
these similarities, the three segments have been aggregated into one reporting
segment for financial statement purposes. The accounting policies of the
reportable segment are the same as those described in the Summary of Significant
Accounting Policies. Please refer to the consolidated financial statements for
financial information regarding the one reportable segment of the Company. The
Company sells products and service within this reportable segment, detailed as

39               17 | SUBSEQUENT EVENT
PE Corporation since renamed Applera Corporation, MDS Inc. and Applied
Biosystems/MDS Sciex the plaintiffs have filed a civil action against
Micromass UK Limited and Micromass, Inc., wholly owned subsidiaries of the
Company, in the U.S. District Court for the District of Delaware. The plaintiffs
allege that the Quattro Ultima triple quadrupole mass spectrometer infringes
U.S. Patent No. 4,963,736 the patent. The patent is owned by MDS Inc. and
licensed to a joint venture, Applied Biosystems/MDS Sciex. The Company believes
that it does not infringe the patent and alleges the patent is invalid and
unenforceable based on inequitable conduct in the course of obtaining the patent
and the Reexamination Certificate therefor.
In March 2002, the Company was informed of a jury finding that the
Quattro Ultima with Mass Transit ion tunnel technology infringes the patent. The
same jury has found that the infringement was not willful and determined damages
in the amount of $475 million. As of the date the Company Annual Report was
published, the Court had not addressed claims brought by the Company of
inequitable conduct. Favorable rulings on these claims could render the patent
unenforceable, although the outcome is not certain. The Court may also enter an
injunction in which the Company is enjoined from making, using and selling the
Quattro Ultima triple quadrupole mass spectrometer. These instruments are
manufactured in the United Kingdom and shipments to the rest of the world
outside of the United States are not subject to the present litigation. There is
a possibility that similar claims may be asserted against the Company in other
countries and for other products in the mass spectrometry product line. Based on
the facts available to management, the Company believes the outcome of any such
claims should they be brought, cannot be predicted with certainty, but could be
material to the Company financial position, results of operations and
liquidity.
The Company intends to contest both the jury verdict and the district
court underlying patent claim construction vigorously both in post-trial
motions and, if necessary, by way of an appeal to the United States Court of
Appeals for the Federal Circuit. It believes that it has meritorious arguments
and has filed counter claims in connection with the above, alleging antitrust
violations and the invalidity of the asserted patent, among other things.
Management, after reviewing available information relating to this matter, has
determined that it is probable some liability has been incurred. The Company
believes that any liability ultimately incurred will not likely exceed the
provision described below recorded in the quarter ended December 31, 2001
including interest, court costs, legal fees and other charges. However, in the
event of an unanticipated adverse final determination in respect of certain
matters, the Company consolidated net income for the period in which such
determination occurs could be materially affected. Although sufficient
uncertainties exist to preclude the Company from precisely determining the
amount of its liability, the $750 million recorded as a patent litigation
provision in the quarter ended December 31, 2001 in the consolidated statements
of operations, is the Company best estimate of its exposure based on
information currently available.
