NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS For the Years Ended December31, 2007, 2006 and 2005 
Unless the context requires otherwise, references in this report to Qwest, we, us, the
Company and our refer to Qwest Communications InternationalInc. and its consolidated subsidiaries. References in this report to QCII refer to Qwest Communications InternationalInc. on an
unconsolidated, stand-alone basis. Note1: Business and Background We provide voice, data, Internet and video services nationwide and globally. We generate the majority of our revenue from services provided within the
14-state region of Arizona, Colorado, Idaho, Iowa, Minnesota, Montana, Nebraska, New Mexico, North Dakota, Oregon, South Dakota, Utah, Washington and Wyoming. We often refer to this region as our local service area. Note2: Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Basis
of Presentation The accompanying consolidated financial statements include our accounts and the accounts of our subsidiaries over
which we exercise control. All intercompany amounts and transactions with our consolidated subsidiaries have been eliminated. Reclassifications
We periodically evaluate the appropriateness of classifications on our consolidated balance sheets.As a result of our recent
evaluation, we have reclassified certain amounts on our consolidated balance sheets to conform to the current year presentation. These changes included the reclassification of other intangible assets of $73million as of December31, 2006.
In our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December31, 2006, other intangible assets were included in capitalized software and other intangible assetsnet. In 2007, we determined that these assets were more appropriately
classified as other non-current assets. The reclassification resulted in a change to the caption on our consolidated balance sheets from capitalized software and other intangible assets to capitalized softwarenet. We are reviewing the definitions we use to classify expenses as cost of sales, selling expenses or general and administrative expenses. We expect to make
changes to these definitions in the first quarter of 2008 to better reflect the manner in which we intend to manage our business going forward. These definitional changes will result in reclassifications between cost of sales, selling expenses and
general and administrative expenses, but will have no impact on our total operating expenses or net income for any period. Use of Estimates 
Our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of
America. These accounting principles require us to make certain estimates, judgments and assumptions. We believe that the estimates, judgments and assumptions made when accounting for items and matters such as, but not limited to, long-term
contracts, customer retention patterns, allowance for doubtful accounts, depreciation, amortization, asset valuations, internal labor capitalization rates, recoverability of assets including deferred tax assets, impairment assessments, employee
benefits, taxes, reserves and other provisions and contingencies are reasonable, based on information available at the time they are made. These estimates, judgments and assumptions can affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities as of the
date of the consolidated financial statements, as well as the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the periods 
59 Table of Contents QWEST COMMUNICATIONS INTERNATIONAL INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTSContinued For the Years Ended December31, 2007, 2006 and 2005 
presented. We also make estimates in our assessments of potential losses in relation to threatened or pending legal and tax matters. See
Note16Commitments and Contingencies. For matters not related to income taxes, if a loss is considered probable and the amount
can be reasonably estimated, we recognize an expense for the estimated loss. If we have the potential to recover a portion of the estimated loss from a third party, we make a separate assessment of recoverability and reduce the estimated loss if
recovery is also deemed probable. Effective January1, 2007, for matters related to income taxes, we apply Financial Accounting
Standards Board FASB Interpretation No. FIN 48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes FIN48. See Note3Income Taxes for further discussion. Actual results could differ from our estimates. Revenue Recognition We recognize revenue for services when the related services are provided. Recognition of certain
payments received in advance of services being provided is deferred until the service is provided. These advance payments include wireline activation fees and installation charges, which we recognize as revenue over the expected customer
relationship period ranging from one to five years. We also defer related costs for customer acquisitions. The deferral of customer acquisition costs is limited to the amount of deferral of revenue on advance payments. Costs in excess of advance
payments are recorded as expense in the period such costs are incurred. Expected customer relationship periods are estimated using historical experience. Termination fees or other fees on existing contracts that are negotiated in conjunction with
new contracts are deferred and recognized over the new contract term. Revenue on customer arrangements that include both equipment and
services is evaluated to determine whether the elements are separable based on objective evidence. If the elements are deemed separable and separate earnings processes exist, the revenue associated with each element is allocated to each element
based on the relative fair values of the separate elements. The revenue associated with each element is then recognized as earned. For example, if we receive an up-front cash payment when we sell equipment and continuing service together, we
immediately recognize as revenue the cash paid attributable to the equipment sale as long as all the conditions for revenue recognition have been satisfied. Any portion of the up-front cash payment in excess of the relative fair value of the
equipment is recognized ratably over the longer of the contractual period or the expected customer relationship period. These conditions include: iwhether the equipment has stand alone value from other services in the arrangement;
iiwhether delivery has occurred or services have been rendered; iiiwhether the customer has fully accepted the equipment; ivwhether the amount charged and the fair value for each separate element is known; and
vwhether collectibility is reasonably assured. If separate earnings processes do not exist, the total advance payment is deferred and recognized ratably over the longer of the contractual period or the expected customer relationship period.
We have periodically transferred optical capacity assets on our network to other telecommunications service carriers. These transactions
are structured as indefeasible rights of use, commonly referred to as IRUs, which are the exclusive right to use a specified amount of capacity or fiber for a specified term, typically 20years. We account for the consideration received on
transfers of optical capacity assets for cash and on all of the other elements deliverable under an IRU as revenue ratably over the term of the agreement. We have not recognized revenue on any contemporaneous exchanges of our optical capacity assets
for other optical capacity assets.

We offer some products and services that are provided by third-party vendors. We review the
relationship between us, the vendor and the end customer to assess whether revenue should be reported on a gross or net basis. As an example, the revenue from our resold satellite digital television service is reported on a net basis, while our
resold wireless service is reported on a gross basis. Our evaluation and ultimate determination of gross or net reporting is based on indicators provided in FASB Emerging Issues Task Force EITF Issue No99-19, Reporting
Revenue Gross as a Principal versus Net as an Agent EITF99-19. Allocation of Bundle Discounts We offer bundle discounts to our customers who receive certain groupings of products and services. These bundle discounts are recognized concurrently with
the associated revenue and are allocated to the various products and services in the bundled offerings. The allocation is basedon therelativevalue ofproducts included in each bundle combination. USF, Gross Receipts Taxes and Other Surcharges Our revenue and cost of sales included taxes and surcharges of $379million, $399million and $398million for the years ended December31, 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. We adopted EITF Issue No06-03, How Taxes Collected from Customers and Remitted to Governmental Authorities Should Be Presented in the Income
Statement That Is, Gross versus Net Presentation EITF06-03 for the year ended December31, 2006. EITF06-03 provides guidance regarding the accounting and financial statement presentation for certain taxes
assessed by a governmental authority. These taxes and surcharges include, among others, universal service fund charges, sales, use, value added, and some excise taxes. In determining whether to include such taxes in our revenue and expenses, we
assess, among other things, whether we are the primary obligor or principal taxpayer for the taxes assessed in each jurisdiction where we do business. In jurisdictions where we determine that we are the principal taxpayer, we record the taxes on a
gross basis and include them in our revenue and cost of sales. In jurisdictions where we determine that we are merely a collection agent for the government authority, we record the taxes on a net method and do not include them in our revenue and
cost of sales. The adoption of EITF06-03 did not change our accounting for these taxes. Advertising Costs Costs related to advertising are expensed as incurred. Advertising expense was $460million, $442million and $430million for
theyears ended December31, 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively, and is included in selling, general and administrative expenses on our consolidated statements of operations. Restructuring Charges Periodically, we commit to exit certain business activities, eliminate
administrative and network locations or significantly reduce our number of employees. At the time a restructuring plan is approved, we record a charge to our consolidated statements of operations for our estimated costs associated with the plan. We
also record a charge when we permanently cease use of a leased location. Charges associated with these exits or restructuring plans incorporate various estimates, including severance costs, sublease income and costs, disposal costs, length of time
on market for abandoned rented facilities and contractual termination costs. Estimates of charges associated with abandoned operating leases, some of which entail long-term lease obligations, are based on existing market conditions and the net
amounts that we estimate we will pay in the future. 
61 Table of Contents QWEST COMMUNICATIONS INTERNATIONAL INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTSContinued For the Years Ended December31, 2007, 2006 and 2005 
Income Taxes and Tax Valuation Allowance The provision for income taxes consists of an amount for taxes currently payable, an amount for tax consequences deferred to future periods and
adjustments to our liabilities for uncertain tax positions, including interest. We record deferred income tax assets and liabilities reflecting future tax consequences attributable to tax net operating loss carryforwards NOLs, tax
credit carryforwards and differences between the financial statement carrying value of assets and liabilities and the tax bases of those assets and liabilities. Deferred taxes are computed using enacted tax rates expected to apply in the year in
which the differences are expected to affect taxable income. The effect on deferred income tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rate is recognized in earnings in the period that includes the enactment date. We use the deferral method of accounting for federal investment tax credits earned prior to the repeal of such credits in 1986. We also defer certain
transitional investment tax credits earned after the repeal, as well as investment tax credits earned in certain states. We amortize these credits ratably over the estimated service lives of the related assets as a credit to our income tax provision
in our consolidated statements of operations. We establish valuation allowances when necessary to reduce deferred income tax assets to the
amounts that we believe are more likely than not to be recovered. Prior to 2006, we had a history of losses and, as a result, we recognized a valuation allowance for our net deferred tax assets. A significant portion of our net deferred tax assets
relate to tax benefits attributable to NOLs. Each quarter we evaluate the need to retain all or a portion of the valuation allowance on
our deferred tax assets. During 2007, we determined that it was more likely than not that we would realize the majority of our deferred tax assets, including those related to U.S. federal NOLs. In making this determination, we analyzed, among other
things, our recent history of earnings and cash flows, forecasts of future earnings, the nature and timing of future deductions and benefits represented by the deferred tax assets and our cumulative earnings for the last 12 quarters. See
Note3Income Taxes. Cash and Cash Equivalents Cash and cash equivalents include highly liquid investments with original average maturities of threemonths or less that are readily convertible into cash and are not subject to significant risk from
fluctuations in interest rates. As a result, the carrying amount of cash and cash equivalents approximates fair value. To preserve capital and maintain liquidity, we invest with financial institutions we deem to be of sound financial condition and
in high quality and relatively risk-free investment products. Our cash investment policy limits the concentration of investments with specific financial institutions or among certain products and includes criteria related to credit worthiness of any
particular financial institution. Book overdrafts occur when checks have been issued but have not been presented to certain controlled
disbursement bank accounts for payment. These bank accounts allow us to delay funding of issued checks until the checks are presented for payment. A delay in funding results in a temporary source of financing. The activity related to book overdrafts
is shown as financing activities in our consolidated statements of cash flows. Book overdrafts are included in accounts payable on our consolidated balance sheets. As ofDecember31, 2007 and 2006, the book overdraft balance was
$32million and $38million, respectively. Allowance for Doubtful Accounts The allowance for doubtful accounts receivable reflects our best estimate of probable losses inherent in our receivable portfolio determined on the basis
of historical experience, specific allowances for known troubled accounts and other currently available evidence. 
62 Table of Contents QWEST COMMUNICATIONS INTERNATIONAL INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTSContinued For the Years Ended December31, 2007, 2006 and 2005 
Property, Plant and Equipment Property, plant and equipment are carried at cost, plus the estimated value of any associated legally or contractually required retirement obligations.
Property, plant and equipment are depreciated primarily using the straight-line group method. Under the straight-line group method, assets dedicated to providing telecommunications services which comprise the majority of our property, plant and
equipment that have similar physical characteristics, use and expected useful lives are categorized in the year acquired on the basis of equal life groups for purposes of depreciation and tracking. Generally, under the straight-line group method,
when an asset is sold or retired, the cost is deducted from property, plant and equipment and charged to accumulated depreciation without recognition of a gain or loss. A gain or loss is recognized in our consolidated statements of operations only
if a disposal is abnormal or unusual. Leasehold improvements are amortized over the shorter of the useful lives of the assets or the lease term. Expenditures for maintenance and repairs are expensed as incurred. Interest is capitalized during the
construction phase of network and other internal-use capital projects. Employee-related costs directly related to construction of internal use assets are also capitalized during the construction phase. Property, plant and equipment supplies used
internally are carried at average cost, except for significant individual items for which cost is based on specific identification. We
perform annual internal studies or reviews to determine depreciable lives for our property, plant and equipment. Our studies utilize models that take into account actual usage, physical wear and tear, replacement history, assumptions about
technology evolution and, in certain instances, actuarially determined probabilities to calculate the remaining life of our asset base. We
have asset retirement obligations associated with the legally or contractually required removal of a limited group of property, plant and equipment assets from leased properties, and the disposal of certain hazardous materials present in our owned
properties. When an asset retirement obligation is identified, usually in association with the acquisition of the asset, we record the fair value of the obligation as a liability. The fair value of the obligation is also capitalized as property,
plant and equipment and then amortized over the estimated remaining useful life of the associated asset. Where the removal obligation is not legally binding, the net cost to remove assets is expensed in the period in which the costs are actually
incurred. Capitalized Software Internally used software, whether purchased or developed, is capitalized and amortized using the straight-line group method over its estimated useful life. We capitalize certain costs associated with software such as costs of employees
devoting time to the projects and external direct costs for materials and services. Costs associated with internally developed software to be used internally are expensed until the point at which the project has reached the development stage.
Subsequent additions, modifications or upgrades to internal-use software are capitalized only to the extent that they allow the software to perform a task it previously did not perform. Software maintenance and training costs are expensed in the
period in which they are incurred. The capitalization of software requires judgment in determining when a project has reached the development stage and the period over which we expect to benefit from the use of that software. We review the economic
lives of our capitalized software annually. Impairment of Long-Lived Assets We review long-lived assets, other than goodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite lives, for impairment whenever facts and circumstances
indicate that the carrying amounts of the assets may not be 
63 Table of Contents QWEST COMMUNICATIONS INTERNATIONAL INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTSContinued For the Years Ended December31, 2007, 2006 and 2005 
recoverable. For measurement purposes, long-lived assets are grouped with other assets and liabilities at the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows
are largely independent of the cash flows of other assets and liabilities. An impairment loss is recognized only if the carrying amount of the asset group is not recoverable and exceeds its fair value. Recoverability of the asset group to be held
and used is measured by comparing the carrying amount of the asset group to the estimated undiscounted future net cash flows expected to be generated by the asset group. If the asset groups carrying value is not recoverable, an impairment
charge is recognized for the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset group exceeds its fair value. We determine fair values by using a combination of comparable market values and discounted cash flows, as appropriate. Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets Intangible assets arising from business combinations, such as goodwill, customer lists, trademarks and trade names, are initially recorded at fair value. Other intangible assets not arising from business combinations are initially recorded
at cost. Intangible assets with finite lives are amortized on a straight-line basis over those lives. Where there are no legal, regulatory, contractual or other factors that would reasonably limit the useful life of an intangible asset, we classify
the intangible asset as indefinite lived and such intangible assets are not amortized. Impairment of Goodwill and Other Indefinite-Lived Intangible
Assets Goodwill and other long-lived intangible assets with indefinite lives, such as trademarks and trade names are reviewed for
impairment annually or whenever an event occurs or circumstances change that would indicate that an impairment may have occurred. These assets are carried at historical cost if their estimated fair value is greater than their carrying amounts.
However, if their estimated fair value is less than the carrying amount, goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets are reduced to their estimated fair value through an impairment charge to our consolidated statements of operations. In
July 2007, we completed our annual review and determined that the fair value of our indefinite-lived intangible assets exceeds their carrying amount. Accordingly, no impairment charge was recorded in 2007. Fair Value of Financial Instruments Our
financial instruments consist of cash and cash equivalents, short-and long-term investments, accounts receivable, accounts payable and borrowings. The carrying values of these instruments, excluding long-term borrowings, approximate their fair
values. The fair value of our long-term borrowings, including our convertible debt, was approximately $146billion and $161billion, respectively, at December31, 2007 and 2006. The fair values of our long-term borrowings are based
on quoted market prices where available or, if not available, based on discounted future cash flows using current market interest rates. Pension and
Post-Retirement Benefits Pension and post-retirement health care and life insurance benefits attributed to employees service
during the year, as well as interest on benefit obligations, are accrued currently. Prior service costs and actuarial gains and losses are generally recognized as a component of net periodic cost over one of the following periods: ithe
average remaining service period of the employees expected to receive benefits of approximately 10years; iithe average remaining life of the employees expected to receive benefits of approximately 18years; or iiithe term
of the collective bargaining agreement, as applicable. Pension and post-retirement costs are recognized over the period in which the employee renders service and becomes eligible to receive benefits as determined using the projected unit credit
method.

In computing the pension and post-retirement health care and life insurance benefit costs, the most
significant assumptions we make include employee mortality and turnover, expected salary and wage increases, discount rate, expected rate of return on plan assets, expected future cost increases, health care claims experience and our evaluation of
the legal basis for plan amendments. The plan benefits covered by collective bargaining agreements as negotiated with our employees unions can also significantly impact the amount of cost, benefit obligation and pension asset we record.
Annually, we set our discount rates based upon the yields of high-quality fixed-income investments available at the measurement date based
on our future expected cash flows of the pension and post-retirement benefit plans. In making the determination of discount rates, we used the average yields of various bond matching sources and the Citigroup Pension Discount Curve. The expected rate of return on plan assets is the long-term rate of return we expect to earn on trust assets. The rate of return is determined by the
investment composition of the plan assets and the long-term risk and return forecast for each asset class. The forecasts for each asset class are generated using historical information as well as an analysis of current and expected market
conditions. The expected rate of return on plan assets is reviewed annually and revised, as necessary, to reflect changes in the financial markets and our investment strategy. The estimate of our post-retirement benefit obligation with respect to retirees who are former occupational union employees is based on the terms of
our written benefit plans. We have a noncontributory qualified defined benefit pension plan, or the pension plan, for substantially all
management and occupational union employees. Our post-retirement benefit plans for certain current and future retirees include health care and life insurance benefits. To compute the expected return on pension and post-retirement benefit plan
assets, we apply an expected rate of return to the market-related value of the pension plan assets and to the fair value of the post-retirement plan assets adjusted for projected benefit payments to be made from the plan assets. The market-related
asset value is a computed value that recognizes changes in fair value of plan equity investments over a period of time, not to exceed fiveyears. The five-year weighted average gains and losses related to the equity assets are added to the fair
value of bonds and other assets at year-end to arrive at the market-related asset value. We recognize actual returns on our equity assets ratably over a five-year period when computing our market-related value of pension plan assets. This method has
the effect of reducing the impact on costs from annual market volatility that may be experienced from year to year. Recently Adopted Accounting
Pronouncements Effective January1, 2007, we adopted FIN48. See Note3Income Taxes for additional
information. Effective on December31, 2006, we adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standards SFAS No158,
Employers Accounting for Defined Benefit Pension and Other Postretirement Plans SFAS No158. See Note11Employee Benefits. Effective January1, 2006, we adopted SFAS No123R, Share-Based Payment SFAS No123R, which revises SFAS
No123, Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation. See Note 13Stock-Based Compensation. In December 2005, we adopted
FASB Interpretation No47, Accounting for Conditional Asset Retirement Obligations an interpretation of SFAS No143, FIN 47. See Note 7Property, Plant and EquipmentAsset Retirement Obligations.
65 Table of Contents QWEST COMMUNICATIONS INTERNATIONAL INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTSContinued For the Years Ended December31, 2007, 2006 and 2005 
Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements In February 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No159, Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities SFAS
No159. Under SFAS No159, entities may choose to measure at fair value many financial instruments and certain other items that are not currently required to be measured at fair value. SFAS No159 also establishes
recognition, presentation, and disclosure requirements designed to facilitate comparisons between entities that choose different measurement attributes for similar types of assets and liabilities. SFAS No159 does not affect any existing
accounting literature that requires certain assets and liabilities to be carried at fair value. SFAS No159 is effective for us beginning January1, 2008. The adoption of this standard did not have any impact on our financial position or
results of operations. In September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No157, Fair Value Measurements, which is effective for
us beginning January1, 2008 and provides a definition of fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value, and expands disclosures about fair value measurements for future transactions. We do not expect the adoption of this
standard to have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations. Note3: Income Taxes Valuation Allowance Between 2000 and 2005, we
reported a significant cumulative loss and generated substantial NOLs for income tax purposes. In 2006, we utilized a portion of these NOLs to offset our taxable income. However, at that time we could not sustain a conclusion that it was more likely
than not that we would realize any of the remaining NOLs and deferred tax assets. Consequently, we maintained a valuation allowance against the majority of our net deferred tax assets. During 2007, we determined that it is more likely than not that we will generate sufficient taxable income to realize the majority of our deferred tax
assets, including the NOLs. Thus, we reversed a significant portion of the valuation allowance during 2007. In making this determination, we analyzed, among other things, our recent history of earnings and cash flows, forecasts of future earnings,
the nature and timing of future deductions and benefits represented by the deferred tax assets and our cumulative earnings for the last twelve quarters. The difference in our valuation allowance between December 31, 2007 and 2006 is primarily due to
the impact on our deferred tax assets from the adoption of FIN48 of $745 million, the impact of our income before income taxes of $238 million and a decrease for other adjustments to deferred taxes of $41 million and the reversal of the
valuation allowance that resulted in a current year income tax benefit of $2133 billion. Certain deferred tax assets totaling $138million require future income of special character to realize the tax benefits. Because we are not currently
forecasting income of an appropriate character for these benefits to be realized, we continue to maintain a valuation allowance equal to the amount we do not believe is more likely than not to be realized. Adoption of FIN 48 Effective January1,
2007, we adopted FIN48, which prescribes a comprehensive model for how a company should recognize, measure, present and disclose in its financial statements uncertain tax positions that the company has taken or expects to take on a tax return.
Though the validity of any tax position is a matter of tax law, the body of statutory, regulatory and interpretive guidance on the application of the law is complex and often ambiguous. Because of this, whether a tax position will ultimately be
sustained may be uncertain. Prior to January1, 2007, the impact of an uncertain tax position that did not create a difference between the financial statement basis and the tax basis of an asset or liability was included in our income tax
provision if it was 
66 Table of Contents QWEST COMMUNICATIONS INTERNATIONAL INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTSContinued For the Years Ended December31, 2007, 2006 and 2005 
probable the position would be sustained upon audit. The benefit of any uncertain tax position that was temporary was reflected in our tax provision if it
was more likely than not that the position would be sustained upon audit. Prior to the adoption of FIN48, we recognized interest expense based on our estimates of the ultimate outcomes of the uncertain tax positions. Under FIN48, the impact of an uncertain tax position that is more likely than not of being sustained upon audit by the relevant taxing authority
must be recognized at the largest amount that is more likely than not to be sustained. No portion of an uncertain tax position will be recognized if the position has less than a 50% likelihood of being sustained. Also, under FIN48, interest
expense is recognized on the full amount of deferred benefits for uncertain tax positions. On January1, 2007, we recorded the
following FIN48 transition adjustments:  $75million decrease in our tax liabilities for uncertain tax positions;  $27million increase in interest accrued for uncertain tax positions;  $119million increase in our tax liabilities for uncertain tax positions and deferred tax assets to gross-up our balance sheet for the tax benefits of tax
credit carryforwards and NOLs that had previously been netted in our uncertain tax position liability; and  $735million increase in our deferred tax assets that was offset by a corresponding increase to our valuation allowance. See our discussion of the 2002-2003
Internal Revenue Service IRS audit below for further information. The IRS examines all of our federal
income tax returns because we are included in the coordinated industry case program. As of December31, 2007, all of the federal income tax returns we have filed since 1998 are still subject to adjustment upon audit. We also file combined
income tax returns in many states, and these combined returns remain open for adjustments to our federal income tax returns. In addition, certain combined state income tax returns we have filed since 1994 are still open for state specific
adjustments. We have agreed on a tentative settlement with the IRS related to audits for the tax years 1998 through 2001. This settlement
is subject to formal review and approval by the IRS and the Joint Committee on Taxation of the U.S. Congress. If the settlement is effected in accordance with our expectations, our total unrecognized tax benefits could decrease by approximately
$200million. We currently believe that it is reasonably likely that review and approval could occur by June30, 2008. We have
also agreed on tentative settlements with the IRS related to several of the issues raised in its audit of our 2002 and 2003 tax years. These settlements are subject to formal review and approval by the IRS. If these settlements are effected in
accordance with our expectations, our total unrecognized tax benefits could decrease by approximately $222million in the next 12months.

FIN48, interest expense and penalties related to income taxes are included in the othernet line of our condensed consolidated statements of operations. For the year ended December31, 2007, we recognized $30million for
interest expense related to uncertain tax positions. As of December31, 2007 and 2006, we had recorded liabilities for interest related to uncertain tax positions in the amounts of $90million and $33million, respectively. The
$33million liability recorded as of December31, 2006 did not reflect the $27million increase we recorded on January1, 2007 in conjunction with the adoption of FIN48. Income Tax Benefit The components of the

Other Income Tax Information As of December31, 2007, we had NOLs of $68billion, including approximately $271million related to stock compensation, the benefit of
which, if realized, will be recognized in equity. If unused, the NOLs will expire between 2009 and 2025. During 2007, our NOLs increased by $15billion and other deferred tax assets increased $860 million in connection with one particular tax
strategy. We had unamortized investment tax credits of $57million and $64million as of December31, 2007 and 2006, respectively, which are included in other long-term liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets. These investment
tax credits are amortized over the lives of the related assets. As of December31, 2007 and 2006, we also have $69million and $71million $45million and $46million net of federal income taxof state investment tax
credit carryforwards that will expire between 2008 and 2019, if not utilized. We have tax sharing agreements with previous affiliates that
require cash payments between the parties in certain situations. In 2006, we negotiated a settlement of certain issues covered by one of these agreements. As a result of the settlement, we received $135million in cash and recognized
$53million in income tax benefit, as well as $39million in interest income. This interest income was included in othernet in 2006. Due to our NOLs, we do not generally pay income taxes. However, in 2006 we made a payment of $130million related to prior years federal income tax issues, of which $74million was tax, and was
recorded as a reduction in our liability for uncertain tax positions. In 2007 and 2005, we paid immaterial amounts for income taxes. We anticipate that in 2008 we will pay approximately $136 million related to income tax settlements. Note4: Investments As of December 31, 2007, we
had $116 million invested in auction rate securities, which are classified as non-current, available-for-sale investments and included in other non-current assets on our consolidated balance sheet. As of December 31, 2006, we had $248 million
invested in auction rate securities, which were classified as short-term investments on our consolidated balance sheet. Except for the remaining $116 million of these securities, we reduced our holdings of auction rate securities during 2007 through
the auction process. Auction rate securities are generally long-term debt instruments that provide liquidity through a Dutch auction
process that resets the applicable interest rate at pre-determined calendar intervals, generally every 28 days. This mechanism generally allows existing investors to rollover their holdings and continue to own their respective securities or
liquidate their holdings by selling their securities at par value. We generally invest in these securities for short periods of time as part of our cash management program. However, the recent uncertainties in the credit markets have prevented us
and other investors from liquidating holdings of auction rate securities in recent auctions for these securities because the amount of securities submitted for sale has exceeded the amount of purchase orders. Accordingly, we still hold these
long-term securities and are due interest at a higher rate than similar securities for which auctions have cleared. These investments are fully collateralized by AA rated bonds and are insured against loss of principal and interest by bond insurers
whose AAA ratings are under review. These securities were valued using a model that takes into consideration the financial conditions of the issuer and the bond insurers as well as the value of the collateral. If the credit ratings of the issuer,
the bond insurers or the collateral deteriorate, we may further adjust the carrying value of these investments. We are uncertain as to
when the liquidity issues relating to these investments will improve. Accordingly, we classified these securities as non-current as of December 31, 2007. 
70 Table of Contents QWEST COMMUNICATIONS INTERNATIONAL INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTSContinued For the Years Ended December31, 2007, 2006 and 2005 
During the fourth quarter of 2007, a fund we historically treated as a cash equivalent began
liquidating its holdings and restricting distributions. As a result, we no longer have daily liquidity and have reclassified our holdings in the fund from cash and cash equivalents to investments on our consolidated balance sheet. The
reclassification from cash and cash equivalents to investments is presented as an investing activity in our consolidated statement of cash flow for the year ended December31, 2007. As of December31, 2007, $79million of our
remaining investment in the fund was classified as short-term investments and $10million was classified as non-current assets on our consolidated balance sheet. Note5: Earnings per Share Basic earnings per share excludes dilution and is computed by
dividing net income available to common stockholders by the weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding for the period. For purposes of this calculation, common stock outstanding does not include shares of restricted stock on which
the restrictions have not yet lapsed. Diluted earnings per share reflects the potential dilution that could occur if certain outstanding stock options are exercised, the premium on convertible debt is converted into common stock and restrictions
lapse on restricted stock awards. The following is a reconciliation of the number of shares used in the basic and diluted earnings per
share computations for the years ended December31, 2007, 2006 and 2005:  Years Ended December31 2007

$001per basic and diluted share in 2006. Asset Retirement Obligations In December 2005, we adopted FIN47, which requires us to recognize asset retirement obligations that are conditional on a future event, such as the
obligation to safely dispose of asbestos when a building is demolished or renovated under certain circumstances. Upon adoption of FIN47, we determined that we have conditional asset retirement obligations to properly dispose of, or
encapsulate, asbestos in several of our buildings, to close fuel storage tanks and to dispose of other potentially hazardous materials.In 2005, we recorded a charge of $22million liability of $26million net of an asset of
$4million for the cumulative effect of this change in accounting principle. As of December31, 2007, our asset retirement
obligations balance was primarily related to estimated future costs of removing circuit equipment from leased properties and estimated future costs of properly disposing of asbestos and other hazardous materials upon remodeling or demolishing
buildings. Asset retirement obligations are included in other long-term liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets. The following table provides asset retirement obligation activity for the years ended December31, 2007, 2006 and 2005:

During 2007, we revised our estimates of the timing and amounts of our original estimate of
undiscounted cash flows related to certain future asset retirement obligations. These revisions resulted in a reduction of $39million to our asset retirement obligations and an offsetting reduction to gross property, plant and equipment.
Note8: Capitalized Software Internally used software, whether purchased or developed, is capitalized and amortized using the straight-line group method over its estimated useful life. As of December31, 2007 and 2006, our capitalized software had carrying costs
of $2221billion and $2085billion, respectively, and accumulated amortization was $1368billion and $1267billion, respectively. Effective January1, 2007, we changed our estimates of the average economic lives of capitalized software from between four and five years to between four and seven years. For the year ended December31,
2007, amortization expense would have been higher by $120million $007 per basic and $006 per diluted share had we not changed our estimates of the average economic lives. We recorded amortization expense of $228million in 2007 for
capitalized software based on a life range of four to seven years. As of December31, 2007, the weighted average remaining life of our capitalized software was 35years. The estimated future amortization expense for capitalized software is as follows:  EstimatedAmortization Dollars inmillions

Notes Covenants As of December31, 2007, QCII had outstanding a total of $2075billion aggregate principal amount of senior notes that were issued in February 2004 and June 2005. These notes are guaranteed on a senior unsecured basis by QSC and
QCF. The indenture governing these notes limits QCIIs and its subsidiaries ability to:  incur or guarantee additional debt or issue preferred stock;  pay dividends or distributions on or redeem or repurchase capital stock;  make investments and other restricted payments;  issue or sell capital stock of restricted subsidiaries;  grant liens;  transfer or sell assets;  consolidate or merge or transfer all or substantially all of our assets; and  enter into transactions with affiliates. If the notes receive investment grade ratings, most of the covenants with respect to the notes will be subject to suspension or termination. Under the indenture governing these notes, we must repurchase the notes upon certain changes of
control. This indenture also contains provisions for cross acceleration relating to any of our other debt obligations and the debt obligations of our restricted subsidiaries in an aggregate amount in excess of $100million. We were in
compliance with all of the covenants as of December31, 2007. 
76 Table of Contents QWEST COMMUNICATIONS INTERNATIONAL INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTSContinued For the Years Ended December31, 2007, 2006 and 2005 
Repayments On October18, 2007, we redeemed $250million aggregate principal amount of QCIIs Floating Rate Senior Notes due 2009. The redemption
resulted in a loss on early retirement of debt of $4million in the fourth quarter of 2007. Also on June4, 2007, we redeemed
$250million aggregate principal amount of QCIIs Floating Rate Senior Notes due 2009. The redemption resulted in a loss on early retirement of debt of $4million. QCII Convertible Senior Notes Covenants The indenture governing the 350% Convertible Senior Notes the Indenture contains certain
covenants including, but not limited to, a limitation on mergers or sales of all, or substantially all, of the assets of QCII, which requires that a successor assume the obligation with regard to these notes. The Indenture contains provisions
requiring acceleration of payment of the notes upon an acceleration of any other debt obligations of QCII in an aggregate amount in excess of $100million. We were in compliance with all of the Indenture covenants as of December31, 2007.
Balance Sheet Classification The $1265billion of our 350% Convertible Senior Notes due 2025 the 350% Convertible Senior Notes was classified as a non-current obligation as of December31, 2007 because specified,
market-based conversion provisions were not met as of that date. These notes were classified as a current obligation as of December31, 2006 because the market-based conversion provisions were met as of that date. These market-based conversion
provisions specify that, when our common stock has a closing price above $708per share for 20or more trading days during certain periods of 30consecutive trading days, these notes become available for conversion for a period. If
our common stock maintains a closing price above $708 per share during certain subsequent periods, the notes would be available for immediate conversion and the outstanding notes would again be reclassified as a current obligation. These notes are registered securities and are freely tradable. As of December31, 2007, they had a market price of $1,332per $1,000 principal
amount of notes, compared to an estimated conversion value of $1,184. The conversion value is calculated based on the specified conversion provisions using the closing prices of our common stock during the 20trading days ended
December31,2007. Conversion Value The conversion value of the notes may be calculated prior to maturity by using an initial conversion rate of 1694341per $1,000 in principal amount of the notes or an initial conversion price of $590, adjusted
for certain events, including the payment of dividends, as described in the Indenture. The following hypothetical example of the
conversion calculation has assumed ino adjustment to the initial conversion rate or price is made or required under the terms of the Indenture, and iithe requisite conditions to an exercise of the conversion right provided under the
Indenture are satisfied: 1 If the price of our common stock exceeds $590 per share when the notes are converted, then
for every $1,000 in principal amount of the notes surrendered for conversion, the holder will receive the following:  $1,000 in cash for the principal value of the notes, and 
77 Table of Contents QWEST COMMUNICATIONS INTERNATIONAL INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTSContinued For the Years Ended December31, 2007, 2006 and 2005  the amount by which the conversion value calculated as the product of the initial conversion rate and the average of the closing sale prices of our common stock
during the conversion period as described in the Indenture exceeds $1,000. At our option, we may elect to pay all or a portion of this amount in shares of our common stock or equivalent value of cash. 2 If the price of our common stock is at or below $590 per share when the notes are converted, then for every $1,000 in principal
amount of the notes surrendered for conversion, the holder will receive the lesser of:  $1,000 in cash for the principal value of the notes, or  the conversion value, calculated as described above, in cash. In December 2007, our Board of Directors declared a dividend as described in Note 12Stockholders Equity or Deficit, and indicated the Board of Directors intent to pay a quarterly dividend going
forward. Under the Indenture, the initial conversion rate will be adjusted by any dividend payments as described in the Indenture. We will notify the Trustee and the holders of the notes in accordance with the terms of the Indenture following any
adjustment to the conversion rate. QCII Credit Facility We have available to us $850million under a revolving credit facility the Credit Facility, which is currently undrawn and expires in
October 2010. If drawn, the Credit Facility would, at our election, bear interest at a rate of adjusted LIBOR or a base rate, in each case plus an applicable margin. Such margin varies based upon the credit ratings of the facility and is currently
1625% for LIBOR based borrowings and 0625% for base rate borrowings. The Credit Facility is guaranteed by QSC and is secured by a senior lien on the stock of its wholly owned subsidiary, QC. The Credit Facility contains certain other covenants including, but not limited to, limitations on:  incurrence of indebtedness suspended while the Credit Facility remains undrawn;  restricted payments;  using any proceeds to pay settlements or judgments relating to securities-related actions discussed in Note16Commitments and Contingencies;
dividend and other payments;  mergers, consolidations and asset sales;  investments; and  liens suspended while the Credit Facility remains undrawn. In the event of certain changes of control, each lender under the Credit Facility may terminate its commitment and declare any outstanding amounts for such lenders account immediately due and payable.
The Credit Facility contains financial covenants that irequire Qwest and its consolidated subsidiaries to maintain a
debt-to-consolidated EBITDA ratio of not more than 6to1 and iirequire QC and its consolidated subsidiaries to maintain a debt-to-consolidated EBITDA ratio of not more than 25to1. Consolidated EBITDA as defined in the
Credit Facility means our net income loss adjusted for taxes, interest and non-cash and certain 
78 Table of Contents QWEST COMMUNICATIONS INTERNATIONAL INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTSContinued For the Years Ended December31, 2007, 2006 and 2005 
non-recurring items. Compliance with these financial covenants is not required while the Credit Facility remains undrawn. However, we were in compliance with
these financial covenants as of December31, 2007. The Credit Facility has a cross payment default provision, and this facility and
certain other debt issues also have cross acceleration provisions. When present, such provisions could have a greater impact on liquidity than might otherwise arise from a default or acceleration of a single debt instrument. These provisions
generally provide that a cross default under these debt instruments could occur if:  we fail to pay any indebtedness when due in an aggregate principal amount greater than $100million;  any indebtedness is accelerated in an aggregate principal amount greater than $100million; or  judicial proceedings are commenced to foreclose on any of our assets that secure indebtedness in an aggregate principal amount greater than $100million.
Upon such a cross default, the creditors of a material amount of our debt may elect to declare that a default has
occurred under their debt instruments and to accelerate the principal amounts due such creditors. Cross acceleration provisions are similar to cross default provisions, but permit a default in a second debt instrument to be declared only if in
addition to a default occurring under the first debt instrument, the indebtedness due under the first debt instrument is actually accelerated. QCF Notes Covenants The QCF notes are guaranteed by QCII on a senior unsecured basis. The indentures governing the QCF notes contain certain covenants including, but not limited to: ia prohibition on certain liens on the assets
of QCF; and iia limitation on mergers or sales of all, or substantially all, of the assets of QCF or us, which limitation requires that a successor assume the obligation with regard to these notes. These indentures do not contain any
cross-default provisions. We were in compliance with all of the covenants as of December31, 2007. Repayment
On August15, 2006, we repaid the remaining $485million of QCFs 775% Notes due August15, 2006 that matured
on that date. Debt-for-Equity Exchanges We had no debt-for-equity exchanges in 2007. During the year ended December31, 2006, we exchanged approximately $70million of existing QCF notes, plus $2million of accrued interest, for approximately
86million shares of our common stock with an aggregate value of approximately $66million at the time of issuance. The effective share price for the exchange transactions ranged from $779 per share to $872 per share principal and
accrued interest divided by the number of shares issued. The trading prices for our common stock at the times the exchange transactions were consummated ranged from $716 per share to $804 per share. As a result, we recorded a gain of
$6million on debt extinguishments. 
79 Table of Contents QWEST COMMUNICATIONS INTERNATIONAL INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTSContinued For the Years Ended December31, 2007, 2006 and 2005 
QC Notes Covenants The indentures governing the QC notes contain certain covenants including, but not
limited to: ia prohibition on certain liens on the assets of QC; and iia limitation on mergers or sales of all, or substantially all, of the assets of QC, which limitation requires that a successor assume the obligation with regard
to these notes. These indentures do not contain any cross-default provisions. We were in compliance with all of the covenants at December31, 2007. New Issues On May16, 2007, QC issued $500million aggregate principal amount of
its 65% Notes due 2017. On August8, 2006, QC issued $600million aggregate principal amount of its 75% Notes due 2014.
The aggregate net proceeds from the above offerings have been or will be used for general corporate purposes, including repayment of
indebtedness and funding or refinancing our investments in telecommunication assets. The notes are unsecured obligations of QC and rank equally in right of payment with all other unsecured and unsubordinated indebtedness of QC. The covenant and
default terms are substantially the same as those associated with QCs other long-term debt. Repayments On June7, 2007, QC redeemed $70million aggregate principal amount of its 60% Notes due 2007. On June4, 2007, QC redeemed $250million aggregate principal amount of its 87/8% Debentures due June1, 2031. The redemption
resulted in a loss on early retirement of debt of $18million. On September21, 2006, QC redeemed the remaining $90million
aggregate principal amount of its 39-year 625% debentures due January1, 2007 at face value plus accrued interest of $1million. Concurrent with the issuance of QCs 75% Notes due 2014 on August8, 2006, QC redeemed the remaining $500million aggregate principal amount of its floating rate term loan maturing in June 2007, plus accrued interest of
$3million. The redemption resulted in a loss on early retirement of debt of $9million. Registered Exchange Offers
On November26, 2007, QC commenced a registered exchange offer for its 65% Notes due 2017 pursuant to the registration rights
agreement that it entered into in connection with the issuance of these notes. QC completed the registered exchange offer on December28, 2007. On November17, 2006, QC commenced a registered exchange offer for its 75% Notes due 2014 pursuant to the registration rights agreement that it entered into in connection with the issuance of these notes. QC
completed the registered exchange offer on December20, 2006.

QCC Notes Repayment On June15, 2007, QCC repaid at maturity $314million aggregate principal
amount of its 725% Senior Notes due 2007. Interest on Debt Interest on debt includes interest on long-term borrowings and capital lease obligations. Other interest expense, such as interest on income taxes, is included in othernet in our consolidated statements of
operations. The following table presents the amount of gross interest expense, capitalized interest and cash paid for interest during the years ended December31, 2007, 2006 and 2005:  Years Ended December31 2007

operating costs, we established restructuring programs, which included workforce reductions, consolidation of excess facilities, and restructuring of certain business functions. As of December31, 2007, the remaining restructuring reserve
relates to leases for real estate that we ceased using in prior periods and consists of our estimates of amounts to be paid for these leases in excess of our estimates of any sublease revenue we may collect. We expect to use this reserve over the
remaining lease terms, which range from 03years to 180years, with a weighted average of 117years. The remaining
reserve balances are included on our consolidated balance sheets in accrued expenses and other current liabilities for the current portion and other long-term liabilities for the long-term portion. The charges and reversals are included in our
consolidated statements of operations in selling, general and administrative expense. As of December31, 2007 and 2006, our restructuring reserve was $312million and $347million, respectively. The amount included in current
liabilities was $32million and $37 million, respectively, and the long-term portion was $280million and $310million, respectively, as of those dates. For the years ended December31, 2007, 2006 and 2005, we added restructuring provisions of $6million, $21million and $40million to the reserves, respectively, we used $38million 67million and $101million, respectively, and we reversed $3million, $35million and $31million, respectively. The restructuring provisions less reversals for the plans discussed above for our wireline services segment were $0million, $0million, and $16million for 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. No amounts were recorded
81 Table of Contents QWEST COMMUNICATIONS INTERNATIONAL INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTSContinued For the Years Ended December31, 2007, 2006 and 2005 
for our wireless services segment for any periods presented. The amounts recorded for our other services segment were $3million, $14million,
and $25million for 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. Severance Severance charges are included in selling, general and administrative expenses in our consolidated statements of operations. As of December31, 2007
and 2006, our severance liability was $25million and $59million, respectively. For the years ended December31, 2007, 2006 and 2005, we accrued severance costs of $29million, $58million and $65million,
respectively. The remaining balance included charges primarily recorded in 2007, and we expect to pay substantially all of the 2007 severance charges in 2008. Note11: Employee Benefits Adoption of SFAS No158 We adopted SFAS No158 as of December31, 2006. SFAS No158 is effective in two steps. Step one required us to recognize on our
consolidated balance sheet the funded status of our defined benefit post-retirement plans. This amount is defined as the difference between the value of plan assets and benefit obligations. We were also required to recognize as a component of other
comprehensive income, net of taxes, the actuarial gains and losses and the prior service costs that arise but were not previously required to be recognized as components of net periodic benefit cost. Other comprehensive income is then adjusted as
these amounts are recognized over time as components of net periodic benefit cost. The adoption of step one resulted in an increase in the prepaid pension asset of $218million, an increase in current liabilities of $180million, a
decrease in post-retirement and other post-employment benefit obligations of $1045billion and an increase in accumulated other comprehensive income of $1083billion as of December31, 2006. Step two requires a plans measurement date to be the same as its balance sheet date and is effective beginning with our fiscal year ending on
December31, 2008. Since we currently use December31 as the measurement date of the funded status of our plans, which is the same as our balance sheet date, this step will not impact our consolidated financial statements. Pension, Post-Retirement and Other Post-Employment Benefits We sponsor a noncontributory defined benefit pension plan for substantially all management and occupational union employees. In addition to this tax qualified pension plan, we also maintain a non-qualified pension
plan for certain highly compensated employees. We maintain post-retirement benefit plans that provide health care and life insurance benefits for certain eligible retirees. We also provide other post-employment benefits for eligible former
employees. Pension The pension plan includes a traditional service-based program as well as an account balance program. Participants in the service-based program include all management employees and occupational union employees who had reached 20years
of service by December31, 2000 or who were service pension eligible by December31, 2003. The account balance program covers management employees hired after December31, 2000 and management employees who did not have 20years
of service by December31, 2000 or who were not service pension eligible by December31, 2003. Future benefits in the account balance program are based on 3% of eligible pay while actively employed plus an investment return. The investment
return on the account balance 
82 Table of Contents QWEST COMMUNICATIONS INTERNATIONAL INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTSContinued For the Years Ended December31, 2007, 2006 and 2005 
program in a given year is based upon the average 30-year U.S. Treasury interest rate in effect during August through December of the prior year and the
account balance at the beginning of the year. Our funding policy for the pension plan is to make contributions with the objective of
accumulating sufficient assets to pay all qualified pension benefits when due under the terms of the plan. No pension contributions were required in 2007 or 2006, and we do not expect to make a contribution in 2008. Post-Retirement Benefits The benefit
obligation for our occupational union health care and life insurance post-retirement plan benefits is estimated based on the terms of our written benefit plans. We consider numerous assumptions, estimates and judgments, including but not limited
to, discount rates, health care cost trend rates and mortality trend rates. In 2005, we negotiated our current three-year collective bargaining agreements. These collective bargaining agreements covered approximately 21,000 of our unionized
employees as of December31, 2007. Additionally, we submitted letters to the Union notifying the Union of intended changes in the benefits provided to former occupational retirees. These agreements and/or letters of notification to the Union
reflect changes for the eligible post-1990 retirees who are former occupational union employees, including: ia Letter of Agreement which states retirees will begin contributing to the cost of health care benefits in excess of specified
limits on the company-funded portion of retiree health care costs also referred to as caps beginning January1, 2009, rather than January1, 2006, which was the previous effective date of the caps: iithe beneficiaries
of post-1990 retirees who were former occupational union employees are eligible to receive a reduced life insurance benefit of $10,000 effective January1, 2006 and the beneficiaries of other retirees who were former occupational union
employees are eligible to receive a reduced life insurance benefit of $10,000 effective January1, 2007; and iiipost-1990 retirees pay increased out of pocket costs through plan design changes starting January1, 2006. These
changes have been considered in the determination of the benefit obligation for our occupational union employee benefits under the plan. The additional costs to us of deferring the enforcement of the caps by three years were substantially offset
by the additional benefit to us of the reduction in life insurance benefits. As a result of this exchange of benefits with the affected plan participants the retirees in this case, we have determined that the caps provision beginning
January1, 2009 is substantive. If the caps were not considered to be substantive in our determination of the benefit obligation, our current calculation of the benefit obligation would increase by approximately $20billion as of
December31, 2007. Our collective bargaining agreements with our employees unions, which expire August16, 2008, contain caps that are effective January1, 2009. We intend to enforce these health care caps beginning on that date
in order to maintain our health care costs at competitive levels. The terms of the post-retirement health care and life insurance plans
between us and our management employees and our post-1990 management retirees are established by us and are subject to change at our discretion. We have a past practice of sharing some of the cost of providing health care benefits with our
management employees and post-1990 management retirees. In 2006, we amended the health care and life insurance plans. The amendments reflect changes for the management retirees effective January1,2007. These amendments: irequire
post-1990 management retirees to cover any costs in excess of specified limits on the company-funded portion of retiree health care costs also referred to as caps; iiprovide that beneficiaries of management retirees are
eligible for a reduced life insurance benefit of $10,000; and iiirequire post-1990 management retirees to pay increased out of pocket costs. These changes have been considered in the determination of the benefit obligation for our management
employee benefits under the plans. The benefit obligation for the management post-retirement health care benefits is based on the terms of the current written plan documents and is adjusted for anticipated continued cost sharing with management
employees and post-1990 management retirees. These amendments reduced our net periodic benefit cost by approximately 
83 Table of Contents QWEST COMMUNICATIONS INTERNATIONAL INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTSContinued For the Years Ended December31, 2007, 2006 and 2005 
$50million in 2007. A putative class action purportedly filed on behalf of certain of our retirees was brought against us and certain other defendants
in Federal District Court in Colorado in connection with our decision to reduce life insurance benefits for these retirees. See Note 16Commitments and ContingenciesOther Matters for additional information. No contributions were made to the post-retirement occupational union health care trust in 2007 or 2006, and we do not expect to make a contribution in
2008. A change of one percent in the assumed initial health care cost trend rate would have had the following effects in 2007: One Percent Change Increase
Decrease Dollars inmillions

Effect on benefit obligation balance sheet 94 85
Our post-retirement health care cost for post-1990 retirees is capped at a set dollar amount
beginning January1, 2007 with respect to retirees who are former management employees. Our post-retirement health care costs for retirees who are former occupational union employees will be capped at a set dollar amount beginning
January1, 2009. Therefore, those health care benefit obligations are not subject to increasing health care trends after the effective date for the caps. Expected Cash Flows The pension, non-qualified pension and post-retirement health care and life insurance benefit
payments are paid by us or distributed from plan assets. The estimated benefit payments provided below have been reduced by participant contributions.  PensionPlan

Not applicable As of December31, 2007, we changed
the assumptions we use to determine our rate of compensation increase. Previously, we used an assumption based on age and service. Now, we use a flat rate assumption. This simplification addresses the fact that the majority of pension plan
participants are not affected by rate of compensation increases. This change did not have a material effect on the plans benefit obligation.

Plan Assets We maintain plan assets for our pension and post-retirement benefit plans. The pension plan assets are used for the payment of pension benefits. The post-retirement benefit plan assets are used only to pay health care
benefits on behalf of retirees who are former occupational union plan participants. The following table summarizes the change in the fair value of plan assets for the pension and post-retirement benefit plans as of and for the years ended

achieve an attractive risk-adjusted return that will provide for the payment of benefits and minimize the risk of large losses. Investment risk is managed by broadly diversifying plan assets across numerous strategies with differing expected
returns, volatilities and correlations. Derivative instruments primarily exchange-traded futures, forwards, swaps and options are used to reduce risk as well as enhance return. The asset allocation, or the asset class holdings as a percentage of each trusts balance, for the pension plan and post-retirement benefit plans as
of December31, 2007 and 2006 are summarized below. There are no plan assets associated with our non-qualified pension plan.  December31 PensionPlan

100 100 100 100 In 2007, we modified our pension plan investment strategy to reduce volatility relative to changes
in the qualified pension plan obligations. This strategy includes decreasing equity investments and increasing interest rate sensitive investments. The target equity allocation will be decreased over time from 60% to 35% of pension assets. The
targets for debt, real estate and other allocations will change to 45%, 5% and 15%, respectively. As a result of these changes, the expected long-term return on pension assets is being reduced to 8% as of the beginning of 2008. Target allocations
for the post-retirement benefit plan assets remain at 55% equity, 30% fixed income, 5% real estate and 10% other. As of December31, 2007 and 2006, shares of our common stock and ownership of our debt accounted for less than 05% of the assets
held in the pension and post-retirement benefit plans.

For the years ended December31, 2007 and 2006, the investment program produced an actual return
on pension and post-retirement plan assets which exceeded the expected return by $202million and $745million, respectively. The annual returns on plan assets will almost always be different from the expected long-term returns, and the
plans could experience net losses, due primarily to the volatility occurring in the financial markets during any given year. Funded Status

Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement and Modernization Act of 2003 We sponsor post-retirement health care plans with several benefit options that provide prescription drug benefits, which we deem actuarially equivalent to
Medicare PartD. We recognize the impact of the federal subsidy received under the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement and Modernization Act of 2003 in the calculation of our benefit obligation and net periodic benefit cost. The effect of
the subsidy reduced our net periodic post-retirement benefit cost by $51million, $81million and $38million for the years ended December31, 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. Other Benefit Plans Health Care and Life
Insurance We provide health care and life insurance benefits to essentially all of our active employees. We are largely self-funded for
the cost of the health care plan. Our active health care benefit costs were $288million, $291million and $281million for the years ended December31, 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. Occupational union employee benefits
are based on negotiated collective bargaining agreements. Currently these costs, other than enrollment fees and out of pocket amounts, are largely funded by us. Management and occupational union employees are required to partially fund the health
care benefits provided by us, in addition to out of pocket costs. Participating management employees contributed $37million, $35million and $35million in 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. Participating occupational union
employees contributed $5million, $5million and $0million in 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. The basic group life insurance plan is fully insured and the premiums are paid by us. 401kPlan We sponsor a
qualified defined contribution benefit plan covering substantially all management and occupational union employees. Under this plan, employees may contribute a percentage of their annual compensation to the plan up to certain maximums, as defined
by the plan and by the Internal Revenue Service IRS. Currently, we match a percentage of employee contributions in cash. As of December31, 2007 and 2006, the assets of the plan included approximately 48million and
55million shares of our common stock, respectively, as a result of the combination of our employer match and participant directed contributions. We made cash contributions in connection with our 401kplan of $67million for each of
the years ended December31, 2007 and 2006. Deferred Compensation Plans We sponsor several non-qualified unfunded deferred compensation plans for various groups that include certain of our current and former management and
highly compensated employees. Certain of these plans are open to new participants. Participants in these plans may, at their discretion, invest their deferred compensation in various investment choices including our common stock. Our deferred compensation obligations for these plans are included in our consolidated balance sheets in accrued expenses and other current liabilities
and other long-term liabilities. Investment earnings, administrative expenses, changes in investment values and increases or decreases in the deferred compensation liability resulting from changes in the investment values are recorded in our
consolidated statements of operations. Deferred compensation plan assets are included in other long-term assets on our consolidated balance sheets. Shares of our common stock owned by rabbi trusts, such as those established for our deferred
compensation

plans, are treated as treasury stock and are included at cost on our consolidated balance sheets. The values of assets and liabilities related to these plans
are not significant. Note12: Stockholders Equity or Deficit Common Stock $001 par value We are authorized to issue up to 50billion shares of
common stock with $001 par value per share. We had 1793billion and 1903billion shares issued and 1787billion and 1901billion shares outstanding as of December31, 2007 and 2006, respectively. On October4, 2006, our Board of Directors approved a stock repurchase program for up to $2billion of our common stock over two years. For the
years ended December31, 2007 and 2006, we repurchased 137million and 26million shares, respectively, of our common stock under this program at a weighted average price per share of $854 and $803, respectively. As of
December31, 2007, we had repurchased a total of $1378billion of common stock under this program. Preferred Stock $100 par value
Under our charter, our Board of Directors has the authority, without stockholder approval, to icreate one or more classes
or series within a class of preferred stock, iiissue shares of preferred stock in such class or series up to the maximum number of shares of the relevant class or series of preferred stock authorized and iiidetermine the preferences,
rights, privileges and restrictions of any such class or series, including dividend rights, voting rights, the rights and terms of redemption, the rights and terms of conversion, liquidation preferences, the number of shares constituting any such
class or series and the designation of such class or series. One of the effects of authorized but unissued and unreserved shares of capital stock may be to render more difficult or discourage an attempt by a potential acquirer to obtain control of
us by means of a merger, tender offer, proxy contest or otherwise and thereby protect the continuity of our management. The issuance of such shares of capital stock may have the effect of delaying, deferring or preventing a change in control of us
without any further action by our stockholders. We have no present intention to adopt a stockholder rights plan, but could do so without stockholder approval at any future time. As of December31, 2007 and 2006, there were 200million shares of preferred stock authorized but no shares issued or outstanding. 
Treasury Stock Deferred
CompensationRabbi Trusts Rabbi trusts were established for two of our deferred compensation plans. As of December31, 2007
and 2006, the rabbi trusts held approximately 62,000shares of our common stock with a cost of $3million. Shares of our common stock held by the rabbi trusts are accounted for as treasury stock, but are considered outstanding for legal
purposes. Forfeitures and Vesting of Restricted Stock Under our Equity Incentive Plan and restricted stock agreements, we automatically withhold a portion of vesting shares of restricted stock to cover the withholding taxes due upon vesting. As a result of forfeited and
withheld restricted stock, we acquired approximately 3,891,000, 931,000 and 60,000shares of treasury stock during 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. 
91 Table of Contents QWEST COMMUNICATIONS INTERNATIONAL INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTSContinued For the Years Ended December31, 2007, 2006 and 2005 
Debt-for-Equity Exchanges We had no debt for equity exchanges in 2007. During 2006 and 2005, we issued 86million and 383million shares, respectively, of our common stock with an aggregate value of $66million and
$145million, respectively, in exchange for certain outstanding debt. Dividends In December 2007, our Board of Directors declared a quarterly dividend of $008 per share, payable on February21, 2008 to shareholders of record on
February1, 2008. We did not declare any dividends during 2006 and 2005. Note13: Stock-Based Compensation Equity Incentive Plan We adopted an Equity
Incentive Plan EIP on June23, 1997. The EIP was most recently amended and restated on May23, 2007. The EIP permits the grant of non-qualified stock options, incentive stock options, stock appreciation rights, restricted
stock, stock units and other stock grants to selected eligible employees, consultants and non-employee members of our Board of Directors. Unless otherwise provided by the Compensation and Human Resources Committee of our Board of Directors, the EIP
provides that, upon a change in control, all awards granted under the EIP will vest immediately. The maximum number of shares of our common stock that may be issued under the EIP at any time pursuant to awards is equal to 10% of the
aggregate number of our common shares issued and outstanding reduced by the aggregate number of options and other awards then outstanding under the EIP or otherwise. Issued and outstanding shares are determined as of the close of trading on the New
York Stock Exchange on the preceding trading day. As of December31,2007, approximately 179million shares of our common stock were authorized for grant under the EIP and approximately 102million shares were available for
future issuance under the EIP. Except for awards with market-based vesting conditions, awards generally vest in equal increments over
three to fiveyears. Awards that we granted to our employees from June1999 to September2002 typically provide for accelerated vesting if the optionee is terminated without cause following a change in control. Since
September2002, awards that we grant to our officers vice president level and above typically provide for accelerated vesting and an extended exercise period upon a change of control, and awards that we grant to all other employees typically
provide for accelerated vesting if the optionee is terminated without cause following a change in control. Awards without Market Based
Vesting Conditions Stock Options The Compensation and Human Resources Committee of our Board of Directors, or its delegate, approves the exercise price for each stock option. Options generally have an exercise price that is at least equal to the fair
market value of the common stock on the date of grant, subject to certain restrictions. Options have ten-year terms.

Except for options with market-based vesting conditions, we use the Black-Scholes model to estimate
the fair value of new stock option grants and establish that fair value at the date of grant. The Black-Scholes option valuation model was developed for use in estimating the fair value of traded options, which have no vesting restrictions and are
fully transferable. Additionally, all option valuation models require the input of highly subjective assumptions including the expected life of the options and the expected stock price volatility. Because our stock options have characteristics
significantly different from traded options, and changes in the input assumptions can materially affect the fair value estimate, estimates of the fair value of our stock options are subjective. Following are the weighted-average assumptions used with the Black-Scholes option-pricing model to determine the fair value estimates of options granted
in the years ended December31,2007, 2006 and 2005:  YearsEndedDecember31 2007

Based on our stock price on the vesting dates, the fair value of restricted stock that vested during
the years ended December31,2007, 2006 and 2005 totaled $7million, $14million and $0million, respectively. Except for restricted stock with market-based vesting conditions, we use the closing price of our common stock on
the date of grant as the fair value of restricted stock. Awards with Market-Based Vesting Conditions In 2007 and 2006, we granted certain non-qualified options and restricted stock with vesting conditions tied in part to the market value of our common
stock. Because of these vesting conditions, our standard valuation models do not accurately estimate the fair value of these awards. We valued these awards using Monte-Carlo simulations to estimate the grant date fair value of each option and share
of restricted stock. We believe the most significant assumption used in our estimate of fair value is the expected volatility, which we estimated based on historical information. We did not grant any awards with market-based vesting conditions prior
to 2006. Stock Options Stock options with market-based vesting conditions activity as of and for the two-year period ended December31,2007 is summarized below:  NumberofShares

Employee Stock Purchase Plan We have an Employee Stock Purchase Plan ESPP under which we are authorized to issue 27million shares of our common stock to eligible
employees. Under the terms of our ESPP, eligible employees may authorize payroll deductions of up to 15% of their base compensation, as defined, to purchase our common stock at a price of 85% of the fair market value of our common stock on the last
trading day of the month in which our common stock is purchased. For the years ended December31,2007, 2006 and 2005, approximately 17million, 15million and 21million shares, respectively, were purchased under this
plan at weighted-average purchase prices of $716, $638 and $346 per share, respectively. Stock-Based Compensation Expense Compensation expense is included in cost of sales and selling, general and administrative expense in our consolidated statements of operations. We
recognize compensation expense relating to awards under our EIP using the straight-line method over the applicable vesting periods. We recognize compensation expense related to employee purchases under our ESPP for the difference between the
employees purchase prices and the fair 
96 Table of Contents QWEST COMMUNICATIONS INTERNATIONAL INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTSContinued For the Years Ended December31, 2007, 2006 and 2005 
market values of the stock. We have not recorded any net income tax benefit related to stock-based compensation for the year ended
December31,2007. As of December31,2007, there was $58million of total unrecognized compensation expense
related to unvested stock options and restricted stock under our EIP. We expect to recognize this amount over the remaining weighted average vesting terms of 22years. There is no unrecognized compensation expense related to the ESPP.
We do not consider capitalized stock-based compensation expense to be material. The following table presents details of our stock-based compensation for the years ended December31, 2007 and 2006:  YearsEndedDecember31 2007

Proceeds from EIP and Employee Stock Purchase Plan We issue new shares of our common stock upon the exercise of stock options, upon grants of restricted stock and upon employee purchases of our stock under our ESPP. The cash received upon exercise of stock options and from employee
purchases under our ESPP was $96million, $191million and $33 million for the years ended December31, 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. Deferred Compensation Plan for Non-Employee Directors We sponsor a deferred compensation plan for current and former
non-employee members of our Board of Directors. Under this plan, participants may, at their discretion, elect to defer all or any portion of the directors fees for the upcoming year for services they perform. Participants in the plan are fully
vested in their plan 
97 Table of Contents QWEST COMMUNICATIONS INTERNATIONAL INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTSContinued For the Years Ended December31, 2007, 2006 and 2005 
accounts. Subject to the terms of the plan, participants can suspend or change their election to defer fees in future calendaryears. Quarterly, we credit each participants account with a number of phantom units having a value equal to his or her deferred
directors fees. Each phantom unit has a value equal to one share of our common stock and is subject to adjustment for cash dividends payable to our stockholders as well as stock dividends and splits, consolidations and the like that affect
shares of our common stock outstanding. Non-employee directors participating in the plan held approximately 765,000 and 716,000 phantom units as of December31, 2007 and 2006, respectively. Subject to the terms of the plan, each
participants account will be distributed as a lump sum as soon as practicable following the end of his or her services as a director. Amounts deferred before 2005 and earnings on those amounts are subject to the distribution options elected in
advance by the participant and may be in the form of: ia lump-sum payment; iiannual cash installments over periods up to 10years; or iiisome other form selected by our chief human resources officer or his or her
designee. A change in our stock price of one dollar would not result in a significant expense impact to our consolidated financial statements. Investment earnings, administrative expenses, changes in investment values and increases or decreases in the deferred compensation liability resulting from changes in the value of our common stock are recorded in our consolidated statements
of operations. The deferred compensation liability is recorded in other long-term liabilities. The expense associated with this plan did not have a significant impact on our consolidated financial statements for the periods presented. However,
depending on the extent of appreciation in the value of our common stock, expenses incurred under this plan could become significant in subsequentyears. Adoption of SFAS No123R We adopted SFAS No123R effective January1, 2006, which requires the
measurement of compensation expense using estimates of the fair value of all stock-based awards. SFAS No123R sets forth accounting requirements for share-based compensation to employees and requires companies to recognize in
their income statements the grant-date fair value of stock options and other equity-based compensation. Prior to 2006, we accounted for stock awards granted to employees under the intrinsic-value recognition and measurement principles of Accounting
Principles Board Opinion No25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees APB No25. Under the intrinsic-value method, no compensation expense was recognized for options granted to employees when the strike price
of those options equaled or exceeded the value of the underlying security on the measurement date. 
98 Table of Contents QWEST COMMUNICATIONS INTERNATIONAL INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTSContinued For the Years Ended December31, 2007, 2006 and 2005 
We applied the modified prospective method for recognizing the expense over the remaining
vesting period for awards that were outstanding but unvested at January1, 2006. In accordance with the modified prospective method, we have not adjusted the financial statements for the periods ended prior to January1, 2006. The
following table illustrates the effect on net loss and loss per share for the year ended December31,2005 as if our stock-based compensation had been determined based on the fair value at the grant dates:  YearEndedDecember31,2005 Dollarsinmillions,except pershareamounts

On August18, 2005, the Compensation and Human Resources Committee of our Board of Directors
accelerated the vesting of all outstanding and unvested stock options that had an exercise price equal to or greater than $379, which was the closing market price of Qwests common stock on that date. The purpose of the acceleration was to
avoid recognizing future compensation expense associated with the accelerated options upon the adoption of SFAS No123R. As a result of the acceleration, 504million stock options, of which 105million stock options were held by
our executive officers, became exercisable on August18, 2005. The impact of the acceleration on net loss as shown in the above table was an increase in pro forma stock-based compensation expense of approximately $103million in 2005. This
modification affected approximately 13,000employees. Aside from the acceleration of the vesting date, the terms and conditions of the stock option agreements governing the underlying stock options remain unchanged. Note14: Segment Information Our operating
revenue is generated from our wireline services, wireless services and other services segments. Segment discussions reflect the way we currently report our operating results to our Chief Operating Decision Maker CODM. In August 2007,
Edward A. Mueller became our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer and our new CODM, and during 2007 he continued to use these same segments to evaluate performance and allocate resources. However, we will adjust our reporting segments at the
beginning of 2008 to reflect changes in how we have begun managing our business beginning in 2008. The accounting principles used to
determine segment results are the same as those used in our consolidated financial statements. Segment income consists of each segments revenue and expenses. Segment revenue is based on the types of products and services offered as described
below. Wireline and wireless segment expenses include employee-related costs except for the combined expense of pension, non-qualified pension and post-retirement benefits, facility costs, network expenses and other non-employee related costs such
as customer support, collections and telemarketing. We manage costs for administrative services such as finance, information 
99 Table of Contents QWEST COMMUNICATIONS INTERNATIONAL INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTSContinued For the Years Ended December31, 2007, 2006 and 2005 
technology, real estate, legal and human resources centrally; consequently, these costs are included in the other services segment. We evaluate depreciation,
amortization, interest expense, interest income and other income expense on a total company basis because we do not allocate our networkcosts, capital and debt costs, and non-operating income or expenses to specific segments. As a result,
these items are not assigned to any segment. Similarly, we do not include impairment charges in the segment results. Therefore, the segment results presented below are not necessarily indicative of the results of operations these segments would have
achieved had they operated as stand-alone entities during the periods presented. We generate revenue from our wireline services, wireless
services and other services as described below.  Wireline services. We provide voice services and data, Internet and video services primarily through our telecommunications network to mass markets, business
and wholesale customers. Our wireline services include:  Voice services. Voice services include local voice services, long-distance voice services and access services. Local voice services include basic local
exchange, switching and enhanced voice services. Local voice services also include network transport, billing services and providing access to our local network through our wholesale channel. Long-distance voice services include domestic and
international long-distance services. Access services include fees we charge to other telecommunications providers to connect their customers and their networks to our network.  Data, Internet and video services. Data, Internet and video services include:  broadband access, which we offer to mass markets and business customers;  more advanced data and Internet services such as data integration, private line, MPLS, web hosting and VoIP, which we offer to business and wholesale customers;
traditional data and Internet services such as ATM, frame relay, DIA, VPN, ISDN and Internet dial-up access, which we offer primarily to business and wholesale
customers; and  video services, including resold satellite digital television and traditional cable-based video, which we offer primarily to mass markets customers.
Wireless services. We sell wireless products and services, including access to a nationwide wireless network, to mass markets and business customers,
primarily within our local service area. We also offer an integrated service, which enables customers to use the same telephone number and voice mailbox for their wireless phone as for their home or business phone. Our wireless products and services
are primarily marketed to consumers as part of our bundled offerings.  Other services. Other services include the subleasing of space in our office buildings, warehouses and other properties. The revenue shown below for each segment is derived from transactions with external customers. Substantially all of our assets are in our wireline
services and other services segments.

telecommunications solutions provider, from Anschutz Digital Media, Inc., a subsidiary of Anschutz Company which is our largest stockholder, in exchange for a promissory note in the amount of $34million. The note bears interest at 6%
annually with semi-annual interest payments and annual principal payments due through 2008. During 2007, 2006 and 2005, we paid $1million, $1million and $2million in interest and $7million, $6million and $5million
in principal, respectively, on the note. As of December31, 2007, the outstanding accrued interest on the note was less than $1million and the outstanding principal balance on the note was $8million. In 2007, we paid approximately $29million in administrative fees in the ordinary course of business to United Healthcare Services, Inc., which
provides health benefit plans to some of our employees and is a subsidiary of UnitedHealth Group. Our director, Anthony Welters, serves as Executive Vice President of UnitedHealth Group and as President of its Public and Senior Markets Group.

The table does not include:  our open purchase orders as of December31, 2007. These purchase orders are generally at fair value, are generally cancelable without penalty and are part of
normal operations;  other long-term liabilities, such as reserves for legal matters and income taxes, that are not contractual obligations by nature. We cannot determine with any
degree of reliability the years in which these liabilities might ultimately settle;  non-qualified pension, post-retirement and post-employment benefits payable to certain current and future retirees, some of which are due under contractual
agreements. Pension and certain occupational post-retirement benefits are paid through trusts, and therefore are not included in this table as we are not able to reliably estimate future required contributions to the trusts, if any. As of
December31, 2007, our qualified defined benefit pension plan was fully funded. As of December31, 2007, we had a liability recorded on our balance sheet of $2389 billion representing the net benefit obligation for non-qualified pension,
post-retirement healthcare and life insurance and other post-employment benefits. Future payments under these plans are impacted by various actuarial and market assumptions and will differ from the current estimates of these payments. See further
discussion of our benefit plans in Note11Employee Benefits to our consolidated financial statements in Item8 of this report; 
103 Table of Contents QWEST COMMUNICATIONS INTERNATIONAL INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTSContinued For the Years Ended December31, 2007, 2006 and 2005  contract termination fees. These fees are non-recurring payments, the timing and payment of which, if any, is uncertain. In the ordinary course of business and to
optimize our cost structure, we enter into contracts with terms greater than one year to use the network facilities of other carriers and to purchase other goods and services. Our contracts to use other carriers network facilities generally
have no minimum volume requirements and are based on an interrelationship of volumes and discounted rates. Assuming we exited these contracts on December31, 2007, the contract termination fees based on minimum commitments would have been
approximately $404million. Under the same assumption, termination fees for contracts to purchase other goods and services would have been $144million. In the normal course of business, we believe the payment of these fees is remote; and
potential indemnification obligations to counterparties in certain agreements entered into in the normal course of business. The nature and terms of these
arrangements vary. Historically, we have not incurred significant costs related to performance under these types of arrangements.  2
Interest paid in all years may differ due to future refinancing of debt. Interest on our floating rate debt was calculated for allyears using the rates effective as of
December31, 2007.  3
We have various long-term, non-cancelable purchase commitments for advertising and promotion services, including advertising and marketing at sports arenas and other venues and
events. We also have service related commitments with various vendors for data processing, technical and software support services. Future payments under certain service contracts will vary depending on our actual usage. In the table above we
estimated payments for these service contracts based on the level of services we expect to receive. Capital Leases 
We lease certain office facilities and equipment under various capital lease arrangements. Assets acquired through capital leases during
2007, 2006 and 2005 were $14million, $21million and $50million, respectively. Assets recorded under capitalized lease agreements included in property, plant and equipment consisted of $235million, $243million and
$208million of cost less accumulated amortization of $103million, $80million and $55million at December31, 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. The future minimum payments under capital leases as of December31, 2007 are reconciled to our consolidated balance sheet as follows:  FutureMinimumPayments Dollarsinmillions

and public transportation authorities that are accounted for as operating leases. For the years ended December31, 2007, 2006 and 2005, rent expense under these operating leases was 
104 Table of Contents QWEST COMMUNICATIONS INTERNATIONAL INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTSContinued For the Years Ended December31, 2007, 2006 and 2005 
$294million, $313million and $455million, respectively, net of sublease rental income of $30million, $33million and
$35million, respectively. Operating leases as reported in the table in Future Contractual Obligations above have not been reduced by minimum sublease rental income of $198million, which we expect to realize under
non-cancelable subleases. Letters of Credit and Guarantees We maintain letter of credit arrangements with various financial institutions for up to $130million. As of December31, 2007, the amount of
letters of credit outstanding was $91million. As described further in Note20Financial Statements of Guarantors, certain
Qwest entities have guaranteed the payment of debt, leases or letter of credit obligations of other Qwest entities. Contingencies
Throughout this note, when we refer to a class action as putative it is because a class has been alleged, but not
certified in that matter. Until and unless a class has been certified by the court, it has not been established that the named plaintiffs represent the class of plaintiffs they purport to represent. Settlement classes have been certified in
connection with the settlements of certain of the putative class actions described below where the courts held that the named plaintiffs represented the settlement class they purported to represent. To the extent appropriate, we have provided reserves for each of the matters described below. The terms and conditions of applicable bylaws, certificates or articles of incorporation, agreements or applicable law may obligate us to indemnify our
former directors, officers and employees with respect to certain of the matters described below, and we have been advancing legal fees and costs to many former directors, officers and employees in connection with the securities actions and certain
other matters. Settlement of Consolidated Securities Action Twelve putative class actions purportedly brought on behalf of purchasers of our publicly traded securities between May24, 1999 and
February14, 2002 were consolidated into a consolidated securities action pending in federal district court in Colorado against us and various other defendants. The first of these actions was filed on July27, 2001. Plaintiffs alleged,
among other things, that defendants issued false and misleading financial results and made false statements about our business and investments, including materially false statements in certain of our registration statements. The most recent
complaint in this matter sought unspecified compensatory damages and other relief. However, counsel for plaintiffs indicated that the putative class would seek damages in the tens of billions of dollars. In November 2005, we, certain other defendants, and the putative class representatives entered into and filed with the federal district court in Colorado
a Stipulation of Partial Settlement that, if implemented, will settle the consolidated securities action against us and certain other defendants. No parties admit any wrongdoing as part of the settlement. Pursuant to the settlement, we have
deposited approximately $400 million in cash into a settlement fund. In connection with the settlement, we received $10 million from Arthur Andersen LLP. As part of the settlement, the class representatives and the settlement class they represent
are also releasing Arthur Andersen. If the settlement is not implemented, we will be repaid the $400 million plus interest, less certain expenses, and we will repay the $10 million to Arthur Andersen. 
105 Table of Contents QWEST COMMUNICATIONS INTERNATIONAL INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTSContinued For the Years Ended December31, 2007, 2006 and 2005 
If implemented, the settlement will resolve and release the individual claims of the class
representatives and the claims of the settlement class they represent against us and all defendants except Joseph Nacchio, our former chief executive officer, and Robert Woodruff, our former chief financial officer. In September 2006, the federal
district court in Colorado issued an order approving the proposed settlement on behalf of purchasers of our publicly traded securities between May24, 1999 and July28, 2002. Messrs. Nacchio and Woodruff appealed that order to the United
States Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit. In addressing that appeal, a panel of Tenth Circuit judges held that the federal district court order overruling Nacchio and Woodruffs objections to the settlement was not sufficiently specific,
and it instructed the district court to provide a more detailed explanation for overruling those objections. We have asked the full Tenth Circuit to review the panels decision. The ultimate outcome of the pending appeal of the decision
approving the settlement of the consolidated securities action is uncertain and could result in the payment of additional monies by us in connection with indemnification claims by Messrs. Nacchio and Woodruff. KPNQwest Litigation/Investigation In
2006, we and the other defendants reached settlements of a putative class action filed against us and others in the federal district court for the Southern District of New York on behalf of certain purchasers of publicly traded securities of
KPNQwest, N.V. of which we were a major shareholder. The plaintiffs had alleged that, among other things, defendants engaged in a fraudulent scheme and deceptive course of business in order to inflate KPNQwests revenue and the value of
KPNQwest securities. In 2007, the court approved the settlements, which were then implemented. Certain individuals and entities were excluded from the settlement class at their request. As a result, their claims were not released by the court order
approving the settlement. Some of these individuals and entities have filed actions against us, as described below, and we are vigorously defending against these claims. We expect that at least some of the other persons who were excluded from the
settlement class will also pursue actions against us if we are unable to resolve their claims amicably. In the aggregate, those who were excluded from the settlement class currently contend that they have incurred losses of at least $76million
resulting from their investments in KPNQwest securities during the settlement class period, which does not include any claims for punitive damages or interest. The amount of these alleged losses may increase or decrease in the future as we learn
more about the potential claims of those who opted out of the settlement class. Due to the fact that some of them have not filed lawsuits, it is difficult to evaluate the claims that they may assert. Regardless, we will vigorously defend against any
such claims. On October31, 2002, Richard and Marcia Grand, co-trustees of the R.M. Grand Revocable Living Trust, dated
January25, 1991, filed a lawsuit in Arizona Superior Court which, as amended, alleges, among other things, that the defendants violated state and federal securities laws and breached their fiduciary duty in connection with investments by
plaintiffs in securities of KPNQwest. We are a defendant in this lawsuit along with Qwest B.V. one of our subsidiaries, Joseph Nacchio and John McMaster, the former President and Chief Executive Officer of KPNQwest. Plaintiffs claim to have lost
approximately $10 million in their investments in KPNQwest. On June25, 2004, the trustees in the Dutch bankruptcy proceeding for
KPNQwest filed a lawsuit in the federal district court for the District of New Jersey alleging violations of the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act, and breach of fiduciary duty and mismanagement under Dutch law. We are a defendant
in this lawsuit along with Joseph Nacchio, Robert S. Woodruff and John McMaster. Plaintiffs allege, among other things, that defendants actions were a cause of the bankruptcy of KPNQwest and they seek damages for the bankruptcy deficit of
KPNQwest of approximately $24 billion. Plaintiffs also seek treble damages as well as an award of plaintiffs attorneys fees and costs. On October17, 2006, the court issued an order granting 
106 Table of Contents QWEST COMMUNICATIONS INTERNATIONAL INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTSContinued For the Years Ended December31, 2007, 2006 and 2005 
defendants motion to dismiss the lawsuit, concluding that the dispute should not be adjudicated in the United States. Plaintiffs have appealed this
decision to the United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit. On June17, 2005, Appaloosa Investment Limited Partnership I,
Palomino Fund Ltd., and Appaloosa Management L.P. filed a lawsuit in the federal district court for the Southern District of New York against us, Joseph Nacchio, John McMaster and Koninklijke KPN N.V., or KPN. The amended complaint alleges that
defendants violated federal securities laws in connection with the purchase by plaintiffs of certain KPNQwest debt securities. Plaintiffs seek compensatory damages, as well as an award of plaintiffs attorneys fees and costs. 
On September13, 2006, Cargill Financial Markets, Plc and Citibank, N.A. filed a lawsuit in the District Court of Amsterdam, The Netherlands,
against us, KPN Telecom B.V., KPN, Joseph Nacchio, John McMaster, and other former employees or supervisory board members of us, KPNQwest, or KPN. The lawsuit alleges that defendants misrepresented KPNQwests financial and business condition in
connection with the origination of a credit facility and wrongfully allowed KPNQwest to borrow funds under that facility. Plaintiffs allege damages of approximately 219million or approximately $320million based on the exchange
rate on December31, 2007. On August23, 2005, the Dutch Shareholders Association Vereniging van Effectenbezitters, or VEB
filed a petition for inquiry with the Enterprise Chamber of the Amsterdam Court of Appeals, located in The Netherlands, with regard to KPNQwest. VEB sought an inquiry into the policies and course of business at KPNQwest that are alleged to have
caused the bankruptcy of KPNQwest in May 2002, and an investigation into alleged mismanagement of KPNQwest by its executive management, supervisory board members, joint venture entities us and KPN, and KPNQwests outside auditors and
accountants. On December28, 2006, the Enterprise Chamber ordered an inquiry into the management and conduct of affairs of KPNQwest for the period January1 through May23, 2002. We and others have appealed that order to the
Netherlands Supreme Court. Purporting to speak for an unspecified number of shareholders, VEB also sought exclusion from the settlement
class in the settlements of the KPNQwest putative securities class action described above. The information that VEB provided in support of its request for exclusion did not indicate the losses claimed to have been sustained by VEB or the unspecified
shareholders that VEB purports to represent, and thus those claims are not included in the approximately $76 million of losses claimed by those who requested exclusion from the settlement class, as described above. In view of these and other
deficiencies in VEBs request for exclusion, VEB was not excluded from the settlement class. We can provide no assurance, however, that our settlement will be enforced against VEB or the shareholders it purports to represent if VEB or such
shareholders were to bring claims against us in The Netherlands. We will continue to defend against the pending KPNQwest litigation
matters vigorously. Other Matters Several putative class actions relating to the installation of fiber optic cable in certain rights-of-way were filed against us on behalf of landowners on various dates and in various courts in California, Colorado,
Georgia, Illinois, Indiana, Kansas, Massachusetts, Mississippi, Missouri, Oregon, South Carolina, Tennessee and Texas. For the most part, the complaints challenge our right to install our fiber optic cable in railroad rights-of-way. Complaints in
Colorado, Illinois and Texas, also challenge our right to install fiber optic cable in utility and pipeline rights-of-way. The complaints allege that the railroads, utilities and pipeline companies own the right-of-way as an easement that did not
include the right to permit us to install our fiber optic cable in the right-of-way without the plaintiffs consent. Most actions California, Colorado, Georgia, Kansas, Mississippi, Missouri, Oregon, South Carolina, 
107 Table of Contents QWEST COMMUNICATIONS INTERNATIONAL INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTSContinued For the Years Ended December31, 2007, 2006 and 2005 
Tennessee and Texas purport to be brought on behalf of state-wide classes in the named plaintiffs respective states. The Massachusetts action purports
to be on behalf of state-wide classes in all states in which Qwest has fiber optic cable in railroad rights-of-way other than Louisiana and Tennessee, and also on behalf of two classes of landowners whose properties adjoin railroad rights-of-way
originally derived from federal land grants. Several actions purport to be brought on behalf of multi-state classes. The Illinois state court action purports to be on behalf of landowners in Illinois, Iowa, Kentucky, Michigan, Minnesota, Nebraska,
Ohio and Wisconsin. The Illinois federal court action purports to be on behalf of landowners in Arkansas, California, Florida, Illinois, Indiana, Missouri, Nevada, New Mexico, Montana and Oregon. The Indiana action purports to be on behalf of a
national class of landowners adjacent to railroad rights-of-way over which our network passes. The complaints seek damages on theories of trespass and unjust enrichment, as well as punitive damages. QCC is a defendant in litigation filed by several billing agents for the owners of payphones seeking compensation for coinless calls made from payphones.
The matter is pending in the United States District Court for the District of Columbia. Generally, the payphone owners claim that QCC underpaid the amount of compensation due to them under Federal Communications Commission FCC
regulations for coinless calls placed from their phones onto QCCs network. The claim seeks compensation for calls, as well as interest and attorneys fees. QCC will vigorously defend against this action. QC is a defendant in litigation brought by several owners of payphones relating to the rates QC charged them for the lines to their payphones between
1997 and 2003. Generally, the payphone owners claim that QC charged more for payphone access lines than QC was permitted to charge under the applicable FCC rules. Two lawsuits are pending, one filed in the United States District Court for the
Western District of Washington, the other in the United States District Court for the District of Utah. The Washington lawsuit resulted in reversal of the district courts dismissal order by the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals, and is currently
stayed pending resolution of related proceedings before the FCC. In the Utah case, the Tenth Circuit Court of Appeals reversed a dismissal by the district court and directed that the district court refer several issues to the FCC for resolution. A
proceeding against QC is also pending before the Oregon Public Utility Commission. Several related proceedings are underway at the FCC involving QC, other telecommunications companies, and payphone owners. In all of these proceedings, the payphone
owners seek damages for amounts paid allegedly exceeding that which was permitted under the applicable FCC rules. QC will vigorously defend against these actions. A putative class action purportedly filed on behalf of certain of our retirees was brought against us and certain other defendants in Federal District Court in Colorado in connection with our decision to reduce the
life insurance benefit for these retirees to a $10,000 benefit. The action was filed on March30, 2007. The plaintiffs allege, among other things, that we and other defendants were obligated to continue their life insurance benefit at the
levels in place before we decided to reduce them. Plaintiffs seek restoration of the life insurance benefit to previous levels and certain equitable relief. We believe that our reduction of the life insurance benefit was permissible under applicable
law and plan documents and will vigorously defend against this action. We have tax related matters pending against us, certain of which
are before the Appeals Office of the IRS. In addition, tax sharing agreements have been executed between us and previous affiliates, and we believe the liabilities, if any, arising from adjustments to previously filed returns would be borne by the
affiliated group member determined to have a deficiency under the terms and conditions of such agreements and applicable tax law. We have not generally provided for liabilities attributable to former affiliated companies or for claims they have
asserted or may assert against us. We believe that we have adequately provided for these tax-related matters. If the recorded reserves for these tax-related matters are insufficient, we could be required to record additional amounts in future
periods.

Fourth Quarter 2007 Income tax expense for the fourth quarter of 2007 includes income tax benefits of $144 million from tentative settlements that we and the IRS agreed to related to several of the issues raised in its audit of our 2002
and 2003 tax years and $52 million of benefit from changes in other estimates. Partially offsetting these benefits was a $93 million reduction in the third quarters reversal of the valuation allowance on our deferred tax assets that we should
have recognized in the third quarter of 2007 when the reversal was recognized. Had the reduction been recognized, it would have reduced the impact of the third quarter reversal of the valuation allowance on our deferred tax assets from $2174
billion to $2081 billion. Absent the $93 million adjustment, our fourth quarter net income would have been $459 million. This adjustment had no impact on our annual results. Third Quarter 2007 Included in net income for the third quarter of 2007 is the reversal of
the valuation allowance on our deferred tax assets which resulted in an income tax benefit of $2174billion during the quarter. For additional information, see Note3Income Taxes. Note18: Other Financial Information Prepaid Expenses and

Note 19: Labor Union Contracts We are a party to collective bargaining agreements with our labor unions, the Communications Workers of America and the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers. Our three-year labor agreements with the unions
expire on August16, 2008. As of December31, 2007, employees covered under these collective bargaining agreements totaled 20,672, or 56%, of all our employees. Note20: Financial Statements of Guarantors QCII and two of its subsidiaries, Qwest Capital
Funding, Inc. QCF and Qwest Services Corporation QSC, guarantee the payment of certain of each others registered debt securities. As of December31, 2007, QCII had outstanding a total of $2075billion
aggregate principal amount of senior notes that were issued in February 2004 and June 2005 and that are guaranteed by QCF and QSC the QCII Guaranteed Notes through their maturity in February 2014. Each series of QCFs outstanding
notes totaling approximately $29billion in aggregate principal amount the QCF Guaranteed Notes is guaranteed on a senior unsecured basis by QCII through their maturity in February 2031. The guarantees are full and unconditional
and joint and several. A significant amount of QCIIs and QSCs income and cash flow are generated by their subsidiaries. As a result, the funds necessary to meet their debt service or guarantee obligations are provided in large part by
distributions or advances from their subsidiaries. The following information sets forth our condensed consolidating statements of
operations for years ended December31, 2007, 2006 and 2005, our condensed consolidating balance sheets as of December31, 2007 and2006, and our condensed consolidating statements of cash flows for the years ended December31,
2007 and 2006. The information for QCII is presented on a stand-alone basis, information for QSC and QCF is presented on a combined basis and information for all of our other subsidiaries is presented on a combined basis. Each entitys
investments in its subsidiaries, if any, is presented under the equity method. The condensed consolidating statements of operations and balance sheets include the effects of consolidating adjustments to our subsidiaries tax provisions and the
related income tax assets and liabilities in the QSC and QCII results. Both QSC and QCF are 100% owned by QCII, and QCF is a finance subsidiary of QCII. Other than as already described in this note, the accounting principles used to determine the
amounts reported in this note are the same as those used in our condensed consolidated financial statements. We periodically restructure
our internal debt based on needs of the business. Business Combinations Under Common Control In February 2007, the FCC issued an order that freed us from some regulatory obligations under the Telecommunications Act of 1996. Among other things, the
order gives us more flexibility to integrate our local and long-distance operations, including the operations of our subsidiaries that provide shared services to our two main operating companies. In light of this order and consistent with our continuing strategy to simplify our corporate structure and gain operational efficiencies, we are
reorganizing the legal structure of our subsidiaries. These reorganization activities will impact the entities that are consolidated into our financial statements and, as a result, the future financial statements presented in this note will be
different from the financial statements we have historically presented in this note. These reorganization activities will result in a combination of businesses under common control and, as a result, we will be required to adjust previously reported
financial statements for all periods presented in this note for any transferred businesses affecting these subsidiaries. 
111 Table of Contents QWEST COMMUNICATIONS INTERNATIONAL INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTSContinued For the Years Ended December31, 2007, 2006 and 2005 
In addition, our reorganization activities may result in the transfer of assets, liabilities or
employees between subsidiaries that do not represent a business, as defined, and will be recorded as equity contributions in the affected subsidiaries statements of stockholders equity. In connection with these activities, we do not
expect that we will consummate any business combinations or other transactions that will adversely affect our consolidated financial condition or results of operations or the financial condition or results of operations for any of the guarantors
presented in this note. Allocations among Affiliates We allocate the costs of shared services among our affiliates. These services include marketing and advertising, information technology, product and technical services as well as general support services. The
allocation of these costs is based on estimated market values or fully distributed cost FDC. Most of our affiliate services are priced by applying an FDC methodology. FDC rates are determined using salary rates, which include payroll
taxes, employee benefits, facilities and overhead costs. Whenever possible, costs are directly assigned to the affiliate that uses the service. If costs cannot be directly assigned, they are allocated among all affiliates based on cost usage
measures; or if no cost usage measure is available, these costs are allocated based on a general allocator. From time to time, we adjust the basis for allocating the costs of a shared service among our affiliates. Such changes in allocation
methodologies are generally billed prospectively. Under our tax allocation policy, we treat our subsidiaries as if they were separate
taxpayers. The policy requires that each subsidiary pay its tax liabilities in cash basedon thatsubsidiarys separate return taxable income. To the extent a subsidiary has taxable losses, the subsidiary does not pay any amount and
therefore retains the benefit of the losses. Subsidiaries are also included in the combined state tax returns we file, and the same payment and allocation policy applies. Employees of our subsidiaries participate in the QCII pension, non-qualified pension, post-retirement health care and life insurance, and other post-employment benefit plans. The amounts contributed by our
subsidiaries are not segregated or restricted to pay amounts due to their employees and may be used to provide benefits to our other employees or employees of other subsidiaries. We allocate the cost of pension, non-qualified pension, and
post-retirement health care and life insurance benefits and the associated obligations and assets to our subsidiaries and determine the subsidiaries required contributions. The allocation is based upon demographics of each subsidiarys
employees compared to all participants. In determining the allocated amounts, we make numerous assumptions. Changes in any of our assumptions could have a material impact on the expense allocated to our subsidiaries.

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm The Board of Directors and Stockholders Qwest Communications International
Inc.: We have audited Qwest Communications International Inc.s the Companys internal control over financial reporting as of
December31, 2007, based on criteria established in Internal ControlIntegrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission COSO. Qwest Communications International Inc.s
management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Managements Report on Internal
Control Over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Companys internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board United States. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about
whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and
testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audit also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit
provides a reasonable basis for our opinion. A companys internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide
reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A companys internal control over financial
reporting includes those policies and procedures that 1pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; 2provide
reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in
accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and 3provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the companys assets that could
have a material effect on the financial statements. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not
prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies
or procedures may deteriorate. In our opinion, Qwest Communications International Inc. maintained, in all material respects, effective
internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2007, based on criteria established in Internal ControlIntegrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission.
We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board United States, the consolidated
balance sheets of Qwest Communications International Inc. as of December31, 2007 and 2006, and the related consolidated statements of operations, stockholders equity deficit, and cash flows for each of the years in the three-year
period ended December31, 2007, and our report dated February12, 2008 expressed an unqualified opinion on those consolidated financial statements. KPMG LLP Denver, Colorado February12, 2008

CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES Conclusion Regarding the Effectiveness
of Disclosure Controls and Procedures The effectiveness of our or any system of disclosure controls and procedures is subject to
certain limitations, including the exercise of judgment in designing, implementing and evaluating the controls and procedures, the assumptions used in identifying the likelihood of future events, and the inability to eliminate misconduct completely.
As a result, there can be no assurance that our disclosure controls and procedures will detect all errors or fraud. By their nature, our, or any system of disclosure controls and procedures can provide only reasonable assurance regarding
managements control objectives. Under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive
Officer and Chief Financial Officer, we evaluated the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures as defined in Rules13a-15e and 15d-15eof the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, or the Exchange Act as
of December31, 2007. On the basis of this review, our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures are designed, and are effective, to give reasonable
assurance that the information required to be disclosed by us in reports that we file under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the rules and forms of the SEC and to ensure that
information required to be disclosed in the reports filed or submitted under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, in a manner that allows timely
decisions regarding required disclosure. There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred in the
fourth quarter of 2007 that materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. Managements Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting Our management is responsible for establishing and
maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as such term is defined in Exchange Act Rule13a-15f. Under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our principal executive officer and principal
financial officer, we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting based on the framework in Internal ControlIntegrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of
the Treadway Commission. Based on our evaluation under the framework in Internal ControlIntegrated Framework, our management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December31, 2007.
The effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December31, 2007 has been audited by KPMG LLP, an
independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in their report which is included herein.  ITEM9B.
