23  REPORT OF INDEPENDENT ACCOUNTANTS  To the Board of Directors Extended Stay America, Inc.
Spartanburg, South Carolina  In our opinion, the accompanying consolidated balance sheets and the related consolidated statements of income, of stockholders equity and of cash flows present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Extended Stay
America, Inc. and its subsidiaries at December 31, 2001 and 2000, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2001, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted
in the United States of America. These financial statements are the responsibility of the Companys management; our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audits. We conducted our audits of these
statements in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in the United States of America, which require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material
misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, and evaluating the
overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.  As discussed
in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements, in 2001 the Company changed its method of accounting for derivatives and in 1999 the Company changed its method of accounting for start-up activities.  PR

28  EXTENDED STAY AMERICA, INC.  NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 000s omitted in all tables except per share data  Note 1Summary of Significant Accounting Policies  Organization and Principles of
Consolidation  Extended Stay America, Inc. and subsidiaries the Company, ESA, we,
our, ours, or us was organized on January 9, 1995, as a Delaware corporation to develop, own, and operate extended stay lodging facilities. The accompanying consolidated financial statements include the accounts
of the Company and its wholly-owned subsidiaries. All material intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.  Estimates  The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted
accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported
amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.  Cash and
Cash Equivalents  Cash and cash equivalents consist of cash on hand and on deposit and highly liquid instruments with
maturities of three months or less when purchased. The carrying amount of cash and cash equivalents is the estimated fair value at the respective balance sheet date.  At December 31, 2001 and 2000, we had invested approximately $130 million and $140 million, respectively, in short-term demand notes. In addition, during these periods we invested
excess funds in an overnight sweep account with a commercial bank which invested in short-term, interest-bearing reverse repurchase agreements. Due to the short-term nature of these investments, we did not take possession of the securities, which
were instead held by the financial institution. The market value of the securities held pursuant to the agreements approximates the carrying amount. Deposits in excess of $100,000 are not insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation.
Accounts Receivable  Accounts receivable at December 31, 2001 and 2000 is stated net of an allowance for doubtful accounts of $900,000 and $1,050,000, respectively. We wrote-off, net of recoveries, uncollectible accounts of $1,331,000 1,268,000, and $966,000 in 2001, 2000, and 1999, respectively.  Property and Equipment  Property and equipment is stated at cost. We capitalize salaries and related costs for site selection, design and construction supervision. We also
capitalize construction period interest.  Depreciation is computed using the straight-line method over the estimated useful
lives of the assets. Maintenance and repairs are charged to operations as incurred; major renewals and improvements are capitalized. The gain or loss on the disposition of property and equipment is recorded in the year of disposition. 
The estimated useful lives of the assets are as follows:   
Buildings and improvements 
40 years 
Furniture, fixtures and equipment 
3-10 years 
We utilize general contractors for the construction of our properties. Pursuant
to the terms of our contractual agreements with the general contractors, amounts are retained from payments made to them until such time as the terms of the agreement have been satisfactorily completed. Retained amounts are recorded as accrued
retainage. 
29  EXTENDED STAY AMERICA, INC.  NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTSContinued  Impairment of Long-Lived Assets
In accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards SFAS No. 121, Accounting for the
Impairment of Long-Lived Assets and for Long-Lived Assets to Be Disposed Of, assets are generally evaluated on a market-by-market basis in making a determination as to whether such assets are impaired. At each year-end, we review long-lived
assets for impairment based on estimated future nondiscounted cash flows attributable to the assets. In the event such cash flows are not expected to be sufficient to recover the recorded value of the assets, the assets are written down to their
estimated fair values.  We performed a comprehensive review of long-lived assets as of the end of December 31, 2001. Based on
this review, no long-lived assets were deemed to be impaired.  In October 2001, the Financial Accounting Standards Board
FASB issued SFAS No. 144, Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets. SFAS No. 144 replaces SFAS No. 121, Accounting for the Impairment of Long-Lived Assets and for Long-Lived Assets to Be Disposed
Of, and requires that long-lived assets which are held for disposal be measured at the lower of carrying amount or fair value less the cost to sell, whether reported in continuing operations or in discontinued operations. SFAS No. 144 also
broadens the reporting of discontinued operations to include all components of an entity with operations that can be distinguished from the rest of the entity and that will be eliminated from the ongoing operations of the entity in a disposal
transaction. SFAS No. 144 is effective beginning January 1, 2002. The adoption of this statement is not expected to have a material effect on our financial statements.  Preacquisition Costs  We incur costs related to the
acquisition of property sites. These costs are capitalized when it is probable that a site will be acquired. These costs are included in property and equipment. In the event the acquisition of the site is not consummated, the costs are charged to
corporate operating expenses.  Deferred Loan Costs and Extraordinary Charge  We have incurred costs in obtaining financing. These costs have been deferred and are amortized over the life of the respective loans. In connection
with the termination of our previously existing credit facility in July 2001, we incurred an extraordinary charge of $59 million, net of income taxes of $39 million, associated with the write-off of unamortized deferred debt costs. 
Derivative Financial Instruments and Cumulative Effect of a Change in Accounting 
We do not enter into financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes. We use interest rate cap contracts to hedge our exposure on variable rate debt. Through December 31,
2000, the cost of the caps was included in prepaid expenses and amortized to interest expense over the life of the cap contract.  SFAS No. 133 Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities, as amended, requires all derivatives to be carried on the balance sheet at fair value. SFAS No. 133, as amended, is effective for financial statements
issued for periods beginning after December 15, 2000. At December 31, 2000, the carrying value of our interest rate cap contracts was $1,115,000 and their fair value was zero. We adopted SFAS No. 133 on January 1, 2001 and designated our interest
rate cap contracts as cash-flow hedges of our variable rate debt. SFAS No. 133, as interpreted by the Derivatives Implementation Group, required the transition adjustment to be allocated between the cumulative-effect-type adjustment of earnings and
the cumulative-effect-type adjustment of other comprehensive income based on our pre-SFAS No133 accounting policy for the contracts. Since the fair value of the interest rate cap contracts at adoption was zero, the entire transition adjustment of
$669,000, net of income tax benefit of $446,000, was recognized in earnings. 
30  EXTENDED STAY AMERICA, INC.  NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTSContinued  Revenue Recognition 
Effective December 31, 2000, we adopted the Securities and Exchange Commissions Staff Accounting Bulletin SAB No. 101,
Revenue Recognition as amended. SAB No. 101 provides guidance on the recognition, presentation and disclosure of revenue, including specifying basic criteria which must be met before revenue can be recognized. The adoption of SAB No. 101
had no impact on our financial statements.  Room revenue and other revenue are recognized when services are rendered. Amounts
paid in advance are deferred until earned. Room revenue on weekly guests is recognized ratably. In the event guests check-out early making them ineligible for the weekly rate, they are re-assessed at the daily rate with any resulting adjustment
reflected in revenue on the date of check-out. Other revenue consists, primarily, of revenue derived from telephone, vending, guest laundry, and other miscellaneous fees or services.  Other Charges Income  In May 2001, we announced that we
would relocate our corporate headquarters from Ft. Lauderdale, Florida to Spartanburg, South Carolina. The relocation was completed in the third quarter of 2001. As a result, we recognized costs associated with the relocation of approximately $90
million. These costs include severance and relocation costs and approximately $21 million in non-cash charges related to the abandonment of unamortized leasehold improvements and charges associated with the valuation of stock options for terminated
employees.  In 1998, unfavorable capital market conditions resulted in a reduction in our development plans for 1999 and 2000.
As a result, we established a valuation allowance of $120 million for the write-off of costs related to sites that would not be developed. This valuation allowance was reduced by $11 million in 1999 due to the renegotiation of the terms of a
number of the optioned sites.  Cumulative Effect of a Change in Accounting  Pursuant to the Statement of Position 98-5, Reporting on the Costs of Start-up Activities issued by the Accounting Standards Executive
Committee, effective January 1, 1999, we changed our method of accounting for start-up activities, including pre-opening and organizational costs, to expense them as they are incurred. Accordingly, in 1999 we recorded an expense of $779,000, net of
income tax benefit of $520,000, as the cumulative effect of this change in accounting.  Income Taxes 
Income taxes are accounted for under the asset and liability method. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax
consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amount of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and for operating loss and tax carryforwards.  Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which the related temporary
differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date.  Net Income Per Share  We
determine earnings per share EPS in accordance with SFAS No. 128, Earnings Per Share. For the years ended December 31, 2001, 2000, and 1999, the computation of diluted EPS does not include approximately 24 million, 70
million, and 108 million weighted average shares, respectively, of common stock, par value $001 per share, of ESA Common Stock represented by outstanding options because the exercise price of the options was greater than the average
market price of Common Stock during the period.  Business Segment 
We operate principally in one business segment which is to develop, own, and operate extended stay lodging facilities.

We had commitments totaling approximately $86 million to complete construction of
additional extended stay properties at December 31, 2001.  For the years ended December 31, 2001, 2000, and 1999, we incurred
interest of $869 million, $877 million, and $670 million, respectively, of which $104 million, $109 million, and $102 million, respectively, was capitalized and included in the cost of buildings and improvements.  Note 3Options to Purchase Property Sites  As of December 31, 2001, we had paid approximately $38 million in connection with options to purchase parcels of real estate in 59 locations in 20 states. If we do not acquire these parcels, the amounts paid in connection with the options
may be forfeited under certain circumstances. These amounts are included in property and equipment.  Note 4Long-Term Debt 
In July 2001, we entered into an agreement with various banks establishing $900 million in credit facilities the Credit
Facility that provide for revolving loans and term loans on a senior collateralized basis. The proceeds of the Credit Facility are to be used for general corporate purposes and to retire existing indebtedness under our previously existing
credit agreement.  In connection with the termination of our previously existing credit facility, we incurred an extraordinary
charge of $59 million, net of income taxes of $39 million, associated with the write-off of unamortized deferred debt costs.

flexibility in managing the development of new hotels. The amendment modified certain definitions and increased the total leverage covenant from 475 to 525 for the period from January 1, 2002 to March 31, 2003. The leverage covenant returns to the
previously scheduled level of 450 beginning April 1, 2003. The amendment instituted a pricing grid which increased the interest rate on outstanding loans under the Credit Facility by 025% from January 1, 2002 through March 31, 2002. Thereafter,
the interest rate is increased by 025% if total leverage is greater than or equal to 425 or by 075% if total leverage is greater than or equal to 475.  As of December 31, 2001, we had outstanding loans, net of scheduled maturities, of $46 million under the revolving facility and $59875 million under the term loans, leaving $254 million available and committed under
the Credit Facility. In January 2002, we borrowed $100 million pursuant to the delayed draw A-3 Facility. The proceeds of this borrowing were used to repay amounts outstanding under the revolving facility and for working capital purposes.
The loans under the Credit Facility will mature on the dates set forth in the table above. The A-1, A-2, and A-3 term loans
will be amortized in quarterly installments of varying amounts through July 24, 2007, and the B term loan will be subject to principal payments of 1% of the initial loan amounts in each of the first six years following the closing date with the
remaining principal balance to be repaid during the seventh year. Availability of the Credit Facility depends upon the Company satisfying certain financial ratios of debt and interest compared to earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and
amortization, with these amounts being calculated pursuant to definitions contained in the credit agreement, as amended.  Our
obligations under the Credit Facility are guaranteed by each of our subsidiaries. The Credit Facility is also collateralized by a first priority lien on all stock of our subsidiaries and all other current and future assets owned by us and our
subsidiaries other than mortgages on real property.  The Credit Facility contains a number of negative covenants, including,
among others, covenants that limit our ability under certain circumstances to incur debt, make investments, pay dividends, prepay other indebtedness, engage in transactions with affiliates, enter into sale-leaseback transactions, create liens, make
capital expenditures, acquire or dispose of assets, or engage in mergers or acquisitions. In addition, the Credit Facility contains affirmative covenants, including, among others, covenants that require us to maintain our corporate existence, comply
with laws, maintain our properties and insurance, and deliver financial and other information to the lenders. The Credit Facility also requires us to comply with certain financial tests and to maintain certain financial ratios on a consolidated
basis. 
33  EXTENDED STAY AMERICA, INC.  NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTSContinued  We have acquired an interest rate cap
contract with a financial institution that limits our exposure to future increases in the LIBOR rate. This contract relates to a total of $800 million and limits our exposure to a maximum LIBOR rate of 888% from June 17, 2001 through June 16, 2002.
The fair value of the contract at December 31, 2001 is zero.  In March 1998, we issued $200 million aggregate principal amount
of senior subordinated notes the 2008 Notes. The 2008 Notes bear interest at an annual rate of 915%, payable semiannually on March 15 and September 15 of each year and mature on March 15, 2008. We may redeem the 2008 Notes beginning
on March 15, 2003. The initial redemption price is 104575% of their principal amount, plus accrued interest. The redemption price declines each year after 2003 and is 100% of their principal amount, plus accrued interest, after 2006. 
In June 2001, we issued $300 million aggregate principal amount of senior subordinated notes the 2011 Notes and together with
the 2008 Notes, the Notes. The 2011 Notes bear interest at an annual rate of 9875%, payable semiannually on June 15 and December 15 of each year and mature on June 15, 2011. We may redeem the 2011 Notes beginning on June 15, 2006. The
initial redemption price is 104938% of their principal amount, plus accrued interest. The redemption price declines each year after 2006 and is 100% of their principal amount, plus accrued interest, beginning June 15, 2009. In addition, before June
15, 2004, we may redeem up to $105 million of the 2011 Notes at 109875% of their principal amount plus accrued interest, using the proceeds from sales of certain kinds of our capital stock.  The 2011 Notes are pari passu with the 2008 Notes. The Notes are not collateralized and are subordinated to our senior indebtedness. The Notes contain certain covenants for the benefit
of the holders. These covenants, among other things, limit our ability under certain circumstances to incur additional indebtedness, pay dividends, and make investments and other restricted payments, enter into transactions with 5% stockholders or
affiliates, create liens, and sell assets.  At December 31, 2001, aggregate maturities of long-term debt were as follows:

An aggregate of $1,1448 million and $9520 million was outstanding at December

at December 31, 2001, and the previously existing credit facility had an estimated fair value of approximately $751 million at December 31, 2000. The 2008 Notes had an estimated fair value of approximately $199 million at December 31, 2001 and $186
million at December 31, 2000, and the 2011 Notes had an estimated fair value of approximately $307 million at December 31, 2001.

At December 31, 2001, we had alternative minimum tax credits of approximately
$307 million, which may be carried forward indefinitely.  In assessing the realizability of deferred tax assets, we consider
whether it is more likely than not that some portion of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. The ultimate realization of the deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during the period in which those
temporary differences become deductible. We considered the scheduled reversal of deferred tax liabilities, projected future taxable income, and tax planning strategies in making this assessment. Based upon the level of taxable income and projections
for future taxable income over the periods which the deferred tax assets are deductible, we believe it is more likely than not we will realize the benefits of these deductible differences. The amount of the deferred tax asset considered realizable,
however, could be reduced in the near term if estimates of future taxable income during the carryforward period are reduced.

Shares of preferred stock may be issued from time to time, in one or more series, as authorized by the Board of Directors. Prior to issuance
of shares of each series, the Board will designate for each such series, the preferences, conversion, or other rights, voting powers, restrictions, limitations as to dividends or other distributions, qualifications, and terms or conditions of
redemption, as are permitted by law. No shares of preferred stock are outstanding and we have no present plans to issue any shares of preferred stock.  Note 7Stock Option Plans  We have six stock option plans including the 1995, 1996, 1997, 1998, and 2001
Employee Stock Option Plans the Employee Plans and the Amended and Restated 1995 Stock Option Plan for Non-Employee Directors the Directors Plan. The Employee Plans and the Directors Plan provide for grants to
certain officers, directors, and key employees of stock options to purchase shares of Common Stock. Options granted under the Employee Plans and the Directors Plan expire ten years from the date of grant. Options granted under the Employee
Plans generally vest ratably over a four year period, and options granted under the Directors Plan vest six months from the date of grant.  In addition, we have two stock option plans associated with an acquisition the Acquired Plans in 1997. Two types of options, incentive stock options and nonqualified stock options, were granted under the
Acquired Plans. All options granted under the Acquired Plans were granted at an exercise price equal to the market price of the acquired companys common stock on the date of grant and may not be exercised more than 10 years after the date
granted.  A summary of the status of the Employee Plans, the Directors Plan, and options granted under the Acquired Plans

Note 8Related Party Transactions  In 1996, we entered into a ten year lease for a suite at Pro Player Stadium for a base rental of $115,000 per year, and a 3-year lease which expired in 1999 for a suite at Homestead
Motorsports Complex for a base rental of approximately $53,000 per year. In 1998, we entered into a three year lease for an additional suite at Pro Player Stadium for a base rental or $83,000 per year, which was terminated in 1999, and a seven year
lease for a suite at the National Car Rental Center for a base rental of $120,000 per year, which was terminated in 2001. The leases are subject to certain additional charges and periodic escalation. The Chairman of our Board of Directors owns Pro
Player Stadium and had an approximate 50% ownership interest which was reduced to approximately 10% in 1997 in Homestead Motorsports Complex. In addition, the Chairman of our Board of Directors is the Chairman of the Board of Directors of a
company which operates the National Car Rental Center.  We incurred charges of approximately $30 million in 2001, $29 million
in 2000, and $22 million in 1999, from a company controlled by our Chief Executive Officer for the use of airplanes. We charged approximately $23,000 in 2001, $276,000 in 2000, and $136,000 in 1999 to our Chief Executive Officer and other companies
37  EXTENDED STAY AMERICA, INC.  NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTSContinued  controlled by him for their use of those airplanes. In addition, we incurred charges of $9,000 in 2001 and
$45,000 in 2000 for aviation related services from a company owned by the Chairman of our Board of Directors.  Our Chief
Executive Officer serves as chairman of the board of a company from which we lease office space under various lease agreements. During 2001, 2000, and 1999, we incurred charges of approximately $70,000, $79,000, and $73,000, respectively, related to
these agreements.  The Chairman of our Board of Directors serves as a director of a company to which we sublease office space.
The sublease is effective January 1, 2002 and provides for monthly rent of $52,157 for a period of three years.  Two members of
our Board of Directors also serve on the board of directors of a company which performs employment related services for us. During 2001, 2000, and 1999, we incurred charges of approximately $479,000, $421,000, and $336,000, respectively, for such
services.  Note 9Quarterly Results Unaudited  The following is a summary of quarterly operations for the years ended December 31, 2001 and 2000:
