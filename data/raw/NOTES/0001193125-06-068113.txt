ITEM8. FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED
PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of Universal Stainless Alloy Products, Inc.
We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Universal Stainless Alloy Products, Inc. and subsidiaries the Company as of
December31, 2005 and 2004, and the related consolidated statements of operations, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December31, 2005. In addition, our audits included the financial statement schedule as of
December31, 2005, 2004 and 2003 included in the index at  2Schedule II. These consolidated financial statements and financial statement schedule are the responsibility of Companys management. Our responsibility is
to express an opinion on these consolidated financial statements and financial statement schedule based on our audits. We conducted our audits in
accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board United States. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of
material misstatement. The Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. Our audit included consideration of internal control over financial reporting as a basis for
designing audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Companys internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. An
audit also includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, and evaluating the
overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. In our opinion, the consolidated
financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Universal Stainless Alloy Products, Inc. and subsidiaries as of December31, 2005 and 2004, and the results of their
operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December31, 2005 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Also, in our opinion, the related financial statement
schedule, when considered in relation to the basic financial statements as a whole, presents fairly, in all material respects, the information set forth therein.  /s/ Schneider Downs Co., Inc.

26 Table of Contents
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Note 1: Significant Accounting Policies Description of the Company. Universal Stainless Alloy Products,
Inc. the Company manufactures and markets semi-finished and finished specialty steel products, including stainless steel, tool steel and certain other alloyed steels. The Companys manufacturing process involves melting,
remelting, treating and hot and cold rolling of semi-finished and finished specialty steels. The Companys products are sold to rerollers, forgers, service centers, original equipment manufacturers, which primarily include the power generation
and aerospace industries, and wire redrawers. The Company also performs conversion services on materials supplied by customers that lack certain of the Companys production facilities or that are subject to their own capacity constraints.
Use of Estimates. The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America
requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements. The estimates and assumptions used in these consolidated financial statements are based on known information available
as of the balance sheet date. Actual results could differ from those estimates. Basis of Consolidation. The consolidated financial statements include the
accounts of the Company and its wholly-owned subsidiaries. All intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. The Company has no interests in any unconsolidated entity nor does it have any off-balance sheet financing
arrangements other than operating leases. Cash and Cash Equivalents. Cash equivalents are stated at cost plus accrued interest, which approximates market
value, and include cash and securities having a maturity of three months or less at the time of purchase. Concentration of Credit Risk. Financial
instruments that potentially subject the Company to concentrations of credit risk are cash and cash equivalents and accounts receivable. The Company limits its credit risk associated with cash and cash equivalents by placing its investments in
high-grade short-term instruments. With respect to accounts receivable, the Company limits its credit risk by performing ongoing credit evaluations and, when deemed necessary, requiring letters of credit, guarantees or cash collateral. The allowance
for doubtful accounts includes specific reserves for the value of outstanding invoices issued to customers currently operating under the protection of the federal bankruptcy law and other amounts that are deemed potentially not collectible.
Receivables are charged-off to the allowance when they are deemed to be uncollectible. Bad debt expense income for fiscal years 2005, 2004 and 2003 was $125,000, $471,000 and $24,000, respectively. Inventories. Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market with cost principally determined by the first-in, first-out FIFO method. The average cost method is
also utilized. Such costs include the acquisition cost for raw materials and supplies, direct labor and applied manufacturing overhead within the guidelines of normal plant capacity. Provisions are made for slow-moving inventory based upon
managements expected method of disposition. The Company purchases scrap metal and alloy additives, principally nickel, chrome and molybdenum, for
its melting operation. A substantial portion of the alloy additives is available only from foreign sources, some of which are located in countries that may be subject to unstable political and economic conditions. Those conditions might disrupt
supplies or affect the prices of the raw materials used by the Company. The Company maintains sales price surcharges to help offset the impact of raw material price fluctuations. Included in inventory are operating materials consisting of production molds and rolls that will normally be consumed within one year. Property, Plant and Equipment. Property, plant and equipment are recorded at cost. Costs incurred in connection with the construction or major rebuild of facilities, including interest directly related to the project,
are capitalized as construction in progress. No depreciation is recognized on these assets until placed in service. Retirements and disposals are removed from cost and accumulated depreciation accounts, with the gain or loss reflected in operating
income. Maintenance and repairs are charged to expense as incurred, and costs of improvements and renewals are capitalized. Major maintenance costs are expensed in the same annual period as incurred; however, the estimated costs are expensed
throughout the year on a pro rata basis. Maintenance expense for the fiscal year 2005, 2004 and 2003 was $11,928,000, $9,203,000 and $6,151,000, respectively. Depreciation and amortization are computed using the straight-line method based on the estimated useful lives of the related assets. The estimated useful lives of buildings and land improvements are between 5 and 25 years, and the estimated
useful lives of machinery and equipment are between 5 and 20 years. Direct costs incurred in the development and implementation of internal-use software are capitalized and recorded within property, plant and equipment, and amortized on a
straight-line basis over its anticipated useful life, which generally does not exceed three years. Depreciation and amortization expense for fiscal year 2005, 2004 and 2003 was $3,058,000, $3,046,000 and $3,063,000, respectively. 
27 Table of Contents
Long-Lived Asset Impairment. Long-lived assets, including property, plant and equipment are evaluated for impairment
whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable in relation to the operating performance and future undiscounted cash flows of the underlying assets. Adjustments are made if the sum of
expected future cash flows is less than book value. Based on managements assessment of the carrying values of such long-lived assets, no impairment reserve had been deemed necessary as of December31, 2005 and 2004. Attempts to sell the
Dunkirk office building since February 2002 have not been successful, and the Company had no prospective buyers. The change in circumstances caused the Companys management to write off the $184,000 carrying value of the Dunkirk office building
to selling and administrative expenses in 2005. Revenue Recognition. Revenue from the sale of products is recognized when both risk of loss and title have
transferred to the customer, which in most cases coincides with shipment of the related products, and collection is reasonably assured. Revenue from conversion services is recognized when the performance of the service is complete. Invoiced shipping
and handling costs are also accounted for as revenue. Customer claims are accounted for primarily as a reduction to gross sales after the matter has been researched and an acceptable resolution has been reached. Revenue is also recognized in certain situations in which products available for shipment are held at the Companys facility beyond the stated shipment date at the
customers specific request. The Company manufactures specialty steel product to customer purchase order specifications and in recognition of requirements for product acceptance. Material certification forms are executed, indicating compliance
with the customer purchase orders, before the specialty steel products are packed and shipped to the customer. Occasionally customers request that the packed products be held at the Companys facility beyond the stated shipment date. In these
situations, the Company receives written confirmation of the request, and acknowledgement that title has passed to the customer and that normal payment terms apply. Such amounts included in revenue for the years ended December31, 2005, 2004
and 2003 were less than 1% of net sales. Income Taxes. Deferred income taxes are provided for unused tax credits earned and the tax effect of temporary
differences between the tax basis of assets and liabilities and their reported amounts in the financial statements. The Company uses the liability method to account for income taxes, which requires deferred taxes to be recorded at the statutory rate
expected to be in effect when the taxes are paid. Valuation allowances are provided for a deferred tax asset when it is more likely than not that such asset will not be realized. Stock-Based Compensation Plans. The Company accounts for stock-based employee and director compensation using the intrinsic value method. No stock-based employee compensation cost is reflected in net income unless the
exercise price of the options granted does not equal market value of the underlying common stock on the date of grant. The tax effects of exercising stock options are added to additional paid-in capital at the exercise date. The following table illustrates the effect on net income and earnings per share if the Company had applied the fair value recognition provisions of issued Statement of
Financial Accounting Standards SFAS No123, Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation SFAS 123, to stock-based employee compensation:  For the years ended December31 2005 2004 2003 dollars in thousands, except per share information Net income loss, as reported 13,056 7,131 1,417 Total stock-based compensation expense determined under fair-value-based method, net of taxes 201 179 118 Pro forma net income loss 12,855 6,952 1,535 EARNINGS LOSS PER SHARE Basic as reported 205 113 023 Basic pro forma 202 110 024 Diluted as reported 202 112 023 Diluted pro forma 198 109 024 The fair value of each option granted is estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option-pricing
model with the following weighted-average assumptions used for grants issued in 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively: dividend yield of 00% for each year; interest rates of 42%, 33% and 30%; expected volatility of 435%, 571% and 540%; and
expected option life of five years. 
28 Table of Contents
Earnings Per Common Share. Basic earnings per common share is computed by dividing net income by the weighted-average
number of common shares outstanding during the period. Diluted earnings per common share is computed by dividing net income by the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding plus all dilutive potential common shares outstanding during the
period. Dilutive common shares are determined using the treasury stock method. Under the treasury stock method, exercise of options and warrants is assumed at the beginning of the period when the average stock price during the period exceeds the
exercise price of outstanding options and warrants, and common shares are assumed issued. The assumed proceeds from the exercise of stock options and warrants are used to purchase common stock at the average market price during the period. The
incremental shares to be issued are considered to be the dilutive potential common shares outstanding. New Accounting Pronouncements. In November of 2004,
the Financial Accounting Standards Board FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No151, Inventory Costs, an amendment of ARB No43, Chapter 4 SFAS 151. The purpose of this
statement is to clarify the accounting of abnormal amounts of idle facility expense, freight, handling costs and waste material. ARB No43 stated that under some circumstances these costs may be so abnormal that they are required to be treated
as current period costs. SFAS 151 requires that these costs be treated as current period costs regardless of whether they meet the criteria of so abnormal. In addition, the statement requires that allocation of fixed production overheads
to the costs of conversion be based on the normal capacity of the production facilities. The provision of this Statement became effective for inventory costs incurred during fiscal years beginning after December31, 2004. The early adoption of
SFAS 151 did not have a material impact on the Companys 2004 or 2005 results of operations or financial position. In December 2004, the FASB issued
Statement of Financial Accounting Standard No123 revised 2004, Share-Based Payment SFAS 123R. This Statement replaces FASB Statement No123 and supersedes APB Opinion No25. SFAS 123R eliminates the
ability to account for share-based compensation transactions using the intrinsic method currently used by the Company. SFAS 123R requires such transactions be accounted for using a fair-value-based method that would result in expense being
recognized in the Companys financial statements. The SEC delayed the required compliance date of SFAS 123R to January1, 2006. The Company will adopt SFAS 123R in 2006 utilizing similar valuation methodologies that generate the pro-forma
disclosures included in this Form 10-K. Reclassifications. Certain prior year amounts have been reclassified to conform
to the 2005 presentation. Note 2: Inventory The major classes of inventory are as follows:  December31 2005

Note 3: Property, Plant and Equipment Property, plant and equipment consists of the following:  December31 2005 2004 dollars in thousands Land and land improvements 1,396 1,014 Buildings 7,531 6,203 Machinery and equipment 54,232 52,358 Construction in progress 4,892 893 68,051 60,468 Accumulated depreciation 22,290 19,752 Property, plant and equipment, net 45,761 40,716 In 2003, the Company entered into a $200,000 Deferred Loan Agreement maturing on December31, 2006 with the
Dunkirk Local Development Corporation. No principal or interest payments will be required under the Deferred Loan Agreement provided that the Company hires and retains 30 new employees through the Deferred Loan Agreement maturation date, with more
than 50% of those jobs made available to certain Dunkirk City residents. As of December31, 2005, the Company believes that it will meet the conditions of the Deferred Loan Agreement, although it can make no assurances to that effect.
Therefore, the proceeds have been applied to reduce the acquisition cost of new equipment at the Companys Dunkirk facility. Property, plant and
equipment included a capital lease with Armco, which merged with and into AK Steel in 1999 AKS, for the ESR building, which houses the Companys four electro-slag remelting furnaces, a new vacuum-arc remelting furnace and
ancillary equipment. In October 2005, the Company purchased the ESR building and certain other parcels. In 2005, the Company wrote off $342,000 at the
Bridgeville facility, mainly for flat bar processing equipment. The write-off was a result of the Companys decision to move its small flat bar production to the Dunkirk facility. The Company also wrote-off $259,000 of Bridgeville
production-related fixed assets and $104,000 of corporate software costs that were retired or being replaced. Note 4: Long-Term Debt and Other
Financing Long-term debt consists of the following:  December31 2005 2004 dollars in thousands PNC Term Loan 10,000 2,300 PNC Bank revolving credit facility 6,117 8,635 Government debt 2,742 3,255 Capital lease obligation 13 44 18,872 14,234 Less amounts due within one year 1,555 2,044 Total long-term debt 17,317 12,190 The Company maintained a credit agreement with PNC Bank for a $150 million revolving credit facility PNC
Line with a term expiring on June30, 2006. This credit agreement also included a term loan PNC Term Loan scheduled to mature on June30, 2006. In June 2005, the Company executed the Third Amended and Restated Credit
Agreement with PNC Bank that extended the $150 million revolving credit facility through June30, 2009 and replaced the existing term loan having an outstanding principal balance of $19 million, with a new $100 million term loan scheduled to
mature in June 2011. The outstanding principal balance is payable in twenty consecutive quarterly installments of $500,000 beginning September30, 2006. The credit agreement is collateralized by substantially all of the Companys assets.
Interest on borrowings under the PNC Line and PNC Term Loan is based on short-term market rates, which may be further adjusted, based upon the Company
maintaining certain financial ratios. PNC Bank reduced the commitment fee paid on the unused portion of the PNC Line from 05% to 025%, provided certain financial ratios are maintained, and removed restrictions regarding the amount of capital
expenditures that may be incurred. The Company is required to be in compliance with three financial covenants: a minimum leverage ratio, a minimum debt service ratio and a minimum tangible net worth. The Company was in compliance with all such
covenants at December31, 2005.

The Company maintains two separate loan agreements with the Commonwealth of Pennsylvanias Department of Commerce
aggregating $600,000 with terms ending between the years 2011 and 2016. The loans bear interest at rates ranging from 5% to 6%per annum. In 1996, the Company entered into a ten-year, 6% interest-bearing loan agreement with the Redevelopment
Authority of Allegheny County Economic Development Fund in the amount of $1,514,000. On February14, 2002, Dunkirk Specialty Steel issued two ten-year, 5% interest-bearing notes payable to the New York Job Development Authority for the combined
amount of $30 million. The Company leases certain equipment and a vehicle. The aggregate annual principal payments due under the Companys long-term

At December31, 2005, the Company has three incentive compensation plans that are described below: STOCK INCENTIVE PLAN The Company maintains
the Stock Incentive Plan that has been adopted and amended from time to time by the Companys Board of Directors, and approved by its stockholders. The Stock Incentive Plan permits the issuance of stock options to non-employee directors, other

345,350 893 EMPLOYEE STOCK PURCHASE PLAN Under the 1996 Employee Stock Purchase Plan the Stock Purchase Plan, the Company is authorized to issue up to 90,000 shares of Common Stock to its full-time
employees, nearly all of whom are eligible to participate. Under the terms of the plan, employees can choose as of January1 and July1 of each year to have up to 10% of their total earnings withheld to purchase up to 100 shares of the
Companys Common Stock each six-month period. The purchase price of the stock is 85% of the lower of its beginning-of-the-period or end-of-the-period market prices. At December31, 2005, the Company has issued 81,676 shares of Common Stock
since the plans inception. CASH INCENTIVE PLANS The Company has a management cash incentive plan covering certain key executives and employees and profit-sharing plans that cover the remaining employees. The profit-sharing plans provide for the sharing of pre-tax
profits in excess of specified amounts. For the years ended December31, 2005, 2004 and 2003, the Company expensed $3,510,000, $1,965,000 and $168,000, respectively, under these plans.

Note 9: Retirement Plans The Company has defined contribution retirement plans that cover substantially all employees. The Company accrues its contributions to the hourly employee plan based on time worked while contributions to the salaried plan are accrued as a
fixed amount per month. Company contributions to both plans are funded periodically. Effective January6, 2003, the Company began to participate in
the Steelworkers Pension Trust Trust, a multi-employer defined-benefit pension plan that is open to all hourly and salaried employees associated with the Bridgeville facility. The Company makes periodic contributions to the Trust based
on hours worked at a fixed rate for each hourly employee and a fixed monthly contribution on behalf of each salaried employee. The hourly employees may continue their contributions to the defined contribution retirement plan even though the Company
contributions ceased. The Company also makes a contribution to the defined contribution retirement plan on behalf of each salaried employee participating in the Trust. The amount of the contribution will be dependent upon each salaried
employees contribution to the defined contribution retirement plan. The total expense for the years ended December31, 2005, 2004 and 2003 was
$772,000, $654,000 and $512,000, respectively. No other post-retirement benefit plans exist. Note 10: Commitments and Contingencies The Company, as well as other
steel companies, is subject to demanding environmental standards imposed by federal, state and local environmental laws and regulations. In December 2005, the Company received a Notice of Violation from the Environmental Protection Agency
EPA alleging violations of certain permitting issues. The Company is cooperating with the EPA to resolve these issues, and believes it will not have a material adverse effect on financial condition. The Company is not aware of any
other environmental condition that currently exists at any of its facilities that would cause a material adverse effect on the financial condition of the Company. The Company operates its Bridgeville facility production and processing equipment on real property, previously owed and used by AKS. The Company has not incurred to date and does not anticipate incurring any significant remediation costs
from environmental conditions at the Bridgeville facility. The Company does not expect that any remediation that may be required at the Bridgeville facility will have a material adverse effect on the Companys results of operations, liquidity
or financial condition. In October 2005, the Company purchased eight acres housing its ESR furnace facilities and other buildings. The Company has agreed to indemnify AKS for any remediation required due to the environmental conditions existing at
the site. The Company believes that the conditions existing on the purchased property will not require any remediation. There can be no assurance that there are no environmental liabilities that the Company may be obligated to remediate or that the
Company would have the financial resources to do so. In connection with the Companys June2, 1995 agreement with AKS to purchase certain assets
and a parcel of real property located at Titusville, AKS agreed to indemnify the Company up to $30 million in the aggregate for liabilities under environmental laws arising out of conditions on or under the Titusville property existing prior to
June2, 1995. AKS also agreed to indemnify the Company for any liabilities arising out of environmental conditions existing off-site as of June2, 1995, and that indemnification is not subject to the $30 million limitation. The Company has filed no claims against AKS since the inception of the acquisition agreement. In addition, management is not aware of any financial difficulties being
experienced by AK Steel, as successor to AKS, that would prevent its performance under the acquisition agreement. In connection with the acquisition of
the Dunkirk facility, Dunkirk Specialty Steel entered into an order with the NY DEC that precludes NY DEC from bringing any action against the Company. In addition, the order releases the Company from any and all claims and liabilities arising from,
or related to, the existing environmental conditions at the Dunkirk facility. There can be no assurance that any other party will not assert any claims with respect to environmental conditions at the Dunkirk facility, or that the Company will have
the financial resources to discharge any liabilities if legally compelled to do so. On June29, 2001, suit was filed against the Company in the Court
of Common Pleas of Allegheny County, Pennsylvania by Teledyne Technologies Incorporated Teledyne. The suit alleges that steel product manufactured by the Company was defective and the Company was or should have been aware of the
defects. Teledyne has alleged that the steel supplied by the Company caused certain crankshafts sold by Teledyne to be defective. As a result, Teledyne is claiming damages relating to the recall, replacement and repair of aircraft engines.
35 Table of Contents
In 2002, Teledyne was unsuccessful in its pursuit of a similar claim brought against another specialty steel producer who
supplied the same steel product. After in-depth investigation, it is the Companys position that the suit is without merit, and it intends to vigorously defend that position. Additionally, the Company believes that it has insurance coverage
that is available for this claim and has reached an agreement with United States Aviation Underwriters, Inc., a New York corporation USAU, as managers and on behalf of United States Aircraft Insurance Group USAIG, the
Companys Aircraft Products Liability insurance carrier, regarding the allocation of certain potential costs associated with the Teledyne claim. At this time, the Company is engaged in the pre-trial phase of the proceedings and believes that
the final disposition of this suit will not have a material adverse effect on the financial condition and the results of operations of the Company. The
Company maintains a supply contract agreement with Talley Metals Technology, Inc., a subsidiary of Carpenter Technology Corporation Talley Metals. While the initial term of the agreement expired December31, 2002, the agreement
continues to automatically renew with the placement of new orders each month and requires a 90-day written notice to terminate by either party. In addition, Talley Metals is required under the agreement to purchase a minimum of 1,000 tons of
stainless reroll billet products each calendar month and average at least 1,250 tons per month during the last 12-month period. The value of the contract on a monthly basis will depend on product mix and key raw material prices. The Continued Dumping and Subsidy Offset Act of 2000 CDSOA provides for payment of import duties collected by the U.S. Treasury to domestic companies
injured by unfair foreign trade practices. The assets purchased by Dunkirk Specialty Steel were previously owned and operated by AL Tech Specialty Steel, Inc. and Empire Specialty Steel, Inc. During their ownership, both organizations participated
in several anti-dumping lawsuits with other domestic specialty steel producers. In accordance with the CDSOA, the Company filed claims to receive its appropriate share of the import duties collected and, was notified that it was awarded $604,000, of
which $10,000 was received in 2003. The remaining payment was not received until 2004 when a favorable ruling was issued by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit in a lawsuit challenging the distribution method of the import duties. In
2004 the Company received $507,000, net of expenses incurred, as part of its 2004 award. In January 2005, the Company received an additional $59,000 from the U.S. Treasury, representing an increase in the total allocation of available funds awarded
to the Company for 2004. In addition, the Company received a net payment of $358,000 in December 2005 as its 2005 award. The Companys purchase
obligations include the value of all open purchase orders with established quantities and purchase prices as well as minimum purchase commitments, all made in the normal course of business. At December31, 2005, the Companys total
purchase obligations were $10,418,000, of which $9,636,000 and $782,000 will be due in years 2006 and 2007, respectively. Note 11: Segment and Related
Information The Company comprises three operating locations and one corporate headquarters. For segment reporting, the Bridgeville and Titusville
facilities have been aggregated into one reportable segment, Universal Stainless Alloy Products, because of the management reporting structure in place. The Universal Stainless Alloy Products manufacturing process involves
melting, remelting, treating and hot and cold rolling of semi-finished and finished specialty steels. A second reportable segment, Dunkirk Specialty Steel, was created in 2002 with the acquisition of certain assets and real property formerly owned
by Empire Specialty Steel, Inc. Dunkirk Specialty Steels manufacturing process involves hot rolling and finishing specialty steel bar, rod and wire products. The accounting policies of both reportable segments are the same as those described in the Summary of Significant Accounting Policies. Sales between the segments are generally made at market-related prices. Corporate assets are primarily
cash and cash equivalents, prepaid expenses, deferred income taxes and property, plant and equipment.

$358,000. The 2004 third and fourth quarter earnings were positively impacted by the receipt of import duties of $565,000 and $507,000, respectively. In October 2004, the Companys electricity costs at the Bridgeville facility increased by
approximately $600,000 per quarter due, in part, to a Public Utility Commission ruling that reduced the number of off-peak power hours available to conduct its melting operations, and increased energy market prices. Earnings per share amounts for each quarter are required to be computed independently. As a result, their sum may not equal the total year earnings per share amounts.
