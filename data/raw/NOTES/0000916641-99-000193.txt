reflect the results of the Company from January 1, 1998 1998 and 1997
1997, respectively. The results of operations for the period ended December

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally
accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and
assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and
disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the dates of the financial
statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the
reporting periods. The more significant estimates made by management include
allowances for obsolete inventory, uncollectible accounts receivable,
realization of goodwill, deferred taxes and other deferred assets, litigation
and claims, product warranty costs, and self-insurance costs. Actual results
could differ from those estimates. AMF BOWLING, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS continued NOTE 2. SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES continued
REVENUE RECOGNITION
For Bowling Products, revenue is generally recognized at the time the
products are shipped. For larger contract orders, Bowling Products generally
requires that customers submit a deposit as a condition of accepting the order.
For a significant portion of international sales, Bowling Products generally
requires the customer to obtain a letter of credit prior to shipment. WARRANTY COSTS
Bowling Products warrants all new products for certain periods up to one
year. Bowling Products charges to income an estimated amount for future
warranty obligations, and also offers customers the option to purchase extended
warranties on certain products. Warranty expense aggregated $5,391 for 1998 3,007 for 1997 and $4,471 for 1996, and is included in cost of goods sold in
the accompanying consolidated statements of operations. CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS
The Company classifies all highly liquid fixed-income investments
purchased with an original maturity of three months or less as cash
equivalents. INVENTORIES
Bowling Products' inventory is valued at the lower of cost or market, cost
being determined using the first-in, first-out FIFO method. Bowling
Centers' inventory is valued at the lower of cost or market, with the cost
being determined using the average cost method see Note 4.
LONG-LIVED ASSETS
The carrying value of long-lived assets and certain identifiable
intangibles, including goodwill, is reviewed by the Company for impairment
whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount
of an asset may not be recoverable, and an estimate of future undiscounted cash
flows is less than the carrying amount of the asset. PROPERTY AND EQUIPMENT
Property and equipment are stated at cost. Expenditures for maintenance
and repairs which do not improve or extend the life of an asset are charged to
expense as incurred; major renewals or betterments are capitalized. Upon
retirement or sale of an asset, its cost and related accumulated depreciation
are removed from property and equipment, and any gain or loss is recognized.
Property and equipment are depreciated over their estimated useful lives
using the straight-line method. Estimated useful lives of property and
equipment are as follows                  
Buildings and improvements    5 -40 years
Leasehold improvements      lesser of the estimated useful life or term of the lease
Bowling and related equipment   5 -10 years
Manufacturing equipment      2 -7 years
Furniture and fixtures      3 -8 years GOODWILL
As a result of the Acquisition and subsequent purchases of bowling centers
discussed in Note 15. Acquisitions, and in accordance with the purchase
method of accounting used for all acquisitions, the Company recorded goodwill
representing the excess of the purchase price over the allocation among the
acquired assets and liabilities in accordance with estimates of fair market
value on the dates of acquisition. Goodwill is being amortized over 40 years.
Amortization expense was $20,403 in 1998, $19,827 in 1997 and $13,070 in 1996. AMF BOWLING, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS continued NOTE 2. SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES continued

COVENANTS
In 1998, the Company entered into Amendment Number 1 and Waiver the

the Company operations through December 31, 1999. In addition, for 1999,
borrowings to finance acquisitions are substantially restricted and limits have
been placed on the Company ability to make capital expenditures, investments
and acquisitions. The Company believes that it will be in compliance with the
amended covenants during 1999, but any downturn in the current performance of
the Company could result in non-compliance with these financial covenants. The
financial covenants existing prior to the amendment will be reinstated in the
year beginning 2000. However, based on current performance the Company will not
meet the requirements of the financial covenants that will be reinstated.
Failure by the Company to comply with its credit agreement covenants could
result in an event of default which, if not cured or waived, will have a
material adverse effect on the Company.

additional affirmative and negative covenants, constraining Bowling Worldwide.

INTEREST RATE CAP AGREEMENTS
During 1996 and 1997, Bowling Worldwide entered into two interest rate cap
agreements that expired in 1998 with Goldman Sachs Capital Markets, L.P., to
reduce the interest rate risk of its Bank Debt. During March 1998, Bowling
Worldwide entered into a third interest rate cap agreement with Goldman Sachs
Capital Markets, L.P. to reduce the interest rate risk of its Bank Debt. The
notional amount of this cap was $1500 million at December 31, 1998. During
October AMF BOWLING, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS continued NOTE 9. LONG-TERM DEBT continued
1998, Bowling Worldwide entered into a fourth interest rate cap agreement with
Goldman Sachs Capital Markets, L.P. to reduce the interest rate risk of its
Bank Debt. The notional amount of this cap was $2000 million at December 31,
1998. Interest expense for interest rate cap agreements was $1,608 in 1998 1,823 in 1997 and $304 in 1996.
Bowling Worldwide is exposed to credit-related loss in the event of
non-performance by the counterparty. Bowling Worldwide believes its exposure to
potential loss due to counterparty non-performance is minimized primarily due
to the relatively strong credit rating of the counterparty. DEFERRED FINANCING COSTS
Costs incurred to obtain bank financing and issue bond financing are
amortized over the lives of the various types of debt using the effective
interest rate method. Bank financing costs, which were incurred to obtain bank
financing for the Acquisition, were entirely written off in the fourth quarter
of 1997 in connection with the Credit Agreement. During 1998, the Company
deferred $13,833 of financing costs associated with the issuance of the
Debentures and with the Amendment and Waiver. Amortization expense for
financing costs was $3,438 in 1998, $4,856 in 1997 and $3,252 in 1996. EXTRAORDINARY CHARGES
The Company recorded after-tax extraordinary charges totaling $23,366 in
the fourth quarter of 1997 as a result of entering into the Credit Agreement,
the premium paid to redeem a portion of the Subsidiary Senior Subordinated
Discount Notes and the write-off of the portion of bond financing costs
attributable to the Subsidiary Senior Subordinated Discount Notes redeemed. OTHER
The Company is highly leveraged as a result of indebtedness incurred in
connection with the Acquisition and subsequent acquisitions. Although the
Company believes it will be able to meet its debt obligations, there is no
assurance that the Company will generate sufficient cash flow in a timely
manner to satisfy scheduled principal and interest payments. NOTE 10. INCOME TAXES

Realization of deferred tax assets associated with the NOLs and foreign
tax credit carryforwards is dependent upon generating sufficient taxable income
prior to their expiration. Management believes that there is a risk that certain
of these NOLs and foreign tax credit carryforwards may expire unused and,
accordingly, has established a valuation allowance against them. Although
realization is not assured for the remaining deferred tax assets, management
believes it is more likely than not that they will be realized through future
taxable earnings or alternative tax strategies.
The gross amount of net operating losses NOLs the Company may utilize
on future tax returns is $194,542. The NOLs expire as follows  YEAR     NOLS

Bowling Centers has certain ground leases, associated with several centers,
which expire at various dates through 2058. These leases generally contain
renewal options and require payments of taxes, insurance, maintenance, and
other expenses in addition to the minimum annual rentals. Certain leases
require contingent payments based on usage of equipment above certain specified
levels. Such contingent rentals amounted to $1,733 in 1998, $1,200 in 1997 and
$912 in 1996. Total rent expense under operating leases aggregated
approximately $31,061 in 1998, $24,117 in 1997 and $13,737 in 1996. AMF BOWLING, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS continued NOTE 11. COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES continued

LITIGATION AND CLAIMS
In June 1998, Harbin Hai Heng Bowling Entertainment Co. Ltd. Hai Heng
filed an action against AMF Bowling Products, Inc. AMF Bowling Products, an
indirect subsidiary of AMF Bowling, in the Harbin Intermediate People Court
in Heilongjing, China. Hai Heng sought to recover $3 to $4 million in damages
relating to 38 New Center Packages NCP or NCPs purchased from AMF. Hai
Heng asserted that the poor quality of the 38 NCPs entitled Hai Heng to recover
the purchase price and damages for lost profits and the cost of storing the
NCPs.
On November 6, 1998, the court awarded Hai Heng approximately $35
million. AMF Bowling Products appealed the award to the High People Court of
Heilongjing Province the People Court. Prior to completion of the appeal
review, the President of the People Court on February 11, 1999 issued a
judgment in favor of Hai Heng for approximately $28 million and ordered Hai
Heng to return 24 NCPs to AMF.
The Company believes Hai Heng claim is a warranty issue and that Hai Heng
is not entitled to recover the purchase price, lost profits or the cost of
storage. The Company continues to believe that Hai Heng claim is substantially
without merit, and furthermore, based on the advice of local legal counsel, the
Company believes that the judicial process leading up to the trial court award
and the judgment issued by the People Court involved significant procedural
and other legal defects. Hai Heng has begun to exercise its rights to enforce
the collection of the judgment. The Company intends to continue to pursue all
available defenses. Among other things, AMF Bowling Products intends to seek an
appeal to the Supreme People Court in Beijing the Supreme Court and a stay
of the execution of the judgment. The granting of an appeal is discretionary
with the Supreme Court.
Due to a number of uncertainties inherent in the litigation process in
these jurisdictions, the Company can give no assurance on the likelihood of
success of its appeal efforts or the ultimate outcome of the Hai Heng
litigation. However, management does not believe that the outcome of the action
will have a material adverse impact on the financial position of the Company.
In addition, the Company currently and from time to time is subject to
claims and actions arising in the ordinary course of its business, including
employment discrimination claims, workers' compensation claims and personal
injury claims. In some actions, plaintiffs request punitive or other damages
that may not be covered by insurance. In management opinion, the claims and
actions in which the Company is involved will not have a material adverse
impact on its financial position or results of operations. However, it is not
possible to assure the outcome of such claims and actions. NOTE 12. STOCKHOLDERS' EQUITY STOCKHOLDERS AGREEMENT
On April 30, 1996, AMF Bowling and the institutional stockholders of AMF
Bowling the Stockholders entered into a stockholders agreement the

options outstanding at December 31, 1998 have a weighted-average exercise price
of $978 and a weighted-average remaining contractual life of 81 years. 1998 STOCK INCENTIVE PLAN

Plan the 1998 Plan under which AMF Bowling may grant to employees of the
Company and its affiliates incentive awards Awards in the form of Stock

Compensation, and elected to account for its stock options under APB Opinion
No. 25, under which no compensation cost has been recognized. Had compensation
cost for Stock Options granted under the 1996 Plan and 1998 Plan been
determined consistent with SFAS No. 123, the Company net losses for 1998,
1997 and 1996 would have been increased to $126,108, $56,503 and $19,858,
respectively, and the Company basic and diluted net loss per share for 1998
would remain at $211, and basic and diluted net loss per share for 1997 and

NOTE 15. ACQUISITIONS
On October 10, 1996, AMF Bowling Centers, Inc. AMF Bowling Centers, a
Virginia corporation and an indirect, wholly-owned subsidiary of Bowling
Worldwide, completed the acquisition the Charan Acquisition of 50 bowling
centers and certain related assets and liabilities from Charan Industries, Inc.
Charan. The net purchase price of the Charan Acquisition was approximately
$1029 million. The Charan Acquisition was funded with approximately $400
million from the sale of equity by AMF Bowling to its institutional
stockholders and one of its directors, and with approximately $629 million
from available borrowings under Bowling Worldwide then existing Acquisition
Facility.
The following unaudited pro forma information has been prepared assuming
the Charan Acquisition had occurred as of January 1, 1996 and is based on pro
forma AMF Bowling results of operations presented in Note 3. Pro Forma Results
of Operations. The pro forma information is presented for information purposes
only and is not necessarily indicative of what would have occurred if the
acquisition had occurred as of those dates. In addition, the pro forma

Since the Acquisition and prior to December 31, 1998, AMF Bowling Centers
purchased an aggregate of 262 bowling centers from various unrelated sellers
including Charan. The combined net purchase price was approximately $4975
million, and was funded with approximately $766 million from the sale of
equity by AMF Bowling, $4197 million from available borrowing under Bowling
Worldwide then existing Acquisition Facility and current Bank Facility, and
with $12 million from the issuance of Common Stock with respect to the
acquisition of Active West, Inc. in 1998. The results of operations for
acquired bowling centers and certain related assets and liabilities other than
the Charan Acquisition were not material in relation to the Company
consolidated results of operations or financial position. Subsequent to
December 31, 1998, the Company has not acquired any bowling centers. NOTE 16. JOINT VENTURES
In April 1997, the Company entered into a joint venture with Hong Leong
Corporation Limited, a Singapore-based conglomerate Hong Leong, to build
and operate bowling centers in the Asia Pacific region. The joint venture
Hong Leong Joint Venture is owned 50% by the Company and 50% by Hong Leong.
The Hong Leong Joint Venture opened its only bowling center during November
1997 in Tianjin, China. Due to the recent economic difficulties in the Asia
Pacific region, future development of bowling centers in that region through
the Hong Leong Joint Venture will not be pursued.
In August 1997, the Company entered into a joint venture with Playcenter
S.A., a Sao Paulo-based amusement and entertainment company Playcenter to
build and operate bowling centers in Brazil and Argentina. The joint venture
Playcenter Joint Venture is owned 50% by the Company and 50% by Playcenter.
As of December 31, 1998, the Playcenter Joint Venture operated 12 centers in
Brazil and two centers in Argentina. No additional sites for the Playcenter
Joint Venture are being evaluated. The Company has pledged its shares of the
Playcenter Joint Venture in connection with a guarantee of a third party loan
of the Playcenter Joint Venture. AMF BOWLING, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS continued NOTE 16. JOINT VENTURES continued

AMF BOWLING GROUP   In our opinion, the combined financial statements listed in the
accompanying index present fairly, in all material respects, the financial
position of AMF Bowling Group at April 30, 1996 and the results of its
operations and its cash flows for the four months ended April 30, 1996 in
conformity with generally accepted accounting principles. These financial
statements are the responsibility of the Company management; our
responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on
our audit. We conducted our audit of these statements in accordance with
generally accepted auditing standards which require that we plan and perform
the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements
are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test
basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial
statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates
made by management, and evaluating the overall financial statement
presentation. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for the
opinion expressed above. PRICE WATERHOUSE LLP Norfolk, Virginia

Pursuant to a Stock Purchase Agreement dated February 16, 1996 between AMF
Group Holdings, Inc. and the stockholders of AMF Bowling Group the Combined
Companies, on May 1, 1996, AMF Group Holdings, Inc. the Company, through
its subsidiaries, acquired the Combined Companies in a stock purchase of all
the outstanding stock of the separate domestic and foreign corporations that
constitute substantially all of the Combined Companies and through the purchase
of certain assets of the Combined Companies' bowling center operations in Spain
and Switzerland. Prior to the acquisition, the Combined Companies were
controlled by the Virginia Investment Trust.
The Combined Companies operated bowling centers in the United States and
in 9 foreign countries and manufactured and distributed a full line of bowling
and leisure related products. The principal markets for bowling and leisure
related equipment are domestic and foreign independent bowling center
operators. The accompanying combined financial statements have been prepared
for the purpose of presenting the financial position and results of operations
of the bowling related operations of the various entities. AMF BOWLING GROUP NOTES TO COMBINED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS continued
in thousands of dollars, except share data NOTE 1. ORGANIZATION continued   The Company did not acquire the assets of two bowling centers located in
Madrid, Spain and Geneva, Switzerland both of which were retained by the
sellers and, accordingly, the April 30, 1996 combined financial statements
exclude the assets of these centers. As a result of the acquisition, the
Company, at May 1, 1996, owns or operates 205 of the Combined Companies'
domestic bowling centers and 78 international bowling centers. The purchase
price for the acquisition was approximately $1,300,000, subject to certain
postclosing adjustments, less approximately $2,000 representing debt of the
Combined Companies which remained in place following the closing of the
acquisition the Closing.
The revaluation, in accordance with Accounting Principles Board Opinion
No. 16, of the Combined Companies' assets and liabilities as a result of the
Stock Purchase Agreement has not been reflected in the accompanying combined
financial statements. In addition, no adjustments have been recorded to reflect
any tax liability resulting from the stock purchase and the related Section 338
h 10 election. NOTE 2. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
BASIS OF PRESENTATION
The accompanying combined financial statements have been prepared on the
accrual basis of accounting and conform in all material respects to accounting
principles generally accepted in the United States. The accompanying combined
financial statements are stated in U.S. dollars. All significant intercompany
and intracompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in the
accompanying combined financial statements. USE OF ESTIMATES
The preparation of financial statements, in conformity with generally
accepted accounting principles, requires management to make estimates and
assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the
disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial
statements, and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the
reporting period. The more significant estimates made by management include
allowances for obsolete inventory, uncollectable accounts receivable, product
warranty costs and litigation and claims. Actual results could differ from
those estimates. REVENUE RECOGNITION
Revenue is generally recognized from the sale of products at the time the
products are shipped. For larger contract orders, the Combined Companies
generally require that customers submit a deposit as a condition of accepting
the order. For nonaffiliate international sales, the Combined Companies
generally require the customer to obtain a letter of credit prior to shipment. WARRANTY COSTS
AMF Bowling offers warranties for its various products and provides, by a
current charge to income, an amount it estimates will be needed to cover future
warranty obligations for products sold. Warranty expense aggregated
approximately $1,313 for the four months ended April 30, 1996. CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS
For the purpose of the statement of cash flows, the Combined Companies
consider all highly liquid debt instruments purchased with an original maturity
of three months or less at the date of purchase to be cash equivalents. INVENTORIES
Manufacturing inventory is valued at the lower of cost or market, cost
being determined using the last-in, first-out LIFO method for domestic
inventories and the first-in, first-out FIFO method for foreign
inventories.
Bowling center inventory is valued at the lower of cost or market with the
cost being determined using the actual or average cost method. AMF BOWLING GROUP NOTES TO COMBINED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS continued

PROPERTY AND EQUIPMENT
Property and equipment are stated at cost. Expenditures for maintenance
and repairs which do not improve or extend the life of an asset are charged to
expense as incurred; major renewals or betterments are capitalized to the
property accounts. Upon retirement or sale of an asset, its cost and related
accumulated depreciation are removed from the property accounts, and any gain
or loss is recognized.
Property and equipment are depreciated over their estimated useful lives
using straight-line and accelerated methods. Estimated useful lives of property
and equipment for financial reporting purposes are as follows       Buildings and improvements    5 - 40 years
Bowling and related equipment   5 - 10 years
Manufacturing equipment      2 - 7 years
Furniture and fixtures      3 - 8 years   In March 1995, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Statement
of Financial Accounting Standards No. 121, Accounting for the Impairment of
Long-Lived Assets and for Long-Lived Assets to be Disposed of, SFAS No.
121. SFAS No. 121 is effective for fiscal year 1996 for the Company. This
Statement establishes accounting standards for the impairment of long-lived
assets, certain identifiable intangibles, and goodwill related to those assets.
The adoption of SFAS No. 121 did not have a material effect on the financial
position or results of operations of the Company. INCOME TAXES
Certain of the Combined Companies included in the accompanying combined
financial statements have elected S Corporation status under the Internal
Revenue Code see Note 1. As an S Corporation, the companies may be liable for
U.S. federal income taxes under certain circumstances and liable for state
income taxes in certain jurisdictions; all other domestic income taxes are the
responsibility of the Combined Companies' stockholders.
The foreign branches of the S Corporations and other foreign entities file
income tax returns and pay taxes in their respective countries. The
stockholders receive a tax credit, subject to certain limitations, in their
U.S. federal income tax returns for foreign taxes paid by the foreign branches
of the U.S. Corporation and certain other foreign entities.
The Combined Companies account for income taxes in accordance with
Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 109, Accounting for Income
Taxes, SFAS No. 109. SFAS No. 109 mandates the liability method for
computing deferred income taxes. Because the Combined Companies have elected S
Corporation status, deferred income taxes are only provided with respect to
state and foreign income taxes. RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT COSTS
Expenditures relating to the development of new products, including

arising from transactions in foreign currencies are included as a separate item
in the accompanying combined statement of operations. FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS
The carrying value of financial instruments including cash and cash
equivalents, accounts receivable, accounts payable and short-term debt
approximated fair value at April 30, 1996 because of the short maturity of
these instruments. The carrying value of long-term receivables and payables
approximated fair value as of April 30, 1996 based upon market rates for
similar instruments. NONCOMPETE AGREEMENTS
The Combined Companies have certain noncompete agreements with
individuals. The assets are recorded at cost or at the present value of
payments to be made under these agreements, discounted at annual rates ranging
from 8%-10%. The assets are included in other current and noncurrent assets and
are amortized on a straight-line basis over the terms of the agreements.
Noncompete obligations were $3,095 at April 30, 1996. COMMON STOCK
The common stock account represents the aggregate number of shares
outstanding for all the Combined Companies multiplied by the respective par
value at each of the Combined Companies. NOTE 3. RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS

companies which are affiliated through common ownership and with certain of its
officers, directors and stockholders. The majority of balances with affiliated
companies were liquidated on or prior to April 30, 1996. Interest income and
expense during the four months ended April 30, 1996 were not significant to the
operating results of the Combined Companies.
The Combined Companies were charged $512 for the four months ended April
30, 1996 in management fees for certain consulting and administrative services
performed by affiliated companies.

PRO FORMA PROVISION FOR INCOME TAXES UNAUDITED   As a result of the Stock Purchase Agreement, the Combined Companies will
no longer be treated as an S Corporation for income tax purposes in the United
States and in certain state jurisdictions.
Accordingly, the combined statements of operations include a pro forma
adjustment for income taxes which would have been recorded if the Combined
Companies had not been an S Corporation based on tax laws in effect during
these periods. The pro forma adjustment was computed separately for each entity
and then combined, except for purposes of computing the utilization of foreign
tax credits related to the worldwide bowling center operations, the domestic
and worldwide bowling center operations were considered in the aggregate.

taxes, insurance, maintenance and other expenses in addition to the minimum
annual rentals. Certain leases require contingent payments based on usage of
equipment above certain specified levels. Such contingent rentals amounted to
$293 for the four months ended April 30, 1996.

AMF Bowling terminated its Korean distributorship agreement. The Korean
distributor filed suit against the company in Korea seeking an injunction
against AMF Bowling Seoul Korea branch to prevent AMF Bowling from selling
bowling and bowling related products in Korea. The Korean Court dismissed the
suit on jurisdiction grounds subsequent to year-end. Such a decision is subject
to an appeal.
On January 10, 1996, the Korean distributor filed a second suit in the
Supreme Court of the State of New York against AMF Bowling and AMF Bowling
Centers. The suit alleges a number of complaints related to the conduct and
termination of the Korean distributorship agreement and alleges that the
defendants caused the Korean distributor insolvency. The Korean distributor
is seeking compensatory damages of at least $41,759 and punitive damages of at
least $100,000 or ten times the amount of compensatory damages awarded,
whichever is greater, under each of seven causes of action set forth in the
suit.
Management believes that the Korean distributorship agreement was properly
terminated. Management intends to vigorously defend against this claim and
believes the resolution of such claim will not have a significant effect on the
Combined Companies' combined financial position or results of operations. Under
terms of the sale agreement Note 1, the current AMF shareholders have agreed
to indemnify the buyers for any loss related to this litigation.
On March 5, 1996, the defendant in an action entitled Northland Bowl and
Sports Center, Inc. and Recreation Associates, II v. Golden Giant, Inc., d/b/a
Golden Giant Building System, Court of Common Pleas, Centre County, Pa. Index
No. 96-75, asserted a third-party claim against AMF Bowling and other parties.
Defendant, Golden Giant, a construction company, was previously named as
defendant by a bowling center not owned or operated by the Combined Companies
in connection with the collapse of the center roof in early 1994. Golden
Giant has now named AMF Bowling, charging it with negligence and breach of
implied warranty for installing scoring monitors four years before the roof
collapsed on a portion of the building that allegedly could not adequately
support the additional weight of the equipment. The bowling center plaintiff
claims total damages in amounts exceeding $3,500, and Golden Giant asserts
that, if plaintiff is entitled to any recovery, it should be in whole or part
against AMF Bowling.
AMF Bowling is involved in two patent infringement suits. The plaintiff in
the first case, a competitor of AMF Bowling Century division, obtained a
summary judgment on the issue of liability in December 1994. The court recently
issued an order which will permit AMF to appeal. The plaintiff claims damages AMF BOWLING GROUP NOTES TO COMBINED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS continued
in thousands of dollars, except share data NOTE 9. COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES continued
in the range of $3,000 to $9,000. A trial on damages will not occur unless and
until the liability issue is resolved against AMF Bowling. Management intends
to vigorously contest the claim and believes the resolution of such claim will
not have a significant effect on the Combined Companies' combined financial
position or results of operations.
The second patent infringement suit relates to AMF Bowling Pins and
Lanes division. Management has settled this claim for $250 during the four
months ended April 30, 1996.
AMF Bowling Centers and AMF Bowling are defendants in a wrongful death
suit related to an employee. The employee estate is seeking compensatory
damages up to $3,000 plus $3,000 in punitive damages. However, the plaintiff
counsel has verbally offered to settle the case for $350. Management expects to
vigorously contest the claim and believes the resolution of such claim will not
have a significant effect on the Combined Companies' combined financial
position or results of operations.
In addition, the Combined Companies are involved in certain other lawsuits
and claims arising out of normal business operations. The majority of these
relate to accidents at the Combined Companies' bowling centers. Management
believes that the ultimate resolution of such matters will not materially
affect the Combined Companies' results of operations or financial position.
While the ultimate outcome of the litigation and claims against the
Combined Companies cannot presently be determined, management believes the
Combined Companies have made adequate provision for possible losses. At April
30, 1996 the Combined Companies had recorded reserves aggregating approximately
$2,900 for litigation and claims. NOTE 10. EMPLOYEE BENEFIT PLANS AND BONUS
The Combined Companies have a defined contribution 401k plan to which
domestic employees may make voluntary contributions based on their
compensation. Under the provisions of the plan, the Combined Companies can, at
their option, match a discretionary percentage of employee contributions and
make an additional contribution as determined by their Board of Directors.
Contributions vest 100% after a five-year period. The amount charged to expense
under this plan was approximately $410 for the four months ended April 30,
1996.
One of the Combined Companies has a Stock Performance Plan the Plan
for certain key employees. Under the terms of the Plan, eligible employees earn
Stock Performance Units as a result of the Company meeting certain operating
performance conditions, as defined by the Plan, relating to 1 sales, 2 cash
flow and 3 operating results. Benefits under the Plan vest over a five-year
period and will be paid in installments over a ten-year period without interest
or less if specified by the Company Board of Directors upon the termination
of an eligible employee. The Plan can be terminated or amended at any time by
the Company Board of Directors. The amount charged to expense under this plan
was approximately $1,479 for the four months ended April 30, 1996. The
agreement contains a provision which would accelerate the payout of the
benefits from ten years to five years upon a change-of-control event and would
require that interest be paid on the unpaid balance. On April 30, 1996, the
Combined Companies made payments of $3,085 related to these plans and the plans
were terminated.
Certain of the Combined Companies' foreign operations have employee
benefit plans covering selected employees. These plans vary as to the funding,
including local government, employee and employer funding. Each company has
provided pension expense and made contributions to these plans in accordance
with the requirements of the plans and local country practices. The amount
charged to expense under these plans aggregated $291 for the four months ended
April 30, 1996.
On April 30, 1996, the Combined Companies paid bonuses and special
payments to employees, former employees and former directors of $43,760 in
recognition of their services. AMF BOWLING GROUP NOTES TO COMBINED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS continued
