Henry Schein, Inc.
Melville, New York We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Henry Schein, Inc. as of
December31, 2005 and December25, 2004, and the related consolidated statements of income, changes
in stockholders equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December31,
2005. These financial statements are the responsibility of the Companys management. Our
responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audits. We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting
Oversight Board United States. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to
obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material
misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and
disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting
principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall
financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our
opinion. In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all
material respects, the consolidated financial position of Henry Schein, Inc. at December31, 2005
and December25, 2004, and the consolidated results of its operations and its cash flows for each
of the three years in the period ended December31, 2005 in conformity with accounting principles
generally accepted in the United States of America. We also have audited, in accordance with standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight
Board United States, the effectiveness of Henry Schein, Inc.s internal control over financial
reporting as of December31, 2005, based on criteria established in Internal Control-Integrated
Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission COSOand
our report dated February21, 2006 expressed an unqualified opinion. s/ BDO SEIDMAN, LLP New York, New York

In thousands, except share and per share data Note 1
Significant Accounting Policies Nature of Operations We distribute healthcare products and services primarily to office-based healthcare
practitioners in the combined North American and European markets, with operations in the United
States, Canada, the United Kingdom, the Netherlands, Belgium, Germany, France, Austria, Portugal,
Spain, the Czech Republic, Luxembourg, Italy, Ireland, Switzerland, Israel, Australia and New
Zealand. We also have an affiliate in Iceland. Principles of Consolidation Our consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Henry Schein, Inc. and all of
our wholly-owned and majority-owned and controlled subsidiaries. All intercompany accounts and
transactions are eliminated in consolidation. Investments in unconsolidated affiliates, which are
greater than or equal to 20% and less than or equal to 50% owned, are accounted for under the
equity method. Certain prior period amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current
period presentation. Use of Estimates The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally
accepted in the United States requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the
reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at
the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the
reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. Fiscal Year We report our operations and cash flows on a 52-53week basis ending on the last Saturday of
December. The year ended December31, 2005 consisted of 53weeks and each of the years ended
December25, 2004 and December27, 2003 consisted of 52weeks. Revenue Recognition We generate revenue from the sale of dental, medical and veterinary consumable products, as
well as equipment, software products and services and other sources. Provisions for discounts,
rebates to customers, customer returns and other contra-revenue adjustments are recorded based upon
historical data and are provided for in the period in which the related sales are recognized. Revenue derived from the sale of consumable products is recognized when products are shipped
to customers. Such sales typically entail high-volume, low-dollar orders shipped using third-party
common carriers. We believe that the shipment date is the most appropriate point in time
indicating the completion of the earnings process because we have no post-shipment obligations, the
product price is fixed and determinable, collection of the resulting receivable is probable and
product returns are reasonably estimable. 51 Table of Contents HENRY SCHEIN, INC.
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Continued
In thousands, except share and per share data Note 1
Significant Accounting Policies Continued Revenue derived from the sale of equipment is recognized when products are delivered to
customers. Such sales typically entail scheduled deliveries of large equipment primarily by
equipment service technicians. Some equipment sales require minimal installation, which is
completed at the time of delivery. Revenue derived from the sale of software products is recognized when products are shipped to
customers. Such software is generally installed by customers and does not require extensive
training due to the nature of its design. Revenue derived from post-contract customer support for
software, including annual support and/or training, is recognized over the period in which the
services are provided. Revenue derived from other sources including freight charges, equipment repairs and financial
services, is recognized when the related product revenue is recognized or when the services are
provided. Cash and Cash Equivalents We consider all highly-liquid debt instruments and other short-term investments with an
original maturity of three months or less to be cash equivalents. Outstanding checks in excess of
funds on deposit of $470million and $327million, primarily related to payments for inventory,
were classified as accounts payable as of December31, 2005 and December25, 2004. Available-for-sale Securities Our available-for-sale securities consist of short-term tax-efficient municipal auction rate
securities, which have a high degree of liquidity and are reflected at fair value. We determine cost of investments in available-for-sale securities on a specific identification
basis. Gross realized gains and losses were immaterial in all periods presented. The securities
held on December31, 2005 had contractual maturities of up to one year. There were no
available-for-sale securities as of December25, 2004. Accounts Receivable and Reserves The carrying amount of accounts receivable is reduced by a valuation allowance that reflects
our best estimate of the amounts that will not be collected. The reserve for accounts receivable
is comprised of allowance for doubtful accounts and sales returns. In addition to reviewing
delinquent accounts receivable, we consider many factors in estimating our reserve, including
historical data, experience, customer types, credit worthiness and economic trends. From time to time, we may adjust our
assumptions for anticipated changes in any of these or other factors expected to affect
collectibility. Inventory and Reserves Inventories consist primarily of finished goods and are valued at the lower of cost or market.
Cost is determined primarily by the first-in, first-out method. In performing our lower of cost
or market 52 Table of Contents HENRY SCHEIN, INC.
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Continued
In thousands, except share and per share data Note 1 Significant Accounting Policies Continued valuation, we consider many factors including the condition and salability of the inventory,
historical sales, forecasted sales and market and economic trends. From time to time, we may
adjust our assumptions for anticipated changes in any of these or other factors expected to affect
the value of inventory. Direct Shipping and Handling Costs Freight and other direct shipping costs are included in cost of sales. Direct handling costs,
which represent primarily direct compensation costs of employees who pick, pack and otherwise
prepare, if necessary, merchandise for shipment to our customers are reflected in selling, general
and administrative expenses. These costs from continuing operations were $394million, $319
million and $248million for 2005, 2004 and 2003. Advertising and Promotional Costs We generally expense advertising and promotional costs as incurred. Total advertising and
promotional expenses from continuing operations were $198million, $217million and $184million
for 2005, 2004 and 2003. Additionally, advertising and promotional costs incurred in connection
with direct marketing, including product catalogs and printed material, are deferred and amortized
on a straight-line basis over the period which is benefited,
generally not exceeding one year. As of December
31, 2005 and December25, 2004, we had $35million and $34million of deferred direct marketing
expenses included in other current assets. Vendor Rebates Vendor rebates are included as a reduction to cost of sales and are recognized as they are
earned. The factors we consider in estimating vendor rebate accruals include forecasted inventory
purchases and sales, in conjunction with vendor rebate contract terms, which generally provide for
increasing rebates based on either increased purchase or sales volume. Property and Equipment Property and equipment are stated at cost, net of accumulated depreciation or amortization.
Amortization of leasehold improvements is computed using the straight-line method over the lesser
of the useful life of the assets or the lease term. Depreciation is computed primarily under the
straight-line method over the following estimated useful lives

In thousands, except share and per share data Note 1 Significant Accounting Policies Continued Capitalized software costs consist of costs to purchase and develop software. Costs incurred
during the application development stage for software bought and further customized by outside
vendors for our use and software developed by a vendor for our proprietary use are capitalized. Costs incurred for
our own personnel who are directly associated with software development may also be capitalized. Income Taxes We account for income taxes under an asset and liability approach that requires the
recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of
events that have been recognized in our financial statements or tax returns. In estimating future
tax consequences, we generally consider all expected future events other than enactments of changes
in tax laws or rates. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates
will be recognized as income or expense in the period that includes the enactment date. We file a
consolidated U.S. federal income tax return with our 80% or greater owned U.S. subsidiaries. Foreign Currency Translation and Transactions The financial position and results of operations of our foreign subsidiaries are determined
using local currency as the functional currency. Assets and liabilities of these subsidiaries are
translated at the exchange rate in effect at each year-end. Income statement accounts are
translated at the average rate of exchange prevailing during the year. Translation adjustments
arising from the use of differing exchange rates from period to period are included in accumulated
other comprehensive income in stockholders equity. Gains and losses resulting from foreign
currency transactions are included in earnings. Risk Management and Derivative Financial Instruments We use derivative instruments to minimize our exposure to fluctuations in interest rates and
foreign currency exchange rates. Our objective is to manage the impact that interest rate and
foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations could have on recognized asset and liability fair
values, earnings and cash flows. Our risk management policy requires that derivative contracts
used as hedges be effective at reducing the risks associated with the exposure being hedged and be
designated as a hedge at the inception of the contract. We do not enter into derivative
instruments for speculative purposes. Our derivative instruments include interest rate swap agreements related to our long-term
fixed rate debt and foreign currency forward and swap agreements related to intercompany loans and
certain forecasted inventory purchase commitments with foreign vendors.
Our interest rate swap agreements are designated as fair value hedges. The terms of our
interest rate swap agreements are identical to the Senior Notes and consequently qualify for an
assumption of no ineffectiveness under the provisions of Statement of Financial Accounting
Standards FAS No133, Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities. Both
the interest rate swap agreements and the underlying Senior Notes are marked-to-market through
earnings at the end of each period; however, since our interest rate swap agreements are deemed
fully effective, these mark-to-market adjustments have no net impact on earnings. Our foreign currency forward and swap agreements related to intercompany loans are designated
as either fair value hedges loans expected to be repaid within the foreseeable future or net
investment 54 Table of Contents HENRY SCHEIN, INC.

forward and swap agreements related to intercompany loan interest payments are designated as cash
flow hedges. Our foreign currency forward and swap agreements related to forecasted inventory
purchase commitments are designated as cash flow hedges. For fair value hedges, the effective portion of the changes in the fair value of the
derivative, along with the translation gain or loss on the hedged item, is recorded in earnings.
For net investment hedges, the effective portion of the changes in the fair value of the
derivative, along with any gain or loss on the hedged item, is recorded as a component
of other comprehensive income as a foreign currency translation adjustment. For cash flow hedges,
the effective portion of the changes in the fair value of the
derivative, along with any gain or loss on the hedged item, is also recorded as a component of other comprehensive
income and subsequently reclassified into earnings in the same periods during which the hedged
transaction affects earnings. We record the cash flows related to our hedging activities in the
same category on our consolidated statement of cash flows as the cash
flows related to the hedged item. Acquisitions The net assets of businesses purchased are recorded at their fair value at the acquisition
date and our consolidated financial statements include their results of operations from that date.
Any excess of acquisition costs over the fair value of identifiable net assets acquired is recorded
as goodwill. Certain acquisitions provide for contingent consideration, primarily cash, to be paid
in the event certain financial performance targets are satisfied over future periods. We have not
accrued any liabilities that may arise from these transactions because the outcome of the
contingencies is not determinable beyond a reasonable doubt. Goodwill and Other Indefinite-Lived Intangible Assets Goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets are not amortized, but are subject to annual
impairment analyses. Such impairment analyses require a comparison of the fair value to the
carrying value of reporting units. Measuring fair value of a reporting unit is generally based on
valuation techniques using multiples of sales or earnings, unless supportable information is
available for using a present value technique, such as estimates of future cash flows. We regard
our reporting units to be our operating segments dental, medical including veterinary,
international and technology. Goodwill was allocated to such reporting units, for the purposes of
preparing our impairment analyses, based on a specific identification basis. We assess the potential impairment of goodwill and other
indefinite-lived intangible assets annually and on an interim basis whenever events or changes in
circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable. Some factors we consider important that could trigger an interim impairment review include   
Significant underperformance relative to expected historical or projected
future operating results 55 Table of Contents HENRY SCHEIN, INC.

Significant changes in the manner of our use of acquired assets or the
strategy for our overall business e.g. decision to divest a business; or   
Significant negative industry or economic trends. If we determine through the impairment review process that indefinite-lived intangible assets
are impaired, we record an impairment charge in our consolidated statements of income. Long-Lived Assets Long-lived assets, including definite-lived intangible assets, are evaluated for impairment
whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not
be recoverable through the estimated undiscounted future cash flows derived from such assets.
Definite-lived intangible assets primarily consist of non-compete agreements, trademarks, trade
names and customer relationships. When an impairment exists, the related assets are written down
to fair value. Cost of Sales The primary components of cost of sales include the cost of the product net of purchase
discounts, vendor chargebacks and rebates and inbound and outbound freight charges. Costs related
to purchasing, receiving, inspections, warehousing, internal inventory transfers and other costs of
our distribution network are included in selling, general and administrative expense along with
other operating costs. As a result of different practices of categorizing costs associated with distribution networks
throughout our industry, our gross margins may not necessarily be comparable to other distribution
companies. Total distribution network costs from continuing operations were $425million, $415
million and $319million for 2005, 2004 and 2003. Stock-Based Compensation We account for stock option awards under the intrinsic value-based method of accounting
prescribed by Accounting Principles Board Opinion No25, Accounting for Stock Issued to
Employees. Under this method, no compensation expense is recorded, provided the exercise price is
equal to or greater than the quoted market price of the stock at the grant date. We make pro forma disclosures of net income and earnings per share as if the fair value-based
method of accounting the alternative method of accounting for stock-based compensation had been
applied as required by FAS No123, Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation. The fair
value-based method requires us to make assumptions to determine expected risk-free interest rates, stock
price volatility, dividend yield and weighted-average option life. Under the accounting provisions of FAS 123, our net income and earnings per share would have
been adjusted to the pro forma amounts indicated in the table below. The prior period pro forma
amounts have been adjusted as a result of revising our calculation of the fair value of stock-based
compensation. These adjustments were not material to pro forma net income or earnings per share. 56 Table of Contents HENRY SCHEIN, INC.

Based on these assumptions, the estimated fair value of options granted for 2005, 2004
and 2003, was approximately $1338, $1121 and $868 per share. As of January1, 2006, in connection with our adoption of FAS 123R Share-Based Payment,
stock-based compensation is included in our results of operations. The method and assumptions used
to determine the fair value of stock-based compensation under FAS 123R are similar to those used
under FAS 123. Additionally, we expect the effect of adopting FAS 123R on our results of
operations to approximate the effect presented in the pro forma disclosure above. Comprehensive Income Comprehensive income includes certain gains and losses that, under accounting principles
generally accepted in the United States, are excluded from net income as such amounts are recorded
directly as an adjustment to stockholders equity. Our comprehensive income is primarily comprised of net income
and foreign currency translation adjustments, but also includes unrealized gains losseson
hedging activity and marketable securities and pension adjustments. 57 Table of Contents HENRY SCHEIN, INC.

New Accounting Pronouncements In December2004, the FASB issued FAS No123R, Share-Based Payment. This Statement
establishes standards for the accounting for transactions in which an entity exchanges its equity
instruments for goods or services. It also addresses transactions in which an entity incurs
liabilities in exchange for goods or services that are based on the fair value of the entitys
equity instruments or that may be settled by the issuance of those equity instruments. This
Statement changes the accounting for transactions in which an entity obtains employee services in
share-based payment transactions. This Statement does not change the accounting guidance for
share-based payment transactions with parties other than employees provided in FAS 123 as
originally issued and EITF Issue No96-18, Accounting for Equity Instruments That Are Issued to
Other Than Employees for Acquiring, or in Conjunction with Selling, Goods or Services. This
Statement is effective for us beginning January1, 2006 and applies to all outstanding and unvested
stock-based payment awards at the date of adoption. In March2005, the SEC issued Staff Accounting Bulletin No107 SAB 107, which discussed
the SECs interpretation of FAS 123R and the related valuation of share-based compensation for
public companies. We are assessing the requirements of both FAS 123R and SAB 107 and the impact
that these pronouncements will have on our consolidated results of operation and earnings per
share. We anticipate the adoption of FAS 123R will affect our results of operations to an
extent similar to that as presented in our FAS 123 pro forma disclosure previously disclosed. In May2005, the FASB issued FAS No154, Accounting Changes and Error Corrections. FAS 154
is a replacement of APB Opinion No20, Accounting Changes and FAS No3, Reporting Accounting
Changes in Interim Financial Statements. This Statement requires voluntary changes in accounting
to be accounted for retrospectively and all prior periods to be restated as if the newly adopted
policy had always been used, unless impracticable. Previously, APB Opinion No20 required most
voluntary changes in accounting to be recognized by including the cumulative effect of the change
in accounting in net income in the period of change. This Statement also requires a change in
method of depreciation, amortization or depletion for a long-lived asset be accounted for as a
change in estimate that is affected by a change in accounting principle. FAS 154 is effective for
us beginning January1, 2006. When adopted, this Statement could have an impact on prior year
consolidated financial statements if we have a change in accounting. 58 Table of Contents HENRY SCHEIN, INC.
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Continued
In thousands, except share and per share data Note 1 Significant Accounting Policies Continued In June2005, the FASB ratified EITF Issue 05-2, The Meaning of Conventional Convertible Debt
Instrument in EITF Issue 00-19, Accounting for Derivative Financial Instruments Indexed to, and
Potentially Settled in, a Companys Own Stock. This issue attempts to define conventional
convertible debt instrument to help clarify the appropriate accounting for such instruments. We do not
anticipate this issue will have a material effect on our financial position, results of operations
or cash flows. Note 2 Earnings Per Share Basic earnings per share is computed by dividing net income by the weighted-average number of
common shares outstanding for the period. Our diluted earnings per share is computed similarly to
basic earnings per share, except it reflects the effect of common shares issuable upon exercise of
stock options using the treasury stock method in periods in which they have a dilutive effect. For the years ended December31, 2005 and December25, 2004, diluted earnings per share does
not include the effect of common shares issuable upon conversion of our convertible debt because
the principal is required to be settled in cash. If at any time, the debt is convertible at a
premium as a result of the conditions of the debt, the amount in excess of the principal would be
presumed settled in common shares and thereby reflected in our calculation of diluted earnings per
share. A reconciliation of shares used in calculating basic and diluted earnings per share follows

Non-compete agreements represent amounts paid primarily to key employees and prior owners
of acquired businesses in exchange for placing restrictions on their ability to pose a competitive
risk to us. Such amounts are amortized, on a straight-line basis over the respective non-compete
period, which generally commences upon termination of employment or separation from us. The
weighted-average non-compete period for agreements currently being amortized was approximately 5
years as of December31, 2005. Trademarks, trade names and customer relationships were established through business
acquisitions. Certain trademarks and trade names, totaling $235million and $257million as of
December31, 2005 and December25, 2004, are deemed indefinite-lived intangible assets and are not
amortized. The remainder are deemed definite-lived and are amortized on a straight-line basis over
a weighted-average period of approximately 3years as of December31, 2005. Customer relationships
and lists are definite-lived intangible assets that are amortized on a straight-line basis over a
weighted-average period of approximately 10years as of December31, 2005. Amortization expense related to definite-lived intangible assets for 2005, 2004 and 2003 was
$149million, $97million and $28million. The annual amortization expense expected for the
years 2006 through 2010 is $137million, $116million, $101million, $93million and $87

Long-term notes receivable carry interest rates ranging from 57% to 120% and are due
in varying installments through 2020. Of the total, approximately $51million in 2005
and $188million in 2004 relate to the sale of certain businesses in prior years. In
addition, $90million and $71million of this balance is owed to us by a related party
in 2005 and 2004. Amortization of long-term assets for 2005, 2004 and 2003 was $540, $651 and $263. Note 6 Business Acquisitions and Divestitures Acquisitions On January11, 2005, we acquired the dental products distribution business of Ash Temple
Limited Ash Temple, a privately held full-service dental distributor based in Ontario, Canada
with annual revenues of approximately $1000million. We recorded $165million of goodwill
related to this acquisition. The operating results of Ash Temple are reflected in the accompanying
financial statements since the date of acquisition. Ash Temple offers dental supplies, equipment, artificial teeth and repair parts, as well as
services including office design and planning, equipment lease financing and limited consulting.
Ash Temple was one of the largest diversified dental companies in Canada with 14 branches,
including five distribution centers, servicing all 10 Canadian provinces. Ash Temple operations
have been combined with Henry Schein Arcona, our Canadian dental business, which is currently operating under the new name Henry
Schein Ash Arcona. On April18, 2005, regulatory authorities approved our pending acquisition of our Demedis
Groups business in Austria, which operates under the Austrodent brand. This approval was
contingent upon our divesting, at closing, a portion of Austrodents business, not using the
Austrodent name, as well as other restrictions. Of the total purchase price for the Demedis Group
discussed below, $135million was attributable to Austrodent, which was paid in 2004 and
recorded as an other current asset. Upon acquiring Austrodent, this amount, less approximately
$12million received in exchange for the divested portion of the business, was reclassified based
on the fair value of the remaining assets and liabilities
acquired, with an increase of $86million to goodwill for the excess purchase price over fair
value. 62 Table of Contents HENRY SCHEIN, INC.
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Continued
In thousands, except share and per share data Note 6 Business Acquisitions and Divestitures Continued In addition to the Ash Temple and Austrodent acquisitions, we completed other acquisitions in
Australia, New Zealand and the United States, which resulted in our recording approximately $115
million of goodwill through preliminary purchase price allocations during the year ended December
31, 2005. These acquisitions were immaterial individually and in the aggregate. On June18, 2004, we acquired all of the outstanding equity shares of Demedis GmbH excluding
its Austrian operations discussed above, which is a leading full-service distributor of dental
consumables and equipment in Germany, Austria, and the Benelux countries; and Euro Dental Holding
GmbH, which included KRUGG S.p.A., which we believe is Italys leading distributor of dental
consumable products, and DentalMV GmbH otherwise known as Muller Weygandt, or MW. We refer
to these entities collectively as the Demedis Group. As part of our agreement with the German regulatory authorities entered into prior to
acquiring the Demedis Group, we agreed to divest MW shortly after the consummation of the
acquisition, effected through exercising a put option back to the previous owners. On July16,
2004, this divestiture was completed for approximately $622million, including the assumption of
debt of approximately $342million, resulting in a reduction of the purchase price for the Demedis
Group. As part of the agreement to divest MW, we were entitled to receive 50% of the net sale
proceeds in excess of EUR 550million, in the event MW was subsequently resold before June18,
2005. On September24, 2004, an agreement was signed to resell MW for an amount that resulted in our
realizing a share of the net sale proceeds equal to approximately $324million, which we received
in October2004. This amount was treated as a further reduction of the purchase price for the
Demedis Group. In addition to the Demedis Group acquisition, we completed other acquisitions and made
earn-out payments that resulted in recording additional goodwill during 2004. These transactions
were immaterial individually and in the aggregate. During the year ended December27, 2003, we acquired eight healthcare distribution businesses,
which were immaterial individually and in the aggregate. Divestitures During the third quarter ended September24, 2005, we reached a decision to divest our
hospital supply business Hospital Supply Business which is a component of our healthcare
distribution business. The primary reason for this decision was that the Hospital Supply Business
does not focus on our core customer, namely the office-based practitioner, and therefore provides
little or no synergies with our core operations. We have classified the operating results of the Hospital Supply Business as a discontinued
operation in the accompanying consolidated statements of income for all periods presented. In
connection with this divestiture, we assessed our long-lived assets for impairment, which resulted
in us recording in the third quarter an impairment charge of $119million $70million after-tax
for the full write-down of all long-lived assets, including goodwill of $46million. 63 Table of Contents HENRY SCHEIN, INC.
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Continued
In thousands, except share and per share data Note 6 Business Acquisitions and Divestitures Continued On March6, 2006, we entered into an agreement to sell substantially all of the assets of our
Hospital Supply Business, as well as our extended care business the results of which are not
material. The purchase price is $400million, with $295million due at closing and $105million
due 90days after closing, subject to certain post-closing contingent payments by us described
below. The closing is conditioned upon the buyer obtaining financing and our entering into a
transition services agreement with the buyer, as well as other customary closing conditions. Based
on this sale agreement, we expect to record a loss on disposal, net of tax, of between $210
million and $240million or $024 and $027 per diluted share, at the time of closing, which will
be presented as part of the results from discontinued operations. We agreed to make payments to the buyer, up to a maximum of $130million,
contingent upon the collection of specified accounts receivable within one year and contingent upon
the maintenance of a specified level of aggregate sales of the Hospital Supply Business during the
two-year post-closing period. Any payments made in connection with
these contingencies will be presented as part of the results from
discontinued operations. Net sales generated by our Hospital Supply Business were $1528million, $1618million and
$1598million for the years ended 2005, 2004 and 2003. The carrying amounts of the major classes
of the Hospital Supply Business assets held-for-sale as of December31, 2005 included accounts
receivable, net of reserves, of approximately $439million and inventories, net of reserves, of
approximately $162million. On August29, 2003, we sold PMA Bode GmbH, an x-ray film distribution business located in
Germany, which was a component of our healthcare distribution business. PMA Bode generated annual
net sales of approximately $310million. The loss recorded on the sale of PMA Bode was
approximately $20million net of $54 tax benefit and is included in the income lossfrom
discontinued operations in our statements of income. Due to immateriality, we have not reflected
the operating results, other than the loss on sale, of PMA Bode separately as a discontinued
operation for any of the periods presented. Note 7 Debt Bank Credit Lines We have a $3000million revolving credit facility with a $1000million expansion feature.
This facility, which expires in May2010, replaced our previous revolving credit facility of $2000
million, which was scheduled to expire in May2006. The interest rate is based on USD LIBOR plus a
spread based on our leverage ratio at the end of each financial reporting quarter. The agreement
provides, among other things, that we maintain certain interest coverage and maximum leverage
ratios, and contains restrictions relating to subsidiary indebtedness, liens, employee and
shareholder loans, disposal of businesses and certain changes in ownership. As of December31,
2005, there were $82million of letters of credit provided to third parties and no borrowings
outstanding under this revolving credit facility. 64 Table of Contents HENRY SCHEIN, INC.

In prior years, we completed private placement transactions under which we issued $1300
million and $1000million in Senior Notes. The $1300million notes mature on June30, 2009 and
bear interest at a fixed rate of 694% per annum. Principal payments on the $1000million notes
totaling $200million annually are due starting September25, 2006 and bear interest at a fixed
rate of 666% per annum. Interest on both notes is payable semi-annually. In 2003, we entered into interest rate swap agreements relating to our $2300million Senior
Notes to exchange our fixed interest rates for variable interest rates. The weighted-average
variable interest rate was 629% as of December31, 2005. This weighted-average variable rate is
comprised of LIBOR plus a spread and resets on the interest due dates of the Senior Notes. The
interest rate swap agreements are marked-to-market at each balance sheet date, with an offsetting
adjustment to the Senior Notes. The agreement governing our Senior Notes provides, among other things, that we will maintain
on a consolidated basis, certain leverage and priority debt ratios and a minimum net worth. The
agreement also contains restrictions relating to transactions with affiliates, annual dividends,
mergers and acquisitions and liens. The agreements limit the distribution of dividends without the
prior written consent of the lenders limited to $250million, plus 80% of cumulative net income,
plus net proceeds from the issuance of additional capital stock. As of December31, 2005, the
amount of retained earnings free of restrictions was $4123million. In 2004, we completed an issuance of $2400million of convertible debt. These notes are
senior unsecured obligations bearing a fixed annual interest rate of 30% and are due to mature on

In thousands, except share and per share data Note 8 Income Taxes Continued The deferred tax asset is realizable as we have sufficient taxable income in prior years
and anticipate sufficient taxable income in future years to realize the tax benefit for deductible
temporary differences. As of December31, 2005, we have domestic unconsolidated net operating loss carryforwards of
$154million, which are available to offset future federal taxable income through 2025. Foreign
net operating losses totaled $2090million as of December31, 2005. Of such losses, $49million
can be utilized against future foreign income through 2012 and $2041million has an indefinite
life. The tax provisions from continuing operations differ from the amount computed using the

Provision has not been made for U.S. or additional foreign taxes on undistributed
earnings of foreign subsidiaries, which have been, and will continue to be reinvested. These
earnings could become subject to additional tax if they were remitted as dividends, if foreign
earnings were loaned to us or a U.S. affiliate, or if we should sell our stock in the foreign
subsidiaries. It is not practicable to determine the amount of additional tax, if any, that might
be payable on the foreign earnings; however, we believe that foreign tax credits may substantially
offset any U.S. tax liabilities. As of December31, 2005, the cumulative amount of reinvested
earnings was approximately $159million. Note 9 Financial Instruments and Concentrations of Credit Risk Fair Values of Financial Instruments The following methods and assumptions were used to estimate the fair value of each class of
financial instruments for which it is practicable to estimate that value   
Cash equivalents and trade receivables Due to the short-term maturity of such instruments, the
carrying amounts are a reasonable estimate of fair value.   
Available-for-sale securities The fair value of available-for-sale securities is estimated
based on quoted market prices for such securities.   
Long-term investments and notes receivable There are no quoted market prices available for
investments in unconsolidated affiliates and long-term notes receivable; however, we believe the
carrying amounts are a reasonable estimate of fair value. 68 Table of Contents HENRY SCHEIN, INC.
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Continued
In thousands, except share and per share data Note 9 Financial Instruments and Concentrations of Credit Risk Continued   
Long-term debt The fair value of our long-term debt is estimated based on quoted market
prices for our traded debt and on market prices of similar issues for our private debt. The
fair value of our long-term debt as of December31, 2005 and December25, 2004 was estimated at $5189million and
$5402million.   
Derivative instruments The fair values of foreign currency forward contracts and interest rate
swap agreements are estimated by obtaining quotes from brokers. Such instruments are carried at
fair value on the balance sheet. The fair value liabilityof our foreign currency forward contracts as
of December31, 2005 and December25, 2004 was estimated at $40million and $12 million
which approximated contract value. The fair value of our interest rate swap agreements was
estimated at $74 million and $14 million, representing the estimated amounts we would have
paid to terminate the agreements as of December31, 2005 and December25, 2004. These amounts
take into account current interest rates, market expectations for future interest rates and our
current creditworthiness. Concentrations of Credit Risk Certain financial instruments potentially subject us to concentrations of credit risk. These
financial instruments consist primarily of cash equivalents, available-for-sale securities, trade
receivables, long-term investments, notes receivable and derivative instruments. In all cases, our
maximum exposure to loss from credit risk equals the gross fair value of the financial instruments.
We continuously assess the need for reserves for such losses, which have historically been within
our expectations. We do not require collateral or other security to support financial instruments subject to credit risk,
except for long-term notes receivable. With respect to our cash equivalents, available-for-sale securities, short-term and long-term
investments and derivative instruments, our credit risk is limited due to our counter-parties being
high-credit quality financial institutions. As a risk management policy, we limit the amount of
credit exposure by utilizing numerous different counter-parties. With respect to our trade receivables, our credit risk is somewhat limited due to a relatively
large customer base and its dispersion across different types of healthcare professionals and
geographic areas. No single customer accounted for more than 11% of our net sales in 2005. Our long-term notes receivable represent strategic financing arrangements with certain
industry affiliates and amounts owed to us from sales of certain businesses. Generally, these
notes are secured by certain assets of the counter-party; however, in most cases our security is subordinate to other
commercial financial institutions. While we have exposure to credit loss in the event of
non-performance by these counter-parties, we conduct ongoing assessments of their financial and
operational performance. Note 10 Segment and Geographic Data We conduct our business through two reportable segments: healthcare distribution and
technology. These segments offer different products and services to the same customer base. The
healthcare distribution reportable segment aggregates our dental, medical including veterinary
and international operating segments. Products distributed consist of consumable products, small
equipment, laboratory 69 Table of Contents HENRY SCHEIN, INC.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Continued
In thousands, except share and per share data Note 11 Stockholders Equity On January31, 2005, we announced that our Board of Directors approved a two-for-one stock
split effected in the form of a dividend. This stock split became effective on February28, 2005
and has been retroactively reflected for all periods presented in the accompanying financial
statements and footnotes. Effective May25, 2005, we increased our authorized common shares from 120,000,000 to
240,000,000 in connection with the above stock split. Common Stock Purchase Rights On November30, 1998, our Board of Directors adopted a Stockholder Rights Plan the Rights
Plan, and declared a dividend under the Rights Plan of one common stock purchase right a
Right on each outstanding share of our common stock. Until the occurrence of certain events,
each share of common stock that is issued will also have attached to it a Right. The Rights
provide, in substance, that should any person or group acquire 15% or more of our outstanding
common stock after the date of adoption of the Rights Plan, each Right, other than Rights held by
the acquiring person or group, would entitle its holder to purchase a certain number of shares of
common stock for 50% of the then-current market value of the common stock. Unless a 15%
acquisition has occurred, we may redeem the Rights at any time prior to the termination date of the
Rights Plan. This Right to purchase the common stock at a discount will not be triggered by a
persons or groups acquisition of 15% or more of the common stock pursuant to a tender or exchange
offer which is for all outstanding shares at a price and on terms that the Board of Directors
determines prior to acquisition to be adequate and in the stockholders best interests. In
addition, the Right will not be triggered by the positions of existing shareholders. Certain business combinations involving an acquiring person or its affiliates will trigger an
additional feature of the Rights. Each Right, other than Rights held by the acquiring person or
group, will entitle its holder to purchase a certain number of shares of common stock of the
acquiring person at a price equal to 50% of the market value of such shares at the time of
exercise. Initially, the Rights will be attached to, and trade with, the certificates representing
our outstanding shares of common stock and no separate certificates representing the Rights will be
distributed. The Rights will become exercisable only if a person or group acquires, or commences a
tender or exchange offer for, 15% or more of our common stock. The Board of Directors may, at its option, redeem all, but not less than all of the then
outstanding Rights at a redemption price of $001 per Right at any time prior to the earlier of a
any person or group acquiring 15% or more of our common stock or bthe final expiration date of
November30, 2008. Note 12 Employee Benefit Plans Stock Options We established the 1994 Stock Incentive Plan the Plan for the benefit of certain
employees. As amended and restated effective as of April1, 2004, pursuant to this plan we may
issue up to approximately 20,159,270 shares of our common stock. The Plan provides for two classes
of options: ClassA options and ClassB options. A total of 475,794 ClassA options were issued to
certain executive management in 1995, all of which were exercised as of December31, 2005. Both
incentive and non-qualified stock options may be issued under the Plan. 75 Table of Contents HENRY SCHEIN, INC.

In thousands, except share and per share data Note 12 Employee Benefit Plans Continued The exercise price of all ClassB options issued has been equal to the market price on the
date of grant, and accordingly, no compensation cost has been recognized. Substantially all Class
B options issued prior to 2004 vest evenly over three years from the date of grant; however shares
exercised in the second and third year after the date of grant may not be sold until the third
anniversary of the date of grant. Substantially all ClassB options issued in 2004 and 2005 vest

until the third anniversary of the date of grant. ClassB options expire on the tenth anniversary
of the date of issuance, subject to acceleration upon termination of employment. A summary of the status of our stock option plans, including the Assumed Plans, is presented

401k Plans We offer qualified, 401k plans to substantially all our domestic full-time employees. As
determined by our Board of Directors, matching contributions to these plans are equal to 100% of
the participants contributions up to 7% of their base compensation. Matching contributions
include both cash and our common stock. Forfeitures attributable to participants whose employment
terminates prior to becoming fully vested are used to reduce our matching contributions. Assets of the 401k and other defined contribution plans are held in self-directed accounts
enabling participants to choose from various investment fund options. Matching contributions to
these plans charged to operations during 2005, 2004 and 2003 amounted to $124million, $103
million and $74million. Supplemental Executive Retirement Plan We offer an unfunded, non-qualified supplemental executive retirement plan to eligible
employees. This plan generally covers officers and certain highly-compensated employees after they
have reached the maximum IRS allowed pre-tax 401k contribution limit. Our contributions to this
plan are equal to the 401k employee-elected contribution percentage applied to base compensation
for the portion of the year in which such employees are not eligible to make pre-tax contributions
to the 401k plan. The amounts charged to operations during 2005, 2004 and 2003 amounted to $14
million, $566 and $839. 77 Table of Contents HENRY SCHEIN, INC.

We have obligations to purchase influenza vaccine from GlaxoSmithKline Biologicals
formerly ID Biomedical Corporation through 2014 which require us
to pay an amount per dose based on the prevailing market price in
each respective year. Although there are uncertainties surrounding their pending FDA
approval to distribute influenza vaccine in the United States for the 2006/2007 influenza season,
we have included this purchase obligation in the above table based on current market prices. Litigation Our business involves a risk of product liability claims and other claims in the ordinary
course of business, and from time to time we are named as a defendant in cases as a result of our
distribution of pharmaceutical and other healthcare products. As a business practice, we generally
obtain product indemnification from our suppliers. We have various insurance policies, including product liability insurance, covering risks in
amounts that we consider adequate. In many cases in which we have been sued in connection with
products manufactured by others, the manufacturer provides us with indemnification. There can be
no assurance 79 Table of Contents HENRY SCHEIN, INC.
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Continued
In thousands, except share and per share data Note 13 Commitments and Contingencies Continued that the insurance coverage we maintain is sufficient or will be available in adequate amounts or
at a reasonable cost, or that indemnification agreements will provide us with adequate protection.
In our
opinion, all pending matters, including those described below, are covered by insurance or will not
otherwise seriously harm our financial condition. As of December31, 2005, we had accrued our best estimate of potential losses relating to
product liability and other claims that were probable to result in a liability and for which we
were able to reasonably estimate a loss. This accrued amount, as well as related expenses, was not
material to our financial position, results of operations or cash flows. Our method for
determining estimated losses considers currently available facts, presently enacted laws and
regulations and other external factors,
including probable recoveries from third parties.
Product Liability Claims As of December31, 2005, we were a defendant in approximately 42 product liability cases. We
have obtained defense and indemnification commitments from the manufacturer in many of these cases.
The manufacturer has withheld indemnification in some of these cases pending product
identification.
Employment, Consulting and Non-Compete Agreements We have employment, consulting and non-compete agreements expiring through 2010, except for a
lifetime consulting agreement with a former principal stockholder, which provides for current
compensation of $308 per year, increasing $25 every fifth year with the next increase in 2007. The
agreements provide for varying base aggregate annual payments of approximately $49million, which
decrease periodically to approximately $386. In addition, some agreements have provisions for
incentive and additional compensation. Note 14 Supplemental Cash Flow Information Cash paid for interest and income taxes was

In the third quarter of 2005, we reached a decision to divest our Hospital Supply business,
which is a component of our healthcare distribution business. This decision resulted in the
recording of an impairment charge of our long-lived assets of approximately $70million, net
of tax, or $008 per diluted share for fiscal 2005. 81 Table of Contents HENRY SCHEIN, INC.

During the fourth quarter of 2004, we recorded a $132million pre-tax $84million
post-tax charge, included in selling, general and administrative expenses, related to our
Fluvirin contract with Chiron Corporation. This charge, which represented the write-off
of a deferred expense associated with the 2005/2006 influenza season, occurred as a result
of the significant uncertainty about whether Chiron would be able to provide Fluvirin for
the 2005/2006 influenza season. The effect that this charge had on earnings per share for
the year ended December25, 2004 was $010. We experience fluctuations in quarterly earnings. As a result, we may fail to meet or
exceed the expectations of securities analysts and investors, which could cause our stock price to
decline. Our business has been subject to seasonal and other quarterly fluctuations. Net sales and
operating profits generally have been higher in the third and fourth quarters due to the timing of
sales of software, equipment and seasonal products including influenza vaccine, equipment and
software products, purchasing patterns of office-based healthcare practitioners and year-end
promotions. Net sales and operating profits generally have been lower in the first quarter,
primarily due to increased sales in the prior two quarters. Quarterly results may also be
adversely affected by a variety of other factors, including   
costs of developing new applications and services   
costs related to acquisitions of technologies or businesses   
the timing and amount of sales and marketing expenditures   
general economic conditions, as well as those specific to the healthcare industry and related
industries   
the timing of the release of functions of our technology-related products and services   
our success in establishing or maintaining business relationships   
our success in selling our Hospital Supply Business   
changes in accounting principles; and   
product recalls by manufacturers. Any change in one or more of these or other factors could cause our annual or quarterly
operating results to fluctuate. If our operating results do not meet or exceed market
expectations, our stock price may decline. 82 Table of Contents Item 1.

executive officer and principal financial officer, we evaluated the effectiveness of the design and
operation of our disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by this
annual report, as such term is defined in Rule13a-15e promulgated under the Securities Exchange
Act of 1934, as amended the Exchange Act. Based on this evaluation, our management, including
our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, concluded that our disclosure
controls and procedures were effective as of the end of the period covered by this annual report to
ensure that all material information required to be disclosed by us in reports that we file or
submit under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to them as appropriate to allow
timely decisions regarding required disclosure and that all such information is recorded,
processed, summarized and reported as specified in the SECs rules and forms. Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting There have been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred
during our last fiscal quarter that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to
materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. Managements Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over
financial reporting, as such term is defined in Exchange Act Rule13a-15f. Our internal control
system is designed to provide reasonable assurance to our management and Board of Directors
regarding the preparation and fair presentation of published financial statements. Under the
supervision and with the participation of our management, including our principal executive officer
and principal financial officer, we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal
control over financial reporting based on the framework in Internal Control-Integrated Framework,
issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission COSO Framework.
Based on our evaluation under the COSO Framework, our management concluded that our internal
control over financial reporting was effective at a reasonable assurance level as of December31,
2005. Our managements assessment of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial
reporting as of December31, 2005 has been audited by BDO Seidman, LLP, an independent registered
public accounting firm, as stated in their attestation report, which is included herein. Limitations of the Effectiveness of Internal Control A control system, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not
absolute, assurance that the objectives of the internal control system are met. Because of the
inherent limitations of any internal control system, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute
assurance that all control issues, if any, within a company have been detected. 83 Table of Contents Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm Board of
DirectorsHenry Schein, Inc.Melville, New York
We have audited managements assessment, included in the accompanying Managements Report on
Internal Control over Financial Reporting, that Henry Schein, Inc. maintained effective internal
control over financial reporting as of December31, 2005, based on criteria established in Internal
ControlIntegrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway
Commission COSO. Henry Schein Inc.s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal
control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control
over financial reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on managements assessment
and an opinion on the effectiveness of the companys internal control over financial reporting
based on our audit. We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight
Board United States. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was
maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal
control over financial reporting, evaluating managements assessment, testing and evaluating the
design and operating effectiveness of internal control, and performing such other procedures as we
considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis
for our opinion. A companys internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable
assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial
statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A
companys internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that 1
pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the
transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; 2provide reasonable assurance that
transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance
with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company
are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company;
and 3provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized
acquisition, use, or disposition of the companys assets that could have a material effect on the
financial statements. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or
detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are
subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that
the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. In our opinion, managements assessment that Henry Schein, Inc. maintained effective internal
control over financial reporting as of December31, 2005, is fairly stated, in all material
respects, based on criteria established in Internal ControlIntegrated Framework issued by the
Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission COSO. Also in our opinion, Henry
Schein, Inc. maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial
reporting as of December31, 2005, based on criteria established in Internal ControlIntegrated
Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission COSO. We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight
Board United States, the consolidated balance sheets of Henry Schein, Inc. as of December31,
2005 and December25, 2004 and the related consolidated statements of income, changes in
stockholders equity 84 Table of Contents and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December31,
