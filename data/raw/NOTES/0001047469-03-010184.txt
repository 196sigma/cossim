MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF PREDECESSOR
FINANCIAL CONDITION
PREPETITION FINANCIAL RESULTS AND OVERLEVERAGE
Between January 1, 1998 and the Petition Date, Loewen Group experienced
disappointing financial results. Loewen Group reported a loss from operations in
1998 of $260 million after recording a charge for asset impairment of $334
million. Loewen Group acquisition, integration and operation of cemeteries
over the three years preceding the Petition Date required significant cash
resources on account of pre-need sales of cemetery interment rights, products
and services and related interest costs on debt incurred. Cemetery pre-need
sales typically were structured with low initial cash payments by the customers
that did not offset the cash costs of establishing and supporting a growing
pre-need sales program, including the payment of sales commissions.
Loewen Group financial difficulties primarily stemmed from a highly
burdensome debt load, much of which was incurred in connection with its
historical acquisition program, and the poor cash flow characteristics
associated with its then-existing cemetery pre-need sales strategy. As of
March 31, 1999, Loewen Group consolidated balance sheet reflected
approximately $21 billion of long-term debt of which approximately
$7422 million was due currently and approximately $488 million of other
current debt. The deterioration of Loewen Group financial health was also
caused by a $175 million settlement of the litigation captioned O'KEEFE V. THE
LOEWEN GROUP INC. in 1996, which affected its immediate and future liquidity,
and resulted in unfavorable publicity that negatively affected its operating
results and ability to maintain its long-term acquisition strategy see
Item 1. Business.
BASIS OF PRESENTATION
Alderwoods Group succeeded to substantially all of the assets and operations
of Loewen Group on the Effective Date, and continues to operate the businesses
previously conducted by the Loewen Companies. For financial reporting purposes,
the effective date of the reorganization was December 31, 2001, because
U.S. GAAP requires that the financial statements reflect fresh start reporting
as of the confirmation date or as of a later date when all material conditions
precedent to the Plan becoming binding are resolved.
Certain consolidated financial and other information concerning the
Predecessor may be of limited interest to stockholders of the Company and has
been included in this annual report on Form 10-K. However, due to the
significant changes in the financial structure of the Company, the application
of fresh start reporting as explained in Note 2 to the Company Consolidated
Financial Statements and as a result of the confirmation and implementation of
the Plan and changes in accounting policies and fiscal accounting periods
adopted by the Company, the Consolidated Financial Statements and other
information of the Company issued subsequent to the Plan implementation are not
comparable with the consolidated financial and other information issued by the
Predecessor prior to the Plan implementation. Accordingly, management
discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations of the
Predecessor should be reviewed with caution, and should not be relied upon as
being indicative of future results of the Company or providing an accurate
comparison of financial performance.
This discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of
operations of the Company and the Predecessor are based upon and should be read
in conjunction with the Company Consolidated Financial Statements and the
Predecessor consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this
Form 10-K including the notes thereto.

YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2001 COMPARED TO YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2000
Consolidated revenue decreased 98% to $8364 million for the year ended
December 31, 2001, from $9277 million in 2000. This was primarily due to
decreases in cemetery and funeral revenue as described below. Consolidated gross
margin decreased by 308%, to $1812 million for the year ended December 31,
2001, from $2620 million in 2000, primarily due to the decline in cemetery and
funeral revenue, though costs, as a percentage of revenue, increased for the
funeral and cemetery operations. As a percentage of revenue, consolidated gross
margin decreased to 217% for the year ended December 31, 2001, from 282% in
2000.
Funeral revenue decreased $548 million, or 95%, to $5221 million for the
year ended December 31, 2001, from $5769 million in 2000, primarily due to
location dispositions, fewer funeral services, and partly, the Predecessor
management Predecessor Management believed, attributable to consumer
concerns caused by the reorganization proceedings. Of the $548 million revenue
decline, approximately $48 million was due to the locations sold during 2000 and
2001. At locations in operation throughout the years ended December 31, 2001 and
2000, funeral revenue declined approximately $7 million, or 13%, to
approximately $505 million, compared to approximately $512 million in 2000, due
primarily to a 11% decline in the number of funeral services performed.
The Predecessor pre-need funeral contracts written decreased to
approximately $108 million in 2001 from approximately $119 million in 2000.
Locations sold in 2001 had written $5 million of pre-need funeral contracts. The
Predecessor estimated that it had a backlog of approximately $11 billion in
pre-need funeral contracts as of December 31, 2001. At January 1, 2000, when the
Predecessor implemented SAB 101, approximately $92 million was recorded on the
balance sheet as deferred revenue, representing amounts received but not
required to be placed in trust, and interest earnings on amounts in trust, which
had previously been recognized in revenue. During 2001, the Predecessor
recognized approximately $44 million of this amount in funeral revenue.
Pre-need funeral services comprised approximately 22% of the annual funeral
services performed by the Predecessor in 2001 and 2000.
Overall funeral gross margin, as a percentage of funeral revenue, decreased
to 265% for the year ended December 31, 2001, from 299% in 2000, principally
as a result of lower revenues and higher fixed costs at locations not sold.
Cemetery revenue decreased $531 million, or 202%, to $2101 million for
the year ended December 31, 2001, from $2632 million in 2000, as at-need
revenue, pre-need revenue and finance income declined, primarily due to location
dispositions, as well as, Predecessor Management believed, consumer concerns
caused by the reorganization proceedings. Of the $531 million revenue decline,
approximately $44 million was due to locations sold during 2000 and 2001, of
which the main components were approximately $11 million at-need revenue and
$28 million pre-need revenue. At locations in operation throughout the years
ended December 31, 2001 and 2000, revenue declined approximately $9 million,
primarily due to lower at-need revenue of approximately $4 million from plot
sales and a decline in finance income of approximately $5 million due to fewer
customer receivables and recent pre-need contracts being written with shorter
contract terms and higher down payments. Though improving cash flow, the shorter
contract terms and larger down payments, as well as the impacts of a lower
number of pre-need cemetery contracts written, negatively impacted finance
income, down approximately $8 million in the year ended December 31, 2001,
compared to 2000.
Pre-need cemetery contracts written during the year ended December 31, 2001
were approximately $69 million, a decrease of approximately $25 million, or
266%, compared to 2000, of which approximately $12 million was attributable to
locations sold. The remaining decline in new pre-need contracts written of
approximately $13 million was primarily due to the Predecessor changes in
pre-need sales practices, including continued refinements of contract terms,
which were less attractive to the customer, but generated significantly better
cash flow to the Predecessor.
34
Overall cemetery gross margin, as a percentage of cemetery revenue,
decreased to 148% for the year ended December 31, 2001, from 319% in 2000,
primarily due to the large declines in at-need and pre-need revenue and finance
income. As well, higher wage and other fixed costs at locations not sold and the
fixed nature of other cemetery expenses, contributed to expense reductions that
were not commensurate with the revenue declines experienced.
Insurance revenue increased 190% to $1042 million for the year ended
December 31, 2001, from $876 million in 2000. Overall insurance gross margin as
a percentage of insurance revenue increased to 112% for the year ended
December 31, 2001, from 65% in 2000, primarily due to higher premium revenue,
lower realized investment losses and litigation costs, partially offset by
increased benefits and claims costs.
General and administrative expenses increased to $757 million for the year
ended December 31, 2001, from $706 million in 2000. The increase in general and
administrative expenses for the year ended December 31, 2001, was primarily due
to costs associated with the continued implementation of a new cemetery contract
management system. General and administrative expenses, as a percentage of
revenue, increased to 91% for the year ended December 31, 2001, from 76% in
2000, primarily due to the effects of the revenue decline.
Depreciation and amortization expenses remained constant at $570 million
for the year ended December 31, 2001 and 2000. As a percentage of revenue,
depreciation and amortization expense increased slightly to 68% for the year
ended December 31, 2001, from 61% in 2000, primarily due to the effects of the
revenue decline.
For the year ended December 31, 2001, the Predecessor recorded a pre-tax
asset impairment of long-lived assets of $1807 million, primarily due to
additional locations sold, as well as from revised estimates of expected cash
flows for the long-lived assets of locations expected to be sold. For the year
ended December 31, 2000, the $1169 million pre-tax asset impairment of
long-lived assets resulted from the Predecessor revising its estimates of
expected cash flows for the long-lived assets of locations expected to be sold.
Gains on sales of locations were $1733 million in 2001 and $56 million in
2000, representing primarily the gain realized at the time of disposition on
deferred pre-need funeral and cemetery contracts.
Interest expense on long-term debt decreased by $14 million to $110
million for the year ended December 31, 2001, from $124 million in 2000. The
decrease was primarily due to the reduction in interest and related fees
associated with the debtors-in-possession revolving credit agreement that
expired on June 30, 2001, as well as the continuing reduction in long-term debt
not subject to compromise. Contractual interest expense not recorded on certain
pre-Petition Date debt obligations amounted to $1325 million and $1539 million
for the years ended December 31, 2001 and 2000, respectively.
Reorganization costs increased to $872 million for the year ended
December 31, 2001, from $459 million in 2000. These costs, before offsetting
interest income of $83 million 2000 -- $47 million, primarily consisted of
$755 million for professional fees for legal, accounting and consulting
services provided to the Debtors and the statutory committee of unsecured
creditors appointed by the U.S. Trustee for the District of Delaware, in
connection with the Debtors' reorganization under Chapter 11 and the Creditors
Arrangement Act, $150 million for the Predecessor Key Employee Retention Plan
and $50 million for executory contracts submitted for rejection. The increase
of approximately $413 million is primarily due to costs incurred in connection
with the Predecessor actual emergence from Chapter 11 and the Creditors
Arrangement Act, and various activities related thereto. Total reorganization
costs since the Petition Date applicable to the Debtors' reorganization amounted
to $2259 million as at December 31, 2001. The Company expects to pay during
2002, approximately $571 million of reorganization costs, which were accrued at
December 31, 2001.
Income taxes for the year ended December 31, 2001 were $280 million,
compared to income tax of $225 million in 2000. The Predecessor tax rate for
the years ended December 31, 2001 and 2000 varied
35
from the statutory tax rate because tax benefits generated by the Predecessor
losses were largely offset by a resultant increase in the valuation allowance
against the Predecessor deferred tax assets. In addition, a substantial
portion of goodwill amortization and reorganization costs are not deductible for
tax purposes and losses incurred in certain jurisdictions may not offset the tax
expense in profitable jurisdictions. Future income and losses, and the
disposition of certain locations, may require the Company to record a change in
the valuation allowance of tax assets that were taken into account in
determining the net amount of liability for deferred income taxes recorded on
its balance sheet at December 31, 2001. If this occurs, any resulting increase
in the valuation allowance would generally be treated as an additional income
tax expense in the period in which it arises, while any resulting decrease in
the valuation allowance established on the Effective Date would be treated as a
reduction of goodwill with any excess over the value assigned to goodwill
recognized as a capital transaction.
The Predecessor recorded an extraordinary gain on debt discharge of
$9590 million and fresh start valuation adjustments of $2281 million for the
year ended December 31, 2001, as a result of its emergence from reorganization
proceedings and the application of fresh start reporting. Additionally, for the
year ended December 31, 2000, the Predecessor recorded a charge for the
cumulative effect of accounting change of $9868 million net of income taxes of
$1087 million as a result of the implementation of SAB 101 effective
January 1, 2000. The cumulative effect of accounting change resulted primarily
from the deferral of $8941 million of merchandise and services revenue,
including related trust income, $2585 million of cemetery interment rights
revenue and other miscellaneous cemetery deferrals of $177 million, reduced by
$548 million reserve for cancellations. The amounts were offset by the reversal
of related merchandise and service costs of sales of $1800 million and
interment rights costs of sales of $401 million. In addition, pre-need funeral
revenue of $920 million was deferred and previously deferred direct obtaining
costs of $1081 million were written off.
The Predecessor statement of cash flows for the year ended December 31,
2001, reflects cash provided from operations of $687 million, compared to
$1478 million in 2000. The decrease in cash of $1591 million for the year
ended December 31, 2001, was primarily due to the distribution of
$1636 million in respect of claims against the Debtors, as well as the
distribution of $939 million to Alderwoods Group, as a result of the
implementation of the Plan on the Effective Date.
DISPOSITIONS
In December 1999, the Predecessor announced its intention to dispose of 201
funeral homes and 170 cemeteries in the United States that did not meet its
strategic objectives, based on geographic location or financial performance. In
January 2000, the Bankruptcy Court approved the Predecessor disposition
process for the locations identified. In addition, other properties not in the
initial group were periodically disposed of after obtaining Bankruptcy Court
approval. During 2000, the Predecessor sold 101 funeral homes and 33 cemeteries
for net proceeds of $361 million. During the year ended December 31, 2001, the
Predecessor sold 124 funeral homes and 119 cemeteries for net proceeds of
$1058 million.

FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS AND RISK FACTORS
FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS
Certain statements made in this Form 10-K, including certain statements made
in the section entitled Management Discussion and Analysis of Alderwoods
Group -- Business Strategy and Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about
Market Risk, in other filings made with the SEC, and elsewhere including oral
statements made on behalf of the Company are forward-looking statements within
the meaning of Section 27Ai of the Securities Act of 1933 and
Section 21Ei of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. The words believe,
may, will, estimate, continues, anticipate, intend, expect and
similar expressions identify these forward-looking statements. Certain events or
circumstances, including those described below under the caption Risk Factors,
could cause actual results to differ materially from those estimated, projected
or predicted. The Company undertakes no obligation to publicly release any
revisions to these forward-looking statements to reflect events or circumstances
after the date hereof or to reflect the occurrence of unanticipated events.
RISK FACTORS
In addition to other information in this Form 10-K, the following important
factors, among others, could cause future results to differ materially from
estimates, predictions or projections.
FUTURE REVENUES ARE UNCERTAIN
1. VOLUME, MIX AND MARGINS ARE UNCERTAIN. Revenue is significantly
affected by the volume of services rendered and the mix and pricing of services
and products sold. Cemetery revenues are also significantly affected by the
fulfillment of previously sold pre-need cemetery contracts and the writing of
pre-need cemetery contracts for interment rights. Margins are affected by
changes in revenue, their related costs and the level of fixed costs in
operating our funeral homes and cemeteries. Further, revenue and margins may be
affected by competitive pricing strategies.
2. NUMBER OF PRE-NEED CONTRACTS WRITTEN IS DEPENDENT UPON AN ADEQUATE
SALESFORCE. The level of pre-need contracts written is dependent upon
maintaining an adequate salesforce. Accordingly, the future success of the
Company is dependent upon the Company ability to attract, train and retain an
adequate number of salespeople.
3. TRUST INCOME IS SUBJECT TO MARKET CONDITIONS. Cemetery revenue is
impacted by the trust income on perpetual care trust funds which is recognized
when the trust income is earned. Trust income on funeral and cemetery
merchandise and service trust funds is deferred and revenue is recognized when
the underlying merchandise and service obligations are fulfilled. The level of
trust income is largely dependent on yields available in connection with the
investment of the balances held in such trust funds. Available yields may be
subject to significant fluctuations in response to conditions in the economy in
general.
4. THE DEATH RATE MAY DECREASE. The death rate in the United States is
estimated to have declined by approximately 1% in 1997 and approximately 2% in
1998, reversing a trend of an approximate 1% increase per year since 1980.
However, for the combined two-year period from 1998 to 2000, the death rate is
estimated to have declined by less than 1%. Industry studies indicate that the
average age of the population is increasing. The financial results of the
Company may be affected by any decline in the death rate.
5. THE RATE OF CREMATION IS INCREASING. There is an increasing trend in
the United States toward cremation. According to the latest industry studies
available, cremations represented approximately 27% of the burials performed in
the United States in 2001, as compared with approximately 10% in 1980, and this
percentage increased by approximately 1% annually from 1997 to 2001. Compared to
traditional funeral services, cremations have historically generated similar
gross profit percentages but lower
37
revenues. A substantial increase in the rate of cremations performed by the
Company could have a material adverse effect on the results of operations of the
Company.
6. DISPOSITIONS MAY ADVERSELY AFFECT REVENUES. Revenue is affected by the
level of dispositions, which may or may not be significant.
THE COMPANY HAS SUBSTANTIAL DEBT
1. SUBSTANTIAL LEVERAGE WILL CONTINUE. The Company total carrying value
of long-term indebtedness including the current portion thereof is
$7597 million as of December 28, 2002. While the Company believes that future
operating cash flow, together with financing arrangements, will be sufficient to
finance operating requirements under the Company business plan, the Company
leverage and debt service requirements could make it more vulnerable to economic
downturns in the markets the Company intends to serve or in the economy
generally. The Company indebtedness could restrict its ability to obtain
additional financing in the future and, because the Company may be more
leveraged than certain of its competitors, could place the Company at a
competitive disadvantage.
The Company Rose Hills' non-recourse subsidiary senior secured debt of
$526 million matures in 2003, approximately $263 million in May 2003 and
approximately $263 million in November 2003. Although, the Company intends to
retire in full the $526 million outstanding on or before May 1, 2003, it
amended the Credit Facility to obtain the Rose Hills Special Advance needed to
finance this retirement. The restrictions under the amended Credit Facility,
which require the Company to obtain lender approval to borrow any other amount
from the Credit Facility until the Rose Hills Special Advance is repaid and
limit the amount that can be outstanding under letters of credit, may exacerbate
the risks noted in the preceding paragraph.
2. DEBT INSTRUMENTS CONTAIN RESTRICTIVE COVENANTS THAT MAY LIMIT LIQUIDITY
AND CORPORATE ACTIVITIES. The Credit Facility and the indentures governing the
Five-Year Secured Notes, the Seven-Year Unsecured Notes, the Convertible
Subordinated Notes and the Rose Hills debt contain covenants that impose
operating and financial restrictions on the Company. For example, these
covenants restrict the ability of Alderwoods Group, and most of its
subsidiaries, to incur additional indebtedness, prepay indebtedness, allow liens
on assets, sell stock or other assets without using proceeds thereof to reduce
the indebtedness of the Company, engage in mergers or acquisitions, make
investments or pay dividends or distributions other than to Alderwoods Group or
certain of its subsidiaries. These covenants could prohibit the Company from
making acquisitions and adversely affect the Company ability to finance future
operations by limiting the incurrence of additional indebtedness or requiring
equity issuance proceeds to be applied to reduce indebtedness. In addition, the
Company is required to achieve specified earnings to fixed charges ratios and
specified levels of tangible net worth. Adverse operating results could cause
the Company to be unable to achieve these financial ratios and tests, in which
event, unless the Company were able to obtain appropriate waivers with respect
to non-compliance, certain of the Company long-term debt would be in default
and the holders thereof could accelerate the maturities of such debt.
3. SUBSIDIARY STOCK IS SUBJECT TO SECURITY INTERESTS. The capital stock of
subsidiaries directly owned by Alderwoods Group or a subsidiary guarantor of the
Credit Facility is subject to various liens and security interests, subject to
percentage limitations in the case of foreign subsidiaries. If a holder of a
security interest becomes entitled to exercise its rights as a secured party, it
would have the right to foreclose upon and sell or otherwise transfer the
collateral subject to its security interest, and the collateral accordingly
would be unavailable to Alderwoods Group or the subsidiary owning the
collateral, except to the extent, if any, that the value of the affected
collateral exceeds the amount of indebtedness in respect of which such
foreclosure rights are exercised.
4. THE SECURITY FOR THE FIVE-YEAR SECURED NOTES MAY NOT BE SUFFICIENT TO
SECURE PAYMENTS. The Company obligations under the Five-Year Secured Notes
Indenture is secured by collateral which consists of i substantially all
personal property other than capital stock and ii the material funeral
38
home real property assets pledged under the Credit Facility of the Company and
certain of its wholly owned subsidiaries. The rights of the holders of the
Five-Year Notes to this collateral will be subordinate to those of the lenders
under the Credit Facility. The proceeds from the sale of this collateral may not
be sufficient to satisfy amounts due on the Five-Year Secured Notes.
If, upon a foreclosure on the collateral, the proceeds from the sale of such
collateral is insufficient to satisfy the entire amount due on the Five-Year
Secured Notes, the claim by the holders of the Five-Year Secured Notes against
the Company for this deficiency would rank equally with the claims of the other
general, unsubordinated creditors of the Company. The remaining assets of the
Company may not be sufficient to satisfy this deficiency.
5. CERTAIN DEBT IS EFFECTIVELY SUBORDINATED TO OBLIGATIONS OF
SUBSIDIARIES. Alderwoods Group principally is a holding company, and therefore
its right to participate in any distribution of assets of any subsidiary upon
that subsidiary dissolution, winding-up, liquidation or reorganization or
otherwise is subject to the prior claims of creditors of that subsidiary, except
to the extent that Alderwoods Group may be a creditor of that subsidiary and its
claims are recognized. There are various legal limitations on the extent to
which some of the subsidiaries of Alderwoods Group may extend credit, pay
dividends or otherwise supply funds to, or engage in transactions with,
Alderwoods Group or its other subsidiaries. The Five-Year Secured Notes, the
Seven-Year Unsecured Notes and the Convertible Subordinated Notes are
effectively subordinated to all indebtedness and other obligations of the
subsidiaries except to the extent that those subsidiaries have guaranteed that
obligations of Alderwoods Group to pay amounts due on the Five-Year Secured
Notes, the Seven-Year Unsecured Notes or the Convertible Subordinated Notes, as
applicable.
THE TAX RATE IS UNCERTAIN
1. EFFECTIVE INCOME TAX RATE MAY VARY. The Company expects that its
effective income tax rate for 2003 and beyond may vary significantly from the
statutory tax rate because i income tax benefits may be offset by an increase
in the valuation allowance due to the uncertainty regarding the ability to
utilize the benefits in the future, ii the losses incurred in certain
jurisdictions may not offset the tax expense in profitable jurisdictions,
iii there are differences between foreign and United States income tax rates,
and iv many tax years are subject to audit by different tax jurisdictions.
2. FEDERAL TAX AUDIT COULD IMPACT TAX RATE. In connection with the audit
of the 1993 through 1998 federal income tax returns, the Company and the
Internal Revenue Service have reached a tentative agreement that resolves
certain issues that were in dispute. This tentative agreement has been submitted
to the Congressional Joint Committee on Taxation Joint Committee for its
review and approval. If approved by the Joint Committee, this tentative
agreement would have a significant positive effect on the Company future tax
rate in the year of settlement. However, the ultimate outcome and timing of the
final resolution cannot be determined at this time.
CAPITAL STOCK: DIVIDENDS NOT ANTICIPATED; ANTI-TAKEOVER EFFECTS
1. VOLATILITY IS POSSIBLE. In January 2002, the Company Common Stock and
Warrants commenced trading on The NASDAQ Stock Market, Inc. Due to the limited
trading history of the Company Common Stock and Warrants, there can be no
assurance as to the degree of price volatility in the market for the Common
Stock and Warrants. The market price of the Common Stock and Warrants may be
subject to significant fluctuations in response to numerous factors, including
variations in the Company annual or quarterly financial results or those of
its competitors, changes by financial analysts in their estimates of the future
earnings of the Company, conditions in the economy in general or in the funeral
industry in particular or unfavorable publicity. Additionally, there can be no
assurance that the market value of the Common Stock will exceed the exercise
price of the Warrants at any time prior to their expiration.
39
2. DIVIDENDS ARE NOT ANTICIPATED; PAYMENT OF DIVIDENDS IS SUBJECT TO
RESTRICTION. Alderwoods Group is not expecting to pay any dividends on the
Common Stock in the foreseeable future. In addition, covenants in the respective
indentures governing the Five-Year Secured Notes, the Seven-Year Unsecured Notes
and the Convertible Subordinated Notes and in the Credit Facility restrict the
ability of Alderwoods Group to pay dividends and may prohibit the payment of
dividends and certain other payments. Certain institutional investors may only
invest in dividend-paying equity securities or may operate under other
restrictions that may prohibit or limit their ability to invest in the Common
Stock.
3. CERTAIN PROVISIONS IN OUR CHARTER DOCUMENTS AND RIGHTS PLAN HAVE
ANTI-TAKEOVER EFFECTS. Certain provisions of the certificate of incorporation
and bylaws, of Alderwoods Group, as well as the General Corporation Law of the
State of Delaware, may have the effect of delaying, deferring or preventing a
change in control of Alderwoods Group. Such provisions, including those
providing for the possible issuance of preferred stock of Alderwoods Group
without stockholder approval, regulating the nomination of directors and
eliminating stockholder action by written consent may make it more difficult for
other persons, without the approval of the Board of Directors the Board of
Alderwoods Group, to make a tender offer or otherwise acquire substantial
amounts of the Common Stock or to launch other takeover attempts that a
stockholder might consider to be in such stockholder best interest.
Additionally, the Company short-term stockholder rights plan, which was
adopted by the Board of Alderwoods Group on March 6, 2002, and became effective
on March 26, 2002, may also delay, defer or prevent a change of control of
Alderwoods Group. Under the rights plan, each outstanding share of Common Stock
has one right attached that trades with the Common Stock. Absent prior action by
the Board of Alderwoods Group to redeem the rights or amend the rights plan,
upon the consummation of certain acquisition transactions, the rights would
entitle the holder thereof other than the acquiror to purchase shares of
Common Stock at a discounted price in a manner designed to result in substantial
dilution to the acquiror. The shareholders rights plan will expire in September
2003, and there is presently no extension or renewal contemplated by
the Company.
OTHER RISK FACTORS
1. FEDERAL, STATE AND LOCAL REGULATIONS MAY CHANGE TO THE DETRIMENT OF
ALDERWOODS GROUP. The Company operations are subject to regulation,
supervision and licensing under numerous federal, state and local laws,
ordinances and regulations, including extensive regulations concerning trust
funds, pre-need sales of funeral and cemetery products and services,
environmental matters and various other aspects of the business. The impact of
such regulations varies depending on the location of funeral homes and
cemeteries. From time to time, states and regulatory agencies have considered
and may enact additional legislation or regulations that could affect the
Company. For example, additional legislation or regulations requiring more
liberal refund and cancellation policies for pre-need sales of products and
services or prohibiting door-to-door or telephone solicitation of potential
customers could adversely impact sales, resulting in lower gross revenues.
Similarly, additional legislation or regulations increasing trust requirements
could reduce the amount of cash available to the Company for other purposes.
Additional legislation or regulations prohibiting the common ownership of
funeral homes and cemeteries in the same market could adversely impact both
sales and costs and expenses in the affected markets. If adopted in the states
in which the Company operates, additional legislation or regulations such as
these could have a material adverse effect on the results of operations of the
Company.
2. ALDERWOODS GROUP PRINCIPALLY IS A HOLDING COMPANY. Alderwoods Group
principally is a holding company, and therefore its right to participate in any
distribution of assets of any subsidiary upon that subsidiary dissolution,
winding-up, liquidation or reorganization or otherwise is subject to the prior
claims of creditors of that subsidiary, except to the extent that Alderwoods
Group may be a creditor of that subsidiary and its claims are recognized. There
are various legal limitations on the extent to which some of the subsidiaries of
Alderwoods Group may extend credit, pay dividends or otherwise supply funds to,
or engage in transactions with, Alderwoods Group or its other subsidiaries.
40
3. OUTCOME OF NAFTA CLAIMS IS IMPOSSIBLE TO PREDICT. In October 1998, the
Predecessor filed the NAFTA Claims against the government of the United States
seeking damages under the arbitration provisions of NAFTA. Pursuant to the Plan,
the Predecessor, through a series of transactions, transferred to the Company
all of its assets, excluding legal title to the NAFTA Claims, and transferred to
the Company the right to any and all proceeds from the NAFTA Claims. In
addition, pursuant to the Plan, an undivided 25% interest in the proceeds, if
any, of the NAFTA Claims as such proceeds may be adjusted as a result of the
arbitration contemplated by the letter agreement between the Predecessor and
Raymond L. Loewen, dated May 27, 1999 the NAFTA Arbitration Agreement, less
a any amounts payable under paragraph 3 of the NAFTA Arbitration Agreement and
b any amounts payable pursuant to the contingency fee letter agreement between
Jones, Day, Reavis & Pogue and Loewen Group, dated July 25, 2000, was
transferred to the Liquidating Trust. Although the Company believes that these
actions should not affect the NAFTA Claims, the government of the United States,
respondent in the NAFTA proceeding, has asserted that these actions have
divested the Arbitration Tribunal of jurisdiction over some or all of the
claims. The Company does not believe that it is possible at this time to predict
the final outcome of this proceeding or to establish a reasonable estimate of
the damages, if any, that may be awarded, or the proceeds, if any, that may be
received in respect of the NAFTA Claims.
ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK
The Company major market risk exposures are to changing interest rates,
currency exchange rates and to equity prices. The market risk exposure
discussion below provides information about market-sensitive financial
instruments and constitutes forward-looking statements, which involve risks
and uncertainties. Actual results could differ materially from those projected
in the forward-looking statements.
The Company exposure to interest rate fluctuations resides primarily in
the United States, and the Company exposure to currency exchange rate
fluctuations resides primarily in investments and operations in Canada and, to a
lesser extent, the United Kingdom, each of which is generally stable politically
and economically and is not highly inflationary. The Company has not entered
into any derivative instruments at December 28, 2002.
The Company intends to implement strategies to manage its mix of floating
and fixed rate debt through the use of derivatives, primarily in the form of
interest rate and currency swap transactions. No such instruments were in place
at December 28, 2002.
The Company debt instrument sensitivity to floating interest rates is
based on the Company floating rate debt being based in the United States.
Accordingly, changes in U.S. interest rates can affect the interest paid on the
Company floating rate debt. The current mix of fixed and floating rate debt
was determined by the Plan. At December 28, 2002, the Company total fixed rate
debt is $7011 million, representing approximately 93% of total debt, and has a
weighted average rate of 1139%. The Company floating rate exposure of
$526 million, represents 7% of total debt and has a weighted average rate of
approximately 49%. A one percent change in the applicable floating rate indices
would cause an approximately $05 million change in the Company annual
interest expense.
The Company exposure to equity prices resides primarily in the United
States. The sale of pre-need funeral contracts, pre-need cemetery merchandise
and insurance products results in the Company having significant investment in,
and supervising the management of the trusts that have significant investments
in mutual funds and equity securities which are sensitive to current market
prices. Fluctuations in interest and equity market rates on investments held in
pre-need funeral trusts and pre-need cemetery merchandise trusts do not result
in significant current income fluctuation, as the income is not realized until
services are performed. Investments of pre-need cemetery merchandise trusts and
insurance invested assets are currently predominately in fixed income
securities. The Company manages the mix of equities and fixed income securities
in accordance with policies set by an investment committee comprised of members
of senior management. The investment committee sets and modifies the mix of
investments with the
41
assistance of independent professional financial advisors. The policy emphasizes
a conservative approach while maintaining acceptable levels of income and
capital appreciation.
The principal cash flows and the related weighted average interest rates for
the Company long-term debt as of December 28, 2002, are presented below. The
carrying values of the Company debt instruments are included in Note 6 to the
Company Consolidated Financial Statements.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT ACCOUNTANTS
The Board of Directors and Stockholders
Alderwoods Group, Inc.   We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Alderwoods
Group, Inc. as at December 28, 2002 and December 31, 2001, and the related
consolidated statements of operations, stockholders' equity and cash flows for
the fifty-two weeks ended December 28, 2002. In connection with our audits of
the consolidated financial statements, we also have audited the information with
respect to the Company in financial statement Schedule II included in  of
the Company annual report on Form 10-K. These consolidated financial
statements and financial statement schedule are the responsibility of the
Company management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these
consolidated financial statements and financial statement schedule based on our
audits.
We conducted our audits in accordance with auditing standards generally
accepted in the United States of America. Those standards require that we plan
and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial
statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a
test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial
statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and
significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall
financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a
reasonable basis for our opinion.
In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above
present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Alderwoods
Group, Inc. as at December 28, 2002, and December 31, 2001, and the results of
its operations and its cash flows for the fifty-two weeks ended December 28,
2002, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United
States of America. Also, in our opinion, the related financial statement
schedule, when considered in relation to the basic financial statements taken as
a whole, presents fairly, in all material respects, the information set forth
therein. s/ KPMG LLP

The Company insurance operations sell a variety of life insurance
products, primarily to fund pre-need funeral services.
NOTE 2. BASIS OF PRESENTATION
The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company,
its subsidiaries and operations controlled by the Company through sales and
management agreements. The Company is the successor to The Loewen Group Inc.
the Predecessor and its subsidiaries, including Loewen Group
International, Inc., a Delaware corporation Loewen International. The
consolidated financial statements have been prepared using the U.S. dollar as
the functional currency and are presented in accordance with accounting
principles generally accepted in the United States.
EMERGENCE FROM REORGANIZATION PROCEEDINGS
On June 1, 1999 the Petition Date, the Predecessor and each of
approximately 850 United States subsidiaries including Loewen International
and one foreign subsidiary voluntarily filed a petition for creditor protection
under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code in the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for
the District of Delaware the U.S. Bankruptcy Court. Concurrent with the
Chapter 11 filing, the Predecessor and 117 Canadian subsidiaries voluntarily
filed an application for creditor protection under the Companies' Creditors
Arrangement Act with the Ontario Superior Court of Justice, Toronto, Ontario,
Canada the Canadian Bankruptcy Court together with the U.S. Bankruptcy
Court, the Bankruptcy Courts. Subsequent to the Petition Date, five
additional subsidiaries of the Predecessor voluntarily filed petitions for
creditor protection and 41 subsidiaries were voluntarily deleted.
On December 5, 2001 and December 7, 2001, the U.S. Bankruptcy Court and the
Canadian Bankruptcy Court, respectively, confirmed the Fourth Amended and
Restated Joint Plan of Reorganization, as modified the Plan, of the
Predecessor and its subsidiaries under creditor protection the Debtors. The
Plan became effective on January 2, 2002 the Effective Date and, for
accounting and reporting purposes, is reflected as of December 31, 2001, because
United States generally accepted accounting principles require that the
financial statements reflect fresh start reporting as of the

confirmation date or as of a later date, that is not subsequent to the Effective
Date, when all material conditions precedent to the Plan becoming binding
are resolved. Pursuant to the Plan, the Debtors altered their debt and capital
structures and, among other things   - completed reorganization transactions that resulted in the ultimate parent
company in the corporate structure being the Company, which was renamed
from Loewen International and now operates the existing businesses of the
Predecessor and Loewen International   - transferred all of the assets of the Predecessor to the Company at fair
value, except for an aggregate cash amount of $133,500,000, which was
transferred prior to December 31, 2001, by the Predecessor to a disbursing
agent for the sole benefit of certain of the Predecessor creditors   - cancelled the stock of certain direct and indirect subsidiaries of the
Predecessor, other than that stock which was owned by the Predecessor or
its direct or indirect subsidiaries   - paid or issued a combination of cash, new Common stock of the Company,
warrants to purchase new Common stock of the Company and new long-term
debt see Note 6 to certain holders of liabilities subject to compromise
that were cancelled   - satisfied certain administrative claims through the issuance of the
Company 12 1/4% Convertible Subordinated Notes Due 2012 in the aggregate
principal amount of $24,679,000, which are convertible into the Company
Common stock at an initial conversion rate of $1717 per share and
379,449 shares of the Company Common stock, which resulted in the
Company becoming the owner of all of the outstanding common stock of Rose
Hills Holdings Corp. Rose Hills, which in turn owns 100% of the
outstanding common stock of Rose Hills Company   - assumed, assumed and assigned, or rejected certain executory contracts and
unexpired leases to which any Debtor was a party   - restructured and simplified the Company and its subsidiaries' corporate
structure; and
- selected new boards of directors of the Company and its reorganized
subsidiaries.
Due to the significant changes in the financial and legal structure of the
Company, the application of fresh start reporting at December 31, 2001,
resulting from confirmation and implementation of the Plan and changes in
accounting policies and fiscal accounting periods adopted by the Company, the
consolidated financial statements of the Company issued subsequent to the Plan
implementation are not comparable with the consolidated financial statements
issued by the Predecessor prior to the Plan implementation. Accordingly, the
Company consolidated financial statements as at and for the 52 weeks ended
December 28, 2002, do not include comparable operating and cash flow
information. Certain consolidated financial and other information concerning the
Predecessor may be of limited interest to the stockholders of the Company and
has been included elsewhere in this Form 10-K.
FRESH START REPORTING
At December 31, 2001, the Company adopted fresh start reporting in
accordance with AICPA Statement of Position 90-7, Financial Reporting by
Entities in Reorganization under the Bankruptcy Code SOP 90-7, which in
turn required application at the date of Plan implementation of purchase

accounting principles, as prescribed by Statement of Financial Accounting
Standards No. 141, Business Combinations FAS No. 141, which superceded
Accounting Principles Board Opinion APB No. 16, Business Combinations. In
addition, SOP 90-7 requires the adoption of any new accounting principles
concurrent with the adoption of fresh start reporting. As such, the Company
adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 142, Goodwill and Other
Intangible Assets, FAS No. 142 on December 31, 2001. As a result of the
adoption of FAS No. 142, goodwill arising from the Company reorganization is
not amortized. Also concurrent with fresh start reporting, the Company adopted a
revenue recognition policy relating to pre-need sales of interment rights which
differed from that previously applied by the Predecessor see Note 3.
Under the principles of fresh start reporting, the Company was required to
record the aggregate value of the Company based on the reorganization value as
set forth in the Plan. The reorganization value of the Company was determined
with the assistance of independent advisors and estimated at the midpoint of the
total enterprise value range I.E., the fair market value of the Company debt
and stockholders' equity, which was approximately $15 billion. The
reorganization valuation utilized various valuation techniques, including
comparable public company trading multiples, discounted cash flow analysis and
comparable acquisition analysis.
In accordance with the principles of purchase accounting, as prescribed by
FAS No. 141 and FAS No. 142, the reorganization value was then allocated to the
Company identifiable tangible and intangible assets and liabilities based on
their fair values, with the residual recorded as goodwill. As a result of the
application of fresh start reporting, significant adjustments were made to the
Company historical assets and liabilities, as the fair values varied
significantly from recorded amounts of the Predecessor immediately prior to the
date of Plan adoption at December 31, 2001 see Note 19.
The following methods and assumptions were used to estimate the fair value
of significant assets and liabilities at December 31, 2001   Cash and cash equivalents, receivables, inventories, other current assets,
and accounts payable and accrued liabilities: The carrying amounts, which
reflected provisions for uncollectible amounts and for inventory
obsolescence, approximated fair value because of the short term to maturity
of these current assets and liabilities.
Pre-need funeral and cemetery contracts: For funeral and cemetery customer
receivables, the fair value was determined as the present value of expected
future cash flows discounted at the interest rate offered by the Company,
which approximated market rates for loans of similar terms to customers with
comparable credit risk. For amounts receivable from funeral and cemetery
trusts, the fair value was based on quoted market prices of the underlying
investments. Amounts receivable from third-party insurance companies were
based on the face value of the policy plus accumulated annual insurance
benefits. Pre-need funeral and cemetery contracts were recorded net of
allowances for expected cancellations and refunds.
Cemetery property: For developed land and undeveloped land, the fair value
was estimated by discounting cash flows from the expected future sales of
cemetery land, reduced by a reasonable profit margin. A maximum term of
30 years was assumed in determining projected sales revenue. Portions of the
Company cemetery land are situated in areas that could not be developed
due to geographic or

regulatory restrictions. Such cemetery land, together with portions of land
that were not required for sales during the next 30 years and for which the
Company had no plan to sell, were assigned a fair value of zero. For
mausoleums and lawn crypts, the fair value was based on the replacement cost
for similar inventory. It is possible that the Company future operations
in the near term may result in recoveries on excess land sales that are
different than those assumed in the estimates.
Insurance invested assets and insurance policy liabilities: Insurance
invested assets were stated at market based on quoted market prices. Policy
liabilities were estimated and, together with future premiums and investment
income, were considered to be sufficient to pay future benefits, dividends
and expenses on insurance and annuity contracts. For traditional products,
insurance policy liabilities were computed using the net level premium
method based on estimated investment yields, withdrawals, mortality and
other assumptions that were appropriate at the time that the policies were
issued or, for policies acquired through acquisition, such assumptions were
as of the purchase date. Estimates used were based on the Company
experience, as adjusted to provide for possible adverse deviation. Future
policy benefits on investment-type contracts reflected the account value
before applicable surrender charges.
Long-term debt: The fair value of the Company long-term debt was estimated
by discounting the future cash flows of each instrument at rates for similar
debt instruments of comparable maturities.
Deferred pre-need funeral and cemetery contract revenue: The fair value of
deferred funeral and cemetery contract revenue was based on the larger of,
as applicable, i the amount refundable to the customer, if the contract
was written in a jurisdiction requiring refunds upon request by the customer
or upon cancellation for non-payment; ii the amount of an insurance policy
representing the face value and accumulated annual insurance benefits; or
iii the present value of the projected future cost to outsource the
fulfillment of the pre-need obligation, based on the estimated outsourcing
cost and mortality, inflation and interest rate assumptions. It is possible
deferred pre-need funeral and cemetery contract revenue could change
materially in the near term as a result of actual servicing and cancellation
experience.
NOTE 3. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
PRINCIPLES OF CONSOLIDATION
The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company,
its subsidiary companies and operations controlled by the Company through sales
and management agreements. All subsidiaries are wholly owned, except for a few
companies with small minority interests.
All significant intercompany balances have been eliminated in the
consolidated financial statements.
USE OF ESTIMATES
The preparation of the consolidated financial statements in accordance with
United States generally accepted accounting principles requires management to
make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and
liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of
the consolidated financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenue and
expenses during the reporting period. As a result, actual amounts could
significantly differ from those estimates.

NOTE 3. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES CONTINUED
FUNERAL OPERATIONS
Sales of at-need funeral services are recorded as revenue when the service
is performed.
Pre-need funeral services contracts provide for future funeral services,
generally determined by prices prevailing at the time the contract is signed.
The payments made under the contract, in part, are either placed in trust or are
used to pay the premiums of life insurance policies under which the Company is
designated as beneficiary. Pre-need funeral services contract amounts, together
with related trust fund investment earnings and annual insurance benefits, are
deferred until the service is performed. The Company estimates that trust fund
investment earnings and annual insurance benefits exceed the increase in cost
over time of providing the related services.
Selling costs related to the sale of pre-need funeral services are expensed
in the period incurred.
CEMETERY OPERATIONS
Sales of cemetery merchandise and services and at-need cemetery interment
rights are recorded as revenue when the merchandise is delivered or service is
performed.
Sales of pre-need cemetery interment rights are recognized in accordance
with the retail land sales provisions of Statement of Financial Accounting
Standards No. 66, Accounting for Sales of Real Estate FAS No. 66.
Accordingly, provided certain collectibility criteria are met, pre-need cemetery
interment right sales of developed cemetery property are recognized when a
specified minimum percentage of the sales price has been collected, while
pre-need cemetery interment right sales of undeveloped cemetery property are
deferred and revenue is recognized on a percentage of completion basis. A
portion of the proceeds from cemetery sales for interment rights is generally
required by law to be paid into perpetual or endowment care trusts. Earnings of
perpetual or endowment care trusts are recognized in current cemetery revenue
and are used to help defray the maintenance costs of cemeteries, which are
expensed as incurred. The principal of these perpetual or endowment care trusts
cannot be withdrawn by the Company, and therefore is not included in the
Company consolidated financial statements.
Pursuant to various state and provincial laws, a portion of the proceeds
from the sale of pre-need merchandise and services may also be required to be
paid into trusts, which are included in pre-need cemetery contracts in the
Company consolidated financial statements. Earnings on merchandise and
services trust funds are recognized when the revenue of the associated
merchandise or service is recognized.
Selling costs related to the sale of pre-need cemetery contract revenues are
expensed in the period incurred.
Interest is imputed at a market rate for financed pre-need cemetery
contracts that do not bear a market rate of interest.
INSURANCE OPERATIONS
For traditional life and participating life products, premiums are
recognized as revenue when due from policyholders. Benefits and expenses are
associated with earned premiums to result in recognition of
54

NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED

NOTE 3. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES CONTINUED
profits over the life of the policy contracts. This association is accomplished
by means of the provision for liabilities for future policy benefits and the
amortization of deferred policy acquisition costs.
Revenues from annuity contracts represent amounts assessed against contract
holders. Such assessments are principally surrender charges. Policy account
balances for annuities represent the deposits received plus accumulated interest
less applicable accumulated administrative fees.
Investment income, net of investment expenses, and realized gains and losses
related to insurance invested assets are included within revenues.
To the extent recoverable, certain costs of acquiring new insurance business
have been deferred. Such costs consist of first-year commissions in excess of
renewal rates, related fringe benefit costs, and direct underwriting and
issuance costs.
The deferred policy acquisition costs on traditional life products are
amortized with interest over the anticipated premium-paying period of the
related policies, in proportion to the ratio of annual premium revenue to be
received over the life of the policies. Expected premium revenue is estimated by
using the same mortality and withdrawal assumptions used in computing
liabilities for future policy benefits. The amount of deferred policy
acquisition costs is reduced by a provision for possible inflation on
maintenance and settlement expenses.
Also, the present value of future profits of acquired insurance business in
force is amortized over the expected premium-paying period of the policies
acquired.
CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS
Cash and cash equivalents include cash and term deposits with a term to
maturity at acquisition of less than or equal to 90 days.
INVENTORIES
Inventories are carried at the lower of cost, determined primarily on a
specific identification basis or a first-in first-out basis, and net realizable
value.
CEMETERY PROPERTY
Cemetery property, including capitalized interest, consists of developed
plots, lawn crypts, mausoleums or niches and undeveloped land, and is valued at
average cost. Amounts are expensed as revenue from sales of cemetery property is
recognized.

PROPERTY AND EQUIPMENT
Property and equipment is recorded at cost and depreciated on a
straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of the assets as follows                         
Buildings and  10 to 40 years

Goodwill, resulting from reorganization value in excess of identifiable net
assets and purchase acquisitions, is not amortized, but tested annually for
impairment. The Company reporting units for goodwill are its reportable
funeral and cemetery operating segments, and its two insurance reporting units.
Identifiable intangible assets consist of deferred insurance policy
acquisition costs, present value of future insurance business profits and
acquired key employee covenants not to compete, which are amortized over their
respective useful lives using a method reflecting the pattern in which such
assets are consumed.
FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS
Financial instruments that potentially subject the Company to concentrations
of credit or collection risk principally consist of cash and cash equivalents,
customer receivables and receivables from trust and insurance companies
presented on the balance sheets in pre-need funeral and cemetery contracts.
The Company maintains its cash and cash equivalents with various financial
institutions. As at December 28, 2002, the Company had approximately $16,984,000
2001 -- $70,000,000 of cash and cash equivalents at two financial
institutions.
Concentrations of credit risk with respect to customer receivables are
minimal, due to the low dollar amount of each receivable, the large number of
customers and the large dispersion of the receivables across many geographic
areas.
Receivables from trust and insurance companies represent customer payments
on pre-need funeral contracts and pre-need cemetery contracts that are placed
into state regulated trusts or used to pay premiums on life insurance contracts,
generally do not subject the Company to significant collection risk. Insurance
funded contracts are subject to supervision by state insurance departments and
are protected in the majority of states by insurance guaranty acts. In addition,
funds placed into certain state regulated trusts are limited to federally
insured deposits and or U.S. Government bonds. The Company policies with
respect to trust fund investments are specifically designed such that
investments are diversified primarily in cash, fixed income and equity
securities and are maintained with various high quality and reputable
counterparties, as well as to minimize concentrations of credit risk by not
maintaining disproportionately large balances in any one financial counterparty.

Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123, Accounting for
Stock-Based Compensation FAS No. 123, Statement of Financial Accounting
Standards No. 148, Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation -- Transition and
Disclosure -- an Amendment of FASB Statement No. 123, FAS No. 148,
established accounting and disclosure requirements using a fair value-based
method of accounting for stock-based employee compensation plans. However, as
allowed by FAS No. 123, the Company has elected to continue to apply the
intrinsic value-based method of accounting described below, and has adopted the
disclosure requirements of FAS No. 123 and FAS No. 148.
The Company applies the intrinsic value-based method of accounting
prescribed by APB Opinion No. 25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees,
and related interpretations, including FASB Interpretation No. 44, Accounting
for Certain Transactions involving Stock Compensation, an interpretation of APB
Opinion No. 25, to account for its fixed plan stock options. Under this method,
compensation expense is recorded on the date of grant only if the current market
price of the underlying stock exceeds the exercise price. Any compensation
expense recorded is charged against operations over the service period, which
generally matches the option vesting period. No stock-based employee
compensation cost is recorded for the 52 weeks ended December 28, 2002, as all
options granted under the Company stock option plan had an exercise price
equal to or greater than the market value of the underlying Common stock on the
grant date. The following table illustrates the effect on net loss and net

Income taxes are accounted for under the asset and liability method.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax
consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement
carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax
bases, and operating loss and tax credit carryforwards. Deferred tax assets and
liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable
income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be
recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a
change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the
enactment date. A valuation allowance is provided against deferred tax assets to
the extent recoverability of the asset cannot be considered to be more likely
than not.
In accordance with the principles of fresh start reporting, any future
reduction of valuation allowances established at the Effective Date will reduce
goodwill established at the Effective Date or, if such goodwill has been reduced
to zero, increase capital in excess of par value.
FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSLATION
The assets and liabilities of the Company foreign subsidiaries, which have
a functional currency other than the U.S. dollar, are translated into U. S.
dollars at the rates of exchange as at the balance sheet date, and revenue and
expenses are translated at the average rates of exchange for the periods of
operation. The net gains or losses arising from the translations are included in
stockholders' equity as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income in
the consolidated statement of stockholders' equity.
CHANGE IN FISCAL YEAR
On March 6, 2002, the Board of Directors of the Company approved a change in
the Company fiscal year end from December 31 to the Saturday nearest to
December 31 in each year whether before or after such date. This change is
effective for fiscal year 2002, which ended on December 28, 2002.

NOTE 3. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES CONTINUED
In connection with the change in fiscal year end, the Company also realigned
its fiscal quarters. In fiscal 2002, the first, second and fourth fiscal
quarters each consisted of 12 weeks and the third fiscal quarter consisted of
16 weeks.
In order to cause the fourth fiscal quarter to end on the same day as the
fiscal year, as described above, the fourth fiscal quarter will consist of
13 weeks in certain years.
COMPARIBILITY
Certain comparative amounts have been reclassified to conform to the
presentation adopted in the current year.
RECENT ACCOUNTING STANDARDS
In June 2001, the Financial Accounting Standards Board FASB issued
Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 143, Accounting for Asset
Retirement Obligations FAS No. 143. FAS No. 143 addresses financial
accounting and reporting for obligations associated with the retirement of
tangible long-lived assets and the associated asset retirement costs. FAS
No. 143 requires that the fair value of a liability for an asset retirement
obligation be recognized in the period in which it is incurred if a reasonable
estimate of fair value can be made. The associated asset retirement costs are
capitalized as part of the carrying amount of the long-lived asset. FAS No. 143
is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after
June 15, 2002, with early application encouraged. The Company believes that the
adoption of FAS No. 143 will have no material impact on its financial condition
or results of operations.
In April 2002, the FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards
No. 145, Rescission of FASB Statements No. 4, 44 and 64, Amendment of FASB
Statement No. 13 and Technical Corrections FAS No. 145. As a result of the
rescission of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 4 and 64, gains
and losses from extinguishments of debt are to be accounted for under the
provisions of Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 30, Reporting the Results
of Operations -- Reporting the Effect of Disposal of a Segment of a Business,
and Extraordinary, Unusual and Infrequently Occurring Events and Transactions.
FAS No. 145 also rescinds Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 44,
Accounting for Intangible Assets of Motor Carriers. FAS No. 145 amends
Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 13, Accounting for Leases, to
eliminate an inconsistency between the required accounting for sale-leaseback
transactions and the required accounting for certain lease modifications that
have economic effects that are similar to sale-leaseback transactions. FAS
No. 145 also amends other existing authoritative pronouncements to make various
technical corrections, clarify meanings or describe their applicability under
changed conditions. FAS No. 145 is effective for fiscal years beginning after
May 15, 2002. The Company believes that the adoption of FAS No. 145 will have no
material impact on its financial condition or results of operations.
In June 2002, the FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards
No. 146, Accounting for Costs Associated with Exit or Disposal Activities
FAS No. 146. FAS No. 146 addresses financial accounting and reporting for
costs associated with exit or disposal activities and nullifies Emerging Issues
Task Force Issue No. 94-3, Liability Recognition for Certain Employee
Termination Benefits and Other Costs to Exit an Activity including Certain
Costs Incurred in a Restructuring. FAS No. 146 requires that
59

TABULAR AMOUNTS EXPRESSED IN THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS EXCEPT PER SHARE AMOUNTS
NOTE 3. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES CONTINUED
a liability for a cost associated with an exit or disposal activity be
recognized when the liability is incurred. FAS No. 146 also establishes that
fair value is the objective for initial measurement of the liability.
FAS No. 146 is effective for exit or disposal activities that are initiated
after December 31, 2002. The Company believes that on adoption, FAS No. 146 will
have no material impact on its financial condition or results of operations.
In November 2002, the FASB issued FASB Interpretation No. 45, Guarantor
Accounting and Disclosure Requirements for Guarantees, Including Indirect
Guarantees of Indebtedness of Others, an interpretation of FASB Statements
No. 5, 57 and 107 and Rescission of FASB Interpretation No. 34 FIN No. 45.
FIN No. 45 clarifies the requirements of Statement of Financial Accounting
Standards No. 5, Accounting for Contingencies, relating to the guarantor
accounting for, and disclosure of, the issuance of certain types of guarantees.
The disclosure provisions of FIN No. 45 are effective for financial statements
of interim or annual periods that end after December 15, 2002. The provisions of
FIN No. 45 for initial recognition and measurement are effective on a
prospective basis for guarantees that are issued or modified after December 31,
2002, irrespective of a guarantor year-end. The Company has considered the
disclosure requirements of FIN No. 45 in the preparation of these consolidated
financial statements. The Company does not currently believe that it has
outstanding instruments that, if they had been subject to the measurement
provisions of FIN No. 45, would have materially impacted its reported financial
condition or results of operations.
In December 2002, the FASB issued FAS No. 148. FAS No. 148 provides
alternative methods of transition for a voluntary change to the fair value-based
method of accounting for stock-based employee compensation. In addition, FAS
No. 148 amends the disclosure requirements of FAS No. 123 to require prominent
disclosures in both annual and interim financial statements about the method of
accounting for stock-based employee compensation and the effect of the method
used on reported results. The Company has adopted the disclosure provisions of
FAS No. 148 and has presented the pro forma effects of FAS No. 123 for the 52
weeks ended December 28, 2002.
In January 2003, the FASB issued FASB Interpretation No. 46 FIN No. 46,
Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities. FIN No. 46 clarifies the
application of Accounting Research Bulletin No. 51, Consolidated Financial
Statements, to certain entities in which equity investors do not have the
characteristics of a controlling financial interest or do not have sufficient
equity at risk for the entity to finance its activities without additional
subordinated financial support from other parties. FIN No. 46 applies
immediately to variable interest entities created after January 31, 2003, and to
variable interest entities in which an enterprise obtains an interest after that
date. FIN No. 46 applies in the first fiscal year or interim period beginning
after June 15, 2003, to variable interest entities in which an enterprise holds
a variable interest that it acquired before February 1, 2003. FIN No. 46 applies
to public enterprises as of the beginning of the applicable interim or annual
period. Although the Company is continuing to consider the implications of
FIN No. 46, it currently believes that the adoption of FIN No. 46 will have no
material impact on its financial condition or results of operations.

NOTE 5. PRE-NEED CEMETERY ACTIVITIES CONTINUED
It is not practicable to estimate the fair value of customer receivables,
because of the large number of individual contracts, which generally have terms
of one to seven years and contractual or imputed interest rates ranging from
900% to 1275% per annum.
PERPETUAL CARE TRUSTS
The perpetual care trust funds are not included in the Company
consolidated balance sheets, as the principal of these trusts cannot be
withdrawn by the Company. The carrying value of the trust investments was
$274,443,000 and $259,520,000 at December 28, 2002, and December 31, 2001,

NOTE 6. LONG-TERM DEBT CONTINUED
At December 28, 2002, the fair value of long-term debt was estimated based
on quoted market prices, where applicable, and discounted future cash flows of
each instrument at rates for similar debt instruments of comparable maturities.
At December 31, 2001, the long-term debt carrying values were equal to their
fair values, as a result of the application of fresh start reporting.
a On January 2, 2002, the Company entered into an exit financing facility
the Credit Facility. The Credit Facility has a maximum availability
of the lesser of $75,000,000 including $35,000,000 in the form of
letters of credit or an amount determined pursuant to a borrowing base
calculation equal to the sum of a 80% of eligible accounts receivable
plus b the lesser of i 50% of the value of eligible inventory and
ii $15,000,000 plus c the lesser of i 25% of the book value of real
property on which the collateral agent for the lenders has a first
priority mortgage and ii $40,000,000. The Credit Facility is used
primarily to fund the Company working capital needs and as more fully
described below, may be used to repay the subsidiary credit agreement
described below, and bears interest at a rate per annum equal to the
J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. prime rate 15625% at December 28, 2002, plus
1% or, at the Company option, LIBOR 14% at December 28, 2002, plus
25%. A fee of 25% is charged on letters of credit and a commitment fee
of 050% is charged on the unused portion of the Credit Facility.
Material covenants include a requirement to maintain a minimum tangible
net worth, required earnings before interest, taxes, and depreciation and
amortization to a fixed charge coverage ratio, and a yearly maximum on
capital expenditures. The Credit Facility is secured by specified real
property, and substantially all personal property of the Company and
specified subsidiaries.
On November 14, 2002, the expiry date of the Credit Facility was extended
to January 2, 2004. On February 14, 2003, the terms of the Credit
Facility were further amended to allow the Company to draw up to
$30,000,000 the Rose Hills Special Advance from the Credit Facility
for the purpose of assisting in the repayment of the principal amount of
$52,642,000 outstanding under Rose Hills' bank credit agreement as
discussed below in b. In addition, the amendment provided that while
any amount under the Rose Hills Special Advance is outstanding, the
Company requires lender approval to borrow any other amount from the
Credit Facility, the aggregate amount outstanding under letters of credit
may not exceed $14,000,000 and the Credit Facility will be additionally
secured by specified personal and real property of Rose Hills and its
subsidiaries. Also, on February 14, 2003, the expiry date of the Credit
Facility was further extended to April 30, 2004. As of December 28, 2002,
the Company borrowing base was approximately $70,074,000, less
approximately $12,088,000 in outstanding letters of credit.
b Subsidiary credit agreement which provides for 1 a senior secured
amortization extended term loan facility in an aggregate principal amount
of $75,000,000, and 2 a senior secured revolving credit facility in an
aggregate principal amount of $10,000,000, which remains undrawn at
December 28, 2002. The subsidiary is required to maintain certain defined
financial ratios and there are restrictions on the payment of dividends
to the Company. The credit agreement bears interest, at the Company
option, at the reference rate of the agent acting on behalf of the
financial institutions, plus 2%, or under a Eurodollar option, at a
reserve adjusted Eurodollar rate, plus 3%. As of December 28, 2002,
interest was charged at a rate of 494% on outstanding borrowings under
the term loan facility. The Company pays a commitment fee of 050% on the

The Credit Facility, 11% Senior secured notes due in 2007, 1225% Senior

consummating certain asset sales unless: a consideration at least equal to
fair market value is received; and b except with respect to specified assets,
not less than 75% of the consideration for the asset sale is paid in cash.
Within 270 days of the receipt of net proceeds from any such asset sale, the
Company will be obligated to apply such net proceeds at its option or as
otherwise required as follows: a to pay the Credit Facility and permanently
reduce commitments with respect thereto, or b to make capital expenditures or
acquisitions of other assets in the same line of business as the Company or
specified subsidiaries or businesses related thereto. To the extent the Company
receives net proceeds from any such asset sale not applied in accordance with
the immediately preceding sentence in excess of certain thresholds, the Company
must offer to purchase 11% Senior unsecured notes due in 2007, 1225% Senior
unsecured notes due in 2009 or 1225% Convertible subordinated notes due in 2012
in that order with such excess proceeds.
Material covenants under the indentures governing the 11% Senior unsecured
notes due in 2007, 1225% Senior unsecured notes due in 2009 and 1225%
Convertible subordinated notes due in 2012 include restrictions placed on the
Company and specified subsidiaries to incur additional indebtedness, pay
dividends, repay subordinate or junior indebtedness, and encumber property or

The Black-Scholes option-pricing model was developed for use in estimating
the fair value of traded options that have no vesting restrictions and are fully
transferable. In addition, option-pricing models require the input of highly
subjective assumptions, including the expected price volatility and option life.
The expected option life is based on the Predecessor historical experience as
well as the vesting periods and terms of the stock options. The Company uses
expected volatility rates, which are based on a combination of the Company
historical volatility rates, plus the historical volatility rates of other
companies in the death care industry, trended into future years. Changes in the
subjective input assumptions can materially affect the fair value estimate, and
therefore the existing models do not necessarily provide a reliable single
measure of the fair value of the Company stock options.
NOTE 9. LEGAL CONTINGENCIES
THE LOEWEN GROUP INC. ET AL. V. THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA
In October 1998, the Predecessor and Raymond L. Loewen, the then-Chairman
and Chief Executive Officer of the Predecessor, filed a claim against the United
States government for damages under the arbitration provisions of the North
American Free Trade Agreement NAFTA. The claimants contend that they were
damaged as a result of breaches by the United States of its obligations under
NAFTA in connection with certain litigation in the State of Mississippi entitled
O'KEEFE VS. THE LOEWEN GROUP INC.

NOTE 9. LEGAL CONTINGENCIES CONTINUED
Specifically, the plaintiffs allege that they were subjected to discrimination,
a denial of justice, a denial of the fair and equitable treatment and full
protection and security guaranteed by NAFTA and an uncompensated expropriation,
all in violation of NAFTA. The NAFTA claims are currently the subject of a
pending proceeding before an arbitration panel the Arbitration Tribunal
appointed pursuant to the rules of the International Centre for Settlement of
Investment Disputes. In January 2001, the Arbitration Tribunal issued a ruling
rejecting certain of the U.S. government jurisdictional challenges and
scheduled a hearing on the merits of the NAFTA claims, held on October 15-19,
2001. A motion relating to the jurisdiction of this matter was heard on June 5,
2002. The matter is now pending before the Arbitration Tribunal.
Pursuant to the Plan, the Predecessor, through a series of transactions,
transferred to the Company all of its assets, excluding legal title to the NAFTA
claims, and transferred to the Company the right to any and all proceeds from
the NAFTA claims. In addition, pursuant to the Plan, an undivided 25% interest
in the proceeds, if any, of the NAFTA claims as such proceeds may be adjusted as
a result of the arbitration contemplated by the letter agreement between the
Predecessor and Raymond L. Loewen, dated May 27, 1999 the NAFTA Arbitration
Agreement, less a any amounts payable under paragraph 3 of the NAFTA
Arbitration Agreement and b any amounts payable pursuant to the contingency
fee letter agreement between Jones, Day, Reavis & Pogue and the Predecessor,
dated July 25, 2000, was transferred to a liquidating trust for the benefit of
creditors of the Predecessor. Although the Company believes that these actions
should not affect the NAFTA claims, the government of the United States,
respondent in the NAFTA proceeding, has asserted that these actions have
divested the Arbitration Tribunal of jurisdiction over some or all of the
claims. The Company does not believe that it is possible at this time to predict
the final outcome of this proceeding or to establish a reasonable estimate of
the damages, if any, that may be awarded, or the proceeds, if any, that may be
received in respect of the NAFTA claims.
OTHER
The Company is a party to other legal proceedings in the ordinary course of
its business, but does not expect the outcome of any other proceedings,
individually or in the aggregate, to have a material adverse effect on the
Company financial position, results of operations or liquidity.

are projected to be $7,734,000 in 2003.
Total expense incurred under all operating leases for the 52 weeks ended
December 28, 2002, was $23,829,000.
ENVIRONMENTAL CONTINGENCIES AND LIABILITIES
The Company operations are subject to numerous environmental laws,
regulations and guidelines adopted by various governmental authorities in the
jurisdictions in which the Company operates. On a continuing basis, the
Company business practices are designed to assess and evaluate environmental
risk and, when necessary, conduct appropriate corrective measures. Liabilities
are recorded when known or considered probable and reasonably estimable.
The Company provides for environmental liabilities using its best estimates.
Actual environmental liabilities could differ significantly from these
estimates.
NOTE 11. RETIREMENT PLANS
The Company has a 401K Retirement Savings Plan for United States employees

Although realization of the Company net deferred tax assets is not
assured, management believes that it is more likely than not that reversals of
deferred tax liabilities and the expected profitability of the Company
insurance operations over the next 15 years will provide sufficient taxable
income to realize the deferred tax assets after consideration of the valuation
allowance. It is possible that the estimated valuation allowance could change in
the near term due to matters such as the timing and manner of reversals of
deferred tax liabilities, sales of operations and future income or loss. If this
occurs, any resulting increase in the valuation allowance would generally be
treated as an additional income tax expense in the period in

which it arises, while any resulting decrease reflecting realization of the
benefits of tax assets that had a corresponding valuation allowance established
on the Effective Date would be treated as a reduction of goodwill established on
the Effective Date, with any excess over the value assigned to such goodwill
recognized as a capital transaction.
As a result of the Company emergence from bankruptcy, all federal net
operating loss carryforwards of the Company generated prior to emergence and
during fiscal 2002, have been eliminated. As a result, the Company net
operating loss carryforwards pertaining to State, local, and foreign
jurisdictions will expire as follows                                 END OF

The amount of loss carryforwards reflects the Company best estimate of the
effects that the confirmation and implementation of the Plan will have on the
reduction and in some cases elimination of certain net operating loss
carryforwards for income tax purposes. These amounts are subject to final
determination by taxation authorities. Further, the Company expects its ability
to utilize certain net operating losses to offset future Company taxable income
in any particular year may be limited because distribution of the Company
Common stock to the Company creditors pursuant to the Plan has resulted in an
ownership change as defined in Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code. The
Company believes that uncertainty exists with respect to future realization of
the loss carryforwards and a full valuation allowance has been established for
the net operating loss carryforwards.
Deferred tax liabilities are not recognized for basis differences related to
investments in foreign subsidiaries that are essentially permanent in duration.
Goodwill that is expected to be deductible for tax purposes at December 28,
2002 is $124,854,000 2001 -- $141,729,000.

NOTE 15. GOODWILL
FAS No. 142 requires that goodwill be reviewed for impairment annually, as
well as upon the occurrence of certain events that would more likely than not
reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying amount. Under FAS
No. 142, goodwill impairment is deemed to exist, and must then be further
assessed, if a reporting unit carrying amount exceeds its estimated fair
value. The Company reporting units are funeral, cemetery and insurance, which
are consistent with the Company operating segments. All of the Company
goodwill is recorded in the funeral reporting unit. In accordance with FAS
No. 142, the Company undertook its annual goodwill impairment review during the
16 weeks ended October 5, 2002, and, as a result, a goodwill impairment
provision of $242,204,000 for the funeral reporting unit was recorded for the
52 weeks ended December 28, 2002. In calculating the goodwill impairment
provision, the fair value of the funeral reporting unit was determined by
independent advisors using a discounted cash flow valuation methodology with a
discount rate, comparable with other enterprises in the death care industry,
adjusted for risks associated with differences in company size, certain
characteristics specific to the Company and cash flow projection risk. The
methods used to fair value the identifiable assets and liabilities were
consistent with the methods used at fresh start.
The funeral reporting unit goodwill impairment provision was primarily the
result of a reduction of the projected financial results used in the valuation
of the funeral reporting unit compared to those used during the reorganization
process and the determination of reorganization value as set forth in the Plan.
The financial projections were reduced principally due to actual 2002 operating
results. The lower valuation was also affected by the decline in the economy
generally, as well as the decline in funeral industry-specific market values.

NOTE 17. IMPAIRMENT OF ASSETS
In accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 144,
Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets FAS
No. 144, the Company reviews its long-lived assets for impairment when changes
in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the asset may not be
recoverable. FAS No. 144 requires that long-lived assets to be held and used be
recorded at the lower of carrying amount or fair value. Long-lived assets to be
disposed of are to be recorded at the lower of carrying amount or fair value,
less estimated cost to sell.
During the 52 weeks ended December 28, 2002, the Company identified eight
additional funeral homes and 36 additional cemeteries as probable for sale, but
not sold as at December 28, 2002, as they do not meet the Company future
geographic and strategic objectives. In addition, of the remaining funeral homes
and cemeteries that were previously identified by the Predecessor as probable
for sale during its reorganization proceedings, 14 funeral homes and
26 cemeteries either had signed agreements for sale or were being negotiated for
sale at December 28, 2002. The carrying amount of these 22 funeral homes and
62 cemeteries was approximately $20,088,000, and the fair market value, less
estimated costs to sell, was approximately $16,805,000. The fair market value
was determined by specific offer or bid, or an estimate based on comparable
recent sales transactions. As a result, a pre-tax long-lived asset impairment
provision of $3,283,000 was recorded during the 52 weeks ended December 28,

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT ACCOUNTANTS
The Loewen Group Inc.
We have audited the consolidated balance sheet of The Loewen Group Inc. as
at December 31, 2001 and the related consolidated statements of operations,
stockholders' equity and cash flows for the years ended December 31, 2001 and
2000. In connection with our audits of the consolidated financial statements, we
also have audited the information with respect to the Predecessor in financial
statement Schedule II included in  of the Predecessor annual report on
Form 10-K. These financial statements and financial statement schedule are the
responsibility of the Predecessor management. Our responsibility is to express
an opinion on these financial statements and financial statement schedule based
on our audits.
We conducted our audits in accordance with United States and Canadian
generally accepted auditing standards. Those standards require that we plan and
perform an audit to obtain reasonable assurance whether the financial statements
are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis,
evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An
audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant
estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial
statement presentation.
In our opinion, these consolidated financial statements present fairly, in
all material respects, the financial position of the Predecessor as at
December 31, 2001, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for the
years ended December 31, 2001 and 2000, in accordance with accounting principles
generally accepted in the United States of America. Also, in our opinion, the

financial statements taken as a whole, presents fairly, in all material
respects, the information set forth therein. s/ KPMG LLP

NOTE 1. REORGANIZATION PROCEEDINGS
On June 1, 1999 the Petition Date, The Loewen Group Inc., a British
Columbia corporation collectively together with its subsidiaries, the
Predecessor, and each of approximately 850 United States subsidiaries and one
foreign subsidiary voluntarily filed a petition for creditor protection under
Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code Chapter 11 in the U.S. Bankruptcy
Court for the District of Delaware the U.S. Bankruptcy Court. Concurrent
with the Chapter 11 filing, the Predecessor and 117 Canadian subsidiaries

filed petitions for creditor protection and 41 subsidiaries were voluntarily
deleted.
The Predecessor and its subsidiaries under creditor protection the
Debtors operated their businesses as debtors-in-possession. The United States
trustee for the District of Delaware appointed a statutory committee of
unsecured creditors the Official Unsecured Creditors' Committee. The
proceedings of the Debtors were jointly administered for procedural purposes
only. The Predecessor United Kingdom, insurance and certain funeral and
cemetery subsidiaries were excluded from the filings.
The Predecessor filed a Fourth Amended Joint Plan of Reorganization, as
modified the Plan, and related Disclosure Statement for itself and other
filing subsidiaries with the U.S. Bankruptcy Court on September 10, 2001. The
Plan was confirmed by the U.S. Bankruptcy Court on December 5, 2001, and was

and substantive requirements for the maintenance of, and were intended to
preserve, the NAFTA Claims; and, as a result of these transactions, the
Predecessor no longer holds any meaningful assets   - The Predecessor ownership of Loewen International was cancelled,
whereupon Loewen International ceased to be affiliated with the
Predecessor. As a result of these actions, Loewen International, which was

other than bare legal title to the NAFTA Claims, ii no right to receive any
proceeds of the NAFTA Claims, iii no officers, directors or employees, and

NOTE 2. NATURE OF OPERATIONS
The Predecessor was the second-largest operator of funeral homes and
cemeteries in North America. Prior to the Predecessor reorganization
see Note 1, effective December 31, 2001, the Predecessor operated 825 funeral
homes and 217 cemeteries throughout North America and 65 combination funeral
homes and cemeteries throughout North America and 32 funeral homes in the United
Kingdom.
The Predecessor made funeral and cremation arrangements on an at-need or
pre-need basis. The Predecessor funeral operations offered a full range of
funeral services, including the collection of remains, registration of death,
professional embalming, use of funeral home facilities, sale of caskets and
other merchandise and transportation to a place of worship, funeral chapel,
cemetery or crematorium.
The Predecessor cemetery operations assisted families in making burial
arrangements and offered a complete line of cemetery products including a
selection of burial spaces, burial vaults, lawn crypts, caskets, memorials,
niches, mausoleum crypts and other merchandise, the opening and closing of
graves and cremation services.
The Predecessor insurance companies sold a variety of life insurance
products, primarily to fund pre-need funeral services.
NOTE 3. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the
Predecessor and its subsidiaries. The consolidated financial statements have
been prepared using the U.S. dollar as the functional currency and are presented
in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United
States.
BASIS OF CONSOLIDATION
The accounts of all subsidiary companies have been included in the
consolidated financial statements from their respective dates of acquisition of
control or formation. All subsidiaries were wholly owned                    95

NOTE 3. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES CONTINUED
except for a few companies with small minority interests. The Predecessor
operating subsidiaries in the United States were held through Loewen
International.
The Predecessor accounts for its investment in companies in which it has
significant influence by the equity method. The Predecessor proportionate
share of income loss as reported, net of amortization of excess purchase price
over net assets acquired, is included in income and added to deducted from the
cost of the investment. The equity method carrying value of the investment is
also reduced by any provision for asset impairment and common stock dividends
received.
All significant intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated
in the consolidated financial statements.
USE OF ESTIMATES
The preparation of the consolidated financial statements in accordance with
United States generally accepted accounting principles requires management to
make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and
liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of
the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and
expenses during the reporting period. As a result, actual results could
significantly differ from those estimates.
FUNERAL OPERATIONS
Sales of at-need funeral services, including related merchandise, are
recorded as revenue when the service is performed.
Pre-need funeral services provide for future funeral services, generally
determined by prices prevailing at the time the contract is signed. The payments
made under the contract, in part, are either placed in trust or are used to pay
the premiums of life insurance policies under which the Predecessor is
designated as beneficiary. Pre-need funeral services contract amounts, together
with related trust fund investment earnings and annual insurance benefits, are
deferred until the service is performed. The Predecessor estimates that trust
fund investment earnings and annual insurance benefits exceed the increase in
cost over time of providing the related services.
Selling costs related to the sale of pre-need funeral services are expensed
in the period incurred.
CEMETERY OPERATIONS
Sales of at-need interment rights, cemetery merchandise and services are
recorded as revenue when the merchandise is delivered or service is performed.
Sales of pre-need cemetery interment rights are recorded as revenue at the time
of transfer of interment right title, typically when the contract is paid in
full, providing the burial space is available for burial. A portion of the
proceeds from cemetery sales for interment rights is generally required by law
to be paid into perpetual or endowment care trusts. Earnings of perpetual or
endowment care trusts are recognized in current cemetery revenue and are used to
defray the maintenance costs of cemeteries, which are expensed as incurred. The
principal of these perpetual or

NOTE 3. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES CONTINUED
endowment care trusts generally cannot be withdrawn by the Predecessor, and
therefore is not included in the Predecessor consolidated balance sheet.
Pursuant to various state and provincial laws, a portion of the proceeds
from the sale of pre-need merchandise and services may also be required to be
paid into trusts, which are included in pre-need cemetery contracts in the
Predecessor consolidated balance sheet. Earnings on merchandise and services
trust funds are recognized when the revenue of the associated merchandise or
service is recognized.
Selling costs related to the sale of pre-need cemetery contract revenues are
expensed in the period incurred.
Interest is imputed at a market rate for pre-need cemetery sales contracts
that do not bear a market rate of interest.
INSURANCE OPERATIONS
The Predecessor accounts for its life insurance operations under United
States generally accepted accounting principles for life insurance companies.
For traditional life and participating life products, premiums are
recognized as revenue when due from policyholders. Benefits and expenses are
associated with earned premiums to result in recognition of profits over the
life of the policy contracts. This association is accomplished by means of the
provision for liabilities for future policy benefits and the amortization of
deferred policy acquisition costs.
Revenues from annuity contracts represent amounts assessed against contract
holders. Such assessments are principally surrender charges. Policy account
balances for annuities represent the deposits received plus accumulated interest
less applicable accumulated administrative fees.
Investment income, net of investment expenses, and realized gains and losses
related to insurance invested assets are included within revenues.
To the extent recoverable, certain costs of acquiring new insurance business
have been deferred. Such costs consist of first-year commissions in excess of
renewal rates, related fringe benefit costs, and direct underwriting and
issuance costs.
The deferred policy acquisition costs on traditional life products are
amortized with interest over the anticipated premium-paying period of the
related policies, in proportion to the ratio of annual premium revenue to be
received over the life of the policies. Expected premium revenue is estimated by
using the same mortality and withdrawal assumptions used in computing
liabilities for future policy benefits. The amount of deferred policy
acquisition costs is reduced by a provision for possible inflation on
maintenance and settlement expenses.
Also, the present value of future profits of acquired insurance business in
force is amortized over the expected premium-paying period of the
policies acquired.

IMPAIRMENT OF LONG-LIVED ASSETS
The Predecessor followed the provisions of Statement of Financial Accounting
Standards No. 121, Accounting for the Impairment of Long-Lived Assets and for
Long-Lived Assets to Be Disposed Of FAS 121.
FAS 121 established accounting standards for the impairment of long-lived
assets, certain identifiable intangibles, and goodwill related to those assets

that long-lived assets and certain identifiable intangibles to be held and used
by an entity be reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in
circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be
recoverable. The review for recoverability for assets to be held and used
included an estimate of the future cash flows expected to result from the use of
the asset and its eventual disposition. If the sum of the estimated expected
future cash flows undiscounted and without interest charges is less than the
carrying amount of the asset, an impairment provision should be recognized. If
an impairment charge is indicated, long-lived assets to be held and used are
written down to the fair value of the asset.
DEBT ISSUE COSTS
Debt issue costs included in other assets on the consolidated balance sheet
represent the costs of negotiating and securing the Predecessor long-term debt
and are included in interest expense on a straight-line basis over the
respective term of the related instrument. These costs include legal fees,
accounting fees, underwriting and agency fees and other related costs.
FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS
Financial instruments that potentially subject the Predecessor to
concentrations of credit or collection risk principally consist of cash and cash
equivalents, trade accounts receivable and installment contracts receivable.
The Predecessor maintains its cash and cash equivalents with various high
quality and reputable financial institutions. The Predecessor policies with
respect to cash and cash equivalents are specifically designed to minimize
concentrations of credit risk.
Concentrations of credit risk with respect to both trade accounts receivable
and installment contracts receivable are minimal, due to the low dollar amount
of each receivable, the large number of customers and the large dispersion of
the receivables across many geographic areas.
DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS
Prior to the Chapter 11 and the Creditors Arrangement Act filings, the
Predecessor used derivative transactions with financial institutions primarily
as hedges of other financial transactions. The Predecessor policies did not
allow leveraged transactions and were designed to minimize credit and
concentration risk with counterparties.
The Predecessor typically used interest rate swap agreements to manage
interest rate exposure on its long-term debt. Differences between the amounts
paid and received would be accrued and accounted for as an adjustment to
interest expense over the life of the swap agreement.
The Predecessor used basic swap and option products to manage its exposure
to interest rate movements when anticipated financing transactions were probable
and the significant characteristics and expected terms were identified. Any gain
or loss as a result of the hedging would be deferred and amortized as an
adjustment to interest expense over the life of the financing instrument hedged.

point in time a hedging transaction no longer met the criteria of a hedge, any
gain or loss would be recognized in current earnings.
The Predecessor also used foreign exchange forward contracts, cross currency
swaps, options and futures to hedge the Predecessor exposure to fluctuations
in foreign exchange rates. Gains or losses as a result of the hedge transaction
would be accounted for as an adjustment to the related transaction.
STOCK ISSUE EXPENSES
The costs of issuing stock, net of income tax recoveries thereon, are
applied to reduce the stated value of such stock.
STOCK OPTION PLAN
Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123, Accounting for
Stock-Based Compensation FAS No. 123, established accounting and disclosure
requirements using a fair value-based method of accounting for stock-based
employee compensation plans. However, as allowed by FAS No. 123, the Predecessor
has elected to continue to apply the intrinsic value-based method of accounting
described below, and has adopted the disclosure requirements of FAS No. 123.
The Predecessor applies the intrinsic value-based method of accounting
prescribed by APB Opinion No. 25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees,
and related interpretations, including FASB Interpretation No. 44, Accounting
for Certain Transactions involving Stock Compensation, an interpretation of APB
Opinion No. 25, issued in March 2000, to account for its fixed plan stock
options. Under this method, compensation expense is recorded on the date of
grant only if the current market price of the underlying stock exceeds the
exercise price.
INCOME TAXES
Income taxes are accounted for under the asset and liability method.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax
consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement
carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax
bases, and operating loss and tax credit carryforwards. Deferred tax assets and
liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable
income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be
recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a
change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the
enactment date. A valuation allowance is provided against deferred tax assets to
the extent recoverability of the asset cannot be considered more likely than
not.
EARNINGS PER SHARE
Earnings per share is calculated based on earnings attributable to Common
stockholders using the weighted average number of shares of Common stock
outstanding during the respective periods. Fully diluted earnings per share is
not materially different from earnings per share.

NOTE 3. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES CONTINUED
FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSLATION
The assets and liabilities of the Predecessor foreign subsidiaries, which
have a functional currency other than the U.S. dollar, are translated into U. S.
dollars at the rates of exchange as at the balance sheet date, and revenue and
expenses are translated at the average rates of exchange for the periods of
operation. The net gains or losses arising from the translations are included in
stockholders' equity as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income in
the consolidated statement of stockholders' equity.
ACCOUNTING CHANGE IN 2001
The Predecessor implemented the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission
Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 101, Revenue Recognition in Financial Statements
SAB 101 effective January 1, 2000, which resulted in a change in revenue
recognition for pre-need funeral contracts and pre-need cemetery contracts. The
Predecessor previously published financial information for the year ended
December 31, 2000, and for the interim periods during the year ended
December 31, 2001, were prepared on a basis that did not fully reflect the
adoption of SAB 101. The financial statements for 2000 and 2001, presented
herein, were restated in 2001 to give effect to SAB 101. Due to the Company
volume of historical pre-need funeral and cemetery contracts involved in the
restatement and the lack of certain transactional information related to such
contracts, certain estimation methods were utilized by the Company to restate
revenue, as a result of the implementation of SAB 101.
Payments received for pre-need funeral contracts that are not required to be
trusted are deferred and recognized as revenue at the time the funeral is
performed. Previously, revenue was partially recognized when payments were
received. Direct selling expenses relating to the sale of pre-need funeral
contracts are expensed in the period incurred. Previously, direct selling
expenses were included in other assets and amortized over ten years.
The Predecessor recognizes revenue and related costs for pre-need sales of
interment rights and related merchandise and services at the time the interment
right title is transferred, merchandise is delivered or service is performed.
Previously, revenue and related costs, net of amounts required to be paid into
perpetual care trusts, were recognized at the time the pre-need contract was
signed. Earnings on merchandise and services trust funds are recognized when the
revenue of the associated merchandise or service is recognized. Previously,
earnings on merchandise and services trust funds were recognized in the period
realized.
The cumulative effect of the implementation of SAB 101 through December 31,
1999, resulted in a charge to income of $986,750,000 net of income taxes of
$108,719,000, or $1331 per basic and diluted share recorded on January 1,
2000.

NOTE 4. LIABILITIES SUBJECT TO COMPROMISE AND DEBT
Pursuant to the Plan, substantially all liabilities subject to compromise
were settled.
In the Chapter 11 and the Creditors Arrangement Act proceedings,
substantially all unsecured and under-secured liabilities of the Debtors as of
the Petition Date were subject to compromise or other treatment under the Plan.
For financial reporting purposes, those liabilities and obligations whose
treatment and satisfaction were dependent on the outcome of the Chapter 11 and
the Creditors Arrangement Act proceedings have been segregated and classified as
liabilities subject to compromise in the consolidated financial statements.
Generally, all actions to enforce or otherwise effect repayment of pre-Petition
Date liabilities, as well as all pending litigation against the Debtors arising
from pre-Petition Date events, were stayed while the Debtors continued their
business operations as debtors-in-possession, except in instances where the stay
had been lifted by the applicable Bankruptcy Court. The general claims bar date,
which was the last date by which most types of claims against the Predecessor
had to be filed in the U.S. Bankruptcy Court if the claimants wished to receive
any distribution in the Chapter 11 proceedings, was December 15, 1999. In
June 2000 and July 2001, the Predecessor filed amended schedules identifying
additional potential creditors, for which the bar dates were set at July 14,
2000 and August 27, 2001, respectively. The bar date for claims against
operating entities applicable to the Creditors Arrangement Act proceedings was
extended to and expired on March 17, 2000. Pursuant to the Plan, substantially
all liabilities subject to compromise were settled.
As a result of the reorganization proceedings, proofs of claim were filed
against the Debtors in the Bankruptcy Courts. The Debtors resolved proofs of
claim that differed in nature, classification or amount from the Debtors'
records through several means, including negotiations with the affected
claimants, the filing and prosecution of objections and, where appropriate, the
referral of the claims to the alternative dispute resolution procedures the
ADR Procedures approved by the U.S. Bankruptcy Court on February 23, 2000.
The ADR Procedures provided for settlement offer exchange procedures to
facilitate the parties' resolution of the claim on a consensual basis. If the
claim remained unresolved following the settlement offer exchange procedures,
the claim was submitted to binding or nonbinding arbitration depending on the
election of the claimant.
Under the U.S. Bankruptcy Code, the Debtors could elect to assume or reject
leases, employment contracts, service contracts and other pre-Petition Date
executory contracts, subject to U.S. Bankruptcy Court approval. Liabilities
related to executory contracts were recorded as liabilities not subject to
compromise, unless the Predecessor decided to reject the contract. Claims for
damages resulting from the rejection, after December 15, 1999, of executory
contracts were subject to separate bar dates.
The principal categories of obligations classified as liabilities subject to
compromise under the reorganization proceedings are identified below. The
amounts in total could vary significantly from the stated amount of proofs of
claim that were filed with the Bankruptcy Courts, and could be subject to future
adjustment depending on Bankruptcy Court action, further developments with
respect to potential disputed claims, and determination as to the value of any
collateral securing claims or other events. Additional claims could also arise
from the rejection of executory contracts by the Debtors.
Under the Plan, liabilities subject to compromise were categorized into a
class of allowed claims and further categorized into divisions. Certain of these
allowed claims would receive a pro rata share of

Alderwoods Group Common Stock, Warrants and interests in the Liquidating Trust.
The amount of any claim that ultimately was allowed by the U.S. Bankruptcy Court
could be significantly more or less than the estimated amount of such claim. As
a consequence, the actual ultimate aggregate amount of allowed unsecured claims
could differ significantly from the amounts recorded in the Predecessor
consolidated financial statements. Accordingly, the amount of the pro rata
distributions of Alderwoods Group Common Stock, Warrants and interests in the
Liquidating Trust that ultimately were received by a holder of an allowed
unsecured claim could be adversely or favorably affected by the aggregate amount
of claims ultimately allowed. Distributions of Alderwoods Group Common Stock,
Warrants and interests in the Liquidating Trust to holders of allowed unsecured
claims will be made on an incremental basis until all claims are resolved.
Litigation against the Predecessor and its filing subsidiaries arising from
events occurring prior to June 1, 1999 and any additional liabilities related
thereto were subject to compromise.
As a result of the Chapter 11 and the Creditors Arrangement Act filings, no
principal or interest payments were made on most pre-Petition Date debt
obligations without Bankruptcy Court approval or until the Plan became
effective.
Pursuant to U.S. bankruptcy law, interest on unsecured and under-secured
pre-Petition Date debt obligations subject to compromise had not been accrued
after the Petition Date. Interest expense and principal payments were recorded
on most secured vendor financing, including capital lease obligations.
Contractual interest expense not recorded on liabilities subject to compromise
totaled $132,481,000 for the year ended December 31, 2001
2000 -- $153,964,000.
Net cash proceeds, after payment of certain direct selling costs, generated
from the Predecessor asset disposition program approved by the
U.S. Bankruptcy Court were subject to restrictions on use. Certain cash proceeds
were required to be placed in a segregated deposit account, pending a
U.S. Bankruptcy Court order determining how such cash proceeds should be
distributed. As at December 31, 2000, cash in this segregated deposit account
amounted to approximately $23 million.
In 1996, the Predecessor, Loewen International and a trustee entered into
the Collateral Trust Agreement pursuant to which the senior lenders shared
certain collateral and guarantees on a pari passu basis. The security for
lenders under the Collateral Trust Agreement consisted of i all of Loewen
International right, title and interest in and to all rights to receive
payment under or in respect of accounts, contracts, contractual rights, chattel
paper, documents, instruments and general intangibles, ii a pledge of the
common shares of substantially all of the subsidiaries in which the Predecessor
directly or indirectly held more than a 50% voting or economic interest, and
iii a guarantee by each subsidiary that pledged shares. The security was held
by the trustee for the equal and ratable benefit of the senior lending group.
The senior lending group consisted principally of the lenders under the senior
amortizing notes, senior notes and bank credit agreements as well as the holders
of certain letters of credit.
Subsequent to the execution of the Collateral Trust Agreement, among other
financings, the Predecessor issued the Series 3 and 4 Senior Notes, the
Series 6 and 7 Senior Notes and the PATS collectively, the Subject Debt. The
aggregate principal amount outstanding of the Subject Debt was $1,100,000,000.
In April 2000, the Predecessor announced that there was uncertainty as to the
secured

status under the Collateral Trust Agreement with respect to the Subject Debt. In
accordance with the terms of the Collateral Trust Agreement, holders of future
indebtedness or their representatives were to effect registration by delivering
to the collateral trustee Additional Secured Indebtedness Registration
Statements in a form set forth in the Collateral Trust Agreement. However,
Additional Secured Indebtedness Registration Statements relating to the Subject
Debt were either not delivered to the collateral trustee or were delivered
indicating an incorrect outstanding amount. The Predecessor confirmed that it
satisfied its obligations under the financing agreements to adopt appropriate
corporate resolutions and to deliver to lender representatives, in connection
with closing, Additional Secured Indebtedness Registration Statements relating
to the Subject Debt. Pursuant to the agreements with lender representatives in
connection with those financings, the Predecessor and Loewen International
treated the Subject Debt as secured under the Collateral Trust Agreement. On
this basis, the total indebtedness owed to the senior lending group subject to
the Collateral Trust Agreement, including holders of certain letters of credit,
at the Petition Date aggregated $2,016,000,000.
The Plan provides for the cancellation of the debt claiming the benefit of
the Collateral Trust Agreement in exchange for a combination of cash, Alderwoods
Group Common Stock and seven-year unsecured notes. Under specified
circumstances, Alderwoods Group could also issue two-year unsecured notes or
five-year secured notes, or both in exchange for cancellation of such debt.
It was not known when the uncertainty would be resolved. Accordingly, the
effects of this contingency, if any, were not reflected in the Predecessor
consolidated financial statements.
On September 29, 2000, Bankers Trust Company, the trustee under the
Collateral Trust Agreement, filed an adversary proceeding in the
U.S. Bankruptcy Court seeking a declaratory judgment that the Subject Debt was
secured debt and entitled to the benefits of the Collateral Trust Agreement. The
Predecessor was named as a defendant in that proceeding.
Interest expense for the year ended December 31, 2001, included $619,000
2000 -- $3,142,000 of debt issue cost amortization and write-offs.
In 1994, Loewen Group Capital L.P. LGC issued 3,000,000 Monthly Income
Preferred Securities for an aggregate amount of $75,000,000. LGC is a limited
partnership, and Loewen International as its general partner managed its
business and affairs. The Monthly Income Preferred Securities were due
August 31, 2024 and were subject to redemption at par at the option of LGC, in
whole or in part, from time to time on or after August 31, 2004. As a result of
the Chapter 11 filing, the Monthly Income Preferred Securities became
redeemable. The Monthly Income Preferred Securities were subject to an unsecured
guarantee by the Predecessor and Loewen International. Accordingly, the Monthly
Income Preferred Securities have been designated as liabilities subject to
compromise.
NOTE 5. IMPAIRMENT OF ASSETS AND DISPOSITIONS
During 1999, as a result of the Predecessor reorganization proceedings and
operating performance decline, the Predecessor conducted extensive reviews of
each of its operating locations. The review resulted in the identification of
201 funeral homes and 170 cemeteries as probable for sale and the development of
a program for disposition of these locations, which was approved by the
U.S. Bankruptcy

Court in January 2000. As a result, a pre-tax asset impairment provision for
long-lived assets of $428,194,000 was recorded in 1999.
During the first two months of 2001, the Predecessor completed the sale of
49 funeral homes and 43 cemeteries for gross proceeds of $25,267,000. As a
result, and together with the Predecessor revision on June 30, 2000, of its
estimates of expected proceeds of the locations held for disposal, an additional
pre-tax asset impairment provision of $116,937,000 was provided for in 2000.
During 2001, the Company further revised its estimates of expected proceeds
of the locations held for disposal and identified other locations, which were
not part of the previously-announced disposition properties, as probable for
sale. Consequently, an additional pre-tax asset impairment provision of
$180,658,000 was recorded.
The asset impairment provisions were based on management estimates.
During 2001, the Predecessor sold 124 funeral homes and 119 cemeteries for
gross proceeds of $106,378,000, before closing and other settlement costs of
$601,000, resulting in a pre-tax gain of $173,308,000.
During 2000, the Predecessor sold 101 funeral homes and 33 cemeteries for
gross proceeds of $38,226,000, before closing and other settlement costs of
$2,107,000, resulting in a pre-tax gain of $5,591,000.
NOTE 6. INVESTMENTS
Under a Put/Call Agreement entered into with Blackstone Capital Partners II
Merchant Banking Fund L.P. and certain affiliates together, Blackstone, the
majority investor in Prime, in August 1996 the Prime Put/Call Agreement, the
Predecessor had the option to acquire the Prime Call Blackstone Prime
common stock and Blackstone had the option to sell the Prime Put its Prime
common stock to the Predecessor. Under a Put/Call Agreement entered into with
Blackstone and RHI Management Direct L.P. RHI in November 1996 the Rose
Hills Put/Call Agreement, the Predecessor had the option to acquire the Rose
Hills common stock owned by Blackstone and RHI and Blackstone and RHI had the
option to sell the Rose Hills Put their Rose Hills common stock to the
Predecessor.
During 2000, Prime was reorganized under Chapter 11 in the U.S. Bankruptcy
Court. Prime common stock was cancelled and the Predecessor received five-year
warrants to purchase 500,000 new common stock of reorganized Prime at an
exercise price of $1676 per common share. The Prime plan of reorganization also
provided that 5,000,000 shares of new common stock would be issued to certain
creditors of Prime. Pursuant to the Plan, all of the Prime warrants were
irrevocably transferred to a liquidating trust for the benefit of holders of
certain of the Predecessor indebtedness.
Blackstone filed proofs of claim against the Predecessor in respect of the
Prime Put, in which Blackstone calculated a Prime Put price of $183,400,000.
Blackstone and RHI also filed proofs of claim against the Predecessor in respect
of the Rose Hills Put, in which Blackstone and RHI calculated a Rose Hills Put
price of $158,800,000.

NOTE 8. STOCKHOLDERS' EQUITY CONTINUED
The holders of the Series C Preferred stock were entitled, as and when
declared by the Board of Directors, to a fixed preferential cumulative cash
dividend of 6% per year, payable quarterly. In March 1999, the Predecessor
suspended future dividends on its Common stock and deferred future dividends on
its Preferred stock.
In August 2000, a motion was filed in the Canadian Court by RBC Dominion
Securities Inc., Sunrise Partners LLC and Paloma Strategic Fund LP seeking an
order to compel the Predecessor to convert the Preferred stock to Common stock
upon request from the Preferred stockholders. The court denied that motion on
September 29, 2000.
On or after July 1, 1999, the Series C Preferred stock was redeemable by the
Predecessor, upon giving not less than 30 days notice, at a redemption price
equal to Cdn. $2500 per share together with accrued and unpaid dividends. Prior
to July 1, 2001, the redemption could only be effected by the issuance of Common
stock, determined by dividing the redemption price by the greater of Cdn. $300
and 95% of the current market price at the date of redemption. On and after
July 1, 2001, the redemption may be effected by the issuance of Common stock or
payment of a cash amount.
As of October 1, 2001, the Predecessor had deferred payment of dividends for
11 consecutive calendar quarters. Accordingly, this Preferred stock was
convertible into Common stock at a ratio of 9710 Common shares per Preferred
share. However, the Predecessor was not accepting requests for conversion.
d MANAGEMENT EQUITY INVESTMENT PLAN MEIP
4,250,000 shares of the Common stock of the Predecessor were reserved upon
adoption by the Predecessor of the MEIP on June 15, 1994. Senior Exchangeable
Debentures the Debentures amounting to $127,670,000 were issued by Loewen
International to a wholly-owned subsidiary of Loewen International formed to act
as agent for the MEIP. The Debentures were due July 15, 2001 and bore interest
at floating rates. Each $30040 of principal amount of Debentures will be
exchangeable for one Convertible First Preferred share, Series B of the
Predecessor, each of which will be convertible into ten shares of the Common
stock of the Predecessor. As at December 31, 2000, the MEIP participants had
paid $2,869,000 for option rights to acquire $57,382,000 of Debentures
exercisable as to 50% in 1999, 25% in 2000 and 25% in 2001. If an option expires
unexercised, the participant is entitled to a refund without interest of the
amount paid to acquire such option right. In addition, as at December 31, 2000,
the former Chairman had paid $2,253,000 for the right and obligation to acquire
$45,060,000 of Debentures with the same exercise dates. Pursuant to the Plan,
the Debentures were canceled on the Effective Date.
e STOCK OPTION PLANS
The Predecessor had separate fixed stock option plans for its United States
and Canadian employees, which enabled the Predecessor to grant options to its
employees and Directors. The option plans were administered by the Compensation
Committee of the Predecessor Board of Directors. Granting of stock options has
been suspended since the Petition Date. At December 31, 2000, 1,752,025 options
were exercisable at prices ranging from $093 to $4125 per Common share. The
Predecessor has determined that, due to its reorganization the stock options
were effectively cancelled.

NOTE 11. RETIREMENT PLANS
The Predecessor had a 401K Retirement Savings Plan for United States
employees who could defer between 2% and 15% of their compensation. The
Predecessor matched 100% of employee contributions to a maximum of 2% of
employees' eligible compensation. There are no required future contributions
under this plan in respect of past service.
The Predecessor had a Registered Retirement Savings Plan for Canadian
employees who could contribute 3% or 5% of their compensation, which was matched
by an equal contribution to the plan by the Predecessor on behalf of employees.
There are no required future contributions under these plans in respect of past
service.
The Predecessor total expense for these retirement plans for the two years

NOTE 14. DEFERRED PRE-NEED REVENUE CONTINUED
The Predecessor gross pre-need funeral contract sales decreased to
approximately $108 million in 2001 from approximately $119 million in 2000. The
Predecessor estimated that it had a backlog of approximately $11 billion in
pre-need funeral contracts as of December 31, 2001. At January 1, 2000, when the
Predecessor implemented SAB 101, approximately $92 million was recorded
representing amounts received but not required to be placed in trust, and
interest earnings on amounts in trust, which had previously been recognized in
revenue. During 2001 and 2000, the Predecessor recognized approximately
$44 million and $61 million, respectively, of this amount in funeral revenue.
NOTE 15. SEGMENTED INFORMATION
The Predecessor reportable segments comprised three businesses it
operated, each of which offered different products and services: funeral homes,
cemeteries and insurance see Note 2.
The accounting policies of the segments are the same as those described in
the summary of significant accounting policies see Note 3. The Predecessor
sold primarily to external customers, though any intersegment sales or transfers
occured at market price. In 2001, the inter-company insurance commissions
amounted to $4,911,000 and were eliminated in the Predecessor consolidated
financial statements 2000 -- $4,454,000. The Predecessor evaluates performance
based on earnings from operations of the respective businesses.                             FUNERAL   CEMETERY  INSURANCE   OTHER   CONSOLIDATED
