SEACHANGE INTERNATIONAL, INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 1. Nature of Business We are an industry leader in the delivery
of multi-screen video. Our products and services facilitate the aggregation, licensing, management and distribution of video, television
programming, and advertising content to cable system operators and telecommunications companies. 2. Summary of Significant Accounting
Policies Significant accounting policies followed
in the preparation of the accompanying consolidated financial statements are as follows Use of Estimates The preparation of these financial statements
in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates
and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and disclosure of contingent assets
and liabilities. On an ongoing basis, management evaluates these estimates and judgments, including those related to revenue recognition,
valuation of inventory and accounts receivable, valuation of investments and income taxes, stock-based compensation, goodwill,
intangible assets and related amortization. Management bases these estimates on historical and anticipated results and trends and
on various other assumptions that management believes are reasonable under the circumstances, including assumptions as to future
events. These estimates form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily
apparent from other sources. By their nature, estimates are subject to an inherent degree of uncertainty. Actual results may differ
from managements estimates. Principles of Consolidation We consolidate the financial statements
of our wholly-owned subsidiaries and all intercompany accounts are eliminated in consolidation. We also hold minority investments
in the capital stock of certain private companies having product offerings or customer relationships that have strategic importance.
We evaluate our equity and debt investments and other contractual relationships with affiliate companies in order to determine
whether the guidelines regarding the consolidation of variable interest entities VIE should be applied in the financial
statements. Consolidation guidelines address consolidation by business enterprises of variable interest entities that possess certain
characteristics. A variable interest entity is defined as an entity in which equity investors do not have the characteristics of
a controlling financial interest or do not have sufficient equity at risk for the entity to finance its activities without additional
subordinated financial support. We use qualitative analysis to determine whether or not we are the primary
beneficiary of a VIE variable interest entity. We consider the rights and obligations conveyed by the implicit and explicit variable
interest in each VIE and the relationship of these with the variable interests held by other parties to determine whether its variable
interests will absorb a majority of a VIEs expected losses, receive a majority of its expected residual returns, or both.
If we determine that our variable interests will absorb a majority of the VIEs expected losses, receive a majority of their
expected residual returns, or both, we consolidate the VIE as the primary beneficiary, and if not, it is not consolidated. We have reviewed
our interest in a joint venture in Germany, a partnership in Turkey and equity investment in Hightech ICT. BV. The primary
beneficiary is required to consolidate the financial position and results of the VIE. We have concluded that we are not the primary
beneficiary for any variable interest entities during fiscal 2012. Accordingly, we used the equity method
to account for these investments. Discontinued Operations We evaluated our decision
to sell the broadcast servers and storage business unit and determined that we met the criteria for classification as held for
sale as of January 31, 2012. We have recorded all assets and liabilities as held for sale and all operating results as discontinued
operations for fiscal 2012, 2011 and 2010. see Note 18   55
Equity Investments Our investments in affiliates include investments
accounted for under the cost method and the equity method of accounting. The investments that represent less than a 20% ownership
interest of the common shares of the affiliate are carried at cost. Under the equity method of accounting, which generally applies
to investments that represent 20% to 50% ownership of the common shares of the affiliate, our proportionate ownership share of
the earnings or losses of the affiliate are included in equity income in earnings of affiliates in equity income loss in earnings
of affiliates in the consolidated statement of operations. We periodically review indicators of the
fair value of our investments in affiliates in order to assess whether available facts or circumstances, both internally and externally,
may suggest an other than temporary decline in the value of the investment. The carrying value of an investment in an affiliate
may be affected by the affiliates ability to obtain adequate funding and execute its business plans, general market conditions,
industry considerations specific to the affiliates business, and other factors. The inability of an affiliate to obtain
future funding or successfully execute its business plan could adversely affect our equity earnings of the affiliate in the periods
affected by those events. Future adverse changes in market conditions or poor operating results of the affiliates could result
in equity losses or an inability to recover the carrying value of the investments in affiliates that may not be reflected in an
investments current carrying value, thereby possibly requiring an impairment charge in the future. We record an impairment
charge when we believe an investment has experienced a decline in value that is other-than-temporary. Revenue
Recognition Our transactions frequently involve the sales of hardware, software,
systems and services in multiple element arrangements. Revenues from sales of hardware, software and systems that do not require
significant modification or customization of the underlying software are recognized when title and risk of loss has passed to the
customer, there is evidence of an arrangement, fees are fixed or determinable and collection of the related receivable is considered
probable. Customers are billed for installation, training, project management and at least one year of product maintenance and
technical support at the time of the product sale. Revenue from these activities are deferred at the time of the product sale and
recognized ratably over the period these services are performed. Revenue from ongoing product maintenance and technical support
agreements are recognized ratably over the period of the related agreements. Revenue from software development contracts that include
significant modification or customization, including software product enhancements, is recognized based on the percentage of completion
contract accounting method using labor efforts expended in relation to estimates of total labor efforts to complete the contract.
Accounting for contract amendments and customer change orders are included in contract accounting when executed. Revenue from shipping
and handling costs and other out-of-pocket expenses reimbursed by customers are included in revenues and cost of revenues. Our
share of intercompany profits associated with sales and services provided to affiliated companies are eliminated in consolidation
in proportion to our equity ownership We have historically applied the software revenue recognition
rules as prescribed by Accounting Standards Codification ASCSubtopic 985-605. In October2009, the Financial Accounting
Standards Board FASBissued Accounting Standards Update ASUNumber 2009-14, Certain Revenue Arrangements That
Include Software Elements, which amended ASC Subtopic 985-605. This ASU removes tangible products containing software components
and non-software components that function together to deliver the products essential functionality from the scope of the
software revenue recognition rules. In the case of our hardware products with embedded software, we have determined that the hardware
and software components function together to deliver the products essential functionality, and therefore, the revenue from
the sale of these products no longer falls within the scope of the software revenue recognition rules. Revenue from the sale of
software-only products remains within the scope of the software revenue recognition rules. Maintenance and support, training, consulting,
and installation services no longer fall within the scope of the software revenue recognition rules, except when they are sold
with and relate to a software-only product. Revenue recognition for products that no longer fall under the scope of the software
revenue recognition rules are similar to that for other tangible products and ASU Number 2009-13, Multiple-Deliverable Revenue
Arrangements, which amended ASC Topic 605 and was also issued in October2009, which is applicable for multiple-deliverable
revenue arrangements. ASU 2009-13 allows companies to allocate revenue in a multiple-deliverable arrangement in a manner that better
reflects the transactions economics. ASU 2009-13 and 2009-14 are effective for revenue arrangements entered into or materially
modified in our fiscal year 2012.   56
Under the software revenue recognition rules, the fee is allocated
to the various elements based on VSOE of fair value. Under this method, the total arrangement value is allocated first to undelivered
elements, based on their fair values, with the remainder being allocated to the delivered elements. Where fair value of undelivered
service elements has not been established, the total arrangement value is recognized over the period during which the services
are performed. The amounts allocated to undelivered elements, which may include project management, training, installation, maintenance
and technical support and certain hardware and software components, are based upon the price charged when these elements are sold
separately and unaccompanied by the other elements. The amount allocated to installation, training and project management revenue
is based upon standard hourly billing rates and the estimated time to complete the service. These services are not essential to
the functionality of systems as these services do not alter the equipments capabilities, are available from other vendors
and the systems are standard products. For multiple element arrangements that include software development with significant modification
or customization and systems sales where vendor-specific objective evidence of the fair value does not exist for the undelivered
elements of the arrangement other than maintenance and technical support, percentage of completion accounting is applied for
revenue recognition purposes to the entire arrangement with the exception of maintenance and technical support. All multiple-deliverable
revenue arrangements negotiated prior to February 1, 2011 and the sale of all software-only products and associated services have
been accounted for under this guidance. Under the revenue recognition rules for tangible products as
amended by ASU 2009-13, the fee from a multiple-deliverable arrangement is allocated to each of the deliverables based upon their
relative selling prices as determined by a selling-price hierarchy. A deliverable in an arrangement qualifies as a separate unit
of accounting if the delivered item has value to the customer on a stand-alone basis. A delivered item that does not qualify as
a separate unit of accounting is combined with the other undelivered items in the arrangement and revenue is recognized for those
combined deliverables as a single unit of accounting. The selling price used for each deliverable is based upon VSOE if available,
third-party evidence TPEif VSOE is not available, and best estimate of selling price BESPif neither VSOE nor TPE
are available. TPE is the price of our or any competitors largely interchangeable products or services in stand-alone sales
to similarly situated customers. BESP is the price at which the Company would sell the deliverable if it were sold regularly on
a stand-alone basis, considering market conditions and entity-specific factors. All multiple-deliverable revenue arrangements negotiated
after February1, 2011, excluding the sale of all software-only products and associated services, have been accounted for
under this guidance. The selling prices used in the relative selling price allocation
method for certain of our services are based upon VSOE. The selling prices used in the relative selling price allocation method
for third-party products from other vendors are based upon TPE. The selling prices used in the relative selling price allocation
method for our hardware products, software, subscriptions, and customized services for which VSOE does not exist are based upon
BESP. We do not believe TPE exists for these products and services because they are differentiated from competing products and
services in terms of functionality and performance and there are no competing products or services that are largely interchangeable.
Management establishes BESP with consideration for market conditions, such as the impact of competition and geographic considerations,
and entity-specific factors, such as the cost of the product, discounts provided and profit objectives. Management believes that
BESP is reflective of reasonable pricing of that deliverable as if priced on a stand-alone basis. Since all of our revenue prior to the adoption of ASU 2009-14
fell within the scope of the software revenue recognition rules and we have only established VSOE for services and revenue in a
multiple-deliverable arrangement involving products, revenue was frequently deferred until the last item was delivered. The adoption
of ASU 2009-13 and 2009-14 has resulted in earlier revenue recognition in multiple-deliverable arrangements involving our hardware
products with embedded software because revenue can be recognized for each of these deliverables based upon their relative selling
prices as defined above. The revenue impact, as a result of implementing the software revenue recognition guidance, was an increase
of $33 million during fiscal 2012.   57
Service revenue from content processing
provided to our customers is recognized when services are provided, based on contracted rates. Upfront fees received for services
are recognized ratably over the period earned, whichever is the longer of the contract term or the estimated customer relationship. Any taxes assessed by a governmental authority
related to revenue-producing transactions e.g. sales or value-added taxes are reported on a net basis and excluded from revenues. Concentration
of Credit Risk and Major Customers Financial instruments which potentially
expose us to concentrations of credit risk include cash equivalents, investments in treasury bills, certificates of deposits and
commercial paper, trade accounts receivable, accounts payable and accrued liabilities. We restrict our cash equivalents and investments
in marketable securities to repurchase agreements with major banks and U.S. government and corporate securities which are subject
to minimal credit and market risk. For trade accounts receivable, we evaluate
customers financial condition, require advance payments from certain of our customers and maintain reserves for potential
credit losses. We perform ongoing credit evaluations of customers financial condition but generally do not require collateral.
For some international customers, we require an irrevocable letter of credit to be issued by the customer before the purchase order
is accepted. We monitor payments from customers and assess any collection issues. We maintain allowances for specific doubtful
accounts and other risk categories of accounts based on estimates of losses resulting from the inability of the Companys
customers to make required payments and record these allowances as a charge to general and administrative expenses. We base our
allowances for doubtful accounts on historical collections and write-off experience, current trends, credit assessments, and other
analysis of specific customer situations. At January 31, 2012 and 2011, we had an allowance for doubtful accounts of $972,000 and
$995,000, respectively, to provide for potential credit losses. At January 31, 2012, two separate customers accounted for 16% and
14%, respectively, of our gross accounts receivable balance. For fiscal 2012 and 2011, two customers each accounted for more than
10%, and collectively accounted for 31% and 34%, respectively, of our total revenues. Revenues from these customers were primarily
in our Software segment. Cash
Equivalents and Marketable Securities We account for investments in accordance
with authoritative guidance that defines investment classifications. We determine the appropriate classification of debt securities
at the time of purchase and reevaluate such designation as of each balance sheet date. Our investment portfolio consists of money
market funds, corporate debt investments, asset-backed securities, government-sponsored enterprises, and state and municipal obligations.
All highly liquid investments with an original maturity of three months or less when purchased are considered to be cash equivalents.
All cash equivalents are carried at cost, which approximates fair value. Our marketable securities are classified as available-for-sale
and are reported at fair value with unrealized gains and losses, net of tax, reported in stockholders equity as a component
of accumulated other comprehensive income or loss. The amortization of premiums and accretions of discounts to maturity are computed
under the effective interest method and are included in interest income. Interest on securities is recorded as earned and is also
included in interest income. Any realized gains or losses would be shown in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations
in other income or expense. We evaluate our investments on a regular
basis to determine whether an other-than-temporary decline in fair value has occurred. This evaluation consists of a review of
several factors, including, but not limited to: the length of time and extent that an investment has been in an unrealized loss
position; the existence of an event that would impair the issuer future earnings potential; and our intent and ability to hold
an investment for a period of time sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery in fair value. Declines in value below cost
for investments where it is considered probable that all contractual terms of the investment will be satisfied, is due primarily
to changes in interest rates, and where the company has the intent and ability to hold the investment for a period of time sufficient
to allow a market recovery, are not assumed to be other-than-temporary. Any other-than-temporary declines in fair value are recorded
in earnings and a new cost basis for the investment is established.   58
Inventory
Valuation Inventories are stated at the lower of
cost or net realizable value. Cost is determined using the first-in, first-out FIFO method. Inventories consist primarily of
components and subassemblies and finished products held for sale. The values of inventories are reviewed quarterly to determine
that the carrying value is stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value. We record charges to reduce inventory to its net
realizable value when impairment is identified through a quarterly review process. The obsolescence evaluation is based upon assumptions
and estimates about future demand, or possible alternative uses and involves significant judgments. For the years ended January
31, 2012, 2011 and 2010, we recorded $10 million, $30 million and $569,000 in inventory write-downs, respectively, of which $430,000
and $25 million were recorded in restructuring expense for fiscal 2012 and 2011, respectively. Property
and Equipment Property and equipment consists of land
and buildings, office and computer equipment, leasehold improvements, demonstration equipment, deployed assets and spare components
and assemblies used to service our installed base. Demonstration equipment consists of systems
manufactured by us for use in marketing and selling activities. Property and equipment are recorded at cost and depreciated over
their estimated useful lives. Leasehold improvements are amortized over the shorter of their estimated useful lives or the term
of the respective leases using the straight-line method. Deployed assets consist of movie systems owned and manufactured by us
that are installed in a hotel environment. Deployed assets are depreciated over the life of the related service agreements. Capitalized
service and spare components are depreciated over the estimated useful lives using the straight-line method. Maintenance and repair
costs are expensed as incurred. Upon retirement or sale, the cost of the assets disposed of, and the related accumulated depreciation,
are removed from the accounts, and any resulting gain or loss is included in the determination of net income. Goodwill
and Long-Lived Assets We recognize the excess of the purchase
price over the fair value of the net tangible and intangible assets acquired as goodwill. At the time of acquisition, goodwill
is assigned to the operating segment as the applicable reporting unit for the goodwill impairment review. Goodwill is not amortized,
but is evaluated for impairment, at the reporting unit level, annually in the third fiscal quarter. Goodwill of a reporting unit
also is tested for impairment on an interim basis in addition to the annual evaluation if an event occurs or circumstances change
such as declines in sales, earnings or cash flows, decline in the Companys stock price, or material adverse changes in the
business climate, which would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying amount. The process
of evaluating goodwill for impairment requires several judgments and assumptions to be made to determine the fair value of the
reporting units, including the method used to determine fair value, discount rates, expected levels of cash flows, revenues and
earnings, and the selection of comparable companies used to develop market based assumptions. We account for business acquisitions in
accordance with authoritative guidance which determines and records the fair values of assets acquired, liabilities, contractual
contingencies and contingent consideration assumed as of the dates of acquisition. The purchase price allocation process requires
management to make significant estimates and assumptions, especially at the acquisition date with respect to intangible assets
and estimated contingent consideration payments. We also evaluate property and equipment,
intangible assets and other long-lived assets on a regular basis for the existence of facts or circumstances, both internal and
external that may suggest an asset is not recoverable. If such circumstances exist, we evaluate the carrying value of long-lived
assets to determine if impairment exists based upon estimated undiscounted future cash flows over the remaining useful life of
the assets and compares that value to the carrying value of the assets. Our cash flow estimates contain managements best
estimates, using appropriate and customary assumptions and projections at the time.   59
Intangible
assets consist of customer contracts, completed technology, in-process research and development, non-competition agreements, patents
and trademarks and are respectively assigned to the operating segments. The intangible assets are amortized to cost of sales and
operating expenses, as appropriate, on a straight-line or accelerated basis in order to reflect the period that the assets will
be consumed. In-process research and development assets as of the acquisition date are recorded as indefinite-lived intangible
assets and are subject to impairment testing at least annually. The useful life of the intangible asset recognized will be reconsidered
if and when an in-process research and development project is completed or abandoned. We develop software for resale in markets
that are subject to rapid technological change, new product development and changing customer needs. The time period during which
software development costs can be capitalized from the point of reaching technological feasibility until the time of general product
release is very short, and consequently, the amounts that could be capitalized are not material to our financial position or results
of operations. Software development costs relating to sales of software requiring significant modification or customization are
charged to costs of product revenues. Amortization expense is recorded over the
period of economic consumption or the life of the agreement, whichever results in the higher expense, starting with the first shipment
of the product to a customer. Amortization expense charged to cost of sales was $22 million, $20 million and $06 million for
fiscal 2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively. Income
Taxes As part of the process of preparing our
financial statements, we are required to estimate our provision for income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate.
This process involves estimating our actual current tax exposure, including assessing the risks associated with tax audits, together
with assessing temporary differences resulting from the different treatment of items for tax and accounting purposes. These differences
result in deferred tax assets and liabilities, which are included within our balance sheet. Deferred income tax assets and liabilities
are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of
existing assets and liabilities and their respective income tax bases, and operating loss and tax credit carryforwards. We evaluate
the weight of all available evidence to determine whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred income
tax assets will not be realized. We will record a valuation allowance if the likelihood of realization of the deferred tax assets
in the future is reduced based on an evaluation of objective verifiable evidence. Significant management judgment is required in
determining our income tax provision, our deferred tax assets and liabilities and any valuation allowance recorded against our
deferred tax assets. We have established a valuation allowance against our United States deferred tax assets due to indications
that they may not be fully realized. The amount of the deferred tax asset considered realizable is subject to change based on future
events, including generating sufficient pre-tax income in future periods. In the event that actual results differ from these estimates,
our provision for income taxes could be materially impacted. We do not provide for U.S. federal and state income taxes on the undistributed
earnings of our non-U.S. subsidiaries that are considered indefinitely reinvested in the operations outside the U.S. Authoritative guidance as it relates to
income tax liabilities states that the minimum threshold a tax position is required to meet before being recognized in the financial
statements is more likely than not i.e., a likelihood of occurrence greater than fifty percent. The recognition
threshold is met when an entity concludes that a tax position, based solely on its technical merits, is more likely than not to
be sustained upon examination by the relevant taxing authority. Those tax positions failing to qualify for initial recognition
are recognized in the first interim period in which they meet the more likely than not standard, or are resolved through negotiation
or litigation with the taxing authority, or upon expiration of the statute of limitations. Derecognition of a tax position that
was previously recognized occurs when an entity subsequently determines that a tax position no longer meets the more likely than
not threshold of being sustained. We file annual
income tax returns in multiple taxing jurisdictions around the world. A number of years may elapse before an uncertain tax position
is audited and finally resolved. While it is often difficult to predict the final outcome or the timing of resolution of any particular
uncertain tax position, we believe that our reserves for income taxes reflect the most likely outcome. We adjust these reserves
as well as the related interest and penalties, in light of changing facts and circumstances. If our estimate of tax liabilities
proves to be less than the ultimate assessment, a further charge to expense would result. If payment of these amounts ultimately
proves to be unnecessary, the reversal of the liabilities would result in tax benefits being recognized in the period when we determine
the liabilities are no longer necessary. The changes in estimate could have a material impact on our financial position and operating
results. In addition, settlement of any particular position could have a material and adverse effect on our cash flows and financial
position.   60
Share-based
Compensation. We account for all employee and non-employee
director stock-based compensation awards using the authoritative guidance regarding share-based payments. We have continued to
use the Black-Scholes pricing model as the most appropriate method for determining the estimated fair value of all applicable awards.
Determining the appropriate fair value model and calculating the fair value of share-based payment awards requires the input of
highly subjective assumptions, including the expected life of the share-based payment awards and stock price volatility. Management
estimated the volatility based on the historical volatility of our stock. The assumptions used in calculating the fair value of
share-based payment awards represent managements best estimates, but these estimates involve inherent uncertainties and
the application of managements judgment. As a result, if circumstances change and we use different assumptions, our share-based
compensation expense could be materially different in the future. In addition, we are required to estimate the expected forfeiture
rate and only recognize expense for those shares expected to vest. If our actual forfeiture rate is materially different from our
estimate, the share-based compensation expense could be significantly different from what it has recorded in the current period.
The estimated fair value of our stock-based options and performance-based restricted stock units, less expected forfeitures, is
amortized over the awards vesting period on a graded vesting basis, whereas the restricted stock units and Employee Stock
Purchase Plan stock units are amortized on a straight line basis. Restructuring We record restructuring charges consisting
of employee severance, write down of inventory, and the disposal of fixed assets. Restructuring charges represent our best estimate
of the associated liability at the date the charges are recognized. Adjustments for changes in assumptions are recorded as a component
of operating expenses in the period they become known. Differences between actual and expected charges and changes in assumptions
could have a material effect on our restructuring accrual as well as our consolidated results of operations. Foreign
Currency Translation For subsidiaries where the U.S. dollar
is designated as the functional currency of the entity, we translate that entitys monetary assets and liabilities denominated
in local currencies into U.S. dollars the functional and reporting currency at current exchange rates, as of each balance sheet
date. Non-monetary assets e.g., inventories, property, plant, and equipment and intangible assets and related income statement
accounts e.g., cost of sales, depreciation, amortization of intangible assets are translated at historical exchange rates between
the functional currency the U.S. dollar and the local currency. Revenue and other expense items are translated using average
exchange rates during the fiscal period. Translation adjustments and transactions gains and losses on foreign currency transactions,
and any unrealized gains and losses on short-term inter-company transactions are included in other income or expense, net. For subsidiaries where the local currency
is designated as the functional currency, we translate our assets and liabilities into U.S. dollars the reporting currency at
current exchange rates as of each balance sheet date. Revenue and expense items are translated using average exchange rates during
the period. Cumulative translation adjustments are presented as a separate component of stockholders equity. Exchange gains
and losses on foreign currency transactions and unrealized gains and losses on short-term inter-company transactions are included
in other income or expense, net. The aggregate foreign exchange transaction
losses included as other expense, net on the Consolidated Statement of Operations were $86,000, $1,100,000 and $572,000 for fiscal
2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively.   61
Comprehensive
Income Loss We present accumulated other comprehensive
income loss and total comprehensive income loss in the Statement of Stockholders Equity. At the end of fiscal 2012,
our total comprehensive loss of $50 million consists primarily of net loss, cumulative translation adjustments and unrealized
gains and losses on marketable securities, net of income tax. Forward
Exchange Contracts not Designated as Hedging Instruments We may
enter into foreign currency forward exchange contracts forward exchange contracts to manage our exposure to the
foreign currency exchange risk related to the fixed deferred purchase price associated with the acquisition of eventIS Group B.V.
The purpose of our foreign currency risk management program is to reduce volatility in earnings caused by exchange rate fluctuation.
We do not enter into derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes. We do not designate these forward exchange
contracts as hedging instruments, as such, they do not qualify for hedge accounting treatment. Therefore, the foreign currency
forward contracts are recorded at fair value, with the gain or loss on these transactions recorded in the consolidated statements
of operations within other expense, net in the period in which they occur. As of January 31, 2012, we have no outstanding
foreign currency forward exchange contracts. We recorded approximately $0, $142,000 and $87,000 of losses related to its foreign
currency forward exchange contract during fiscal 2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively. Our foreign currency forward exchange contract
is an over-the-counter instrument. There is an active market for these instruments, and therefore, they are classified as Level
1 in the fair value hierarchy. Advertising
Costs Advertising costs are charged to expense
as incurred. Advertising costs were $374,000, $319,000 and $386,000 for fiscal 2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively. Earnings Per Share Earnings per share are presented in accordance
with authoritative guidance which requires the presentation of basic earnings per share and diluted
earnings per share. Basic earnings per share is computed by dividing earnings available to common shareholders by the weighted-average
shares of common stock outstanding during the period. For the purposes of calculating diluted earnings per share, the denominator
includes both the weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding during the period and the weighted average number
of potential common stock, such as stock options, employee stock purchase plan, and restricted stock, calculated using the treasury
stock method. For
fiscal 2012, 2011 and 2010 respectively, 16 million, 25 million and 36 million of common shares issuable upon the exercise of
stock options are anti-dilutive and have been excluded from the diluted earnings per share computation as the exercise prices of
these common shares were above the market price of the common stock for the periods indicated. For fiscal 2012, an additional 10
million stock awards have been excluded from diluted earnings per share due the net loss. Below
is a summary of the shares used in calculating basic and diluted earnings per share for the periods indicated

Impact of Recently Adopted Accounting Guidance Revenue Recognition for Arrangements
with Multiple Deliverables In September2009, the FASB amended
the guidance for revenue recognition in multiple-element arrangements. It has been amended to remove from the scope of industry
specific revenue accounting guidance for software and software related transactions, tangible products containing software components
and non-software components that function together to deliver the products essential functionality. The guidance now requires
an entity to provide updated guidance on whether multiple deliverables exist, how the deliverables in an arrangement should be
separated, and the consideration allocated; and allocates revenue in an arrangement using estimated selling prices of deliverables
for these products if a vendor does not have vendor-specific objective evidence VSOE or third-party evidence of
selling price. The guidance also eliminates the use of the residual method and requires an entity to allocate revenue using the
relative selling price method for these products. The accounting changes summarized are effective for fiscal years beginning on
or after June 15, 2010. We adopted the new guidance in the first quarter of 2011 on a prospective basis. See Note 2. Recent Accounting Guidance Not Yet Effective Other Comprehensive Income The amendments in ASU 2011-05 revise the
manner in which companies present comprehensive income in their financial statements in order to make U.S. GAAP and international
standards more consistent. This ASU requires companies to report the components of comprehensive income in either a continuous
statement of comprehensive income or in two separate but consecutive statements. In the two-statement approach, the first statement
would present the components of net income, similar to the Companys current Consolidated Statements of Operations, while
the second statement would include the components of other comprehensive income, as well as a cumulative total for comprehensive
income In December 2011, the Financial Accounting Standards Board FASB
issued ASU 2011-12 to defer one provision of ASU 2011-05. The amendments in ASU 2011-12 defer the requirements under ASU 2011-05
to present reclassification adjustments by component in both the statement where net income is presented and the statement where
other comprehensive income is presented. This deferral was prompted by users concerns that the presentation requirements
would be costly to implement and could add unnecessary complexity to financial statements. Neither of these ASUs changes the items that must be
reported in other comprehensive income. Both Updates must be applied retrospectively beginning in the first quarter of 2012. Our
adoption date will be February 1, 2012, the beginning of our first quarter for fiscal 2013. Fair Value Measurement In May2011, the FASB issued amended
guidance clarifying how to measure and disclose fair value. This guidance amends the application of the highest and best
use concept to be used only in the measurement of the fair value of nonfinancial assets, clarifies that the measurement
of the fair value of equity-classified financial instruments should be performed from the perspective of a market participant who
holds the instrument as an asset, clarifies that an entity that manages a group of financial assets and liabilities on the basis
of its net risk exposure to those risks can measure those financial instruments on the basis of its net exposure to those risks,
and clarifies when premiums and discounts should be taken into account when measuring fair value. The fair value disclosure requirements
also were amended. These provisions are effective for reporting periods beginning on or after December 15, 2011 applied prospectively.
Early application is not permitted. We are currently reviewing what effect, if any, this new provision will have on our Consolidated
Financial Statements. Goodwill Impairment Test In September 2011, the FASB issued additional
guidance on goodwill impairment testing. This guidance permits an entity to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether
it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount as a basis for determining
whether it is necessary to perform the two-step goodwill impairment test. This guidance is effective for annual and interim goodwill
impairment tests performed for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2011 with early adoption permitted. We anticipate the
adoption of this guidance will not have a material impact on our consolidated financial position or results of operations.   63
3. Fair value of Assets and Liabilities The applicable
accounting guidance establishes a framework for measuring fair value and expands required disclosure about the fair value measurements
of assets and liabilities. This guidance requires us to classify and disclose assets and liabilities measured at fair value on
a recurring basis, as well as fair value measurements of assets and liabilities measured on a non-recurring basis in periods subsequent
to initial measurement, in a three-tier fair value hierarchy as described below. The guidance defines fair value as the exchange price that would
be received for an asset or paid to transfer a liability in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability
in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date. Valuation techniques used to measure fair value
must maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs. The guidance describes three levels of
inputs that may be used to measure fair value   
Level1 Observable inputs that reflect quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities in active markets.
Level2 Observable inputs other than Level1 prices, such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities; quoted prices in markets that are not active; or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities. We primarily use broker quotes for valuation of our short-term investments.
Level3 Unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activity and that are significant to the fair value of the assets or liabilities. Our financial assets and liabilities that
are measured at fair value on a recurring basis as of January 31, 2012 are as follows

We rely on mark to market valuations to
record the fair value of our available for sale security assets which are measured under a Level 1 input. These assets are publicly
traded equity securities for which market prices are readily observable and recorded. At January 31, 2012, we had $79 million
in short-term marketable securities and $41 million in long-term marketable securities. We determine the appropriate classification
of debt securities at the time of purchase and reevaluate such designation as of each balance sheet date. Our investment portfolio
consists of money market funds, corporate debt investments, asset-backed securities, government-sponsored enterprises, and state
and municipal obligations. All highly liquid investments with an original maturity of three months or less when purchased are considered
to be cash equivalents. All cash equivalents are carried at cost, which approximates fair value. Our marketable securities are
classified as available-for-sale and are reported at fair value with unrealized gains and losses, net of tax, reported in stockholders
equity as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income or loss. The amortization of premiums and accretions of discounts
to maturity are computed under the effective interest method and is included in interest income. Interest on securities is recorded
as earned and is also included in interest income. Any realized gains or losses would be shown in the accompanying consolidated
statements of operations in other expense, net. The following is a summary of available-for-sale
securities, including the cost basis, aggregate fair value and gross unrealized gains and losses, for cash equivalents, short-and
long-term marketable securities portfolio as of January 31, 2012 and 2011

$84,864 During fiscal 2012, 2011 and 2010, available-for-sale
securities were sold for total proceeds of $0, $519,000, and $116 million, respectively. The gross realized gains and losses for
fiscal years 2012, 2011 and 2010 were immaterial. For purposes of determining gross realized gains and losses, the cost of securities
sold is based on specific identification.   66

$11,995 We
concluded that there were no other than temporary declines in investments recorded as of January 31, 2012, 2011 and 2010. The unrealized
holding losses/gains, net of tax, on available-for-sale securities in the amount of $84,000, $77,000 and $262,000 for the
years ended January 31, 2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively, have been included in stockholders equity as a component of accumulated
other comprehensive income or loss. Cash, Cash Equivalents and Marketable
Securities Cash and cash equivalents consist primarily
of highly liquid investments in money market mutual funds, government sponsored enterprise obligations, treasury bills, commercial
paper and other money market securities with remaining maturities at date of purchase of 90 days or less. The fair value of cash,
cash equivalents and marketable securities at January31, 2012 and 2011 was $938 million and $849 million, respectively,
and approximated fair value. Restricted Cash Pursuant to certain lease agreements and
share purchase agreements, we are required to maintain cash reserves, classified as restricted cash. Current restricted cash totaled
$12 million and $13 million at January 31, 2012 and 2011, respectively. Foreign Currency Exchange Risk We may enter into a foreign exchange forward
contract denominated in Euros to hedge against a portion of the foreign currency exchange risk associated with the acquisition
of eventIS Group B.V. for the fixed deferred purchase price. The purpose of our foreign currency risk management program is to
reduce volatility in earnings caused by exchange rate fluctuations. Authoritative guidance requires companies to recognize all
of the derivative financial instruments as either assets or liabilities at fair value in the consolidated balance sheets based
upon quoted market prices for comparable instruments. Our derivative instrument did not meet the criteria for hedge accounting
within authoritative guidance. Therefore, the foreign currency forward contracts have been recorded at fair value, with the gain
or loss on these transactions recorded in the consolidated statements of operations within interest and other income, net
in the period in which they occur. We do not use derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes. As of January
31, 2012, we had no outstanding foreign currency forward exchange contracts. During the year ended January 31, 2011, we recorded
approximately $142,000 of losses related to our foreign currency forward exchange contract. Typically, any losses or gains on the
forward exchange contracts are offset by re-measurement losses or gains on the underlying balances denominated in non-functional
currencies. Our foreign currency exchange contract is an over-the-counter instrument. Acquisition-Related Consideration We determined the fair value of the acquisition-related
consideration in connection with the acquisition of eventIS Group B.V. in September 2009 using a probability-weighted discounted
cash flow model. This fair value measurement is based on significant inputs not observed in the market and thus represents a Level
3 measurement. Any change in the fair value of the acquisition-related consideration for the deferred fixed purchase price and
earnout payments subsequent to the acquisition date, including changes from events after the acquisition date, such as changes
in our estimate of the performance goals, will be recognized in earnings in the period the estimated fair value changes. The fair
value of the acquisition-related consideration to be distributed directly to the eventIS and VividLogic selling shareholders is
$123 million as of January 31, 2012.   67

Investments in Affiliates We periodically review indicators of the
fair value of our investments in affiliate companies in order to assess whether available facts or circumstances, both internally
and externally, may suggest an other than temporary decline in the fair value of the investment. There were no indications of other
than temporary declines in the fair value of investments in affiliates as of January 31, 2012 and 2011, respectively. Our investments

Minerva. We own 13 million shares
of preferred stock representing 28% of the total capital stock of Minerva Networks, Inc. Minerva, a California
based company specializing in software products for the telecommunications and television markets. The preferred shares are convertible
to 13 million shares of common stock under certain conditions as defined in the Stock Purchase Agreement. We account for this
investment under the cost method of accounting. Visible World. We own less than
5% of the common and preferred stock of Visible World and we account for this investment under the cost method of accounting. For
fiscal years 2012, 2011 and 2010, we recognized revenues of approximately $11,000, $532,000 and $641,000 respectively, from Visible
World. On
Demand Deutschland GmbH Co. KG On February27, 2007, the On Demand Group Limited ODG, a wholly-owned
U.K. subsidiary of SeaChange, entered into an agreement with Tele-Munchen Fernseh GmbH Co. Produktionsgesellschaft TMG
to create a joint venture named On Demand Deutschland GmbH Co. KG. On Demand Deutschland specializes in establishing
on-demand and pay-per-view services on multiple platforms in German-speaking Europe. ODG contributed $28 million to acquire its
50% ownership interest in the joint venture of which $26 million consisted of the fair value of customer contracts and content
license agreements contributed by ODG and $154,000 represented a cash contribution. The customer contracts and licensed content
had no book value. We determined that this investment is an operating joint venture and does not require consolidation. Consequently,
we account for this investment under the equity method of accounting. ODG entered into a Service Agreement with
the joint venture whereby ODG provides content aggregation, distribution, marketing and administration services to the joint venture
under an arms length fee structure. For the years ended January 31, 2012, 2011 and 2010, ODG recorded revenues of $18 million 19 million, and $18, respectively, related to the Service Agreement. ODGs share of profits from this agreement in proportion
to its equity ownership interest is eliminated in consolidation. ODG recorded its proportionate share of
the joint ventures losses of $487,000, $36,000 and $653,000 for fiscal 2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively. Due to the capital
distribution and ODGs share of the joint ventures net loss exceeding the book value of its investment in the joint
venture, the investment is recorded as a long-term liability of $743,000 and $12 million at January 31, 2012 and 2011, respectively. Casa
Systems. On April 26, 2010, we sold our entire equity investment in Casa Systems, Inc., a Massachusetts based company
that specializes in video-on-demand products for the telecommunications and television markets, for $341 million realizing a pre-tax
profit of $252 million. InSite One. In the fourth quarter
of fiscal 2011, we sold our entire equity investment in InSite One for $46 million in cash realizing a pre-tax profit of $19
million. 6. Acquisitions eventIS Group B.V. On September1, 2009, we acquired
the entire share capital of eventIS Group B.V. eventIS based in Eindhoven, the Netherlands, which provides video-on-demand
and linear broadcast software and related services to cable television and telecommunications companies primarily in Europe.
The results of eventISs operations have been included in the consolidated financial statements since the acquisition date.
We acquired eventIS to expand our VOD solutions into the European market.   69
Fair Value of Consideration Transferred We have made
cash payments to the former shareholder of eventIS under the eventIS Share Purchase Agreement of $405 million in accordance with
the eventIS Share Purchase Agreement. On September 1, 2010, we paid approximately
$18 million and issued 75,018 shares approximate value $615,000 of restricted stock that will vest annually over three years.
The former shareholders of eventIS elected to receive the balance of the restricted stock consideration due in cash and approximately
$273,000 remains to be paid, which will be paid out in equal installments on September 1, 2012 and 2013. We are obligated to make
an additional fixed payment on September 1, 2012 in an aggregate amount of $28 million with $17 million payable in cash and $11
million payable by the issuance of restricted shares of our common stock, which will vest in equal installments over three years
starting on the first anniversary of the date of issuance. Under the earn-out provisions of the share purchase agreement, a cash
payment of $17 million for earnouts achieved in fiscal 2011 and 2012 will be paid in fiscal 2013. Additional earn-out payments
may be earned in fiscal 2013 if certain performance goals are met. VividLogic, Inc. On February1, 2010, we completed
our acquisition of VividLogic, Inc. VividLogic. VividLogic, based in Fremont, California provides in-home infrastructure
software for high definition televisions, home gateway, and set-top boxes to cable television service providers, set-top box manufacturers
and consumer electronics CE suppliers. We acquired VividLogic to expand our in-home solutions.
The results of VividLogics operations have been included in the consolidated financial statements since the acquisition
date. Fair Value of Consideration Transferred As of January 31, 2012, we had made cash
payments totaling $185 million to the former shareholders of VividLogic. We are obligated to make additional fixed payments of
$10 million in cash on February 1, 2012 and 2013. In addition, under the share purchase agreement with the former shareholders
of VividLogic, in the first quarter of fiscal 2013 we will make a cash earnout payment of $27 million for the earnout earned in
fiscal 2012. Additional earn-out payments may be earned over fiscal 2013 if certain performance goals are met. Allocation of Consideration Transferred The identifiable assets acquired and liabilities
assumed in the VividLogic acquisition were recognized and measured as of the acquisition date, February 1, 2010, based on their
estimated fair values. The excess of the acquisition date fair value of consideration transferred over the estimated fair value
of the net tangible assets and intangible assets acquired was recorded as goodwill.   70

and estimates of future performance of VividLogics products. The fair values of identified intangible assets were calculated
using an income approach based on estimates and assumptions provided by VividLogics and our management. The following table

Total intangible assets
$9,900 We determined the useful life of intangible
assets based on the expected future cash flows associated with the respective asset. Existing technology is comprised of products
that have reached technological feasibility and are part of VividLogics product line. Non-compete agreements represent the
fair value of the non-compete with the former shareholders and key employees and will be amortized over the respective terms of
the agreements. Customer contracts represent the underlying relationships and agreements with VividLogics installed customer
base. Trade name represents the value of the VividLogic name. Backlog represents the discounted value of the orders received from
customers but unfulfilled. Amortization of existing technology is included in cost of product revenue, and amortization expense
for customer relationships, non-compete and backlog are included in operating expenses. The weighted average life of the remaining
amortization expense is approximately eight years.   71
Goodwill Of the total VividLogic purchase price
of $239 million, $100 million was allocated to goodwill.Goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price of an acquired
business over the fair value of the underlying net tangible and intangible assets. We
determined that the goodwill included the value of VividLogics work force and expected synergies in global sales and marketing.
We consider the acquired business an addition to our Software reporting segment. We made this determination based upon the
financial information provided and reviewed by our Chief Executive Officer the chief operating decision maker and the similar
economic characteristics to our other products in our Software segment. None of the goodwill associated with the VividLogic acquisition
is deductible for income tax purposes. Deferred Revenue In connection with the allocation of consideration
transferred, we recorded the fair value of the customer contract obligations assumed from VividLogic. The fair value of the customer
contract obligations was determined using a cost build-up approach. The cost build-up approach determines fair value by estimating
the costs relating to fulfilling the obligations plus a normal profit margin. The sum of the costs and operating profit approximates,
in theory, the amount that we would be required to pay a third party to assume the service obligations. The estimated costs to
fulfill the service obligations were based on the historical direct costs and indirect costs related to VividLogics contracts
with its customers. Direct costs include personnel directly engaged in providing service and support activities, while indirect
costs consist of estimated general and administrative expenses based on normalized levels as a percentage of revenue. Profit associated
with selling efforts was excluded because VividLogic had concluded the selling efforts on the service contracts prior to the date
of our acquisition. The research and development costs associated with the customer contracts have been included in the fair value
determination, as these costs were deemed to represent a legal obligation to the customers at the time of acquisition. We recorded
$25 million of deferred revenue as of the acquisition date to reflect the fair value of VividLogics service obligations
assumed. Acquisition-related Consideration A liability was recognized for the acquisition
date fair value of the acquisition-related consideration for the deferred fixed purchase price, the estimated earnout payments
and working capital adjustments. Any change in the fair value of the acquisition-related consideration subsequent to the acquisition
date, including changes from events after the acquisition date, such as changes in our estimate of the meeting of performance goals,
will be recognized in earnings in the period the estimated fair value changes. The fair value estimate for the earnout payment
was estimated at $700,000 and is based on the probability weighted bookings to be achieved over the earnout period. A change in
fair value of the acquisition-related consideration could have a material effect on the statement of operations and financial position
in the period of the change in estimate. The fair value of the acquisition-related consideration to be distributed directly to
the VividLogic shareholders was estimated by us at the acquisition date to be $84 million. Acquisition-related Costs We recorded transaction costs such as legal,
accounting, valuation and other professional services of $831,000 and $341,000 during fiscal 2011 and 2010. The transaction costs
were expensed and recorded in general and administrative expenses in the Consolidated Statement of Operations.   72
7. Goodwill and Intangible Assets At January 31, 2012 and 2011, we had goodwill
of $636 million and $647 million, respectively. The change in the carrying amount of goodwill for the years ended January 31,
2012 and 2011 are as follows

of goodwill assigned based on a relative fair value calculation to the divestiture of the broadcast servers and storage business
unit that is included in non-current assets related to discontinued operations in the Consolidated Balance Sheet. As of August 1, 2011, we reviewed the recoverability
of goodwill associated with our previously reported three segments, Software, Servers and Storage, and Media Services, and determined
that there was no goodwill impairment. Following the divestiture of a portion of the broadcast servers and storage product lines,
the Software and VOD server product line was organized in the one business reporting segment. Reportable segments were determined
based upon the nature of the products offered to customers, the market characteristics of each operating segment and the Companys
management structure. During the fourth quarter of fiscal
2012, we evaluated the impairment analysis and updated for the change in its estimates from August 1, 2011 to January 31, 2012.
While no impairment charges resulted from the analyses performed during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2012, impairment charges may
occur in the future due to changes in projected revenue growth rates, projected operating margins or estimated discount rates,
among other factors. At January 31, 2012 and 2011, we have recorded
net intangible assets of $ 238 million and $303 million respectively, consisting of patents, customer contracts, non-compete
agreements, completed technology, in-process research and development and trademarks. Intangible assets, net, consisted of the

to take actions to lower its cost structure as it strives to improve its financial performance and incurred restructuring charges
totaling $33 million including severance costs of $28 million for the termination of 33 employees, including the departure of
the President and the retirement of the Chief Executive Officer, the write-down of $430,000 of inventory relating to discontinued
VOD server product lines and $270,000 charge for the disposal of fixed assets relating to the New Hampshire facility. During fiscal
2011, we incurred restructuring charges of approximately $70 million related to the termination of 110 employees, incurred an
inventory write-down of approximately $25 million and took a charge related to the disposal of fixed assets of $13 million as
part of an overall restructuring plan. The severance amounts reported as a component of accrued liabilities

maintain a revolving line of credit with RBS Citizens a subsidiary of the Royal Bank of Scotland Group plc for $200 million
which expires on October 31, 2012. Loans made under this revolving line of credit bear interest at a rate per annum equal to the
banks prime rate. Borrowings under this line of credit are collateralized by substantially all of our assets. The
loan agreement requires us to comply with certain financial covenants. As
of January 31, 2012, we were in compliance with the financial covenants and there were no amounts outstanding under the revolving
line of credit.   74
We are occasionally required to post letters
of credit, issued by a financial institution, to secure certain sales contracts. Letters of credit generally authorize the financial
institution to make a payment to the beneficiary upon the satisfaction of a certain event or the failure to satisfy an obligation.
The letters of credit are generally posted for one-year terms and are usually automatically renewed upon maturity until such time
as we have satisfied the commitment secured by the letter of credit. We are obligated to reimburse the issuer only if the beneficiary
collects on the letter of credit. We believe that it is unlikely we will be required to fund a claim under our outstanding letters
of credit. As of January 31, 2012 the full amount of the letters of credit of $16 million was supported by our credit facility. 10. Commitments and Contingencies We lease certain of our operating facilities,
automobiles and office equipment under non-cancelable operating leases, which expire at various dates through 2015. Rental expense
under operating leases was $34 million, $32 million and $26 million for fiscal 2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively. Future commitments
under minimum lease payments as of January 31, 2012 are as follows

a contempt motion in the U.S. District Court for the District of Delaware against SeaChange International relating to U.S. Patent
No 5,805,804 the 804 patent, a patent in which ARRIS has an ownership interest. In its motion, ARRIS is seeking
further patent royalties and the enforcement of the permanent injunction entered by the Court on April 6, 2006 against certain
SeaChange products. On August 3, 2009, SeaChange filed a complaint seeking a declaratory judgment from the Court that its products
do not infringe the 804 patent and asserting certain equitable defenses. On June 4, 2010, the Court entered an Order staying
the declaratory judgment action pending resolution of the contempt proceeding. On September 2, 2011, the Court entered an Order
in which it concluded that a contempt proceeding is the appropriate procedure for resolving the parties dispute and that
further factual and legal determinations would be necessary. On March 1, 2012, the Court conducted a hearing at which the parties
submitted additional information. No determinations were made by the Court at the hearing as to liability, and the parties are
now scheduled to submit post-hearing briefs. We believe that our products do not infringe on the 804 patent and that we
have meritorious defenses against the suit, however, the ultimate resolution of the matter is not reasonably estimable at this
time, but could result in a material liability for the Company.   75
Indemnification and Warranties We
enter into agreements in the ordinary course of business with customers, resellers, distributors, integrators and suppliers. Most
of these agreements require us to defend and/or indemnify the other party against intellectual property infringement claims brought
by a third party with respect to our products. From time to time, we also indemnify customers and business partners for damages,
losses and liabilities they may suffer or incur relating to personal injury, personal property damage, product liability, and environmental
claims relating to the use of our products and services or resulting from the acts or omissions of us, our employees, authorized
agents or subcontractors. For example, we have received requests from several of our customers for indemnification of patent litigation
claims asserted by Acacia Media Technologies, USA Video Technology Corporation, VTran Media Technologies and Active Video Networks,
Inc. Management cannot reasonably estimate any potential losses, but these claims could result in material liability for
us. We warrant that our products, including
software products, will substantially perform in accordance with its standard published specifications in effect at the time of
delivery. Most warranties have at least a one year duration that generally commence upon installation. In addition, we provide
maintenance support to our customers and therefore allocate a portion of the product purchase price to the initial warranty period
and recognizes revenue on a straight line basis over that warranty period related to both the warranty obligation and the maintenance
support agreement. When SeaChange receives revenue for extended warranties beyond the standard duration, it is deferred and recognized
on a straight line basis over the contract period. Related costs are expensed as incurred. In the ordinary course of business, we
provide minimum purchase guarantees to certain of our vendors to ensure continuity of supply against the market demand. Although
some of these guarantees provide penalties for cancellations and/or modifications to the purchase commitments as the market demand
decreases, most of the guarantees do not. Therefore, as the market demand decreases, we re-evaluate the accounting implications
of guarantees and determine what charges, if any, should be recorded. With respect to our agreements covering
product, business or entity divestitures and acquisitions, we provide certain representations and warranties and agrees to indemnify
and hold such purchasers harmless against breaches of such representations, warranties and covenants. With respect to our acquisitions,
we may, from time to time, assume the liability for certain events or occurrences that took place prior to the date of acquisition. We provide such guarantees and indemnification
obligations after considering the economics of the transaction and other factors including but not limited to the liquidity and
credit risk of the other party in the transaction. We believe that the likelihood is remote that any such arrangement could have
a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operation or liquidity. We record liabilities, as disclosed above,
for such guarantees based on our best estimate of probable losses which considers amounts recoverable under any recourse provisions. 11. Stockholders Equity Stock Authorization The Board of Directors is authorized to
issue from time to time up to an aggregate of 5,000,000 shares of preferred stock, in one or more series. Each such series of preferred
stock shall have the number of shares, designations, preferences, voting powers, qualifications and special or relative rights
or privileges to be determined by the Board of Directors, including dividend rights, voting rights, redemption rights and sinking
fund provisions, liquidation preferences, conversion rights and preemptive rights. No preferred stock has been issued as of January
31, 2012. Stock Repurchase Program On May 26, 2010, our Board of Directors
authorized the repurchase of up to $200 million of its common stock, par value $01 per share, through a share repurchase program.
The repurchase program terminated on January31, 2012. During the year ended January 31, 2011, we repurchased approximately
178,000 shares at a cost of $14 million at an average purchase price $805. During fiscal 2011, there were 1,484,617 treasury
shares retired. During fiscal 2012, we did not repurchase any shares.   76
On March 28, 2012, our Board of Directors
authorized the repurchase of up to $250 million of its common stock, par value $01 per share, through a share repurchase program.
The repurchase program terminates on January31, 2013. For fiscal 2011, approximately 465,446
RSUs were earned by the Company executive officers under the Companys fiscal 2011 performance based plan. These RSUs were
not awarded due to the Company not having sufficient RSUs available within the 2005 Plan to satisfy the RSUs earned. The Company
recorded a liability totaling $14 million on the Consolidated Balance Sheet as of January 31, 2011 for the estimated fair value
of the award. The award was re-measured quarterly until the increase in the RSUs was approved by the shareholders. These shares
were awarded at the Companys annual meeting on July 20, 2011. 12. Segment Information Operating segments are defined as components
of an enterprise evaluated regularly by our senior management in deciding how to allocate resources and assess performance. Through
the third quarter of fiscal 2012, we managed and operated as three segments, Software, Servers and Storage, and Media Services,
Following the classification of a portion of the broadcast servers and storage business unit as an asset held for sale,
the Software and VOD product line was organized in the one business reporting segment. We have two segments in which senior management
decides how to allocate resources and assess performance. Reportable segments were determined based upon the nature of the products
offered to customers, the market characteristics of each operating segment and the Companys management structure. Software segment This segment includes
product revenues from our advertising, back-office including video streamers, and home gateway software solutions, related services
such as professional services, installation, training, project management, product maintenance, technical support and software
development for those software products. Media Services segment This agreement includes
the operations of the On Demand Group which include content acquisition and preparation services for television and wireless service
providers. Under
this revised reporting structure, we further determined that there are significant functions, and therefore costs considered corporate
expenses and are not allocated to the reportable segments for the purposes of assessing performance and making operating decisions.
These unallocated costs include general and administrative expenses, other than general and administrative expenses related to
Media Services, interest and other income, net, taxes and equity income losses in affiliates, which are managed separately at
the corporate level. The segment data for the fiscal years ended January 31, 2012, 2011, and
2010 has been recast to reflect the realignment of the new segments. The basis of the assumptions for all such
revenues, costs and expenses includes significant judgments and estimations. There are no inter-segment revenues for the periods
shown below. We do not separately track all assets by operating segments nor are the segments evaluated under this criterion.   77

13. Stock-Based Compensation and Stock
Incentive Plans We use on a modified prospective basis,
the provisions of the authoritative guidance which requires the measurement and recognition of compensation expense for all share-based
payment awards made to employees and directors including employee stock options, restricted stock units and, prior to its termination,
employee stock purchases related to the Employee Stock Purchase Plan ESPP based on estimated fair values. The fair
value of our stock-based options and performance-based restricted stock units, less expected forfeitures, is amortized over the
awards vesting period on a graded vesting basis, whereas the restricted stock units and Employee Stock Purchase Plan stock
units are amortized on a straight line basis. We have applied the provisions of authoritative guidance allowing the use of a simplified
method, in developing an estimate of the expected term of plain vanilla share options. Stock-based compensation includes expense
charges for all stock-based awards to employees and directors. Such awards include option grants, restricted stock unit awards,
and, prior to its termination, shares expected to be purchased under an employee stock purchase plan. The estimated fair value
of our stock-based options and performance-based restricted stock units, less expected forfeitures, is amortized over the awards
vesting period on a graded vesting basis, whereas the restricted stock units and ESPP stock units are amortized on a straight line
basis. The effect of recording stock-based compensation
was as follows

guidance for recording stock-based compensation for the year ended January 31, 2012 are not indicative of future amounts. Determining Fair Value We record the fair value of stock options,
including rights granted under the ESPP prior to its termination, using the Black-Scholes valuation model. Key input assumptions
used to estimate the fair value of stock options include the exercise price, the expected option term, the risk-free interest rate
over the options expected term, the expected annual dividend yield and the expected stock price volatility. The expected
option term was determined using the simplified method for plain vanilla options. The expected stock
price volatility was established using a blended volatility, which is an average of the historical volatility of our common stock
over a period of time equal to the expected term of the stock option, and the average volatility of our common stock over the most
recent one-year and two-year periods.   79

No ESPP shares granted in fiscal 2012. The ESPP plan was cancelled in fiscal 2011 Stock Option Plans 2011 Compensation and Incentive Plan. On
July 20, 2011 our stockholders approved the adoption of our 2011 Compensation and Incentive Plan the 2011 Plan
under a number shares of common stock equal to 28 million plus the number of expired, terminated, surrendered or forfeited awards
under the Amended and Restated 2005 Equity Compensation and Incentive Plan the
2005 Plan subsequent to July 20, 2011 were authorized and terminated the Amended and Restated 2005 Equity Compensation
and Incentive Plan. The 2011 Plan provides for the grant of incentive stock options, nonqualified stock options, restricted stock,
restricted stock units, and other equity based non stock option awards as determined by the plan administrator for the purchase
of up to an aggregate of 2,800,000 shares of our common stock by officers, employees, consultants and directors of the Company.
We may satisfy awards upon the exercise of stock options or vesting of restricted stock units with newly issued shares or treasury
shares. The Board of Directors is responsible for the administration of the 2011 Plan and determining the term of each award, award
exercise price, the number of shares for which each award is granted and the rate at which each award vests. As of January 31,
2012, there were 19 million shares available for future grant. Option awards may be granted to employees
at an exercise price per share of not less than 100% of the fair market value per common share on the date of the grant. Restricted
stock units and other equity-based non-stock option awards may be granted to any officer, employee, director or consultant at a
purchase price per share as determined by the Board of Directors. Awards granted under the 2011 Plan generally vest over three
years and expire seven years from the date of the grant. Amended and Restated 2005 Equity Compensation
and Incentive Plan The 2005 plan was terminated upon the adoption
of the 2011 Plan on July 20, 2011. No further awards will be granted under the 2005 Plan. The 2005 Plan provided for the grant
of incentive stock options, nonqualified stock options, restricted stock, restricted stock units, and other non-stock
option awards as determined by the plan administrator for the purchase of up to an aggregate of 2,800,000 shares of our common
stock by officers, employees, consultants and directors of the Company. We may satisfy awards upon the exercise of stock options
or vesting of restricted stock units with either newly issued shares or treasury shares. The Board of Directors is responsible
for the administration of the 2005 Plan and determining the term of each award, award exercise price, number of shares for which
each award is granted and the rate at which each award is exercisable.   80

338 The weighted-average fair valuation at
grant date of stock options granted during the years ended January 31, 2012, 2011 and 2010, was $286, $370, and $321, respectively.
As of January 31, 2012, the unrecognized stock-based compensation related to the unvested stock options was $682,000 net of estimated
forfeitures. Total unrecognized compensation cost will be adjusted for any future changes in estimated changes in forfeitures.
This cost will be recognized over an estimated weighted average amortization period of seventeen months. The total intrinsic value of options exercised
during the years ended January 31, 2012, 2011 and 2010 was approximately $754,000, $473,000 and $60,000, respectively, with intrinsic
value defined as the difference between the market price on the date of exercise and the grant date price. The cash received from employees as a result
of employee stock option exercises during fiscal years 2012, 2011 and 2010 was $18 million, $21 million, and $324,000, respectively. The following table summarizes information

Restricted Stock Units Pursuant to the 2011 Plan, we may grant
restricted stock units that entitle the recipient to acquire shares of our common stock. Awards of restricted stock units generally
vest in equal increments on each of the first three anniversaries of the grant of the award. Stock-based compensation expense associated
with the restricted stock units is charged for the market value of our stock on the date of grant, assuming nominal forfeitures,
and is amortized over the awards vesting period on a straight-line basis for awards with only a service condition and graded
vesting basis for awards that include both a performance and service condition. As of January 31, 2012 there were 19 million RSUs
available to be granted. For fiscal 2012, approximately 51,000 RSUs were earned by our executive officers under the Companys
fiscal 2012 performance based plan The following table summarizes the restricted

$794 As of January 31, 2012 the unrecognized
stock-based compensation related to the unvested restricted stock units was $45 million. This cost will be recognized over an
estimated weighted average amortization period of 21 years. Due to the retirement of our Chief Executive Officer on December 8,
2011, his unvested restricted stock units were accounted for as a modification to the terms and conditions. This modification resulted
in the cancellation of unvested restricted awards with a grant date value of $19 million and recognition of stock compensation
expense of $13 million. Employee Stock Purchase Plan In September 1996, our Board of Directors
adopted and the stockholders approved an employee stock purchase plan the ESPP, effective January 1, 1997 as amended
July 16, 2008, which provided for the issuance of a maximum of 22 million shares of common stock to participating employees who
meet eligibility requirements. The Plan was terminated on May 31, 2010. The purchase price of the stock was 85% of the lesser of
the average market price of the common stock on the first or last business day of each six-month plan period. During fiscal 2011
and 2010, the number of shares of common stock issued under the Employee Stock Purchase Plan were 135,632 and 282,889, respectively.
The cash received from employees as a result of the ESPP during fiscal 2011 and 2010 was $660,000, and $15 million, respectively. 14. Income Taxes The components of income before income

$1,026 At January 31, 2012, we had federal, state
and foreign net operating loss carryforwards of $26 million, $270 million and $144 million respectively, which can be used to
offset future tax liabilities and expire at various dates beginning in fiscal 2016. Utilization of these net operating loss carryforwards
may be limited pursuant to provisions of the respective local jurisdiction. At January 31, 2012, we had federal and state research
and development credit carryforwards of approximately $31 million and $848,000 respectively, and state investment tax credit carryforwards
of $178,000. The federal credit carryforwards will expire at various dates beginning in fiscal 2016, if not utilized. Certain state
credit carryforwards will expire at various dates beginning in fiscal 2013, while certain other state credit carryforwards may
be carried forward indefinitely. Utilization of these credit carryforwards may be limited pursuant to provisions of the respective
local jurisdiction. We also have alternative minimum tax credit carryforwards of $558,000 which are available to reduce future
federal regular income taxes over an indefinite period. We have foreign tax credit carryforwards of $600,000 which are available
to reduce future federal regular income taxes. We review quarterly the adequacy of the
valuation allowance for deferred tax assets. We have evaluated the positive and negative evidence bearing upon the realizability
of our deferred tax assets and have established a valuation allowance of approximately $123 million for such assets, which are
comprised principally of net operating loss carryforwards, research and development credits, deferred revenue, inventory and stock
based compensation. If we generate pre-tax income in the future, some portion or all of the valuation allowance could be reversed
and a corresponding increase in net income would be reported in future periods. The valuation allowance increased from $70 million
at January 31, 2011 to $123 million at January 31, 2012 At January
31, 2012, we have indefinitely reinvested $683 million of the cumulative undistributed earnings of certain foreign subsidiaries.
Approximately $451 million of such earnings would be subject to U.S. taxes if repatriated to the U.S. Through January 31, 2012,
we have not provided deferred income taxes on the undistributed earnings of our foreign subsidiaries because such earnings are
considered to be indefinitely reinvested outside the U.S. Non-US income taxes are, however, provided on those foreign subsidiaries
undistributed earnings with the exception of ZQ Interactive, LTD based in the British Virgin Islands. Determination of the potential
deferred income tax liability on these undistributed earnings is not practicable because such liability, if any, is dependent on
circumstances existing if and when remittance occurs.   84
For the year ended January 31, 2012, we
recognized an additional tax expense for unrecognized tax benefits of $431,000. None of the amounts included in the balance of
unrecognized tax benefits at January 31, 2012 of $65 million are related to tax positions for which it is reasonably possible
that the total amounts could significantly change during the next twelve months. We recognize accrued interest and penalties related
to uncertain tax positions in income tax expense. A reconciliation of the beginning and ending balance of the total amounts of
gross unrecognized tax benefits, excluding interest of $721,000 is as follows in thousands

$7,283 We and our subsidiaries file income tax
returns in U.S. federal jurisdiction, various state jurisdictions, and various foreign jurisdictions. We are no longer subject
to U.S. federal examinations before 2008. However, the taxing authorities still have the ability to review the propriety of certain
tax attributes created in closed years if such tax attributes are utilized in an open tax year, such as our federal research and
development credit carryovers. 15. Employee Benefit Plan We sponsor
a 401k retirement savings plan the Plan. Participation in the Plan is available to full-time employees who meet
eligibility requirements. Eligible employees may contribute up to 25% of their annual salary, subject to certain limitations. We
matched contributions up to 50% of the first 6% of compensation. During fiscal 2012, 2011 and 2010, we contributed $12 million 13 million and $14 million, respectively. We also contribute to various retirement plans in its international subsidiaries,
of which the amounts will vary, according to the local plans specific to each foreign location. 16. Related Party On September 1, 2009, we completed our
acquisition of eventIS from a holding company in which Erwin van Dommelen held a 315% interest. Subsequent to the acquisition
Mr. van Dommelen was appointed President of SeaChanges Software segment in March 2010. On closing the transaction, we made
cash payments to the holding company totaling $370 million and issued $11 million of restricted shares. We have made and are
obligated to make additional fixed and variable earnout payments to the holding company of deferred purchase price under the eventIS
share purchase agreement. See note 6 for payment details.   85

Item 2. Controls and Procedures A Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures We evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure
controls and procedures, as defined in the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended the Exchange Act Rule 13a-15e,
as of the end of the period covered by this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Raghu Rau, our Chief Executive Officer, and Michael D.
Bornak, our Chief Financial Officer, participated in this evaluation. Based upon that evaluation, Messrs. Rau and Bornak concluded
that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of the end of the period covered by the report.   88
B Report of Management on Internal Control over Financial Reporting Our management is responsible for establishing
and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting. Our internal control system was designed to provide reasonable
assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in
accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. Our internal control over financial reporting
includes those policies and procedures that i pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and
fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of our assets; ii provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded
as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that
our receipts and expenditures are being made only in accordance with authorizations of our management and directors, and iii
provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of our assets
that could have a material effect on the financial statements. Because of inherent limitations, internal
control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness
to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree
of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. Our management assessed the effectiveness
of our internal control over financial reporting as of January 31, 2012. In making this assessment, management used the criteria
set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission COSO in Internal ControlIntegrated
Framework. Based on our assessment, management concluded that, as of January 31, 2012, our internal control over financial
reporting was effective based on those criteria. The effectiveness of our internal control
over financial reporting as of January 31, 2012 has been audited by Grant Thornton LLP, our independent registered public accounting
firm, as stated in their report which is included immediately below. To the Board of Directors and Shareholders of SeaChange International,
Inc. We have audited SeaChange International,
Inc. a Delaware Corporation and subsidiaries internal control over financial reporting as of January31, 2012, based on
criteria established in Internal ControlIntegrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the
Treadway Commission COSO. SeaChange International Inc.s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control
over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in
the accompanying Managements Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion
on SeaChange International, Inc. and subsidiaries internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We conducted our audit in accordance with
the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board United States. Those standards require that we plan and perform
the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all
material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk
that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the
assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit
provides a reasonable basis for our opinion. A companys internal control over
financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and
the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A companys
internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that 1pertain to the maintenance of records
that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; 2provide
reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with
generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with
authorizations of management and directors of the company; and 3provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely
detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the companys assets that could have a material effect on the
financial statements.   89
Because of its inherent limitations, internal
control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness
to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree
of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. In our opinion, SeaChange International,
Inc. and subsidiaries maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of January31,
2012, based on criteria established in Internal ControlIntegrated Framework issued by COSO. We also
have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board United States, the consolidated
balance sheets of SeaChange International, Inc. and subsidiaries as of January31, 2012 and 2011, and the related consolidated
statements of operations, stockholders equity and comprehensive income loss, and cash flows for each of the three years
in the period ended January31, 2012 and our report dated April 5, 2012 expressed an unqualified opinion. s/ Grant Thornton LLP Boston, Massachusetts
April 5, 2012 C Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting As a result of the evaluation completed by management, and in
which Messrs. Rau and Bornak participated, we have concluded that there were no changes during the fiscal quarter ended January
31, 2012 in our internal control over financial reporting, which have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially
affect, our internal control over financial reporting.   90
