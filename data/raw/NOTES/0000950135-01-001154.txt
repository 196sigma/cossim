REPORT OF INDEPENDENT ACCOUNTANTS
To the Board of Directors and Stockholders
of NetGenesis Corp In our opinion, the accompanying consolidated balance sheets and the related
consolidated statements of operations, stockholders' equity deficit and cash
flows present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of
NetGenesis Corp. and its subsidiaries at December 31, 2000 and 1999, and the
results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in
the period ended December 31, 2000 in conformity with accounting principles
generally accepted in the United States of America. These financial statements
are the responsibility of the Company management; our responsibility is to
express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audits. We
conducted our audits of these statements in accordance with auditing standards
generally accepted in the United States of America, which require that we plan
and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial
statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a
test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial
statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates
made by management, and evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.
We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

Company provides consulting, training, maintenance and support services to

statements are as follows  Principles of Consolidation
The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and
its wholly owned subsidiaries. Intercompany balances and transactions have been
eliminated. The company organizes itself as one segment reporting to the chief
operating decision-maker. Revenue consists of software licensing, and service
and support agreements. The Company has sales outside of the United States,
which are described in the footnotes.
Use of Estimates
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally
accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and
assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and
disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial
statements and the reported amount of revenues and expenses during the reporting
period. Actual amounts could differ from those estimates.
Reclassification
Certain prior period amounts have been reclassed to be consistent with
the current period presentation.
Cash and Cash Equivalents
The Company considers all highly liquid investments with an original
maturity of three months or less to be cash equivalents. At December 31, 1999
and 2000, the Company cash equivalents consisted of certificates of deposit,
money market funds, and other investments with an original maturity of three
months or less totaling approximately $8,754,000 and $13,914,000, respectively.
The                    34
36
carrying amount in the financial statements approximates fair value because of
the short maturity and holding period of these instruments.
Short-term Investments and Marketable Securities
The Company invests its excess cash primarily in short and long-term
investments which are classified as available-for-sale marketable securities. Of
these investments, $17 million is restricted in connection with our leased
facilities in Cambridge, MA. This restricted investment is classified as a
long-term other asset. In calculating realized gains and losses, cost is
determined using specific identification. We recorded $11 million of realized
gains in 2000 and none in 1999. Unrealized gains and losses on short-term
investments and marketable securities are excluded from earnings and reported in
a separate component of stockholders' equity. At December 31, 1999 and 2000
unrealized gains on short-term investments and marketable securities were $12
million and $122,000 respectively. The following is a summary of short-term
investments and marketable securities as of December 31, 2000                                 COST      ESTIMATED FAIR VALUE

Restricted Cash
Restricted cash consists of deposits held at major financial institutions as
collateral for letters of credit that secure the Company office leases and
leases of certain of the Company fixed assets.
Revenue Recognition
Effective January 1, 1998, the Company adopted Statement of Position No.
97-2 SOP 97-2. The Company generates several types of revenue, including the
following      License Fees
The Company standard end user license agreement for the Company
products provides for an initial fee to use the product in perpetuity up
to a maximum number of users. The Company also enters into other license
agreement types, typically with major end user customers, which allows
for the use of the Company products, usually restricted by the number
of users, the number of servers or the license term. Fees from licenses
are recognized as revenue when a contract has been executed and the
product has been delivered, provided fees are fixed or determinable,
collection is probable and there are no uncertainties with respect to
customer acceptance. If uncertainties exist, revenue is deferred until
such time as the customer accepts the                    35
37
product or service. Revenue under arrangements where multiple products
or services are sold together under one contract is allocated to each
element based on their relative fair values, with these fair values
being determined using the price charged when that element is sold
separately. License fees from software sold together with services are
generally recognized upon delivery of the software provided that the
above criteria have been met and the services are not essential to the
functionality of the software. In instances where the aforementioned
criteria have not been met, both the license and professional services
fees are recognized under the percentage of completion method of
contract accounting, based upon the proportion of hours expended to
total estimated hours at completion. Losses, if any, on fixed price
contracts are recognized when the loss is determined.
Service and Support Agreements
The Company provides consulting, installation and training services
to its customers. Revenue from such services is generally recognized
over the period during which the applicable service is to be performed
or on a services-performed basis. Support agreements generally call for
the Company to provide technical support and software updates to
customers. Revenue for support agreements is recognized ratably over the
term of the support agreement and is included in services revenue in the
accompanying statements of operations.
Fair Value of Financial Instruments
The carrying amounts of the Company financial instruments, which include
cash equivalents, accounts receivable, accounts payable, accrued expenses,
capital lease obligations and debt, approximate their fair values at December
31, 1999 and 2000.
Concentrations of Credit Risk and Significant Customers
Financial instruments which potentially expose the Company to concentrations
of credit risk consist of accounts receivable. The Company performs ongoing
evaluations of customers' financial condition and does not generally require
collateral. The Company maintains reserves for potential credit losses, which,
in the aggregate, have not exceeded management expectations.
At December 31, 1999, accounts receivable from one customer accounted for
approximately 11% of total accounts receivable. At December 31, 2000, accounts
receivable from one customer accounted for approximately 28% of total accounts
receivable.
During the year ended December 31, 1998, revenue from each of two customers
accounted for approximately 11% of total revenue. During the years ended
December 31, 1999 and 2000, no customer accounted for more than 10% of total
revenue.
Impairment of Long-Lived Assets
NetGenesis reviews long-lived assets for impairment whenever events or
changes in business circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the
assets may not be fully recoverable or that the useful lives of these assets
are no longer appropriate. Each impairment test is based on a comparison of the
undiscounted cash flows to the recorded value of the asset. If an impairment is
indicated, the asset is written down to its estimated fair value on a
discounted cash flow basis.
Fixed Assets
Fixed assets are recorded at cost and depreciated using the straight-line
method over the estimated useful lives of the assets. Capital leases and
leasehold improvements are amortized over the lesser of the remaining lease life
or the estimated useful life of the asset. Upon retirement or sale, the costs of
the assets disposed and the related accumulated depreciation are removed from
the accounts and any resulting gain or loss is included in the determination of
income. Maintenance and repair costs are charged to expense as incurred.
Estimated useful lives of fixed assets generally range from three to five years.
Research and Development and Software Development Costs
Costs incurred in the research and development of the Company products are
expensed as incurred. Software development costs                    36
38
incurred subsequent to the establishment of technological feasibility are
capitalized in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards
SFAS No. 86, Accounting for the Cost of Computer Software to be Sold,
Leased or Otherwise Marketed. No software development costs were capitalized
during 1998, 1999 or 2000 since costs incurred subsequent to the establishment
of technological feasibility were not significant.
Advertising Expense
The Company recognizes advertising expense as incurred. Advertising expense
was approximately $49,000, $131,000 and $348,000 for the years ended December
31, 1998, 1999, and 2000, respectively.
Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation
The Company accounts for stock-based awards to employees using the intrinsic
value method as prescribed by Accounting Principles Board Opinion APB No.
25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees, and related interpretations. The
Company has adopted the provisions of SFAS No. 123, Accounting for Stock-Based
Compensation, through disclosure only Note 8.
Income Taxes
The company computes deferred income taxes based on the differences between
the financial statement and tax basis of assets and liabilities using enacted
rates in effect in the years in which the differences are expected to reverse.
The Company must establish a valuation allowance to offset temporary deductible
differences, net operating loss carryforwards and tax credits when it is more
likely than not that the deferred tax assets will not be realized.
Comprehensive Income
Comprehensive income is defined as the change in equity of a business
enterprise during a period from transactions and other events and circumstances
from non-owner sources, including foreign currency translation adjustments and
unrealized gains and losses on marketable securities.
Net Loss per Share
Basic and diluted net loss available to common stockholders per share is
computed by dividing loss available to common stockholders by the weighted
average number of shares of common stock outstanding during the period,
excluding shares of common stock subject to repurchase. Diluted net loss
available to common stockholders per share does not differ from basic net loss
per share since potential common shares from conversion of preferred stock and
exercise of stock options and warrants are anti-dilutive for all periods
presented. Unaudited pro forma basic and diluted net loss available to common
stockholders per share have been calculated assuming the conversion of all
outstanding shares of preferred stock into common shares, as if the shares had
converted immediately upon their issuance.
Recently Enacted Accounting Standards
In June 1998, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Statement of
Financial Accounting Standards SFAS No. 133, Accounting for Derivative
Instruments and Hedging Activities. SFAS No. 133 was amended in July 1999 by
the issuance of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 137 SFAS No.
137, Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities - Deferral
of the Effective Date of FASB Statement No. 133 - An Amendment of FASB No. 133.
SFAS No. 137 defers the implementation of SFAS No. 133 by one year. SFAS No. 133
was further amended in June 2000 by the issuance of Statement of Financial
Accounting Standards No. 138 SFAS No. 138, Accounting for Certain
Derivative Instruments and Certain Hedging Activities - An Amendment of FASB
Statement No. 133. SFAS No. 138 further clarifies the provisions of SFAS No.
133. SFAS No. 133, as amended, is effective for fiscal quarters beginning after
January 1, 2001. The Company has not historically entered into transactions
involving derivative instruments, nor has it hedged any of its business
activities, so it does not believe that adoption of SFAS No. 133 will have an
effect on on its financial statements.
In December 1999, the Securities and Exchange Commission SEC issued
Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 101 SAB 101, Revenue Recognition in Financial
Statements, as amended by SAB 101B, which is effective no later than the year
ended December 31, 2000. The bulletin clarifies the SEC views regarding
certain aspects of revenue recognition. We adopted SAB 101 in the fourth quarter
of 2000. The application of the guidance in SAB 101 did not have a material
impact on our results of operations.                    37
39
In September 2000, the FASB issued SFAS No. 140 Accounting for Transfers
and Servicing of Financial Assets and Extinguishments of Liabilities - a
replacement of FASB Statement No. 125. SFAS No. 140 revises the standards for
accounting for securitizations and other transfers of financial assets and
collateral and requires certain disclosures, but it carries over most of SFAS
No. 125 provisions without reconsideration. This Statement is effective for
transfers and servicing of financial assets and extinguishments of liabilities
occurring after March 31, 2001. This Statement is effective for recognition and
reclassification of collateral and for disclosures related to securitization
transactions and collateral for fiscal years ending after December 15, 2000. We
do not expect the adoption of SFAS No. 140 to have a material impact on our
financial position or results of operations. 3. FIXED ASSETS

4. CAPITAL LEASE AND BORROWINGS
In January 1999, the Company entered into an agreement with a leasing
company to establish a line of credit that enabled the Company to finance up to
$1,000,000 in purchases of property and equipment under capital leases the
lease line. Each borrowing under the lease line is payable in equal monthly
installments over a period of 36 months and bears interest at a rate of 9% per
annum. In connection with this agreement, the Company granted warrants to
purchase 35,307 shares of the Company Series E preferred stock at an exercise
price equal to $184 per share. These warrants were exercised on September 12,
2000. Upon exercise, the shares were converted on a one for 75 basis to 26,480
shares of common stock. The value ascribed by management to these
warrants was approximately $32,000 and was computed using the Black-Scholes
model with the following assumptions: Series E redeemable convertible preferred
stock fair value of $184 per share; warrant exercise price of $184 per share;
dividend yield of 0%; risk-free interest rate of 502%; expected term of 5 years
life of the warrants; and 50% volatility. There is $742,000 outstanding on the
lease line at December 31, 2000. The future minimum lease payments as of
December 31, 2000 are $798,000. The Company also has $62,000 outstanding on two
other capital leases with future minimum lease payments of $70,000 as of
December 31, 2000.
During 1999 and 2000, the Company sold and immediately leased back certain
equipment under the lease line. Total computer equipment of $443,000 and
$547,000 were purchased under the lease line for the year ended December 31,
1999 and 2000, respectively. Amortization of property and equipment under the
lease line during the years ended December 31, 1999 and 2000 totaled $85,000 and
$315,000, respectively, and is included in depreciation expense. Interest
expense relating to the lease line for the years ended December 31, 1999 and
2000 totaled $25,000 and $73,000, respectively.
In January 1999, the Company entered into a subordinated debt agreement
providing for borrowings of up to $3,000,000. The subordinated debt is payable
in 36 monthly payments and bears interest at a rate of 135%. At December 31,
1999 and 2000, the Company had $27 and $15 million, respectively, outstanding
under the agreement.
In connection with the subordinated debt, the Company granted warrants to
purchase 244,432 shares of the Company Series E redeemable convertible
preferred stock at an exercise price equal to $184 per share. These warrants
were exercised on February 29, 2000. Upon exercise, the shares were converted on
a one for 75 basis to 183,324 shares of common stock. The value
ascribed by management to these warrants was approximately $223,000 and was
computed using the Black-Scholes model with the                    38
40
following assumptions: Series E redeemable convertible preferred stock fair
value of $184 per share; warrant exercise price of $184 per share; dividend
yield of 0%; risk free interest rate of 502%; expected term of 5 years life of
the warrants; and 50% volatility. The warrant value was recorded as a debt
discount and is being amortized to interest expense over the term of the loans.
The subordinated debt and the lease line are secured by substantially all
assets of the Company. Under these agreements, the Company is required to comply
with certain covenants. The Company is in compliance with these covenants for
all periods presented.
5. ACCRUED EXPENSES

6. REDEEMABLE CONVERTIBLE PREFERRED STOCK AND CONVERTIBLE PREFERRED STOCK
In June 1999, pursuant to the terms of the Series F Preferred Stock
agreement, the Company issued, to the placement agent for the Series F Preferred
Stock, warrants to purchase 114,458 shares of Series F preferred stock with an
exercise price of $332 per share. The warrants were exercisable immediately and
were to expire five years from the date of grant or, if earlier, at the
effective date of the Company initial public offering. The warrants were
exercised immediately prior to the Company initial public offering.
Redeemable convertible preferred stock, $001 par value, consisted of the

In Connection with the Company initial public offering in February
2000, all outstanding shares of preferred stock automatically converted into an
aggregate of 12,867,728 shares of the Company common stock. Prior to the
conversion, each share of preferred stock was convertible into 75 share of the
Company common stock. All holders of the preferred stock were also entitled to
dividends at the rate of 7% per year and were entitled to one vote for each
share of common stock into which the redeemable preferred stock was convertible.
7. COMMON STOCK
Each share of common stock entitles the holder to one vote on all matters
submitted to a vote of the Company stockholders. Common stockholders are
entitled to receive dividends, if any, as may be declared by the Board of
Directors, subject to any preferential dividend rights of the preferred
stockholders.
In June 1999, the Company increased the number of authorized shares of
common stock from 17,500,000 to 24,000,000 shares.
In December 1999, the Company increased the number of authorized shares of
common stock from 24,000,000 to 100,000,000 shares.
In January 2000, the Company authorized a 3-for-4 reverse split of its
common stock. As a result, all references to common stock share and per share
amounts, including options and warrants to purchase common stock, have been
retroactively restated to reflect the reverse split.
The Company had reserved 14,564,325 shares of common stock for the
conversion of the Series A, Series B, Series C, Series D, Series E and Series F
Preferred Stock and for the exercise of outstanding options at December 31,
1999. In February 2000, 12,867,728 shares of Preferred Stock were converted to
common stock upon the Company public offering. As of December 31, 2000, the
Company has reserved 3,817,802 shares of common stock for the exercise of
outstanding options.
Stock Restriction Agreements
The Company has entered into stock restriction agreements with certain
common stockholders. The agreements provide that in the event that any
individual who is a party to such agreement is no longer employed by the
Company, the Company may repurchase all shares that are not vested at the time
the individual ceases to be employed by the Company. These shares generally vest
over four years, as defined in the agreements. At December 31, 1999 and 2000,
approximately 1,267,626 and 846,248 shares of common stock, respectively, were
subject to repurchase.
8. STOCK OPTIONS
1995 Incentive Stock Option Plan
The 1995 Incentive Stock Option Plan the 1995 Plan provides for the
grant of incentive stock options and nonqualified stock options. The Board of
Directors is responsible for administration of the 1995 Plan. The Board of
Directors determines the term of each option, option exercise price, number of
shares for which each option is granted and the rate at which each option is
exercisable. Options generally vest ratably over four years. Options granted
under the 1995 Plan generally expire ten years from the date of the grant.
Nonqualified stock options may be granted to any officer, employee, director
or consultant at an exercise price per share as determined by the Company
Board of Directors.
In July 1998, the Company increased the number of options available for
grant under the 1995 Plan to 3,000,000.
In September 1999, the Company increased the number of options available for
grant under the 1995 Plan from 3,000,000 to 3,750,000. In December 1999, the
Company retired the 1995 Plan for future option grants.                    40
42
1999 Stock Incentive Plan
In December 1999, the Company adopted its 1999 Stock Incentive Plan the
1999 Plan and reserved 2,625,000 shares of common stock for issuance under
the 1999 Plan. In December 2000 an additional 375,000 shares were automatically
reserved for issuance under the 1999 Plan in accordance with the 1999 Plan
terms. The 1999 Plan authorizes the grant of incentive options and nonqualified
options and also provides for awards of stock appreciation rights, performance
shares, restricted stock and other stock-based awards.
Incentive options may be granted under the 1999 Plan to key employees of the
Company and its affiliates within the meaning of the Internal Revenue Code,
including officers and directors as well as officers and directors of the
Company affiliates who are also employees. The exercise price of incentive
options granted under the 1999 Plan must be at least equal to the fair market
value of the common stock on the date of grant. The exercise price of incentive
options granted to an optionee who owns stock possessing more than 10% of the
voting power of our outstanding capital stock must be at least equal to 110% of
the fair market value of the common stock on the date of grant, and such
optionee must exercise his or her option within five years from the date of the
grant of such option.
Additionally, the Company may grant nonqualified options to its officers and
other employees, directors, and other individuals providing services to the
Company. There are no limits on the exercise price of nonqualified options
granted under the 1999 Plan.
The 1999 Plan is administered by the compensation committee of the board of
directors. The compensation committee selects the individuals to whom options
will be granted and determines the option exercise price and other terms of each
award, subject to the provisions of the 1999 Plan.
Transactions under the 1995 Plan and the 1999 Plan for the years ended
December 31, 1998, 1999 and 2000 are summarized as follows                                       WEIGHTED

During the years ended December 31, 1999 and 2000, respectively, the Company
issued options to certain employees under the Plans with exercise prices below
the amount subsequently determined to be the fair market value of the common
stock at the date of grant for financial reporting purposes. In accordance with
the requirements of APB 25, the Company has recorded deferred compensation for
the differences between the exercise price of the options and the deemed fair
market value of the Company stock at the date of grant. This deferred
compensation is amortized to expense over the vesting periods, generally four
years.
As discussed in Note 2, the Company has adopted SFAS 123 through disclosure
only. Had compensation cost for the Company option plan been determined based
on the fair value of the options at the grant dates, as prescribed in SFAS 123,
the Company net loss and basic and diluted net loss per share on a pro forma
basis would have been as follows                               IN THOUSANDS, EXCEPT PER SHARE DATA

addition to the factors noted above, and because additional option grants are
expected to be made and options vest over several years, the above pro forma
disclosures are not representative of the pro forma effects on reported net
income or loss for future years.
2001 Nonqualified Stock Plan
In January 2001, the Company adopted its 2001 Nonqualified Stock Plan the
2001 Plan and reserved 1,000,000 shares of common stock for issuance under
the plan. The 2001 Plan authorizes the grant of nonqualified options.
The Company may grant nonqualified options to its officers and other
employees, directors, and other individuals providing services to the Company.
There are no limits on the exercise price of nonqualified options granted under
the 2001 Plan.
The 2001 Plan is administered by the compensation committee of the board
of directors. The compensation committee selects the individuals to whom options
will be granted and determines the option exercise price and other terms of each
award, subject to the provisions of the 2001 Plan. Under the 2001 Plan, no more
than forty-nine percent of the awards granted under the 2001 Plan may be granted
to directors and officers of NetGenesis.
1999 Employee Stock Purchase Plan
In December 1999, the Company adopted its 1999 Employee Stock Purchase Plan
the 1999 Purchase Plan and reserved 225,000 shares of common stock for
issuance under the plan. In December 2000 an additional 52,500 shares of common
stock were reserved for issuance under the 1999 Purchase Plan.
Under the terms of the 1999 Purchase Plan, all employees who have completed
three months of employment and whose customary employment is more than 20 hours
per week and more than five months in the calendar year are eligible to
participate in the 1999                    42

Purchase Plan. Employees who own stock and hold outstanding options to purchase
stock representing five percent or more of the total combined voting power or
value of all classes of the Company stock are not eligible to participate in
the 1999 Purchase Plan.
At the commencement of each designated payroll deduction period, or offering
period, an eligible employee may authorize the Company to deduct between 1% to
10%, in increments of 1%, of his or her base pay. On the last business day of
the offering period, the Company will deem the employee to have exercised the
option, at the exercise option price, to the extent of accumulated payroll
deductions. The purchase price will be 85% of the closing market price of the
common stock on either a the first business day of the offering period or b
the last business day of the offering period, whichever is lower.
As of December 31, 2000, 73,897 shares of common stock had been issued under
the 1999 Purchase Plan.
9. PUBLIC OFFERING
In February 2000, NetGenesis sold 4,887,500 shares of its common stock
through an initial public offering. Net proceeds from the offering were
approximately $803 million after deducting the underwriting discount and other
offering expenses. Immediately prior to the initial public offering, all of
NetGenesis' outstanding preferred stock automatically converted into 12,867,683
shares of common stock.
10. ACQUISITION AND INTANGIBLE ASSETS
On October 23, 2000, the Company completed the acquisition of e-dynamics
GmbH e-dynamics, an analytics consulting and distribution firm based in
Germany. The acquisition was accounted for under the purchase method of
accounting and is not significant to the Company financial position or results
of operations. Under the purchase method, the results of operations of acquired
companies are included prospectively from the date of acquisition, and the
acquisition cost is allocated to the acquirees' assets and liabilities based
upon the fair market values at the date of acquisition.
The Company purchased all of the outstanding shares of common stock of
e-dynamics for $12 million. An additional $800,000 will be due to the
principals of e-dynamics on October 23, 2001, subject to their retention. In
addition, the Company issued 177,777 unregistered shares of common stock vesting
over a period of two years, subject to the retention of e-dynamics employees. An
additional 76,190 unregistered shares of common stock were issued to the
principals of e-dynamics, vesting at December 31, 2001 based upon continued
employment. Additional consideration of up to $25 million worth of shares of
the Company common stock, which will be valued as of the issuance date, may be
earned over the next two years by the principals of e-dynamics through earnout
agreements based on revenue milestones in place for 2001 and 2002.
At December 31, 2000, the net book value of intangible assets associated
with the acquisition is $127 million. Amortization expense of intangible assets
for the year ended December 31, 2000 is $63,000. Intangible assets, consisting
of workforce and customer lists, are being amortized on an straight-line basis
over four years and are included in other assets. 11. INCOME TAXES
Deferred tax assets consist of the following                                     IN THOUSANDS

$ --      $                                            The Company has provided a full valuation allowance for the deferred tax
assets since it is more likely than not that these future benefits will not be
realized. If the Company achieves future profitability, a significant portion of
these deferred tax assets could be available to offset future income taxes.
At December 31, 2000, the Company has federal and state net operating loss
and research and development tax credit carryforwards of approximately
$50,663,000 and $1,544,000, respectively, available to reduce future federal and
state income taxes payable. The federal and state net operating loss
carryforwards are both equal to $50,663,000. The federal and state research and
development tax credit carryforwards are $811,000 and $733,000 respectively.
These net operating loss carryforwards and credits expire through 2020.
Certain substantial changes in the Company ownership occurred during 1997
and 1996. As a result, under the provisions of Section 382 of the Internal
Revenue Code, the amount of net operating loss carryforwards available annually
to offset future taxable income may be limited. The amount of this annual
limitation is determined based upon the Company value prior to the ownership
changes taking place. Subsequent significant ownership changes could further
affect the limitation in future years.
The net operating loss carryforwards of $50,663,000 include $38,000 of tax
deductions relating to stock options. The benefits of these deductions included
in net operating loss carryforwards will be credited to additional paid-in
capital when realized. 12. COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES
The Company leases its facilities, certain computer equipment and furniture
and fixtures under non-cancelable operating leases.
Future lease obligations as of December 31, 2000 are as follows                    43

reduction for future sublease rental income of approximately $384,000.
Rental expense under operating leases for the years ended December 31, 1998,
1999 and 2000 was $269,000, $658,000 and $997,000, respectively.
The Company is from time to time subject to legal proceedings and claims
which arise in the normal course of its business. In the opinion of management,
the amount of ultimate liability with respect to these actions will not have a
material adverse affect on the Company financial position or results of
operations.
Royalty Agreements
The Company maintains several agreements under which the Company has
obtained the right to use technology related to certain software developed by
others. In exchange, the Company is required to pay royalties as a fixed
percentage of software sales as stipulated in the royalty agreements. Royalty
expense of approximately $150,000, $121,000 and $614,000 was incurred for the
years ended December 31, 1998, 1999 and 2000, respectively.
13. NET LOSS PER COMMON SHARE
The following is a calculation of net loss per share   Basic and diluted net loss available to common stockholders per share is
computed using the weighted average number of common shares outstanding. Options
and warrants were not included in the computation of diluted net loss available
to common stockholders per share because the effect would be anti-dilutive.
Pro forma net loss per share has been computed as described above except
that it gives effect to the conversion of preferred stock outstanding as if the
conversion took place at the beginning of the period presented.                                            YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31,

these shares would have been anti-dilutive.
14. 401k PLAN
In January 1997, the Company adopted an employee savings and retirement plan
which covers all employees and is qualified under Section 401 of the Internal
Revenue Code. Employees may elect to make voluntary contributions to the 401k
plan, based on a percentage of their pretax earnings, up to the statutorily
prescribed annual limit. The Company may make matching or additional
contributions to the 401k plan in amounts determined annually by the Board of
Directors. Through December 31, 2000, the Company has made no contributions to
the 401k plan.
