principles generally accepted in the United States. In addition, in our opinion,
the financial statement schedule listed in the accompanying index presents
fairly, in all material respects, the information set forth therein when read in

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
NOTE 1 THE COMPANY AND SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES THE COMPANY
LJL BioSystems, Inc. the Company was incorporated in Delaware on
January 19, 1993 and is the surviving corporation of three commonly controlled
predecessor companies. In March 1998, the Company established a wholly owned
subsidiary, LJL BioSystems, Ltd., in the United Kingdom. The Company designs,
produces, and sells primarily to pharmaceutical and biotechnology firms
infrastructure products and, to a lesser extent, services that accelerate and
enhance the process of discovering new drugs. The Company proprietary
integrated technology platform is comprised of instrumentation and consumables
microplates and fluorescence-based assay technologies designed to provide
flexible solutions to the current and evolving high throughput requirements of
drug discovery laboratories. The Company operates in one business segment.
BASIS OF PRESENTATION
The accompanying consolidated financial statements include the accounts of
the Company and its wholly owned subsidiary. All significant intercompany
accounts and transactions have been eliminated on consolidation.
USE OF ESTIMATES
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally
accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and
assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and
disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial
statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the
reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.
INITIAL PUBLIC OFFERING
In April 1998, the Company completed an initial public offering of 2,088,000
shares of its common stock, raising net cash proceeds of $128 million. In
connection with the offering, all outstanding shares of mandatorily redeemable
convertible preferred stock were converted into 3,621,503 shares of the
Company common stock.
REVENUE RECOGNITION
Product sales are generally recognized upon shipment. Amounts received prior
to completion of the earnings process are recorded as customer deposits or
deferred revenue, as appropriate. Development agreements, which were completed
during 1997, were performed on a best effort basis and revenues were recognized
based on work performed using the percentage-of-completion method, completion
being measured using costs incurred to total estimated costs at completion.
CASH EQUIVALENTS
Cash equivalents consist of highly liquid investments, principally money
market accounts and marketable debt securities, with maturities of three months
or less at the time of purchase.
42
LJL BIOSYSTEMS, INC.
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED
NOTE 1 THE COMPANY AND SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES: CONTINUED
INVESTMENTS
The Company short-term and long-term investments consist of marketable
securities classified as available-for-sale. Available-for-sale securities are
carried at fair market value, with unrealized gains and losses; net of tax,
included in accumulated other comprehensive income in stockholders' equity.
Gains and losses on securities sold are based on the specific identification
method and are included in the results of operations.
Fair values of marketable securities are based on quoted market values at
December 31, 1999. At December 31, 1999, the difference between the fair value
and amortized cost of marketable securities was not significant. As of December
31, 1999, marketable securities consisted of U.S. government securities and
corporate securities maturing within twelve months or less.
COMPREHENSIVE INCOME
The Company adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 130
SFAS 130, Reporting Comprehensive Income, during 1998. Under SFAS 130, the
Company is required to display comprehensive income and its components as part
of the Company consolidated financial statements. The measurement and
presentation of net income loss did not change. Comprehensive income is
comprised of net income loss and other comprehensive income. Other
comprehensive income includes certain changes in the equity of the Company that
are excluded from net income loss. Specifically, SFAS 130 requires unrealized
gains and losses on the Company available-for-sale securities and foreign
currency translation adjustments, which otherwise would have been reported
separately in stockholders' equity, to be included in accumulated other
comprehensive income. Comprehensive income loss for the years ended
December 31, 1999 and 1998 has been reflected in the Consolidated Statement of
Stockholders' Equity Deficit.
CONCENTRATIONS OF CREDIT RISK AND SIGNIFICANT CUSTOMERS
Financial instruments, which potentially subject the Company to
concentrations of credit risk, are primarily cash, cash equivalents, short-term
investments, loans receivable from employees and accounts receivable. The
Company deposits cash with high credit quality financial institutions. The
Company cash equivalents and marketable securities are primarily invested in
federal government agency obligations and corporate securities that have various
maturities during 2000. The Company has issued a loan to an executive officer as
part of the terms of his employment agreement. The executive home and shares
of the Company common stock secure the loan.
The Company accounts receivable are derived from revenue earned from
customers located in the U.S., the United Kingdom and Japan. Generally, the
Company requires no collateral on trade receivables. The Company performs
ongoing credit evaluations of its customers' financial condition and provides
for expected losses; however, such amounts have not been significant. At
December 31, 1999, amounts due from one customer represented 43% of gross trade
receivables, amounts due from another customer represented 13% of gross trade
receivables and amounts due from another customer represented 10% of gross trade
receivables. At December 31, 1998, amounts due from one customer represented 25%
of gross trade receivables and amounts due from four other customers each
represented 13% of gross trade

receivables. As a percentage of total revenues, product sales and revenues
recognized under development agreements from individual customers in excess of
10% of total revenues were as follows                                YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31,

Becton Dickinson and    --      --      10 INVENTORIES
Inventories are stated at the lower of cost, determined using the first-in,
first-out method, or market.
CAPITALIZED SOFTWARE COSTS
Software development costs incurred subsequent to the establishment of
technological feasibility are capitalized in accordance with Statement of
Financial Standards No. 86; Accounting for the Costs of Computer Software to Be
Sold, Leased, or Otherwise Marketed. Amortization of capitalized software
development costs is the greater of the amount computed using a the ratio of
current revenues to the total of current and anticipated future revenues or
b the straight-line method over the estimated economic life of the product. No
amounts have been capitalized to date.
PROPERTY AND EQUIPMENT
Property and equipment is recorded at cost. Depreciation and amortization
are computed using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of
the assets, generally ranging from three to five years, or the lease term of the
respective assets. Maintenance and repairs are expensed as incurred.
LONG-LIVED ASSETS
The Company identifies and records impairment losses on long-lived assets
when events and circumstances indicate that the assets might be impaired. No
such events have occurred with respect to the Company long-lived assets, which
consist primarily of property and equipment and leasehold improvements.
RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT EXPENSE
Research and development costs are expensed as incurred and consist of costs
incurred for internally funded research and development activities and
development agreements. These amounts include direct costs and research-related
overhead expenses. Research and development expenses under development
agreements were $316,000 in 1997.
INCOME TAXES
Prior to June 6, 1997, the Company elected to be treated as an S corporation
for federal and California income tax purposes. As a result, little or no
federal or state income taxes were payable at the corporate level. Rather, the
Company stockholders included their respective portions of the Company
44
LJL BIOSYSTEMS, INC.
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED
NOTE 1 THE COMPANY AND SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES: CONTINUED
taxable income in their individual income tax returns. On June 6, 1997, in
connection with the preferred stock financing, the Company became subject to the
C corporation provisions of the Internal Revenue Code. Accordingly, any earnings
after this date are taxed at federal and state corporate income tax rates. Upon
termination of the Company S corporation status, the S corporation accumulated
deficit of $742,000 was transferred to additional paid-in capital.
The Company uses the asset and liability approach for accounting for income
taxes which requires the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for
the expected future tax consequences of events recognized in the Company
consolidated financial statements or income tax returns. Deferred tax assets are
recognized, net of any valuation allowance, for deductible temporary
differences, net operating losses and tax credit carryforwards when their
realization is considered more likely than not. Deferred tax expense represents
the change in the deferred tax asset and liability balances.
FOREIGN CURRENCY
The U.S. dollar is the functional currency of the Company UK subsidiary.
Monetary and non-monetary assets and liabilities are remeasured into U.S.
dollars at period end and historical exchange rates, respectively. Sales and
expenses are remeasured at average exchange rates in effect during each period,
except for these expenses related to non-monetary assets which are remeasured at
historical exchange rates. Gains or losses resulting from foreign currency
transactions are included in net loss and were not material.
SEGMENT REPORTING
In 1998, the Company adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No.
131 SFAS 131, Disclosures about Segments of an Enterprise and Related
Information. SFAS 131 requires use of the management approach, which
designates the internal organization that is used by management for making
operating decisions and assessing performance as the source of reportable
segments. SFAS 131 also requires disclosures about products and services,
geographic areas, and major customers. The adoption of SFAS 131 did not have a
material effect on the consolidated financial statements or notes thereto. At
December 31, 1999, 97% of the Company total assets were held domestically and
the Company earned 69% of its fiscal 1999 sales from domestic customers. At
December 31, 1998, 98% of the Company total assets were held domestically and
the Company earned 91% of its fiscal 1998 sales from domestic customers. During
1997, 100% of the Company assets and sales, were domestic.
STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION
The Company has adopted the pro forma disclosure requirements of Statement
of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123 SFAS 123, Accounting for
Stock-Based Compensation. As permitted, the Company continues to recognize
stock-based compensation under the intrinsic value method of accounting as
prescribed by Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 25. The pro forma effects

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED
NOTE 1 THE COMPANY AND SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES: CONTINUED
BASIC AND DILUTED NET INCOME LOSS PER SHARE AVAILABLE TO COMMON STOCKHOLDERS
Basic earnings per share is computed using the weighted average number of
common shares outstanding during the period. Diluted earnings per share is
computed using the weighted average number of common and potential common shares
outstanding during the period. Potential common shares consist of the
incremental common shares issuable upon conversion of outstanding convertible
preferred stock using the if-converted method and shares issuable upon the
exercise of stock options and warrants using the treasury stock method.
Potential common shares are excluded from the computation if their effect is
anti-dilutive, as was the case for the years ended December 31, 1999, 1998 and
1997. For the years ended December 31, 1998 and 1997, the net loss available to
common stockholders includes $254,000 and $636,000, respectively, to reflect
accretion of the mandatorily redeemable convertible preferred stock redemption
value.
Shares excluded from the computation of diluted net loss per share include

NOTE 3 LONG-TERM DEBT   In September 1995, September 1996 and June 1997, the Company entered into
equipment loan agreements with a bank related to the purchase of equipment and
software. The loans, which were collateralized by the related equipment and
software and by personal guarantees by the Company stockholders, bore interest
at 1020% to 1185% per annum and were repaid in full in March 1998.
In February 1998, the Company entered into an equipment financing agreement
that provided a $13 million line of credit that was used to finance the
purchases of equipment, computers and software necessary to support the
Company CRITERION product line development effort and additions to the
marketing, sales and administrative infrastructure. The initial term of this
agreement was through February 16, 1999. Amounts borrowed under this agreement
bear interest at 1108% to 1216%. The agreement was extended twice with the
latest extension expiring on December 31, 1999. At December 31, 1999, the
Company had an obligation to repay $868,000 under this agreement through 2003.
Future principal payments under this line of credit are as follows YEAR ENDING DECEMBER 31

NOTE 4 INCOME TAXES   The provision for income taxes for the year ended December 31, 1997 reflects
S corporation taxes imposed in California at the statutory rate of 15% of
taxable income, adjusted for nondeductible items. On June 6, 1997, the Company
became subject to the C corporation provisions of the Internal Revenue Code. No
provision for income taxes relating to the US operation of the Company has been
recognized for periods subsequent to June 6, 1997, as the Company incurred net
operating losses for income tax purposes and has no carryback potential. During
1999, the Company recorded a provision for foreign income taxes relating to its
UK subsidiary.
The significant components of deferred tax assets and liabilities are as

Net deferred tax  $    --  $                                    Due to incurring ongoing operating losses, management believes that there is
sufficient uncertainty regarding the realization of deferred tax assets such
that a full valuation allowance is appropriate.
At December 31, 1999, the Company had federal and state net operating loss
carryforwards of approximately $18 million and $9 million, respectively,
available to reduce future taxable income, which expire from 2003 to 2020. The
Company ability to utilize net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards may
be subject to limitation as set forth in applicable federal and state tax laws.
As specified in the Internal Revenue Code, an ownership change of more than 50%
during any three-year period would result in certain annual limitations on the
Company ability to utilize its net operating loss and tax credit
carryforwards.
NOTE 5 MANDATORILY REDEEMABLE CONVERTIBLE PREFERRED STOCK   In May and June 1997, the Company amended its Certificate of Incorporation
to authorize a total of 7,400,000 shares of preferred stock for future issuance.
In June 1997, the Company completed a private placement of 3,621,503 shares of
Series A mandatorily redeemable convertible preferred stock the Series A for
$260 per share, resulting in cash proceeds of $8,672,000, net of issuance costs
of $744,000.
The Series A stockholders were entitled to annual dividends at a rate of
$0312 per share subject to adjustment for dilution or stock splits. Such
dividends were noncumulative and were payable when and if declared by the Board
of Directors provided, however, that such dividends would be deemed to be
accrued and cumulatively payable upon the redemption of the Series A shares or a
liquidation or dissolution of the Company. Accordingly, such amounts were
accreted to the carrying value of the Series A shares with a corresponding
charge to accumulated deficit. The Series A shares were converted into 3,621,503
shares of common stock in connection with the Company initial public offering
in March 1998.

NOTE 6 STOCKHOLDERS' EQUITY   The Company has the right to repurchase, at the original issuance price,
certain of the shares of common stock issued to employees and directors under
restricted stock agreements. The Company repurchase right lapses over four
years based on the length of the individual service with the Company. At
December 31, 1999, 45,000 shares of common stock were subject to repurchase by
the Company.
In connection with the Series A private placement in June 1997, the Company
issued to the placement agent two warrants to purchase a total of 65,653 shares
of Series A at an exercise price of $520 per share. The warrants originally
were to expire on the earlier of June 6, 2002, the closing of an initial public
offering of the Company common stock pursuant to a registration statement
under the Securities Act of 1993 or a merger or sale of substantially all of the
Company assets and were exercisable immediately. In March 1998, the terms of
the warrants were amended such that the warrants are now exercisable to purchase
65,653 shares of the Company common stock at an exercise price of $700 per
share and expire in 2001. The Company determined that the value of the amended
warrants was not material.
In connection with entering into a line of credit agreement with a leasing
company in February 1998, the Company issued a warrant to purchase up to 13,290
shares of the Company common stock at $538. The actual number of shares to be
issued under the warrant was based on 55% of the borrowings against the line of
credit divided by the exercise price of $538 and was determined during 1999 to
be 10,312 shares of the Company common stock, none of which were exercised as
of December 31, 1999. The warrant will expire in February 2002. The Company
determined that the value of this warrant was not material.
At December 31, 1999, the Company had two million shares of preferred stock
authorized, of which no shares were issued or outstanding.
NOTE 7 EQUITY INCENTIVE PLANS   In January 1994, the Company adopted the 1994 Equity Incentive Plan the
1994 Plan under which 499,500 shares of the Company common stock were
reserved for issuance to employees, directors and consultants of the Company, as
approved by the Board of Directors. On March 14, 1997, the Company reduced the
number of shares reserved for issuance under the 1994 Plan to 479,250. The 1994
Plan, which expires in 2004, provides for the grant of incentive as well as
nonstatutory stock options, stock bonuses, stock appreciation rights and
restricted stock purchase rights.
In March 1997, the Company adopted the 1997 Stock Plan the 1997 Plan. As
amended, 2,520,750 shares of the Company common stock have been reserved for
issuance to employees, directors and consultants of the Company under the 1997
Plan. The 1997 Plan, which expires in 2007, provides for the grant of incentive
as well as nonstatutory stock options and restricted stock purchase rights.
Options granted under the 1994 Plan and the 1997 Plan are for terms not to
exceed ten years. If the option is granted to a stockholder who owns more than
10% of the Company outstanding stock, the term may not exceed five years and
the exercise price of the stock option must be at least 110% of the fair market
value of the stock at the date of grant. Exercise prices of incentive stock
options granted to all other persons are generally equal to at least 100% of the
fair market value of the stock at the date of grant. For nonstatutory stock
options granted to all other persons, the exercise price under the 1994 Plan and
the 1997 Plan is generally equal to at least 50% or 85%, respectively, of the
fair market value of the stock at the date of grant. Options under the plans
generally vest over a five-year period.

NOTE 7 EQUITY INCENTIVE PLANS: CONTINUED
The term of restricted stock purchase rights granted under the 1997 Plan is
thirty days, after which unaccepted stock purchase rights expire. If the stock
purchase right is granted to a stockholder who owns stock representing more than
10% of the total combined voting power of all classes of stock of the Company,
the exercise price is generally at least equal to 100% of the fair market value
of the stock on the date of grant. The exercise price of stock purchase rights
granted to all other persons is generally equal to at least 85% of the fair
market value of the stock on the date of grant. There were no unaccepted
restricted stock purchase rights outstanding at December 31, 1999.
On December 16, 1997, the Board of Directors adopted the 1998 Employee Stock
Purchase Plan the 1998 Purchase Plan and the 1998 Directors' Plan and
reserved 300,000 and 150,000 shares of common stock, respectively, for issuance
under these plans, which were approved by the stockholders in February 1998. The
1998 Purchase Plan, which is intended to qualify under Section 423 of the
Internal Revenue Code, permits eligible employees to purchase common stock
through payroll deductions at a purchase price equal to 85% of the fair market
value of the Company common stock at the beginning or end of the offering
period, whichever is less. During 1999, 39,522 shares were issued under the 1998
Purchase Plan. The 1998 Directors' Plan provides for certain automatic grants of
nonstatutory stock options to nonemployee directors of the Company. Options
granted under the 1998 Directors' Plan vest over four years, have a term of ten
years and are granted at exercise prices equal to the fair market value of the
Company common stock on the date of grant.

Deferred compensation is recorded when the exercise price of an option is
less than the deemed fair value of the underlying stock on the date of grant.
From inception through June 1997, all stock options were granted at exercise
prices that equaled the estimated fair value of the underlying stock on the
respective grant dates. In August 1997, the Company granted options to purchase
a total of 75,000 shares of common stock at an exercise price of $100 per
share. Deferred compensation of approximately $56,000 was recorded on these
options, based on the deemed fair value of the common stock on the date of grant
of $175 per share. In October 1997, the Company granted options to purchase
24,500 shares of common stock at an exercise price of $100 per share.
Additional deferred compensation of approximately $123,000 was recorded based on
a deemed fair value of $600 per share on the date of grant. Additionally, in
October 1997 the Company granted to a consultant options to purchase 7,500
shares of the Company common stock at an exercise price of $100 per share,
resulting in additional deferred compensation of $40,000 based on the estimated
fair value of the options granted. In December 1997, the Company granted rights
to purchase 45,000 shares of restricted common stock at an exercise price of
$200 per share and options to purchase 30,250 shares of common stock at an
exercise price of $200 per share. Additional deferred compensation of
approximately $553,000 related to these grants was recorded based on a deemed
fair value of the common stock of $935 per share on the date of grant. On
March 10, 1998, the Company granted an option to an employee to purchase 15,000
shares of the Company common stock at a price 15% below fair market value at
the date of the grant. Deferred compensation of $33,600 was recorded based on
the estimated fair value of the options granted. Deferred compensation is
amortized over the vesting period of the options, generally four to five years.
In December 1997, the Company also granted fully vested options to employees
to purchase 75,000 shares of common stock at exercise prices of $200 to $220
per share, in lieu of cash bonuses. Compensation expense of $547,000 related to
these options, based on a deemed fair value of the common stock on the date of
grant of $935 per share, was recognized in 1997.
Stock compensation expense for options granted to consultants has been
determined using the Black-Scholes option pricing model to measure the fair
value of the option. The fair value of such options is periodically remeasured
as the options vest.
The Company accounts for issuances of stock options to employees in
accordance with the provisions of Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 25.

been determined based on the fair value of the options at the dates of grant, as
prescribed in SFAS 123, the Company pro forma net income loss for the years
ended December 31, 1999, 1998 and 1997 would have included additional stock
compensation expense of $394,000, $286,000 and $10,000, respectively. The fair
value of each option has been estimated on the date of grant using the
Black-Scholes option pricing model for all options granted after the effective
date of the Company initial public offering on March 13, 1998 and using the
minimum value method for options granted prior to the initial public offering.
The following assumptions were used in computing the fair value of options
granted: dividend yield of 00% for 1999, 1998 and 1997; risk-free interest
rates of 46% to 64% for 1999, 44% to 57% for 1998, and 63% to 65% for
1997; volatility of 90% for options granted in 1999, volatility of 84% for
options granted after the effective date of the Company initial public
offering on March 13, 1998 through December 31, 1998; and a weighted average
expected option term of four years for 1999 and 1998 and 1997.
Additional option grants are expected to be made beyond 1999. Accordingly,
pro forma disclosures may differ significantly from the reported results of
operations in the future.
At December 31, 1999, the Company had 2,723,637 shares of common stock
reserved for future issuance upon the exercise of stock options and common stock
purchase warrants.
