NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
1. ORGANIZATION AND SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
Mattson Technology, Inc. the Company or Mattson was incorporated in
California on November 18, 1988. In September 1997, the Company was
reincorporated in the State of Delaware. As part of the reincorporation, each
outstanding share of the California corporation, no par value common stock,
was converted automatically to one share of the new Delaware corporation 0001 par value common stock.
The Company designs, manufactures and markets advanced fabrication
equipment to the semiconductor manufacturing industry worldwide.
Basis of Presentation
The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company
and its subsidiaries. All significant intercompany accounts and transactions
have been eliminated. The preparation of financial statements in conformity
with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make
estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and
liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of
the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses
during the reported periods. Actual results could differ from those estimates.
The Company fiscal year ends on December 31. The Company fiscal
quarters end on the last Sunday in the calendar quarter.
Cash and Cash Equivalents
For purposes of the statement of cash flows, the Company considers all
highly liquid instruments with an original maturity of three months or less to
be cash equivalents. Cash equivalents consist primarily of money market funds.
Restricted Cash
At December 31, 2000 the company had $320 million of restricted cash
invested in Certificates of Deposit. This restricted cash collateralizes
Letters of Credit issued in connection with the January 1, 2001 acquisition of
certain subsidiaries of STEAG Electronic Systems AG see Note 14.
Investments
Investments primarily consist of commercial paper and U.S. Treasury
securities. The Company classifies its investments in commercial paper and
U.S. Treasury securities as available-for-sale and the investments are
reported at fair market value. As of December 31, 2000, the fair value of the
investments in commercial paper and U.S. Treasury securities approximated
amortized cost and, as such, unrealized holding gains and losses were not
significant. The fair value of the Company investments was determined based
on quoted market prices at the reporting date for those instruments.
Investments with a contractual maturity of one year or less are classified as
short-term on the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. Contractual
maturities for long-term investments range from January 2002 to June 2002.
Realized gains on the sale of these investments for the year ended December
31, 2000 were not significant.
Inventories
Inventories are stated at the lower of standard cost, which approximates
actual cost, using the first-in, first-out method, or market, and includes
material, labor and manufacturing overhead costs.
46          MATTSON TECHNOLOGY, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS--Continued Property and Equipment
Property and equipment are stated at cost. Depreciation is computed using
the straight-line method based upon the estimated useful lives of the assets,
which range from three to five years. Leasehold improvements are amortized
using the straight-line method over the term of the related lease or the
estimated useful lives of the improvements, whichever is less. Depreciation
expenses were $42 million, $38 million, and $38 million for the years ended
December 31, 2000, 1999 and 1998 respectively.
Long-Lived Assets
Mattson reviews long-lived assets and identifiable intangible assets for
impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the
carrying amount of these assets may not be recoverable. Mattson assesses these
assets for impairment based on estimated future cash flows from these assets.
The company did not record an impairment loss for the years ended December 31,
2000, 1999 and 1998.
Intangible Assets
Purchased technology and workforce are presented at cost, net of
accumulated amortization, and are being amortized using the straight-line
method over their estimated useful lives of three to seven years. Amortization
expenses were $09 million, $10 million and $06 million for the years ended
December 31, 2000, 1999 and 1998, respectively.
Stock-Based Compensation
In October 1995, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Statement
of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123, Accounting for Stock-Based
Compensation. As allowed by the provisions of SFAS No. 123, the Company has
continued to apply APB Opinion No. 25 in accounting for its stock option plans
and, accordingly, does not recognize compensation cost because the exercise
price equals the market price of the underlying stock at the date of grant.
The Company has adopted the disclosure only provisions of SFAS No. 123 and
Note 6 to the Consolidated Financial Statements contains a summary of the pro
forma effects to reported net income loss and earnings loss per share for
the years ended December 31, 2000, 1999 and 1998 for compensation cost based
on the fair value of the options granted at the grant date as prescribed by
SFAS No. 123. In April 2000, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued
FIN 44, Accounting for Certain Transactions Involving Stock Compensation: An
Interpretation of APB No. 25. The Company has adopted the Provisions of FIN
44 and such adoption did not materially impact the Company result of
operations.
Revenue Recognition
Mattson derives revenue from two primary sources- equipment sales and spare
part sales. In December 1999, the Securities and Exchange Commission issued
Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 101 SAB 101, Revenue Recognition in Financial
Statements. The Company implemented the provisions of SAB 101 in the fourth
quarter of 2000, retroactive to January 1, 2000. The Company previously
recognized revenue from the sales of its products generally upon shipment.
Effective January 1, 2000, the Company changed its method of accounting for
equipment sales to recognize the corresponding revenues as follows: 1. for
equipment sales of existing products with new specifications or acceptance
clauses to a new customer, and for all sales of new products, revenue is
recognized upon customer acceptance; 2. for equipment sales to existing
customers, who have purchased the same equipment with the same customer
specified and previously demonstrated acceptance provisions, the lesser of the
fair value of the equipment or the contractual amount billable upon shipment
is recorded as revenue upon title transfer. The remainder is recorded as
deferred revenue and recognized as revenue upon customer acceptance. From time
to time, however, the Company allows customers to evaluate systems                    47          MATTSON TECHNOLOGY, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS--Continued
and since customers can return such systems at any time with limited or no
penalty, the Company does not recognize revenues until these evaluation
systems are accepted by the customer. Revenues associated with sales to the
Company customers in Japan are recognized upon customer acceptance. Revenue
recognition for spare part sales has generally not changed under the
provisions of SAB 101. In all cases, revenue is only recognized when
persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, delivery has occurred or
services have been rendered, the seller price is fixed or determinable and
collectibility is reasonably assured. The cumulative effect of the change in
accounting principle of $81 million or $38 per diluted share is reported
as a charge in the quarter ended March 31, 2000. The cumulative effect of the
change in accounting principle includes system revenue, cost of sales and
certain expenses, including warranty and commission expenses that will be
recognized when the conditions for revenue recognition are met.
Service and maintenance contract revenue, which to date has been
insignificant, is recognized on a straight-line basis over the service period
of the related contract.
Warranty
The Company offers a 36 month warranty on all of its systems sold after
January 1996, other than the EpiPro 5000 system and any systems sold in Japan,
which carry a 12 month warranty. A provision for the estimated cost of
warranty is recorded at the time of revenue recognition.
Comprehensive Income
In 1998, the Company adopted SFAS No. 130, Reporting Comprehensive
Income. SFAS No. 130 establishes standards for disclosure and financial
statement presentation for reporting total comprehensive income and its
individual components. Comprehensive income, as defined, includes all changes
in equity during a period from non-owner sources. The Company comprehensive
income includes net income, foreign currency translation adjustments and
unrealized gains and losses on investments and is presented in the statement
of stockholders' equity.
Forward Foreign Exchange Contracts
The Company uses forward foreign exchange contracts primarily to hedge the
short-term impact of foreign currency fluctuations of intercompany accounts
payable denominated in U.S. dollars recorded by its Japanese subsidiary. The
maturities of all forward foreign exchange contracts are generally short-term
in nature. Because the impact of movements in currency exchange rates on
forward foreign exchange contracts offset the related impact on the underlying
items being hedged, these financial instruments do not subject the Company to
speculative risks that would otherwise result from changes in currency
exchange rates. Gains and losses on forward foreign exchange contracts are
deferred and recognized in the Consolidated Statements of Operations when the
related transactions being hedged are recognized. To date, premiums paid for
forward exchange contracts have not been material.
The estimated fair value of forward foreign exchange contracts with a
notional amount of $217 million that are not carried on the Company
Consolidated Balance Sheets, was $15 million at December 31, 2000.
Foreign Currency Accounting
The local currency is the functional currency for all foreign operations.
Accordingly, all assets and liabilities of these foreign operations are
translated using exchange rates in effect at the end of the period, and
revenues and costs are translated using average exchange rates for the period.
Gains or losses from translation of foreign operations where the local
currencies are the functional currency are included as a component of
stockholders' equity. Foreign currency transaction gains and losses are
recognized in the statements of operations and have not been material.
48          MATTSON TECHNOLOGY, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS--Continued Net Income Loss Per Share
Basic earnings per share EPS is computed by dividing income available to
common stockholders numerator by the weighted average number of common
shares outstanding denominator for the period. Diluted EPS gives effect to
all dilutive potential common shares outstanding during the period. The
computation of diluted EPS uses the average market prices during the period.
Segment Reporting
In June 1997, the FASB issued SFAS No. 131, Disclosure about Segments of
an Enterprise and Related Information. SFAS No. 131 changes the way companies
report selected segment information in annual financial statements and also
requires companies to report selected segment information in interim financial
reports. The Company operates in one reportable segment. Note 11 of the
Consolidated Financial Statements contains a summary table of industry
segment, geographic and customer information.
SFAS No. 133 Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities
In June 1998, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Statement of
Financial Accounting Standards No. 133, Accounting for Derivative Instruments
and Hedging Activities. SFAS 133 establishes new standards of accounting and
reporting for derivative instruments and hedging activities. SFAS 133 requires
that all derivatives be recognized at fair value in the statement of financial
position, and that the corresponding gains or losses be reported either in the
statement of operations or as a component of comprehensive income, depending
on the type of hedging relationship that exists. SFAS 133 is effective for
fiscal years beginning after June 15, 2000 and cannot be applied
retroactively. The required implementation date of the standard was delayed by
the issuance of Statement of Financial Accounting Standard No. 137 and amended
by Statement of Financial Accounting Standard No. 138. The Company adopted the
standards in the first quarter of 2001. The impact of the adoption is not
expected to be significant to the company results of operations.
Reclassifications
Certain amounts presented in previous years have been reclassified to
conform to the 2000 presentation.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS--Continued 2. ACQUISITIONS
On July 24, 1998, the Company completed the acquisition of Concept Systems
Design, Inc., a supplier of epitaxial systems. The merger was accounted for
using the purchase method at a purchase price of $4,689,000, which included
$650,000 of estimated acquisition-related costs. In connection with the
merger, the Company issued 795,138 shares of its common stock to the former
stockholders of Concept. The purchase price was allocated to assets acquired
and liabilities assumed based on the fair value of Concept current assets
and liabilities, which approximated their book value, the estimated fair value
of property and equipment and an independent appraisal for all other
identifiable assets. The excess of the purchase price over the net tangible
and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed was allocated to
goodwill. The allocation of the purchase price was as follows in thousands                                   
Property and  $ 3,055
Current and other   4,041
Liabilities  13,570
Acquired developed technology and   5,300
1,643
Acquired in-process research and   4,220
$ 4,689
In the first quarter of 1999, a preacquisition contingency was resolved
which reduced the liabilities assumed from Concept by approximately $22
million. Under the provisions of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards
No. 38, this has been recorded by the Company in the first quarter of 1999 on
a prospective basis as an elimination of previously recorded goodwill and a
pro-rata reduction of the balance to the acquired developed technology,
workforce and property and equipment. The acquired developed technology and
workforce are recorded on the balance sheet as intangibles and other assets
and is amortized on a straight line basis over periods ranging from 3 to 7
years. The acquired in-process research and development was expensed at the
time of acquisition as a one time charge.
See note 14 for a description of further acquisitions subsequent to the
reporting period.
3. LINE OF CREDIT
During 1999 the Company entered into a one-year revolving line of credit
with a bank in the amount of $150 million. This line of credit expired in
July 2000. All borrowings under this line of credit bore interest at a per
annum rate equal to the lender prime rate. The line of credit was secured by
our accounts receivable and other tangible assets. During the third quarter of
1999 the Company had borrowed $30 million against this revolving line of
credit. The outstanding balance was fully repaid during the first quarter of
2000. The revolving credit line required the Company to maintain certain
quarterly financial covenants, including a minimum quick ratio and minimum
tangible net worth. The Company was in compliance with all of its financial
covenants throughout the tenure of the line of credit.
4. STOCKHOLDER AND EMPLOYEE LOANS
During the second quarter of 2000, the Company extended a loan to Brad
Mattson, our chief executive officer, in the amount of $200,000. The interest
rate on the loan is 6%. The repayment of the loan is due in the first quarter
of 2001. At December 31, 2000 the Company had loans receivable from other
employees of $09 million. The interest rates on these loans are from 55% to
6%. The loans are due in 2001.

Common Stock
In 1998, the Board of Directors authorized the Company to repurchase up to
1,000,000 shares of the Company Common Stock in the open market. As of
December 31, 1999, the Company had repurchased 274,800 of these shares, and
none were repurchased during 1999 or 2000. The purpose of the repurchase
program is to acquire shares to fund our stock based employee benefit
programs, including our employee stock purchase plan and our stock option
plan. The Company does not intend to repurchase any additional shares of its
stock under this repurchase program. The total cost of share repurchases was
$2,987,000 and these shares are held as treasury stock.
51          MATTSON TECHNOLOGY, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS--Continued  On March 8, 2000 the Company completed its secondary public offering of
3,000,000 shares of its common stock. The public offering price was $4250 per
share. On March 16, 2000, the underwriters exercised a right to purchase an
additional 90,000 shares to cover over-allotments. The Company expects to use
the net proceeds of $1228 million for general corporate purposes, principally
working capital and capital expenditures.
Stock Option Plan
In September 1989, the Company adopted an incentive and non-statutory stock
option plan under which a total of 6,400,000 shares of Common Stock have been
reserved for future issuance, including increases of 1,000,000 shares in 1996,
300,000 shares in 1997, 250,000 shares in 1998, 1,125,000 shares in 1999, and
2,100,000 shares in 2000. Options granted under this Plan are for periods not
to exceed ten years. Incentive stock option and non-statutory stock option
grants under the Plan must be at prices at least 100% and 85%, respectively,
of the fair market value of the stock on the date of grant. The options
generally vest 25% one year from the date of grant, with the remaining vesting
1/36th per month thereafter. In November 2000, the number of shares reserved
for issuance under Mattson amended and restated 1989 stock option plan was
increased by 750,000 and by an additional 1,350,000 shares in connection with
the strategic business combination with the STEAG Semiconductor Division and
CFM Note 14.

all employees, other than executive officers, could elect to cancel certain
options in exchange for grants of new options with exercise prices which were
equal to the fair value of the Company Common Stock on the date of the
Board approval and for which a new four year vesting period commenced as of
the new date of grant. Employees canceled options for the purchase of a total
of 681,315 shares at exercise prices ranging from $341 to $2450, in exchange
for newly issued options with an exercise price of $600 per share, which was
the fair market value on the date of the Board approval.

In August 1994, the Company adopted an employee stock purchase plan under
which 1,925,000 shares of Common Stock have been reserved for future issuance,
including an increase of 65,000 in 1996, 400,000 shares in 1997, 450,000
shares in 1998 and 475,000 shares in 1999. In November 2000, the shares
reserved for issuance under the 1994 Employee Stock Purchase Plan were
increased by 250,000 shares. The Purchase Plan is administered generally over
offering periods of 24 months, with each offering period divided into four
consecutive six-month purchase periods beginning May 1 and November 1 of each
year. Eligible employees may designate not more than 15% of their cash
compensation to be deducted each pay period for the purchase of Common Stock
under the employee stock purchase plan and participants may not purchase more
than $25,000 worth of Common Stock in any calendar year or 10,000 shares in
any offering period. On the last business day of each purchase period, shares
of Common Stock are purchased with the employees' payroll deductions
accumulated during the six months, at a price per share of 85% of the market
price of the Common Stock on the date immediately preceding the offering date
or the date immediately preceding the purchase date, whichever is lower.
The weighted average fair value on the grant date of rights granted under
the employee stock purchase plan was approximately $315 in 2000, $315 in
1999, and $342 in 1998.
Compensation cost under SFAS No. 123 is calculated for the estimated fair
value of the employees' stock purchase rights using the Black-Scholes option-
pricing model with the following average assumptions                             2000   1999  1998

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS--Continued Pro Forma Effect of Stock Based Compensation Plans
In accordance with the provisions of SFAS No. 123, the Company applies APB
Opinion No. 25 in accounting for its incentive stock option and employee stock
purchase plans, and accordingly, does not recognize compensation cost in the
statement of operations because the exercise price of the stock options equals
the market price of the underlying stock on the date of grant. If the Company
had elected to recognize compensation cost based on the fair value of the
options granted at grant date as prescribed by SFAS No. 123, net income loss
and income loss per share would have been adjusted to the pro forma amounts
indicated in the table below                           Year Ended December 31,

be representative of that to be expected in future years.

The deferred tax assets valuation allowance at December 31, 2000 and 1999
is attributable to federal and state deferred tax assets. Management believes
that sufficient uncertainty exists with regard to the realizability of certain
tax assets such that a valuation allowance is necessary, but that $64 million
is realizable in the current year via carryback claim potential and future
profitability. Factors considered in providing a valuation allowance include
the lack of a significant history of consistent profits and the lack of full
carryback capacity to realize these assets. Based on this absence of objective
evidence, management is unable to assert that it is more likely than not that
the Company will generate sufficient taxable income to realize all the
Company net deferred tax assets. At December 31, 2000, the Company had
Federal net operating loss carryforwards of approximately $26 million which
expire in 2011. The entire $26 million are net operating loss carryforwards
from the acquisition of Concept which are generally limited to a utilization
of approximately $2 million per year. The deferred tax assets related to the
acquisition of Concept, approximately $10 million as of December 31, 2000, if
and when realized will be used to reduce the amount of goodwill and
intangibles recorded at the date of acquisition. Federal and state research
and development credit carryforwards of approximately $14 million are also
available to reduce future Federal and state income taxes through 2020. If
certain substantial changes in the Company ownership occur, there would be
an additional annual limitation on the amount of the net operating loss
carryforwards which can be utilized.
8. EMPLOYEE BENEFIT PLANS
Retirement/Savings Plan
The Company has a retirement/savings plan, which qualifies as a thrift plan
under section 401k of the Internal Revenue Code. All employees who are
twenty-one years of age or older are eligible to participate in the
55          MATTSON TECHNOLOGY, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS--Continued
Plan. The Plan allows participants to contribute up to 20% of the total
compensation that would otherwise be paid to the participant, not to exceed
the amount allowed by the applicable Internal Revenue Service guidelines. The
Company may make a discretionary matching contribution equal to a percentage
of the participant contributions. In 2000, the Company made a matching
contribution of $663,000, in 1999, the Company made a matching contribution of
$226,000 and in 1998, the Company made a matching contribution of $197,000.
Profit Sharing Plan
The Company had a profit sharing plan, wherein, as determined by the board
of directors, a percentage of income from operations was accrued and
distributed to all employees excluding management. The total charge to
operations under the profit sharing plan was approximately $80,000 for 1999,
and $0 for 1998. The plan was discontinued in 2000.
9. NET INCOME LOSS PER SHARE
SFAS No. 128 requires dual presentation of basic and diluted net income
loss per share on the face of the income statement. Basic EPS is computed by
dividing income loss available to common stockholders numerator by the
weighted average number of common shares outstanding denominator for the
period. Diluted EPS gives effect to all dilutive potential common shares
outstanding during the period. The computation of diluted EPS uses the average
market prices during the period. All amounts in the following table are in
thousands except per share data.                           Year Ended December 31,

December 31, 1998 of 3,084,000 were excluded from the computations of diluted
net income loss per share because of their anti-dilutive effect on diluted
earnings loss per share.
10. CERTAIN TRANSACTIONS
The Company had a distribution agreement with Marubeni Solutions Corp., a
Japanese distributor, through the second quarter of 2000. The Company formed a
subsidiary in Japan in October 1995 in which Marubeni has a 19% minority
interest. In 1999, the Company shifted its strategy to a direct sales model
and terminated its distribution relationship with Marubeni in the second
quarter of 2000 and established its own sales force in Japan. In 2000, the
Company acquired the 19% interest in its Japanese subsidiary from Marubeni.

1999, and $363,000 for 1998.
The Company paid Alliant Partners, a technology merger and acquisition
advisory firm, a fee of $300,000 for rendering an opinion as to the fairness
from a financial point of view to Mattson stockholders of the consideration
to be provided by Mattson in connection with the acquisition of the STEAG
Semiconductor Division and CFM. The Company also agreed to pay Alliant
Partners a success fee of $2,000,000 upon the closing of the transactions,
against which the fairness opinion fee was to be credited. This payment was
made in January 2001. This amount was capitalized in 2000 as a direct
acquisition related cost. Mr. Savage, who was a member of Mattson Board of
Director until January 1, 2001 is a partner at Alliant Partners.
11. REPORTABLE SEGMENTS
SFAS No. 131, Disclosures about Segments of an Enterprise and Related
Information supersedes SFAS No. 14, Financial Reporting for Segments of a
Business Enterprise, replacing the industry segment approach with the
management approach. SFAS No. 131 establishes standards for reporting
information about operating segments, geographic areas and major customers in
financial statements. Operating segments are defined as components of an
enterprise about which separate financial information is available that is
evaluated regularly by the chief operating decision maker, or chief decision
making group, in deciding how to allocate resources and in assessing
performance. Brad Mattson, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of the
Company, is the Company chief decision maker. As the Company business is
completely focused on one industry segment, the design, manufacturing and
marketing of advanced fabrication equipment to the semiconductor manufacturing
industry, management believes that the Company has one reportable segment. The
Company revenues and profits are generated through the sale and service of
products for this one segment.
The following is net sales information by geographic area for the years

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS--Continued  For the purposes of determining sales to significant customers, the Company
includes sales to customers through its distributor at the sales price to the
distributor and excludes the distributor as a significant customer. In 1999,
20% of net sales was to a single customer. In 1998 and 2000, no single
customer accounted for 10% of net sales.
12. CONCENTRATION OF CREDIT RISK
Financial instruments that potentially subject the Company to significant
concentrations of credit risk consist principally of cash equivalents,
investments, trade accounts receivable and financial instruments used in
hedging activities.
The Company invests in a variety of financial instruments such as
certificates of deposit, corporate bonds and treasury bills. The Company
limits the amount of credit exposure to any one financial institution or
commercial issuer.
The Company trade accounts receivable are concentrated to companies in
the semiconductor industry and are derived from sales in the United States,
Japan, other Pacific Rim countries and Europe. The Company performs ongoing
credit evaluations of its customers and to date has not experienced any
material losses.
The Company is exposed to credit loss in the event of non performance by
counterparties on the forward foreign exchange contracts used in hedging
activities. The Company does not anticipate nonperformance by these
counterparties.
13. COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES
