ITEM 8. FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA
REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM
Board of Directors and Stockholders
Innotrac Corporation
We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Innotrac
Corporation and subsidiaries as of December 31, 2005 and 2004 and the related
consolidated statements of operations, shareholders' equity, and cash flows for
the years then ended. We have also audited the schedule listed in the Index at
 as Schedule II as of and for the years ended December 31, 2005 and 2004.
These consolidated financial statements and schedule are the responsibility of
the Company management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these
consolidated financial statements and schedule based on our audits.
We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company
Accounting Oversight Board United States. Those standards require that we plan
and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial
statements and schedule are free of material misstatement. The Company is not
required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal
control over financial reporting. Our audits included consideration of internal
control over financial reporting as a basis for designing audit procedures that
are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an
opinion on the effectiveness of the Company internal control over financial
reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. An audit also includes
examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in
the financial statements and schedule, assessing the accounting principles used
and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall
presentation of the financial statements and schedule. We believe that our audit
provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.
In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present
fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Innotrac Corporation
and subsidiaries at December 31, 2005 and 2004, and the results of its
operations and its cash flows for the years then ended, in conformity with
accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Also,
in our opinion, the related schedule presents fairly, in all material respects,
the information set forth therein as of and for the years ended December 31,
2005 and 2004. s/ BDO Seidman, LLP

Innotrac Corporation Innotrac or the Company, a Georgia corporation,
provides order processing, order fulfillment and call center services. The
Company offers inventory management, inbound call center, pick/pack/ship
services, order tracking, transaction processing and returns handling from its
leased facilities in Atlanta, Georgia, Pueblo, Colorado, Reno, Nevada,
Bolingbrook, Illinois, Hebron, Kentucky and New Castle, Delaware.
2.  SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
Basis of Financial Statement Presentation. The consolidated financial statements
include the accounts of the Company and its subsidiary which was merged into
the Company effective January 1, 2005. The financial statements have been
prepared on the accrual basis of accounting in conformity with accounting
principles generally accepted in the United States of America. All significant
intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated in consolidation.
Reclassifications have been made to prior year consolidated statements of
operations to conform to the 2005 presentation.
Accounting Estimates. The preparation of financial statements in conformity with
accounting principles generally accepted in the United States requires
management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of
assets and liabilities and the disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities
at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and
expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those
estimates.
Concentration of Revenues. Revenues earned under the Company contracts with
its telecommunication clients to provide fulfillment of telecommunications
equipment and related order processing and call center support services,
including DSL modems and wireless pagers, accounted for approximately 33%, 38%
and 42% of total revenues for the years ended December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003,
respectively. Revenues generated from the fulfillment of DSL and cable modem
equipment accounted for 21%, 20%, and 19% of the aforementioned totals.
The following table sets forth the percentage of total revenues derived from
each of the Company largest clients for the years ended December 31, 2005,
2004 and 2003. Except for the major clients noted in the following table, no
other single customer provided more than 10% of consolidated revenues during
these years.                 YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31,
2005  2004  2003
BELLSOUTH - TELECOM EQUIPMENT    88% 145% 185%
- DSL EQUIPMENT     147  125  130
SMITH & HAWKEN           123  129  132
THANE               113  70  39
TACTICA               00  30  102 Cash and Cash Equivalents. The Company considers all short-term, highly liquid
investments with an original maturity of three months or less to be cash
equivalents.
Fair Value of Financial Instruments. The carrying value of the Company
revolving credit facility approximates fair value given that interest rates
under the facility are based on prevailing market rates. The book value of the
Company accounts receivable and accounts payable approximate fair value.                    33 Inventories. Inventories, consisting primarily of telephones and Caller ID
equipment are stated at the lower of cost or market, with cost determined by the
first-in, first-out method. Substantially all inventory at December 31, 2005 and
2004 is for the account of one client who has indemnified the Company from
substantially all risk associated with such inventory.
Property and Equipment. Property and equipment are stated at cost. Depreciation
is determined using straight-line methods over the following estimated useful
lives            
Rental equipment     3 years
Computers and software  3-5 years
Machinery and equipment  5-7 years
Furniture and fixtures  7 years Leasehold improvements are amortized using the straight-line method over the
shorter of the service lives of the improvements or the remaining term of the
lease. Depreciation expense for the years ended December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003
were $43 million, $49 million and $53 million, respectively. Maintenance and
repairs are expensed as incurred.
Goodwill and Other Acquired Intangibles. Goodwill represents the cost of
acquired enterprises in excess of the fair market value of the net tangible and
identifiable intangible assets acquired. The Company adopted SFAS No. 142,
Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets effective January 1, 2002, which changed
the accounting for goodwill and other indefinite life intangibles from an
amortization method to an impairment only approach. The Company tests goodwill
annually for impairment at January 1 or sooner if circumstances indicate.
Under SFAS No. 142, goodwill impairment is deemed to exist if the net book value
of a reporting unit exceeds its estimated fair value. Upon completion of its
analysis for impairment as of January 1, 2006 in accordance with SFAS No. 142,
no impairment was determined to exist at that time. Innotrac goodwill carrying
amount as of December 31, 2005 was $252 million. This asset relates to the
goodwill associated with the Company acquisition of Universal Distribution
Services UDS in December 2000, including the earnout payment made to the
former UDS shareholders in February 2002, and the acquisition of iFulfillment,
Inc. in July 2001.
The Company has intangible assets that were subject to amortization under the
provisions of SFAS No. 142. The intangible assets consist of acquired customer
contracts, which are included in other assets in the Company Consolidated
Balance Sheets and which are amortized over a period of 1 to 5 years on a
straight-line basis. At December 31, 2005 and 2004, the Company had intangible
assets, consisting primarily of customer contracts, of approximately $0 and
$185,000, net of accumulated amortization of approximately $13 million and $11
million, respectively. Amortization expense of these intangible assets amounted
to approximately $185,000, $202,000 and $202,000 during the years ended December
31, 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively.
Impairment of Long-Lived Assets. The Company reviews long-lived assets and
certain intangible assets for impairment when events or changes in circumstances
indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. Impairment
would be measured based on a projected cash flow model. If the projected
undiscounted cash flows for the asset are not in excess of the carrying value of
the related asset, the impairment would be determined based upon the excess of
the carrying value of the asset over the projected discounted cash flows for the
asset.
Accounting for Income Taxes. Innotrac utilizes the liability method of
accounting for income taxes. Under the liability method, deferred taxes are
determined based on the difference between the financial and tax basis of assets
and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect in the years in which the
differences are expected to reverse. A valuation allowance is recorded against
deferred tax assets if the Company considers it is more likely than not that
deferred tax assets will not be realized. A valuation allowance has been
recorded against deferred tax assets at December 31, 2005 see Note 6.                    34 Revenue Recognition. Innotrac derives its revenue primarily from two sources:
1 fulfillment operations and 2 the delivery of business services. Innotrac
fulfillment services operations record revenue at the conclusion of the material
selection, packaging and shipping process. Innotrac call center services
business recognizes revenue according to written pricing agreements based on
number of calls, minutes or hourly rate basis. All other revenues are recognized
as services are rendered. As required by the consensus reached in Emerging Issue
Task Force EITF Issue No. 99-19, revenues have been recorded net of the cost
of the equipment for all fee-for-service clients. As required by the consensus
reached in EITF No. 01-14, Income Statement Characterization of Reimbursements
Received for Out-of Pocket Expenses Incurred, the Company records
reimbursements received from customers for out-of pocket expenses, primarily
freight and postage fees, as revenue and the associated expense as cost of
revenue.
Cost of Revenues. The primary components of cost of revenues include labor costs
for the fulfillment and call centers, telephone minute fees, and freight and
packaging material costs. Costs related to facilities, equipment, account
services and information technology are included in selling, general and
administrative expense along with other operating costs. As a result of the
Company policy to include facility, account services and information
technology costs in selling, general and administrative expense, our gross
margins may not be comparable to other fulfillment companies.
Stock-Based Compensation Plans. The Company accounts for its stock-based
compensation plans under Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 25, Accounting
for Stock Issued to Employees APB 25. Since the exercise price for all
options granted under those plans was equal to the market value of the
underlying common stock on the date of grant, no compensation cost is recognized
in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations. Had compensation cost
for stock options been determined under a fair value based method, in accordance
with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123, Accounting for
Stock-Based Compensation, as amended by Statement of Financial Accounting
Standards No. 148, the Company net loss and net loss per share would have been
the following pro forma amounts in 000, except per share data                           YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31,
2005   2004   2003

Basic net loss income per share as reported   $ 038 $ 001  $ 104
Diluted net loss income per share as reported  $ 038 $ 001  $ 104
Pro forma net loss per share           $ 066 $006 $ 110 Under the fair value based method, compensation cost, net of tax is $34
million, $787,000 and $718,000 for the years ended December 31, 2005, 2004 and
2003, respectively.
On December 31, 2005, in anticipation of the adoption of SFAS No. 123R on
January 1, 2006, the Board of Directors amended the terms of certain outstanding
options to purchase the Company common stock that the Company previously had
granted. The amendments included accelerating the vesting date of 172,250
outstanding options to a vesting date of December 31, 2005 and re-pricing
834,450 out-of-the-money outstanding options to an exercise price of $456, the
market value of the company common stock on December 31, 2005, to better
incentivize the holders of those options. Since the amended exercise price for
the options was equal to the market value of the underlying common stock on the
date of amendment, no compensation cost was recognized as a result of these
amendments.                    35 The Company has computed for pro forma disclosure purposes the value of all
options granted using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model as prescribed by
SFAS No. 123 using the following weighted average assumptions               2005    2004    2003
Risk-free interest rate    447%    423%    427%
Expected dividend yield      0%     0%     0%
Expected lives      21 Years  23 Years  26 Years
Expected volatility      724%    751%    804 The fair value of each option was estimated on the date of grant using the
Black-Scholes option pricing model with the above weighted average assumptions.
The weighted average fair value of options granted was as follows              2005    2004    2003
Per share option value  $  196  $   478  $  222
Aggregate total     $849,200  $1,017,803  $266,028
Earnings Per Share. Basic earnings per share is computed by dividing net income
by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding. In the computation
of diluted earnings per share, the weighted average number of common shares
outstanding is adjusted for the effect of all dilutive potential common stock
equivalent shares.
Recent Accounting Pronouncements. In December 2004, the Financial Accounting
Standards Board FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standard
SFAS No. 123R, Share-Based Payment, which revises SFAS No. 123,
Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation. The revised statement clarifies and
expands SFAS No. 123 guidance in several areas, including measuring fair
value, classifying an award as equity or as a liability, and attributing
compensation cost to reporting periods. The revised statement supercedes
Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 25, Accounting for Stock Issued to
Employees APB 25, and its related implementation guidance. Under the
provisions of SFAS No. 123R, the alternative to use APB 25 intrinsic value
method of accounting that was provided in SFAS No. 123, as originally issued, is
eliminated, and entities are required to measure liabilities incurred to
employees in share-based payment transactions at fair value. The Company
currently accounts for its stock-based compensation plans under APB 25. Since
the exercise price for all options granted under those plans was equal to the
market value of the underlying common stock on the date of grant, no
compensation cost is recognized. SFAS No. 123R will be effective for the
Company beginning January 1, 2006.
3.  ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE
Accounts receivable were composed of the following at December 31, 2005 and 2004
in 000                      2005   2004

4.  FINANCING OBLIGATIONS
The Company recently renewed its revolving credit agreement to extend the
facility for an additional three years, until March 2009. Although the facility
has a maximum borrowing limit of $250 million, the credit facility limits
borrowings to a specified percentage of eligible accounts receivable and
inventory, which                    36 totaled $119 million at December 31, 2005. The maximum borrowing amount of this
facility was reduced from $400 million to $250 million in the third quarter of
2004 as the Company does not anticipate a need for the larger amount. The
Company has granted a security interest in all of its assets to the lender as
collateral under this revolving credit agreement.
The revolving credit agreement contains restrictive fixed charge coverage ratio,
change in ownership control and other covenants. The provisions of the revolving
credit agreement require that the Company maintain a lockbox arrangement with
the lender, and allows the lender to declare any outstanding borrowing amounts
to be immediately due and payable as a result of noncompliance with any of the
covenants. Accordingly, in the event of noncompliance, these amounts could be
accelerated.
As renewed, the facility requires the Company to maintain a minimum fixed charge
coverage ratio of between 070 and 100 to 100, depending on the particular
fiscal quarter, for each of the Company quarters through the end of its fiscal
year 2006, and a ratio of 115 to 100 thereafter. Although, at December 31,
2005 the Company was not in compliance with the then-current fixed charge
coverage ratio requirement of 130 to 100, or with a then-existing tangible net
worth requirement which has been eliminated from the new facility, the Company
received a waiver of such noncompliance from the bank. The Company fixed
charge ratio at December 31, 2005 was 118 to 100.
Interest on borrowings is payable monthly at rates equal to the prime rate, or
at the Company option, LIBOR plus up to 200 basis points. During the years
ended December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003 the Company incurred interest expense
related to the line of credit of approximately $87,000, $111,000 and $704,000,
respectively, resulting in a weighted average interest rate of 501%, 348% and
380%, respectively. At December 31, 2005, the Company had $119 million of
additional availability under the revolving credit agreement.
5.  COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES
Operating Leases. Innotrac leases office and warehouse space and equipment under
various operating leases. The primary office and warehouse operating leases
provide for escalating payments over the lease term. Innotrac recognizes rent
expense on a straight-line basis over the lease term.
Aggregate future minimum lease payments under noncancellable operating leases
with original periods in excess of one year as of December 31, 2005 are as
follows in 000                  OPERATING
LEASES
2006..  $ 9,672
2007..   9,914

2009..   2,957
2010..   2,362

Rent expense under all operating leases totaled approximately $87 million, $86
million and $81 million during the years ended December 31, 2005, 2004 and
2003, respectively.
Legal Proceedings. The Company is subject to various legal proceedings and
claims that arise in the ordinary course of business. There are no material
pending legal proceedings to which the Company is a party.
Shareholder Rights Plan. In December of 1997, the Company Board of Directors
approved a Shareholder Rights Plan the Rights Plan. The Rights Plan provides
for the distribution of one Right for each outstanding share of the Company
Common Stock held of record as of the close of business on January 1, 1998 or
that thereafter becomes outstanding prior to the earlier of the final expiration
date of the Rights or                    37 the first date upon which the Rights become exercisable. Each Right entitles the
registered holder to purchase from the Company one one-hundredth of a share of
Series A Participating Cumulative Preferred Stock, par value $10 per share, at
a price of $6000 the Purchase Price, subject to adjustment. The Rights are
not exercisable until ten calendar days after a person or group an Acquiring
Person buys, or announces a tender offer for, 15% or more of the Company
Common Stock. Such ownership level has been increased to 40% for a particular
shareholder that owned approximately 340% of the shares outstanding on December
31, 2005. In the event the Rights become exercisable, each Right will entitle
the holder to receive that number of shares of Common Stock having a market
value equal to the Purchase Price. If, after any person has become an Acquiring
Person other than through a tender offer approved by qualifying members of the
Board of Directors, the Company is involved in a merger or other business
combination where the Company is not the surviving corporation, or the Company
sells 50% or more of its assets, operating income, or cash flow, then each Right
will entitle the holder to purchase, for the Purchase Price, that number of
shares of common or other capital stock of the acquiring entity which at the
time of such transaction have a market value of twice the Purchase Price. The
Rights will expire on January 1, 2008, unless extended, unless the Rights are
earlier exchanged, or unless the Rights are earlier redeemed by the Company in
whole, but not in part, at a price of $0001 per Right.
Employment Commitment. In June 1999, in conjunction with the opening of a new
call center facility, the Company entered into an Employment Commitment
Agreement with the City of Pueblo, Colorado, whereby the Company received cash
incentives of $968,000. These funds were accounted for as a reduction in the
basis of the assets acquired. In return for this consideration, the Company is
obligated to employ a minimum number of full-time employees at its Pueblo
facility, measured on a quarterly basis. This obligation, which became effective
June 2002, will continue through June 2009. In the event that the number of
full-time employees fails to meet the minimum requirement, the Company will
incur a quarterly penalty of $9630 for each employee less than the minimum
required amount. During 2005, 2004 and 2003, the Company did not meet the
minimum employee requirements of 359 full-time employees, as measured on a
quarterly basis, incurring a penalty of approximately $11,000, $17,000 and
$11,000, respectively.
6.  INCOME TAXES
Details of the income tax benefit provision for the years ended December 31,
2005, 2004 and 2003 are as follows in 000      2005  2004   2003
Current       $ 232
Deferred   --   --  8,540
$8,772
38 Deferred income taxes reflect the net effect of the temporary differences
between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting
purposes and the amounts used for income tax purposes. The significant
components of the Company deferred tax assets and liabilities as of December
31, 2005 and 2004 are as follows in 000                     2005    2004
Deferred tax assets:
Net operating loss carryforwards  $ 14,317  $12,120
Allowance for doubtful accounts    1,019    619
Reserves                215     2
Other                  58     9
Total deferred tax assets        15,609  12,750
Valuation allowance         12,187  9,680
Net deferred tax assets         3,422   3,070
Deferred tax liabilities:
Goodwill               2,318  1,749
Depreciation             1,104  1,321
Net deferred taxes             --     Net deferred taxes:
Current deferred tax assets       --      Noncurrent deferred tax assets      --                                             $   --  $                        Innotrac utilizes the liability method of accounting for income taxes. Under the
liability method, deferred taxes are determined based on the difference between
the financial and tax basis of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in
effect in the years in which the differences are expected to reverse. A
valuation allowance is recorded against deferred tax assets if the Company
considers it is more likely than not that deferred tax assets will not be
realized. Innotrac gross deferred tax asset as of December 31, 2005 is
approximately $156 million. This deferred tax asset was generated primarily by
net operating loss carryforwards created primarily by the special charge of
$343 million recorded in 2000 and the net losses generated in 2002 and 2003 and
2005. Innotrac has a tax net operating loss carryforward of $375 million at
December 31, 2005 that expires between 2020 and 2025.
Innotrac ability to generate the expected amounts of taxable income from
future operations is dependent upon general economic conditions, collection of
existing outstanding accounts receivable, competitive pressures on sales and
margins and other factors beyond management control. These factors, combined
with losses in recent years, creates uncertainty about the ultimate realization
of the gross deferred tax asset in future years. Therefore, a valuation
allowance of approximately $122 million and $97 million has been recorded as
of December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively. Income taxes associated with future
earnings will be offset by a reduction in the valuation allowance. For the year
ended December 31, 2005, the deferred income tax benefit of $25 million was
offset by a corresponding increase of the deferred tax asset valuation
allowance. When, and if, the Company can return to consistent profitability and
management determines that it will be able to utilize the deferred tax assets
prior to their expiration, the valuation allowance can be reduced or eliminated.                    39 The difference between the provision for income taxes benefit and the amount
computed by applying the U.S. federal income tax rate for the years ended
December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003 is as follows                         2005   2004   2003
Statutory federal income tax benefit    $1,624 $ 37  $1,091

7.  EARNINGS PER SHARE
The following table shows the shares used in computing diluted earnings per
share EPS in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No.
128 in 000                      2005   2004   2003
Diluted earnings per share:
Weighted average shares outstanding  12,196  11,865  11,542
Employee and director stock options    --   657                               Weighted average shares
assuming dilution         12,196  12,522  11,542
Options and warrants outstanding to purchase shares of the Company common
stock aggregating 17 million, 87,500 and 19 million were not included in the
computation of diluted EPS for the years ended December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003,
respectively, because their effect was anti-dilutive. This includes a warrant
with registration rights issued to Thane International in December 2000 to
purchase 150,000 shares of Innotrac common stock at the exercise price of $650,
which vests 20% annually, which expires December 8, 2010.
On December 31, 2005, in anticipation of the adoption of SFAS No. 123R on
January 1, 2006, the Board of Directors amended the terms of certain outstanding
options to purchase the Company common stock that the Company previously had
granted. The amendments included accelerating the vesting date of 172,250
outstanding options to a vesting date of December 31, 2005 and re-pricing
834,450 out-of-the-money outstanding options to an exercise price of $456, the
market value of the company common stock on December 31, 2005, to better
incentivize the holders of those options. Since the amended exercise price for
the options was equal to the market value of the underlying common stock on the
date of amendment, no compensation cost was recognized as a result of these
amendments.                    40 8.  OTHER COMPREHENSIVE LOSS
SFAS No. 130, Reporting Comprehensive Income, established standards for
reporting and display of comprehensive income and its components in financial
statements. For the years ended December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003, the components
of the Company comprehensive loss are as follows in 000                                Year Ended
December 31,
2005  2004   2003

9.  SHAREHOLDERS' EQUITY
In June 2000, the Company Board of Directors authorized the repurchase, at the
direction of senior management, of up to $50 million of the Company common
stock. The stock repurchase program was extended for an additional twelve months
by the Board of Directors in February 2002. During the years ended December 31,
2005 and 2004 the Company did not repurchase shares.
At December 31, 2003, all treasury shares previously repurchased had been
reissued for stock options exercised during 2003, and accordingly no treasury
stock remains.
10. EMPLOYEE RETIREMENT PLANS
Innotrac employees may participate in a 401k defined contribution plan. The
plan covers all employees who have at least six months of service and are 18
years of age or older. Participants may elect to defer up to 15% of compensation
up to a maximum amount determined annually pursuant to IRS regulations. Prior to
July 1, 2004, Innotrac policy was to provide matching employer contributions
equal to 15% of contributions for less than five years of service, 25% of
contributions for five to nine years of service, and 35% of contributions for
over nine years of service. However, this match was suspended from January 1,
2002 through June 30, 2002, reinstituted from July 1, 2002 through December 31,
2002 and was temporarily suspended thereafter. Effective July 1, 2004 and
through December 31, 2004, Innotrac reinstituted a matching employer
contribution equal to 5% of contributions for less than five years of service,
10% of contributions for five to nine years of service and 15% of contributions
for over nine years of service. These rates were adjusted effective January 1,
2005 to 5% of contributions for less than four years of service and 10% of
contributions for over four years of service. Total matching contributions made
to the plan and charged to expense by Innotrac for the years ended December 31,
2005, 2004 and 2003 were approximately $42,000, $16,000 and $0, respectively.
The Company has an executive deferred compensation plan for certain employees,
as designated by the Company Board of Directors. Participants may elect to
defer up to 30% of compensation. Innotrac policy is to provide matching
employer contributions ranging from 20% to 100% of employee contributions based
on years of service. However, this match was suspended for 2005, 2004 and 2003.
The Company invests these contributions in employee-directed marketable equity
securities which are recorded as trading securities at fair-market value on the
accompanying consolidated balance sheet in other assets and aggregated
$884,889 and $874,865 at December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively. The monies
held by the plan are subject to general creditors of the Company in the event of
a Company bankruptcy filing.                    41 11. STOCK BASED COMPENSATION
The Company has adopted two stock option plans: the 1997 and 2000 Stock Option
and Incentive Award Plans The Plans. The Plans provide key employees,
officers, directors, contractors and consultants an opportunity to own shares of
common stock of the Company and to provide incentives for such persons to
promote the financial success of the Company. Awards under The Plans may be
structured in a variety of ways, including as incentive stock options, as
defined in Section 422 of the Internal Revenue Code, as amended, non-qualified
stock options, restricted stock awards, and stock appreciation rights SARs.
Incentive stock options may be granted only to full-time employees including
officers of the Company. Non-qualified options, restricted stock awards, SARs,
and other permitted forms of awards may be granted to any person employed by or
performing services for the Company, including directors, contractors and
consultants. The 1997 Stock Option Plan and 2000 Stock Option Plan, as amended,
provide for the issuance of options to purchase up to an aggregate of 800,000
shares and 2,800,000 shares of common stock, respectively. At December 31, 2005,
there were 1,237,850 shares available to be issued under The Plans.
On December 31, 2005, in anticipation of the adoption of SFAS No. 123R on
January 1, 2006, the Board of Directors amended the terms of certain outstanding
options to purchase the Company common stock that the Company previously had
granted. The amendments included accelerating the vesting date of 172,250
outstanding options to a vesting date of December 31, 2005 and re-pricing
834,450 out-of-the-money outstanding options to an exercise price of $456, the
market value of the company common stock on December 31, 2005, to better
incentivize the holders of those options. Since the amended exercise price for
the options was equal to the market value of the underlying common stock on the
date of amendment, no compensation cost was recognized as a result of these
amendments.
Incentive stock options are also subject to certain limitations prescribed by
the Code, including the requirement that such options may not be granted to
employees who own more than 10% of the combined voting power of all classes of
voting stock of the Company, unless the option price is at least 110% of the
fair market value of the common stock subject to the option. The Board of
Directors of the Company or a committee designated by the Board otherwise
generally has discretion to set the terms and conditions of options and other
awards, including the term, exercise price and vesting conditions, if any; to
select the persons who receive such grants and awards; and to interpret and
administer The Plans.

12. RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS
The Company leases a single engine aircraft from a company wholly-owned by our
Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, pursuant to an agreement that provides for
Innotrac to pay for 86% of all expenses associated with this aircraft. This
allocation is determined annually based on actual business usage. The Company
paid approximately $187,000 during 2005. For the years ended December 31, 2004
and 2003, the Company paid $205,000 and $134,000, respectively.
The Company paid approximately $29,000, $29,000 and $83,000 during 2005, 2004
and 2003, respectively, in fees to an accounting firm for tax and consulting
services. One of the directors of the Company is the Managing Partner and part
owner of that firm.
The Company paid approximately $239,000, $527,000 and $863,000 during 2005, 2004
and 2003, respectively, in fees to a print broker for services related to the
printing of marketing, client, inter-company and other materials. The broker is
owned by the brother of the Company Chairman and Chief Executive Officer.
In 2003, the Company and the IPOF Group consisting of IPOF Fund, LP and its
general partner, David Dadante, which as of December 31, 2005 beneficially
owned approximately 42 million shares of Common Stock, entered into an amended
Agreement to permit the IPOF Group to acquire up to 40% of the Common Stock on
the terms set forth in that Agreement without becoming an Acquiring Person
under the Company Rights Agreement with SunTrust Bank. The Agreement with the
IPOF Group contains various restrictions on the IPOF Group right to vote and
take certain other shareholder actions. Among these restrictions, the IPOF Group
agreed to vote all shares in excess of 15% proportionately with votes cast by
the other shareholders of the Company and not seek to place a representative on
the Company Board or seek to remove any member of the Board. The IPOF Group
further acknowledged that it is an affiliate, as defined under applicable
federal securities law.
During 2004, the Company became aware of possible IPOF Group violations of the
short-swing profit rules under Section 16b of the Securities and Exchange Act
of 1934. Upon conclusion of the investigation of this matter, the Company and
IPOF Group, on March 3, 2004, entered into a Settlement Agreement regarding the
potential Section 16b liability issues that provides for the Company
recovery in 2006 of $301,957.                    43 The United States District Court in Cleveland, Ohio has appointed a receiver to
identify and administer the assets of the IPOF Fund, L.P. and its general
partner, Mr. David Dadante. Based on information from the receiver, the Company
understands that the Fund and Mr. Dadante own 4,176,725 shares of common stock
of the Company, representing approximately 340% of the total shares
outstanding, all of which are held as collateral in margin accounts maintained
at several financial institutions. The Company has been engaged in discussions
with the receiver in an effort to cause the shares to be sold in a manner that
causes as little disruption to the market for Company stock as possible. The
Federal Court has prohibited the financial institutions holding Company stock
owned by the IPOF Fund and Mr. Dadante in margin accounts from selling any of
these shares through at least July 14, 2006. The court has permitted open market
sales by the receiver as he may in his sole discretion determine to be
consistent with his duty to maximize the value of the assets of IPOF Fund, and
as warranted by market conditions. The receiver has indicated to the Company
that he does not intend to direct any open market sales during this period
except in circumstances in which he believes that there would be no material
adverse impact on the market price for the Company shares.

Item 2. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES
Our management, with the participation of the Chief Executive Officer and
principal financial officer, evaluated our disclosure controls and procedures
as defined in federal securities rules as of December 31, 2005. No system of
controls, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide absolute
assurance that the objectives of the system of controls are met, and no
evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that the system of
controls has operated effectively in all cases. Our disclosure controls and
procedures however are designed to provide reasonable assurance that the
objectives of disclosure controls and procedures are met. Based on the
evaluation discussed above, our CEO and principal financial officer have
concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of the
date of that evaluation to provide reasonable assurance that the objectives of
disclosure controls and procedures are met.                    44 There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting during
the quarter ended December 31, 2005 that has materially affected, or is
reasonably likely to materially affect, Innotrac internal control over
financial reporting.
