Item 8. FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA  REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM  To
the Board of Directors and Stockholders of Captaris, Inc. Bellevue, Washington  We have audited the
accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Captaris, Inc. and subsidiaries the Company as of December 31, 2004 and 2003, and the related consolidated statements of operations, cash flows, and shareholders equity for each of the
three years in the period ended December 31, 2004. These financial statements are the responsibility of the Companys management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audits.  We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting
Oversight Board United States PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on
a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial
statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.  In our opinion, such consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Captaris, Inc. and subsidiaries as of December 31, 2004 and 2003, and the results of their
operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2004, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.  /s/ DELOITTE TOUCHE LLP  Seattle, Washington March 31, 2005

CAPTARIS, INC.  NOTES TO
CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  Years ended December
31, 2004, 2003 and 2002  1. Description of the Business and Summary of
Significant Accounting Policies  The Business  Captaris, Inc. provides business information delivery solutions which enable
our customers to capture, process, deliver, manage and archive data and documents. Our products address the fax server market, which is divided into network fax and production fax, e-document delivery and related business process automation,
workflow and archiving and records management markets. We distribute our products globally primarily through independent distributors and value-added resellers. Captaris was incorporated in the State of Washington in 1982. We also provide strategic
and architectural technology consulting, custom development, integration of third party technologies and other services.  Accounting Principles  The consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States
of America.  Principles of Consolidation  The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Captaris, Inc.
and our wholly owned subsidiaries. All intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.  Use of Estimates  The preparation of our consolidated financial statements, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America,
requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities and commitments at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and
expenses during the reporting period. When the carrying values of assets and liabilities and commitments and contingencies are not readily apparent from other sources, we use estimates. Typically, estimates are used in accounting for the valuation
of goodwill and other intangible assets, useful lives of intangible assets, equipment and leasehold improvements, inventory valuation allowances, revenue recognition and the estimated allowances for sales returns and doubtful accounts. Actual
results may differ significantly from these estimates. To the extent that there are material differences between these estimates and actual results, our presentation of our financial condition or results of operations may be affected.  Reclassifications  As described in Note 4, on September 1, 2003, we sold the assets of MediaTel Corporation MediaTel, our wholly
owned subsidiary which operated the MediaLinq business. As such, in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, results of operations have been reclassified to reflect MediaTels operating results, net of income taxes, as
discontinued operations.  Business Combinations  We include the results of operations of acquired businesses from the date of
acquisition. Net assets acquired are recorded at their fair value at the date of acquisition. The excess of the purchase price over the fair value of net assets acquired is included in goodwill in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. In
certain circumstances, we have pushed down the goodwill to the acquiring foreign subsidiary resulting in foreign currency exchange differences upon consolidation.  Cash and Cash Equivalents  We consider all highly liquid debt instruments purchased with an original maturity of three months or less to be cash equivalents. 
43 Table of Contents CAPTARIS, INC.  NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Continued 
Restricted Cash  Restricted cash consists of cash collateralized for a letter of credit that serves as collateral pursuant to a lease agreement.  Investments  We classify our short-term and long-term investments as available-for-sale. Our investments are comprised of
government agency issues, mortgage-backed securities, corporate debt securities, municipal securities and certificates of deposit and are recorded at fair market value. We determine the fair value of our investments based on quoted market prices.
Investments with expected maturities of one year or less are classified as short-term. We recognize realized gains and losses upon sale of investments using the specific identification method. We believe that the expected lives of the
mortgage-backed securities investments are much shorter than the stated maturities due to mortgage refinances and sales of homes. Accordingly, we have estimated the portion of the mortgages likely to be prepaid within one year based on historical
prepayment data, current interest rates and other economic factors, and classified these investments as short-term. Unrealized gains and losses, net of any income tax effect, are recorded as a component of other comprehensive income. Interest income
is recorded using an effective interest rate, with the associated premium or discount amortized to interest income over the term of the investment. See Note 6. 
We recognize an impairment charge related to unrealized losses when an investments decline in fair value is below the cost basis and is judged to
be other than temporary. In making this judgment, we evaluate, among other factors, the duration and extent to which the fair value of an investment is less than its cost; the financial condition and near-term business outlook for the investee and
our intent and ability to hold the investment for a period of time sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery in market value.  Concentration of Credit Risk  We extend credit to customers and are therefore subject to credit risk. We perform initial and ongoing credit evaluations of our customers financial
condition and do not require collateral on accounts receivable. Estimates are used in determining the allowance for doubtful accounts and are based on our historical bad debt experience, the aging of customer accounts, customer concentrations,
customer credit-worthiness, current economic trends and changes in our customer payment patterns. Historically, reserves for credit losses have been within our expectations.  A significant portion of our revenues are derived from sales in the United States. For the years ended December 31, 2004,
2003 and 2002, sales in the United States accounted for 749%, 775% and 758%, respectively, of net revenue. See Note 18 Geographic Revenue, Long-Lived Assets and Significant Customers for a breakdown of revenue by geographic region.
Inventories  Inventories consist primarily of fax boards, which we resell, and are stated
at the lower of cost or market as determined by the first-in, first out method. Due to rapid changes in technology, it is possible that older products in inventories may become obsolete or we may sell these products below cost. When we determine
that the carrying value of inventory is not recoverable, we write down inventories to market value.  Equipment and Leasehold Improvements  Equipment and leasehold improvements are recorded at cost less accumulated depreciation. Depreciation is calculated on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of the related assets, ranging from three to
seven years. Leasehold improvements are amortized over the lesser of their estimated useful lives or the term of the lease.  Intangible and Long-lived Assets  Intangible assets, other than goodwill, are amortized using the straight-line method over their estimated period of benefit, ranging from one to twelve
years. All of our intangible assets are subject to amortization. We periodically evaluate the recoverability of intangible assets and take into account events or circumstances that warrant revised estimates of useful lives or that indicate that
impairment exists. 
44 Table of Contents CAPTARIS, INC.  NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Continued 
Goodwill  Goodwill represents the excess purchase price over the estimated fair value of net assets acquired as of the acquisition date. In accordance with SFAS No.
142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, we perform tests for goodwill impairment on an annual basis and on an interim basis in certain circumstances. If impairment exists, goodwill is written down to its fair value.  Fair Value of Financial Instruments  For certain financial instruments, including accounts receivable, accounts
payable and accrued liabilities, recorded amounts approximate fair value due to the short maturities of these instruments. Short-term and long-term investments are recorded at fair value as the underlying securities are classified as
available-for-sale and marked to market at each reporting period. The change in market value is recorded in other comprehensive income.  Foreign Currency  The financial statements of our wholly owned foreign subsidiaries have been translated to U.S. dollars in accordance with SFAS No. 52, Foreign Currency
Translation. Accordingly, all assets and liabilities of the subsidiaries are translated at year-end exchange rates and all revenue and expenses are translated at the average exchange rate for the period presented. Translation gains and losses
are reported as other comprehensive income loss as a separate component of shareholders equity. In addition, we made a U.S. dollar denominated, long-term loan to one of our subsidiaries which is not intended to be repaid in the foreseeable
future. The translation gains and losses recognized by the foreign subsidiary related to this loan are also recorded in other comprehensive income loss in the consolidated financial statements.  Foreign currency transaction gains and losses are a result of the effect of
exchange rate changes on transactions denominated in currencies other than the functional currency, including U.S. dollars. Gains and losses on those foreign currency transactions are included in other income expense for the period of exchange.
Foreign currency transaction gains were $13,000 in 2004 and $461,000 in 2003 and foreign currency transaction losses were $58,000 in 2002.  Segment Reporting  Historically, we classified our business into two major segments: software products and e-document services. In September 2003, we sold our e-document
services operating segment see Note 4. As a result of the sale, we now operate in only one operating segment.  Stock-Based Compensation  During the second quarter of 2001, we offered a limited non-compulsory exchange of employee stock options on a less than one-for-one basis. The exchange
which closed on July 10, 2001 resulted in the voluntary cancellation of employee stock options to purchase 3,135,720 shares of our common stock with varying exercise prices greater than $1000 per share in exchange for 1,286,790 employee stock
options with an exercise price of $211. The option exchange offer resulted in variable accounting treatment for a total of 1,993,250 options, representing the 1,286,790 new options granted in the exchange as well as all employee options modified
during the year. Variable accounting treatment will result in charges or credits recorded to stock based compensation, depending on fluctuations in quoted prices for our common stock and the number of stock options subject to variable accounting,
neither of which can be predicted. At December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002, we had 181,366, 266,342 and 1,370,779 options, respectively, to purchase common stock subject to variable accounting. In 2004, the total benefit to continuing operations for
stock compensation was $29,000. In 2003, we recorded a total charge for stock compensation of $31 million consisting of a charge to continuing operations of $23 million and a charge to discontinued operations of $863,000. In 2002, we recorded a
total benefit for stock based compensation expense of $12 million, consisting of a benefit to continuing operations of $938,000 and a benefit to discontinued operations of $213,000.

Revenue Recognition 
Our revenue recognition policies follow the guidelines of the American
Institute of Certified Public Accountants AICPA Statement of Position SOP No. 97-2, Software Revenue Recognition, as amended. We recognize revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, delivery has
occurred, the selling price is fixed or determinable and collection is reasonably assured.  We sell products through resellers, OEMs and other channel partners, as well as directly to end-users. Except for OEM sales described below, we recognize product revenue upon shipment, net of estimated returns,
provided that collection is determined to be probable and no significant obligations remain. All software licenses are bundled with 30 days of telephone support. We consider revenue associated with this telephone support to be insignificant, and
therefore, we recognize this revenue when the software is shipped and record an estimate for the related cost of the telephone support. Revenue from term software licenses is recognized over the term of the license, generally twelve months. Whenever
a software license, hardware, installation and post-contract customer support or PCS elements are sold together, we allocate the total arrangement fee among each element based on its respective fair 
46 Table of Contents CAPTARIS, INC.  NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Continued 
value, which is the price charged when that element is sold separately. The amount of revenue assigned to each
element is impacted by our judgment as to whether an arrangement includes multiple elements and, if so, whether vendor-specific objective evidence VSOE of fair value exists for those elements. Changes to the elements in an arrangement
and our ability to establish VSOE for those elements could affect the timing of revenue recognition for these items. Revenue for PCS is recognized on a straight-line basis over the service contract term, ranging from one to five years. PCS includes
rights to unspecified upgrades and updates, when and if available, and bug fixes. Installation revenue is recognized when the product has been installed at the customers site and accepted by the customer. Recognition of revenue from software
sold with installation services is recognized either when the software is shipped or when the installation services are completed, depending on our agreement with the customer and whether the installation services are integral to the functionality
of the software. Revenue from perpetual software licenses is recognized when the software has been shipped, provided that collection for such revenue is deemed probable. For software sold to resellers in which we have granted exchange rights, we
defer the revenue until the reseller sells the software through to end-users.  We have entered into agreements with certain OEMs from which we receive royalty payments periodically. Under the terms of the OEM license agreements, each OEM will qualify our software on their hardware and software
configurations. Once the software has been qualified, the OEM will begin to ship products and report net sales to us. Most OEMs pay a license fee based on the number of copies of licensed software included in the products sold to their customers.
These OEMs pay fees on a per-unit basis, and we record associated revenue when we receive notification of the OEMssales of the licensed software to an end-user. The terms of the license agreements generally require the OEMs to notify us of
sales of our products within 30 to 45 days after the end of the month or quarter in which the sales occur. As a result, we recognize the revenue in the month or quarter following the sales of the product to these OEMscustomers.  In general, customers are granted a 30-day right of return for product sales.
We reduce revenue recognized for estimated product returns at the time the related revenue is recorded. When customer acceptance provisions are present and we cannot reasonably estimate returns, we recognize revenue upon the earlier of customer
acceptance or expiration of the acceptance period. Costs related to insignificant customer support obligations, which include telephone support, are recorded at the time the related revenue is recognized.  Consulting services are customarily billed at fixed rates, plus out-of-pocket
expenses and revenues are recognized when the consulting has been completed. However, if it is determined that a consulting engagement will be unprofitable, we recognize the loss at the time of such determination. Training revenue is recognized when
the training is completed.  Warranty Expense  A warranty reserve is established based on our historical experience and an
estimate of the amounts necessary to settle future and existing claims on products sold as of the balance sheet date. While we believe that our warranty reserve is adequate and that the judgment applied is appropriate, such amounts estimated to be
due and payable could differ materially from what will actually transpire in the future. Historically, warranty expenses have not been material.  Research and Development Costs  Research and development costs are expensed as incurred. We have not capitalized any software development costs, as technological feasibility is not
generally established until substantially all development is complete.  Advertising Costs  Advertising costs are
charged to sales and marketing expense as incurred. Advertising expenses from continuing operations were $51 million, $33 million and $39 million for the years ended December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively. Advertising expenses for
discontinued operations were $83,000 and $86,000 for 2003 and 2002, respectively.  Income Taxes  We compute the provision for
income taxes using the asset and liability method, under which deferred income taxes are recorded for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities. These
deferred taxes are measured using tax rates expected to be in effect when the temporary differences reverse. We will establish a valuation allowance to reduce deferred tax assets unless it is more likely than not that we will generate sufficient
taxable income to allow for the realization of our deferred net tax asset. 
47 Table of Contents CAPTARIS, INC.  NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Continued 
Income Loss Per Common Share  Basic net income loss per common share is computed by dividing net income loss by the weighted average number of shares
of common stock outstanding during the year. Diluted net income loss per common share is computed by dividing net income loss by the sum of the weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding during the year and the net additional
shares that would have been issued had all dilutive options been exercised less shares that would be repurchased with the proceeds from such exercises. Dilutive options are those that have an exercise price less than the average stock price during
the period.  The following table sets forth the computation of
basic and diluted income loss per common share:  Year Ended December 31 2004 2003

December 31, 2004 and 2002, we excluded 471,162 and 309,120 common stock equivalents, respectively, from the calculation of diluted net income loss per share because such securities were antidilutive in those periods due to the net losses from
continuing operations. Additionally, employee stock options to purchase 2,772,388, 1,724,232 and 4,126,940 shares in the years ended December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively, were outstanding, but were not included in the computation of
diluted income loss per share because the exercise price of the stock options was greater than the average share price of the common shares and, therefore, the effect would have been antidilutive.  Comprehensive Income  Comprehensive income consists of two components, net income and other comprehensive income. Other comprehensive income
refers to revenue, expenses, gains and losses that under generally accepted accounting principles are recorded as an element of shareholders equity but are excluded from net income. Our other comprehensive income is comprised of foreign
currency translation adjustments from those subsidiaries not using the U.S. dollar as their functional currency and unrealized gains and losses on marketable securities categorized as available-for-sale.  The components of accumulated other comprehensive income was as follows in
thousands:  December 31 2004 2003
Accumulated net unrealized loss on available-for-sale investments 181 21
Accumulated foreign currency translation 929 355 Total accumulated other comprehensive income 748 376

2. New Accounting Pronouncements  In December 2004, the Financial Accounting Standards Board FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting
Standards No. 123 revised 2004 SFAS 123R, Share-Based Payments, that requires companies to expense the value of employee stock options and other forms of share-based compensation. This statement eliminates the ability to
account for share-based compensation transactions using APB No. 25, and requires instead that such transactions be accounted for using a fair-value based method. Under SFAS No. 123R, share-based compensation arrangements, including stock options
and employee stock purchase plans, will result in a cost that will be measured at fair value on the awards grant date, based on the estimated number of awards that are expected to vest. This cost, including the related income tax effects, will
be recognized as the shares vest. Compensation cost for awards that vest would not be reversed if the awards expire without being exercised. The fair value of the awards can be determined using an option-pricing model that appropriately reflects our
specific circumstances and the economics of our transactions. SFAS No. 123R is effective for public companies for periods beginning after June 15, 2005. We are currently evaluating option valuation methodologies and assumptions in light of this
new statement. As such, at this time, we have not estimated the effect of this statement on our results of operations. However, we expect the adoption of SFAS No. 123R to have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.  In December 2004, the FASB issued FASB Staff Position FSP FAS
No. 109-b, Accounting and Disclosure Guidance for the Foreign Earnings Repatriation Provision within the American Jobs Creations Act AJCA of 2004. The AJCA introduces a limited time 85% dividends received deduction
on the repatriation of certain foreign earnings to a U.S. taxpayer repatriation provision, provided certain criteria are met. FSP FAS No. 109-b provides accounting and disclosure guidance for the repatriation provision. We do not anticipate
repatriating earnings from our foreign entities in the foreseeable future and therefore no provision for the tax effect of such repatriation has been made.  Also included in the AJCA is a provision for a tax deduction on qualified production activities. We believe that we may benefit from this provision but
since this special deduction does not come into effect until 2005, we do not have the necessary information to estimate the amount of this deduction at this time.  In November 2004, the FASB issued SFAS No. 151, Inventory Costs, which clarifies the accounting for abnormal amounts
of idle facility expense, freight, handling costs and wasted material. SFAS No. 151 will be effective for inventory costs incurred during fiscal years beginning after June 15, 2005. We do not believe the adoption of SFAS No. 151 will have a material
impact on our financial statements.  In March 2004, the FASB
issued Emerging Issues Task Force EITF Issue No. 03-1, The Meaning of Other-Than-Temporary Impairment and its Application to Certain Investments. EITF No. 03-1 establishes additional disclosure requirements for each category of
SFAS No. 115 investments in a loss position and provides guidance for assessing impairment losses on investments. Effective for years ending after December 15, 2003, companies must disclose the aggregate amount of unrealized losses and the aggregate
related fair value of their investments with unrealized losses. Those investments are required to be segregated by those in a loss position for less than twelve months and those in a loss position for greater than 12 months. Additionally, certain
qualitative disclosures are required to clarify a circumstance whereby an investments fair value that is below cost is not considered other than temporary. In September 2004, the FASB delayed the provisions of EITF No. 03-1 which provide
guidance on evaluating whether an impairment is other than temporary. The disclosure requirements remain effective for annual financial statements. Although we will continue to evaluate the application of EITF No. 03-1, management does not currently
believe adoption will have a material impact on our results of operations or financial position.  3. Businesses Acquired  On October 28, 2004, we acquired Information Management Research, Inc. IMR, an Englewood, Colorado company. IMRs Alchemy product line, which helps organizations capture, archive and retrieve business information enables
us to provide complete solutions for business information delivery to our worldwide enterprise customers. Under the terms of the acquisition agreement, we acquired IMR for a total of $319 million. We paid $264 million in cash, including
transaction costs of approximately $12 million and assumed liabilities of $56 million, net of cash acquired of $142,000. The assumed liabilities include $31 million of deferred tax liabilities related to purchased intangibles not deductible for
tax purposes, deferred revenue of $12 million and accounts payable and other accrued liabilities of $13 million. The acquisition of IMR has been accounted for as a purchase. On the acquisition date, $50 million of the purchase price was deposited
in a third-party escrow account for two years as security for certain post-closing obligations of the IMR shareholders, including indemnification obligations. In connection with the acquisition we adopted a plan to consolidate all IMR finance and
administrative functions to our Bellevue headquarters. As such, as part of the purchase price allocation, we recorded a liability of $116,000 for severance expenses related to the involuntary termination of fourteen employees. 
49 Table of Contents CAPTARIS, INC.  NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Continued 
In accordance with SFAS No. 141, Business Combinations, all identifiable assets and
liabilities were assigned a portion of the cost of the acquisition based on their respective fair values. We engaged a valuation firm to provide an estimated fair value for all identifiable intangible assets including technology, trade name,
distributor relationships and non-compete agreements, using a discounted cash flow model. The determination of fair value is a critical and complex consideration that involves significant assumptions and estimates. These assumptions and estimates
were based on our best judgments and resulted in the allocation of purchase price for this acquisition as detailed below. The excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the assets acquired was allocated to goodwill. Our results of
operations include IMRs results of operations for the period from October 28, 2004 to December 31, 2004.  IMR Purchase Price Allocation:  inthousands

Other assets acquired 7,061 Total purchase price 31,948  All identified
amortizable intangible assets will be amortized on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives, ranging from one to five years. The weighted-average useful life of these assets is approximately 40 years. We will recognize amortization
expense for these intangible assets of approximately $27 million in 2005, $22 million in 2006, $15 million in 2007, $11 million in 2008 and $933,000 in 2009. All of the $160 million allocated to goodwill was assigned to the fax and messaging
reporting unit and is not deductible for tax purposes. Other assets acquired include $47 million of deferred tax-assets, $15 million of accounts receivable, $554,000 of fixed assets and $322,000 of other assets.  The following summarizes the unaudited pro forma results of operations, on a
combined basis, as if our acquisition of IMR occurred January 1, 2003. The pro forma information gives effect to certain adjustments, including amortization of identified intangibles and the change in interest income had the respective acquisition
occurred January 1, 2003. The pro forma financial information does not reflect integration costs, or cost savings or other synergies anticipated as a result of the acquisition. This pro forma information is presented for illustrative purposes only
and is not necessarily indicative of the results of future operations or results that would have been achieved if we had made these acquisitions at the beginning of the specified periods.  Pro Forma Information:  YearEndedDecember31 2004 2003 in thousands Unaudited

On September 30, 2003, we acquired Teamplate, Inc. Teamplate, an Alberta, Canada
corporation. Teamplates product is a business process automation product built on the Microsoft.NET framework for Web services. Teamplates technology extends our business information delivery solutions with streamlined enterprise
application integration, rapid solution deployment, sophisticated business rules processing and integrated process monitoring and metrics. Our results of operations include Teamplates results of operations for the twelve months ended December
31, 2004 and the three months ended December 31, 2003.  Under
the terms of the agreement, we acquired all of the stock of Teamplate for $81 million in cash, issued 574,727 shares of Captaris redeemable common stock valued at approximately $30 million that were issued on October 3, 2003 Note 11 and assumed
liabilities of approximately $837,000, all resulting in an aggregate purchase price of $124 million, including transaction costs of approximately $325,000. Pursuant to the terms of the agreement, we deposited $250,000 in escrow as security for post
closing adjustments related to working capital at September 30, 2003, the payment of a certain liability and the ultimate collection of certain accounts receivable. As of June 30, 2004, each of these adjustments was resolved and accordingly, we
incurred additional goodwill relating to an additional payment of $68,000 to the original investors of Teamplate and a $70,000 purchase price adjustment. The $250,000 escrow balance was returned to us in September 2004.  The redeemable common stock issued in connection with this acquisition was
held in a third-party escrow account for one year as security for certain post closing obligations of the Teamplate shareholders, including indemnification provisions whereby the Teamplate shareholders agreed to indemnify us against claims resulting
from various representations and warranties made by the former Teamplate shareholders. In addition, we agreed to indemnify the Teamplate shareholders against claims resulting from various representations and warranties made by us. At December 31,
2004, there have been no indemnification claims made and the shares have been released from escrow.  As part of the effort to retain the management team of Teamplate, we offered an incentive plan that allows the Teamplate management team to earn a minimum
of $28 million up to a maximum of $83 million over the thirteen quarter period following the completion of the acquisition in September 2003, subject to their continued employment and our success in achieving certain performance targets. Any
incentive compensation earned under this program is recorded as compensation expense in the period earned. Compensation expense related to this incentive program was $654,000 and $300,000 for the years ended December 31, 2004 and 2003, respectively.
In accordance with SFAS No. 141, Business Combinations,
all identifiable assets and liabilities were assigned a portion of the cost of the acquisition based on their respective fair values. We engaged a valuation firm to provide an estimated fair value for all identifiable intangible assets including
workflow server technology, trade name, customer relationships and reseller agreements, using a discounted cash flow model. The determination of fair value is a critical and complex consideration that involves significant assumptions and estimates.
These assumptions and estimates were based on our best judgments and resulted in the allocation of purchase price for this acquisition as detailed below. The excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the assets acquired was allocated to
goodwill.  Teamplate Purchase Price Allocation:

Current assets 1,478 Total purchase price 12,410  The purchase price
allocation set forth above was subject to additional adjustments related to the payment of a certain liability and the ultimate collection of certain accounts receivable. All such adjustments identified during the allocation period changed the
carrying amount of goodwill generated as a result of this acquisition. On December 31, 2003, we increased the carrying value of goodwill related to this acquisition by $151,000 primarily for additional legal fees incurred in connection with the
acquisition and for an additional payment made for the repayment of a note payable assumed in the acquisition at September 30, 2003. During 2004, additional expenses related to the acquisition were incurred and additional goodwill of $138,000 was
recorded for the post-closing adjustments discussed above. 
51 Table of Contents CAPTARIS, INC.  NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Continued 
All identified amortizable intangible assets are amortized on a straight-line basis over their
estimated useful lives, ranging from fifteen months to seven years. The weighted-average useful life of these assets is approximately 65 years. We will recognize amortization expense for these intangible assets of approximately $683,000 during each
of the years ending December 31, 2005 through December 31, 2009 and $513,000 in 2010. All of the $68 million allocated to goodwill was assigned to the fax and messaging reporting unit and is expected to be deductible for tax purposes. 
In August 2002, we acquired the distribution activities, assets and
fifteen employees of our longtime distributor in the Netherlands, OfficeCom B.V. OfficeCom. We paid $416,000 in cash, assumed net liabilities of $146,000 and recorded goodwill of $562,000 in the fax and messaging reporting unit.
On January 3, 2001, we acquired all of the outstanding stock
of Infinite Technologies Infinite, a privately held global supplier of wireless applications and wireless infrastructure solutions for a total consideration of up to $241 million. At closing, we paid approximately $91 million in cash
and issued 1,631,600 shares of common stock valued at $81 million. At the time of closing, we were obligated to pay approximately $29 million in a combination of cash and common stock over the next three years; this obligation was recorded at the
time of closing as a note payable of $14 million net of imputed interest and stock to be issued totaling $15 million. Additionally, we could have paid up to an additional $39 million to the founder of Infinite who became an employee, in a
combination of cash and our common stock under an earn-out arrangement over a period of three years from the date of closing which we would have expensed as compensation expense. We accounted for the business combination as a purchase. In connection
with the acquisition, we recorded a one-time charge in the first quarter of 2001 related to purchased in-process research and development in the amount of $19 million.  In April 2002, the employee resigned and signed a separation agreement under which we paid approximately $15 million in
cash in full satisfaction of all outstanding payments due under the agreement. The remainder of the accrued amounts of the purchase price, $14 million, was recorded as a reduction of goodwill. We also reversed a 2001 accrual for the employees
performance incentive of approximately $700,000, which is reported as a reduction of 2002 research and development expenses.  4. Discontinued Operations  On September 15, 2003, Captaris and our wholly owned subsidiary, MediaTel Corporation Delaware MediaTel, entered into an asset purchase
agreement, effective as of September 1, 2003, to sell the assets of MediaTel to PTEK Holdings, Inc. PTEK and its wholly owned subsidiary, Xpedite Systems, Inc. Xpedite. MediaTel provided outsourced e-document delivery
services. Under the terms of the agreement, Xpedite paid us $149 million in cash and assumed certain liabilities. In June 2004, Xpedite paid us $232,000 of additional proceeds, net of income taxes of $152,000, in connection with a post-closing net
working capital adjustment as prescribed in the asset purchase agreement. We are contingently obligated to indemnify Xpedite against claims resulting from various representations and warranties made by us. At December 31, 2004 no indemnification
claims were outstanding. Concurrent with the sale transaction, we also entered into license and reseller agreements with Xpedite pursuant to which we will license our fax-to-mail technology to Xpedite in return for minimum compensation of $20
million over a three year period, and both parties agreed to cooperate in providing mutual resale opportunities for each others products and services. In 2004, we recognized $250,000 of revenue in connection with these agreements. 
For the year ended December 31, 2004, we recognized additional gain on the
sale of MediaTel assets which consisted of additional proceeds of $232,000, net of income taxes; a Federal income tax refund of $483,000, including associated interest income, less professional fees, both net of income taxes; and legal fees incurred
in defense of various legal proceedings see Note 19 of $68,000, net of expected insurance reimbursements, both net of income taxes. For the year ended December 31, 2003, we recognized a gain on the sale of the assets of MediaTel of approximately
$58 million, net of income taxes of $38 million. In accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, MediaTels results of operations, net of income taxes, for the years ended December 31, 2003 and 2002 have been reclassified to
discontinued operations.

On September 29, 2003, we announced the sale of our
CallXpress product line, which primarily includes the Captaris voice and unified messaging assets, to Sound Advantage, LLC Sound Advantage, a California limited liability company.  Under the terms of the agreement, Sound Advantage acquired the CallXpress
product line for $25 million in cash and will pay up to an additional $10 million per year over a three year period beginning January 1, 2004, pursuant to an earn out arrangement, which is based on achievement of specified revenue targets for the
CallXpress business. In addition, we were issued a 10 percent equity interest in Applied Voice and Speech Technologies, Inc. AVST, a newly formed company established by Sound Advantage to acquire and operate the combined CallXpress and
Sound Advantage businesses. RightFax will continue to be a part of AVSTs Unified Messaging offering, based on an ongoing OEM agreement. Also, we agreed to indemnify AVST against claims resulting from various representations and warranties made
by us. At December 31, 2004, no indemnification claims have been made by AVST. We recognized a gain on the sale of CallXpress of approximately $22 million in 2003.  Pursuant to the terms of the agreement, AVST must notify us within 60 days of December 31, 2004 as to whether they achieved
certain revenue targets and therefore owe us an additional $10 million. If AVST did achieve the revenue targets, we will record this payment as additional gain on the sale of CallXpress in the first quarter of 2005. This gain will be classified on
our income statement as a reduction to operating expenses in 2005. On March 2, 2005, we received a report from AVST, and payment of $10 million, confirming achievement of the revenue target for 2004.  Components of the CallXpress product line reflected in our consolidated
statements of operations are detailed below. Certain components of operating expenses directly attributable to the CallXpress product line could not be separated from other product lines. Only direct revenue and cost of revenue directly attributable

the years ended December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively. Amortization expense for intangible assets excluding certain technology and license agreements recorded in operating expenses was $683,000, $275,000 and $942,000 for the years ended
December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively. Based on the current amount of intangible assets subject to amortization, the estimated amortization expense for 2005 through 2008 is as follows: $37 million for 2005, $32 million for 2006, $23
million in 2007, $19 million in 2008, $17 million in 2009 and $602,000 in 2010.  On October 28, 2004, we acquired $89 million of intangible assets in connection with the acquisition of IMR. On September 30, 2003, we acquired approximately $49 million of intangible assets in connection with the
acquisition of Teamplate. See Note 3.  In connection with our
decision to incorporate the mobility technology associated with the Infinite product line directly into our business information delivery products effective January 2005 the intangible asset related to the Infinite Technology trade name
became impaired and an impairment charge of approximately $488,000 was recorded in the fourth quarter of 2004. In the second quarter of 2002, we engaged a valuation firm to provide an estimated fair value of each of our intangible, long-lived assets
using a discounted cash flow model. The determination of fair value is a critical and complex consideration when assessing impairment under SFAS No. 144, Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets, which involves
significant assumptions and estimates. These assumptions and estimates were based on our best judgments. As a result, we determined that certain intangible assets acquired from Infinite Technologies in January 2001 were impaired. Accordingly, we
recorded an impairment charge of $55 million for the mobile delivery product line in the second quarter of 2002. This impairment charge consisted of a write-down of core technology of approximately $24 million, a write-down of customer base and
marketing channel of approximately $22 million and a write-down of trade names of approximately $849,000. No impairment charges were recognized in 2003.  In April 2002, we entered into a nonexclusive license agreement with AudioFax IP LLC, settling a patent infringement suit filed by AudioFax on November
30, 2001. We paid a one-time fee to license the technology until the patents expire in 2008 and 2011. In the first quarter of 2002, we recorded a charge of $875,000, reflecting managements assessment of the fair value of the portion of the
license fee that relates to prior years. The remaining balance of the license fee was capitalized and is being amortized over the remaining life of the licensors patents. Included in total amortization expense recorded in cost of revenue
discussed above, amortization expense related to this license was $90,000 for the years ended December 31, 2004 and 2003 and $67,000 for the year ended December 31, 2002.

10. Line of Credit 
We have a $10 million cash secured revolving line of credit which is reserved for letters of credit. As of December 31, 2004, we have utilized the
letter of credit capacity in conjunction with our corporate headquarters lease. We have placed $10 million in a restricted certificate of deposit with the bank that supports the letter of credit. Prior to August 2004, we had a $40 million
unsecured revolving line of credit, of which $20 million was for unsecured borrowings and $20 million was reserved for letters of credit. We did not borrow under our line of credit. The line of credit expired in August 2004, and we renewed $10
million of the line used to secure the corporate headquarters lease as discussed above.  11. Redeemable Common Stock  On October 3,
2003, in connection with the acquisition of Teamplate on September 30, 2003, we issued 574,727 shares of redeemable common stock valued at approximately $30 million. On the first anniversary of the closing, each Teamplate shareholder had the option
to require us to purchase all of the shareholders portion of the Captaris common stock issued in the transaction at a price per share of $522 per share if a the average of the last sale price of the common stock for the 20 trading days
prior to September 30, 2004, was less than $522 per share; and b the last sale price of the common stock on September 30, 2004, was less than $522 per share. At December 31, 2003, we recorded the issuance of this common stock as Redeemable
Common Stock on the balance sheet. On October 25, 2004, 571,261 shares were returned to us to be repurchased for an aggregate amount of approximately $30 million. The stock redemption had no impact on the final purchase price adjustment for
Teamplate.  12. Shareholders Equity  Stock Option Plans  The 1989 Restated Option Plan  The Captaris 1989 Restated Stock Option Plan the 1989 Plan provides for the issuance of incentive or
non-statutory stock options to employees, directors, officers and other agents of the Company. Incentive stock options are granted at an exercise price of not less than the fair value per share of the common stock on the date of grant. The exercise
price for non-statutory stock options may be at the discretion of the Board of Directors; however, as of December 31, 2004, no stock options have been granted for less than fair market value on the date of grant. The 1989 Plan was adopted and
amended to replace several expired option plans. Options under the 1989 Plan have a term of one to ten years from the date of grant and vest at the rate of 25% after one year and 20833% per month thereafter. We have authorized 12,900,000 shares of
common stock for issuance under the 1989 Plan.  The 2000
Non-Officer Employee Stock Compensation Plan  Under the
2000 Non-Officer Employee Stock Compensation Plan the 2000 Plan, we may issue non-qualified options to purchase common stock to employees and external consultants other than officers and directors. These options generally are granted
at the fair market value of our common stock at the date of grant. Options under the 2000 Plan have a term of ten years from the date of grant and vest at the rate of 25% after one year and 20833% per month thereafter. We have authorized 5,000,000
shares of common stock for issuance under the 2000 Plan.  At
December 31, 2004, we have the following number of common stock shares available for future grant under our stock option plans:  1989 Plan

Pursuant to a stock repurchase plan approved by our Board
of Directors, we repurchased $135 million, $31 million and $34 million of our common stock in 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively. In January 2005, the Board of Directors approved an $110 million increase to its previously announced stock
repurchase program. Including the increase, approximately $150 million remains available to repurchase shares. We may repurchase shares in the future subject to open trading windows, overall market conditions, stock prices and our cash position and
requirements going forward. The repurchase program will continue until the earlier of a such time when the maximum dollar amount authorized has been utilized or b our Board of Directors elects to discontinue the repurchase program. 
13. Loans to Non-Officer Employees  Non-officer employee loans were made under a program to allow non-officer
employees to purchase our common stock in the open market in 2000. The unsecured loans bear interest at the lowest rate allowed by the Internal Revenue Service. Loans from non-officer employees were $218,000 as of December 31, 2002. During 2003 and
2002, we wrote down the value of these loans approximately $7,000 and $476,000, respectively, to reflect their expected net realizable value. In 2003, we canceled 13,368 shares of common stock in connection with these loans. At December 31, 2004 and
2003, none of these loans were outstanding. 
58 Table of Contents CAPTARIS, INC.  NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Continued 
14. OEM Agreement  In January 2002, we entered into an OEM agreement with Cisco Systems, Inc. Cisco, under which we granted Cisco an exclusive third-party
license to certain enabling technology. The agreement provided for quarterly payments to be made by Cisco through mid-2005. However, the timing and amount of these payments were subject to a number of conditions, some of which were beyond our
control, including Ciscos ability to successfully implement the technology. We received a payment of $25 million in 2002. We recognized $33 million in revenue from this agreement in 2002.  In October 2003, we reached an agreement with Cisco Systems to accelerate the
conclusion of our OEM contract. Pursuant to the agreement, Cisco paid us $120 million as payment in full for all remaining unpaid aggregate license fees, plus an additional 320 hours of support and training services for a period not exceeding
twelve months, valued at $100,000. As a result of this agreement, $119 million was recorded as license revenue in the fourth quarter of 2003. Training revenue related to this OEM agreement is recognized as the service is rendered. Support revenue
is recognized ratably from October of 2003 through the first nine months of 2004. As of December 31, 2004, all the revenue related to the support and training was recognized.  15. Commitments and Contingencies  Leases  We lease our office space and certain equipment under non-cancelable operating leases, which expire on various dates between March 2005 and February 2008. We sublease a portion of our office space to third parties.
Rent expense under the non-cancelable leases was $27 million, $23 million and $31 million in 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively. Certain of our lease agreements provide for scheduled rent increases over the lease term. Minimum rental expenses are
recognized on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease. Future minimum lease payments under non-cancelable operating leases and future rental income under non-cancelable subleases having initial or remaining lease terms in excess of one year
at December 31, 2004 were as follows in thousands:  FutureLeasePayments

We periodically receive letters and other communications
from third parties asserting patent rights and requesting royalty payments and will probably receive additional claims in the future. Over the past six years, we have been involved in intermittent communications with Avaya, which was spun off from
Lucent Technologies in 2001. Over this period of time, Lucent/Avaya asserted that we were infringing on their patents or technology, eventually identifying 10 patents as including claims that allegedly cover our current or former products and/or
services. Several communications and meetings between us and Lucent/Avaya have occurred. We have also been in communication with BellSouth since December of 2001, at which time BellSouth asserted that we were infringing on two of its patents.
Analysis of both patents in light of our current and former products/services is still underway. The last communication with representatives of BellSouth was on June 19, 2003. The ultimate outcome of these matters cannot presently be determined. As
such, we have not recorded an accrual for these exposures. Accordingly, the ultimate resolution of these matters could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, cash flows and financial condition. 
59 Table of Contents CAPTARIS, INC.  NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Continued 
Indemnifications  Pursuant to the terms of the sale of our MediaTel assets to PTEK and the sale of our CallXpress product line to AVST in September 2003, we agreed to
indemnify these two parties against various representations and warranties we made in connection with these transactions. At December 31, 2004, no claims for indemnification were outstanding from PTEK or AVST.  In the normal course of business to facilitate sales of our products, we
indemnify other parties, including customers, resellers, distributors, OEMs and parties to other transactions with the Company, with respect to certain matters. We have agreed to hold the other party harmless against losses arising from a breach of
representations or covenants, or out of intellectual property infringement or other claims made by certain parties. We evaluate estimated losses for such indemnifications under SFAS No. 5, Accounting for Contingencies, as interpreted by FIN
No. 45. We consider such factors as the degree of probability of an unfavorable outcome and the ability to make a reasonable estimate of the amount of the loss. To date, we have not encountered material costs as a result of such obligations and have
not accrued any liabilities related to such indemnifications in our financial statements. See Note 19.  16. Restructuring Charges, Severance and Voluntary Layoff Program  Severance expense unrelated to a restructuring charge and for voluntary layoff programs was recorded in cost of revenue, research and development and
selling, general and administrative expenses as follows:  In September 2003, we recorded a charge of approximately $624,000 in selling, general and administrative expenses for severance expense. These costs were paid as of December 31,
2003.  In October 2002, we announced to our employees a voluntary layoff program, which subsequently resulted in a reduction of approximately 40 employees or 90% of our workforce, at a
cost of $670,000. Approximately $561,000 of the total charge was paid in 2003 and the remainder was paid in 2002. Allocation of the costs of this program to operating expenses is as follows:  Year EndedDecember31,2002 inthousands

were recorded separately on the statement of operations as follows:  In September 2003, in conjunction with the sale of our CallXpress product line, we recorded a restructuring charge of approximately $423,000 for severance and related benefits for
terminated employees associated with CallXpress. All of these expenses were paid as of December 31, 2003.  In January 2002, we announced a reduction of our workforce, affecting approximately 90 employees, or 180% of the total workforce. This reduction in force resulted in the
recognition of a restructuring charge recorded in continuing operations of $20 million related to severance, impairment of certain assets and non-cancelable lease obligations; and a restructuring charge recorded in discontinued operations of
$100,000 related to severance. All costs associated with this reduction in force were paid as of December 31, 2002.

17. Income Taxes  Income loss from continuing operations before income tax expense benefit consists of the following:  Year Ended December 31 2004 2003 2002 in thousands U.S. 2,031 10,247 13,280 Foreign 1,172 349 Income loss from continuing operations before income tax expense benefit 3,203 9,898 13,280  We are subject to
income taxes in both the United States of America and numerous foreign jurisdictions. Significant judgment is required in evaluating our tax positions and determining our provision for income taxes. During the ordinary course of business, there are
many transactions and calculations for which the ultimate tax determination is uncertain. We establish accruals for tax-related uncertainties based on estimates of whether, and to the extent which, additional taxes and interest will be due. These
accruals are established when, despite our belief that our tax return positions are fully supportable, we believe that certain positions are likely to be challenged and may not be sustained on review by tax authorities. We adjust these accruals in
light of changing facts and circumstances, such as the closing of a tax audit or the expiration of statutes of limitations. The provision for income taxes includes the impact of potential tax claims and changes to accruals that we consider
appropriate, as well as the related penalties and interest.  The items accounting for the difference between income taxes computed at the U.S. statutory rate and the effective tax rate consisted of the following:  Year Ended December 31 2004 2003 2002 Amount Amount TaxRate Amount in thousands Income tax expense benefit at statutory rate 1,121 350 3,464 350 4,648 350 Research and experimentation credit 363 27 Nondeductible goodwill amortization and merger costs 8 01 Nontaxable interest income 187 58 14 01 323 25 State income taxes and other 90 28 222 22 368 28 Extra-territorial income exclusion benefit 334 25 Income tax contingency 1,413 441 Other items 32 10 Income tax expense benefit 2,663 831 3,680 372 6,036 455  Income tax expense

and state provisions do not reflect the tax savings resulting from deductions associated with our stock option plans. These savings were approximately $400,000 and $720,000 in 2004 and 2003 respectively and were credited to additional paid in
capital. Tax savings from these deductions were not significant in 2002. The income tax benefit in 2004 includes a benefit of $14 million relating to the reversal of income tax contingencies as a result of the expiration of certain statutory
limitations.

Income from discontinued operations before income tax expense see Note 4 was $147,000, $104
million and $42 million for the years ended December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively, and was all derived in the U.S. The following table is a reconciliation from the U.S. statutory rate to the effective tax rate for discontinued operations:

from temporary differences relating to items that are expensed for financial reporting, but are not currently deductible for income tax purposes. Significant components of our deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities as of December 31, 2004
and 2003 are as follows:  December 31 2004 2003 in thousands Deferred tax assets Accounts receivable allowances 515 484 Inventories 390 368 Depreciation 30 Accrued compensation, benefits and stock-based compensation 500 417 Amortization of intangibles 1,405 1,705 Deferred revenue 1,905 492 Net operating losses 5,147 90 Other 11 140 Total deferred tax assets 9,881 3,696 Deferred tax liabilities Depreciation 415 250 Capitalized software 153 Intangible assets not deductible for tax 3,130 330 Total deferred tax liabilities 3,698 580 Net deferred tax assets 6,183 3,116  At December 31, 2004,
we have available unused net operating losses that may be applied against future taxable income of $51 million. These net operating losses consist of international losses of $482,000 that do not expire, Federal losses of $44 million that expire
from 2019 to 2024, and State losses of $231,000 that expire from 2006 to 2022. We believe that there is sufficient positive evidence to support our conclusion not to record a valuation allowance against these net operating losses. We believe that we
will utilize the loss carry forwards in the future because we have had a history of pre-tax income and the Internal Revenue Code IRC Section 382 limitation for the acquired net operating loss of IMR of $47 million covers approximately
ten years of future operations, which is well within the statute of limitations for these losses.

years ended December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002.  19. Legal Proceedings
One of the services provided by MediaTel Corporation, a
wholly owned subsidiary of Captaris, was the transmission of facsimiles to travel industry participants on behalf of travel service providers. MediaTel held a license to use a database supplied by NFO PLOG and then Northstar Travel Media that listed
recipients for these facsimiles. All of the assets of MediaTel were sold to a subsidiary of PTEK Holdings, Inc. PTEK on September 1, 2003. On or about July 29, 2003, Travel 100 Group, Inc. Travel 100 filed three lawsuits
in Circuit Court in Cook County, Illinois, one against Mediterranean Shipping Company Mediterranean, the second against The Melrose Hotel Company Melrose and the third against Oceania Cruises Oceania. On or
about April 13, 2004, a fourth lawsuit was filed by another travel agent, Travel Travel Kirkwood, Inc. Kirkwood, against Oceania Cruises. That case was subsequently removed to the U.S. District Court, Eastern District of Missouri. The
complaints are substantially identical in form and allege violations of the Telephone Consumer Protection Act in connection with the receipt of facsimile advertisements that were transmitted by MediaTel. Each of the Travel 100 complaints seeks
injunctive relief and unspecified damages and certification as a class action on behalf of Travel 100 and others similarly situated throughout the United States that received the facsimile advertisements. The Kirkwood complaint seeks injunctive
relief and unspecified damages but does not seek to certify a class action. Under the Telephone Consumer Protection Act, a court can impose liability of $500 per fax on a party that sends a fax without the consent of the recipient. A court can
increase the liability to $1,500 per fax if the sending of the fax is willful.  In its answer filed on September 23, 2003, Mediterranean named Captaris as a third-party defendant and asserted that, to the extent that Mediterranean is liable, Captaris should be liable under theories of
indemnification, contribution or breach of contract for any damages suffered by Mediterranean. Similarly, in its answer filed on October 14, 2003, Melrose named Captaris, as well as PTEK, as third-party defendants based on allegations of breach of
contract, indemnification and contribution. On September 8, 2004 and November 18, 2004, Oceania filed Answers and Third-Party Complaints against Captaris and MediaTel in the Travel 100 and Kirkwood cases, respectively, making similar allegations to
those made in the other two cases in its counts for fraud, indemnification and contribution. 
63 Table of Contents CAPTARIS, INC.  NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Continued 
In response to Mediterraneans third-party complaint, we filed our answer on November 3, 2003,
denying the allegations filed by Mediterranean and further answering by way of affirmative defenses that to the extent we are found liable for any damages allegedly suffered by plaintiffs or any third-party plaintiffs in this action, we are entitled
to indemnification and/or contribution from other non-parties to this action. We filed similar answers to the Melrose complaint on November 20, 2003 and the Oceania complaints on or about January 19, 2005 and January 12, 2005 respectively. Both
Captaris and MediaTel have denied any liability in the cases because, among other facts and defenses, MediaTel understood that the database and lists of travel agent recipients to whom faxes were sent had authorized that information could be sent to
them by fax. Based on Captaris analysis to date, we estimate that there were approximately 500,000 faxes sent relating to the Mediterranean case and approximately 200,000 faxes sent relating to the Melrose case. As of the date of this Annual
Report on Form 10-K, we have not yet determined how many faxes were sent relating to the Oceania cases.  In Oceania, plaintiff, Travel 100, filed a motion to voluntarily dismiss the Oceania complaint because, according to Travel 100s counsel, Travel 100
no longer wanted to participate in the prosecution of that case. Plaintiffs counsel requested that it be given 90 days to find another plaintiff to pursue the claim that Travel 100 had filed, and that if it could not find a plaintiff within
that period then the complaint would be dismissed. Captaris and Oceania opposed allowing plaintiffs counsel 90 days to find a substitute plaintiff. On March 24, 2005, the Court agreed with Captaris and Oceania and dismissed Travel 100s
complaint against Oceania, without allowing 90 days to find a substitute plaintiff. The Court in turn dismissed Oceanias complaint against Captaris and MediaTel without prejudice. Accordingly, the Oceania case is no longer pending. 
Discovery is ongoing in all other cases and the parties are in the process
of working out a schedule for class certification briefing. We expect the plaintiffs in the Mediterranean case to push for a hearing on class certification in the second half of 2005.  We have tendered these claims to our general liability insurance carrier and coverage has been disputed. Even if coverage is
determined to apply, since the potential liability of these claims is substantially in excess of our coverage limits, there can be no assurance that our coverage will be sufficient to satisfy any damages we are required to pay.  We intend to vigorously defend each of these cases, but litigation is subject
to numerous uncertainties and we are unable to predict the ultimate outcome of any of these matters. Moreover, the amount of any potential liability in connection with these cases will depend, to a large extent, on whether a class is certified, and
if one is certified, on what the scope of that class will be, neither of which can be predicted at this time. We have not recorded a liability related to these cases. However, there is no guarantee that we will not determine in the future that an
accrual is required or that we will not be required to pay damages in respect of these cases in the future, either of which could materially and adversely affect our results of operations, cash flows and financial condition for the quarter or year
in which any accrual is recorded or any damages are paid.  On
September 25, 2002, Lan-Aces, Inc. filed a complaint in the District Court of Harris County, Texas against the Company seeking damages of $600,000 plus attorneys fees for breach of contract. We removed the action to Federal Court in the
Southern District of Texas on October 18, 2002. On January 23, 2003, Lan-Aces, Inc. filed an amended complaint adding unspecified statutory damages under the Copyright Act. The amended complaint alleged that we either breached an alleged agreement
between the plaintiff and Infinite Technologies, Inc., or infringed plaintiffs copyright, with respect to software incorporated in the MailandNews.com Website, a free Internet service acquired as part of the Infinite Technologies
acquisition and subsequently transferred to an unrelated third party. In July 2003, the matter was resolved by settlement between the parties, pursuant to which we agreed to pay an immaterial amount to the plaintiff. Pursuant to settlement, the case
has been dismissed.

Item 3. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES  Disclosure
Controls and Procedures  Under the supervision and with
the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer the CEO and Chief Financial Officer the CFO, we have evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the
period covered by this report. Based on our evaluation, our CEO and CFO concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective as of December 31, 2004 to ensure that information required to be disclosed in this report is recorded,
processed, summarized and reported within the appropriate time periods. The basis for this determination was that, as discussed below, we have identified material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting, which we view as an
integral part of our disclosure controls and procedures. As a result, additional review, evaluation and oversight were required on the part of management to ensure we adequately compensated for the weaknesses in our internal control over financial
reporting.  Managements Report On Internal Control Over Financial
Reporting  We have not yet completed our assessment of our
internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2004. As a result, we have not published managements report on internal control over financial reporting in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, as required by Section 404 of the
Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 and Item 308a of Regulation S-K, or the related attestation report of our independent registered public accounting firm required under Item 308b of Regulation S-K. In November 2004, the SEC issued an exemptive order
providing a 45-day extension for the filing of these reports. We have elected to rely on this 45-day extension and intend to file these reports in an amendment to this Annual Report on Form 10-K on or before April 29, 2005.  Information Management Research, Inc. IMR has been excluded
from managements assessment because it was acquired by us in a business combination on October 28, 2004 and it is not possible for management to conduct an assessment of IMRs internal control over financial reporting in the period
between the consummation date and due date of managements assessment. IMRs total assets were 237% of our consolidated assets and 24% of our consolidated net revenue as of and for the year ended December 31, 2004.  Based on our assessment to date, utilizing the criteria set forth in the
framework in Internal Control - Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission, we have identified three weaknesses described below which constitute material weaknesses in our internal
control over financial reporting. As a result, our management will conclude in their annual report that our internal control over financial reporting was not effective as of December 31, 2004. We believe that upon completion of their audit, our
independent registered public accounting firm will issue an adverse opinion with respect to the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2004.  A material weakness is a significant deficiency as defined in PCAOB Auditing Standard No. 2, or combination of significant
deficiencies, that results in there being more than a remote likelihood that a material misstatement of the annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected.  We have identified the following material weaknesses:  1. Management has determined that a material weakness exists in that our culture did not establish and promote an
environment that results in effective internal control over financial reporting and the generation of reliable financial statements. This material weakness led to additional material weaknesses, as discussed below, that resulted in adjustments and
reclassifications to our consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2004. There was insufficient emphasis on assessing the impact of business changes on our internal control over financial reporting, which includes
two divestitures, the acquisition of new domestic and international businesses and product lines, and a broadening and diversification of our business. 
66 Table of Contents
This material weakness also resulted in insufficient information systems support for financial reporting,
the inability to effectively prepare for the impact of acquisitions and divestitures on the financial reporting function, a persistent inadequacy in the number of accounting personnel with appropriate technical expertise, and in past years, the
restatement of our financial statements.  To remediate the
material weakness noted above, management plans to implement a periodic business risk assessment process to ensure the internal control environment is appropriately updated and monitored to reflect business changes. This process will be led by
executive management and an assessment will be presented to the Board of Directors in the first half of 2005 and at least annually thereafter.  2. Management has determined, based on our assessment to date, that a material weakness also exists in the information systems. The information systems do
not appropriately address the requirements necessary for preparation of timely and accurate financial reports and do not sufficiently support the finance function resulting in adjustments and reclassifications to our consolidated financial
statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2004. The underlying data reporting structure utilized in the financial reporting application does not adequately address our reporting requirements. The financial application and related
information applications and systems are not sufficiently robust and comprehensive, resulting in a lack of automation in the financial close and related financial processes.  To remediate this material weakness, management plans to conduct a strategic assessment of required financial and operating
information requirements and information systems to adequately support the finance function and our operations. We expect to complete this assessment in the first half of 2005. We expect to implement a revision to our data architecture for our
financial system application and related systems by the third quarter of 2005. Plans are also underway to implement new applications or replace existing applications and to streamline and automate manual business processes.  3. Management has also determined, based on our assessment to date, that a
lack of sufficient and specialized technical accounting personnel is a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting. This weakness gave rise to the following control deficiencies, each of which resulted in adjustments and
reclassifications to our consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2004:  Controls over software revenue recognition were not effective to determine the appropriate application of authoritative accounting literature related to a software contract with
exchange rights.  Controls over non-routine or complex transactions were not effective to properly evaluate and account for transactions associated with an acquisition. Specifically, there were
errors in recording the revenue and cost of revenue for the fair value of acquired deferred revenue related to the support contracts assumed in the IMR acquisition.  Controls over the calculation of the income tax provision, taxes payable and deferred income tax accounts were not effective. Specifically, supervisory controls did not identify
errors in supporting account reconciliations and the application of the appropriate statutory tax requirements.  Controls over the financial close process were not effective. Specifically, sufficient review procedures were not performed resulting in several adjustments to the financial
statements for the fourth quarter and for the year ended December 31, 2004.  To remediate this material weakness, management is reassessing its accounting and finance resources to ensure that we have the sufficient depth of resources and technical expertise. In the first half of 2005, we
expect to expand staffing and engage additional third parties to provide ongoing technical advice. 
67 Table of Contents
Management has discussed the material weaknesses and related corrective actions described above with the
Audit Committee and our independent registered public accounting firm. Other than as described above, we are not aware of any other material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting. However, there can be no assurance that, in
completing our assessment, we will not identify additional significant deficiencies, and that any such deficiencies, either alone or in combination with others, will not be considered additional material weaknesses.  Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting  As discussed above, we have identified material weaknesses in our internal
control over financial reporting. Although we have not fully remediated the material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting, we have made and will continue to make, improvements to our policies, procedures, systems and staff who
have significant roles in internal control to address the internal control deficiencies identified by us and our independent registered public accounting firm. 
We implemented a change to our internal control over financial reporting in the fourth quarter of 2004 by centralizing our international accounting and
cash management functions and supporting processes to our headquarters in Bellevue, Washington.  Except for the improvement noted above, there have been no other changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the quarter ended
December 31, 2004 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. We intend to continue to improve and enhance the design and operation of our internal control processes
and procedures and to upgrade staff to strengthen our internal controls.
