Managements Statement of Responsibility for Financial Statements 
FactSets consolidated financial statements are prepared by management, which is responsible for their fairness, integrity and objectivity. The
accompanying financial statements have been prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. applied on a consistent basis and include amounts that are estimates and judgments. All historical financial information in
this Annual Report on Form 10-K is consistent with the accompanying financial statements. FactSet maintains accounting systems, including
internal accounting controls, designed to provide reasonable assurance of the reliability of financial records and the protection of assets. The concept of reasonable assurance is based on recognition that the cost of a system should not exceed the
related benefits. The effectiveness of those systems depends primarily upon the careful selection of financial and other managers, clear delegation of authority and assignment of accountability, inculcation of high business ethics and
conflict-of-interest standards, policies and procedures for coordinating the management of corporate resources, and the leadership and commitment of top management. In compliance with Section404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, FactSet
assessed its internal control over financial reporting and issued a report see below. PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, an independent registered
public accounting firm, has completed an integrated audit of FactSets fiscal 2010, 2009 and 2008 consolidated financial statements and of its internal control over financial reporting as of August31, 2010 in accordance with the standards
of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board United States as stated in their report appearing on page 53. The Audit Committee of the
Board of Directors, which consists solely of independent non-employee directors, is responsible for overseeing the functioning of the accounting system and related controls and the preparation of annual financial statements. The Audit Committee
periodically meets with management and the independent accountants to review and evaluate their accounting, auditing and financial reporting activities and responsibilities, including managements assessment of internal control over financial
reporting. The independent registered public accounting firm has full and free access to the Audit Committee and met with the committee, with and without management present. Managements Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting Management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as defined in Rules13a-15fand 15d-15funder the Exchange Act.Under
the supervision and with the participation of the Companys management, including its principal executive officer and principal financial officer, the Company conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of its internal control over financial
reporting based on criteria established in the framework in Internal ControlIntegrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission.Based on this evaluation, the Companys
management concluded that its internal control over financial reporting was effective as of August31, 2010. PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, has audited the effectiveness of FactSets internal
control over financial reporting and has issued a report on the Companys internal control over financial reporting, which is included in their report on the following page. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject
to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.  s/PHILIP A.

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm 
To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of FactSet Research Systems Inc. In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements listed in the accompanying index present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of FactSet Research Systems Inc. and its
subsidiaries at August31, 2010 and 2009, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended August31, 2010 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United
States of America. In addition, in our opinion, the financial statement schedule listed in the accompanying index presents fairly, in all material respects, the information set forth therein when read in conjunction with the related consolidated
financial statements. Also in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of August31, 2010, based on criteria established in Internal Control Integrated
Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission COSO. The Companys management is responsible for these financial statements and financial statement schedule, for maintaining effective internal
control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Managements Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to
express opinions on these financial statements, on the financial statement schedule, and on the Companys internal control over financial reporting based on our integrated audits. We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the
Public Company Accounting Oversight Board United States. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement and whether effective
internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audits of the financial statements included examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the
accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, and evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over
financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other procedures as
we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions. A companys
internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted
accounting principles. A companys internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that ipertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions
and dispositions of the assets of the company; iiprovide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that
receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and iiiprovide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized
acquisition, use, or disposition of the companys assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. Because of its
inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of
changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.  s/ PRICEWATERHOUSECOOPERS LLP PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP

OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES Financial Accounting Standards Board FASB Establishes Accounting
Standards Codification In June 2009, FASB issued Accounting Standards Update 2009-01, Generally Accepted Accounting Principles,
which establishes the FASB Accounting Standards Codification the Codification or ASC as the official single source of authoritative U.S. generally accepted accounting principles GAAP. All existing accounting
standards are superseded. All other accounting guidance not included in the Codification is considered non-authoritative. The Codification also includes all relevant SEC guidance organized using the same topical structure in separate sections within
the Codification. The FASB does not issue new standards in the form of Statements, FASB Staff Positions or Emerging Issues Task Force Abstracts. Instead, it issues Accounting Standards Updates ASU which serve to update the
Codification, provide background information about the guidance and provide the basis for conclusions on the changes to the Codification. The Codification is not intended to change GAAP, but does change the way GAAP is organized and presented. The
Codification was effective beginning September1, 2009 and the principal impact on the Companys consolidated financial statements is limited to disclosures as all references to authoritative accounting literature is referenced in
accordance with the Codification. The significant accounting policies of the Company and its subsidiaries are summarized below.
Basis of Presentation The accompanying consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its wholly owned subsidiaries. All intercompany activity and balances have been eliminated from the consolidated
financial statements. The presentation of certain prior year amounts in the Consolidated Statements of Financial Condition regarding deferred taxes have been reclassified to conform to the current years presentation. These reclassifications
had no effect on the Companys previously reported consolidated operating income, net income or stockholders equity. 
Basis of Financial Statements and Use of Estimates The Companys consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. The preparation of consolidated financial statements and related
disclosures in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities
at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Significant estimates have been made in areas that include receivable reserves, valuation of goodwill, useful lives and valuation
of fixed and intangible assets, accrued compensation, income and other taxes, stock-based compensation and allocation of purchase price to assets and liabilities acquired. The Company bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other
assumptions that are believed to be reasonable, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities. Actual results could differ from those estimates. 
58 Table of Contents
Revenue
Recognition The Companys revenues are derived from month-to-month subscriptions to services such as workstations also
referred to as users, content and applications. Primarily all clients are invoiced monthly to reflect the actual services provided. Remaining clients are invoiced quarterly, annually or biannually in advance. Subscription revenue is earned each
month as the service is rendered to clients on a monthly basis. FactSet recognizes revenue when the client subscribes to FactSet services, the service has been rendered and earned during the month, the amount of the subscription is fixed and
determinable based on established rates quoted on an annualized basis and collectibility is reasonably assured. A provision for billing adjustments and cancellation of services is estimated and accounted for as a reduction of revenue, with a
corresponding reduction to accounts receivable. Cost of Services
Cost of services is composed of cash and stock-based compensation for Company employees within the content collection, consulting, product development,
software and systems engineering groups in addition to data costs, amortization of identifiable intangible assets, computer maintenance and depreciation expenses and client-related communication costs. 
Selling, General and Administrative Selling, general and administrative expenses include cash and stock-based compensation for the sales and various other support and administrative departments, travel and entertainment expenses, marketing
costs, rent, amortization of leasehold improvements, depreciation of furniture and fixtures, office expenses, professional fees and other expenses. Earnings per Share Basic earnings per share EPS is computed by
dividing net income by the number of weighted average common shares outstanding during the period. Diluted earnings per share is computed by dividing net income by the number of weighted average common shares outstanding during the period increased
by the dilutive effect of potential common shares outstanding during the period. The number of potential common shares outstanding has been determined in accordance with the treasury stock method to the extent they are dilutive. Common share
equivalents consist of common shares issuable upon the exercise of outstanding share-based compensation awards, including employee stock options and restricted stock. Under the treasury stock method, the exercise price paid by the optionee, future
stock-based compensation expense that the Company has not yet recognized and the amount of tax benefits that would be recorded in additional paid-in capital when the award becomes deductible are assumed to be used to repurchase shares. 
Fair Value Measures Fair value is defined as the price that would be received from selling an asset or paid to transfer a liability i.e.,the exit price in an orderly transaction between market
participants at the measurement date. In determining fair value, the use of various valuation methodologies, including market, income and cost approaches is permissible. The Company considers the principal or most advantageous market in which it
would transact and considers assumptions that market participants would use when pricing the asset or liability. The accounting guidance for
fair value measurements establishes a fair value hierarchy that requires an entity to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs when measuring fair value. There are three levels of inputs that may be used to
measure fair value based on the reliability of inputs. A financial instruments categorization within the fair value hierarchy is based upon the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement. The Companys cash
equivalents are classified as Level 1 while the Companys derivative instruments foreign exchange forward contracts are classified as Level 2. See Note 4 for further discussion surrounding the fair value of the Companys financial
instruments. Cash and Cash Equivalents Cash and cash equivalents consist of demand deposits and money market investments with maturities of three months or less at the date of acquisition and are reported at fair value. The Companys
institutional money market funds maintained with various financial institutions are traded in an active market and the net asset value of each fund on the last day of the quarter is used to determine its fair value. 
59 Table of Contents
Accounts
Receivable and Deferred Fees Amounts that have been earned but not yet paid are reflected on the Consolidated Statements of
Financial Condition as accounts receivable, net of reserves. Amounts invoiced in advance or client payments that are in excess of earned subscription revenues are reflected on the Consolidated Statements of Financial Condition as deferred fees. As
of August31, 2010, the amount of accounts receivable that was unbilled totaled $09 million, which was billed in fiscal 2011. Allowance for Doubtful Accounts The Company calculates its receivable
reserve through analyzing aged client receivables, reviewing the recent history of client receivable write-offs and understanding general market and economic conditions. In accordance with this policy, a receivable reserve of $19 million and $17
million were recorded as of August31, 2010 and 2009, respectively, in the Consolidated Statements of Financial Condition as a reduction of accounts receivable. Property, Equipment and Leasehold Improvements Property, equipment and
leasehold improvements are stated at cost, less accumulated depreciation and amortization. Computers and related equipment are depreciated on
a straight-line basis over estimated useful lives of three years or less. Furniture and fixtures are depreciated on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives between five and seven years. Leasehold improvements are amortized on a
straight-line basis over the terms of the related leases or estimated useful lives of the improvements, whichever period is shorter. The
Company performs a test for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an individual asset or asset group may not be recoverable. Should projected undiscounted future cash flows be less than the
carrying amount of the asset or asset group, an impairment charge reducing the carrying amount to fair value is required. Fair value is determined based on the most appropriate valuation technique, including discounted cash flows. 
Repairs and maintenance expenditures, which are not considered improvements and do not extend the useful life of the property and equipment, are expensed
as incurred. Asset Retirement Obligations An asset retirement obligation is recognized in the period in which sufficient information exists to determine the fair value of the liability with a corresponding increase to the carrying amount of the
related property, plant and equipment which is then depreciated over its useful life. The liability is initially measured at discounted fair value and then accretion expense is recorded in each subsequent period. The Companys asset retirement
obligations are associated with its build out of office space in London where the Company made significant leasehold improvements and is obligated to remove the leasehold improvements at the end of the lease term. The Companys asset retirement
obligations are not material to its consolidated financial statements. Goodwill 
Goodwill has resulted from the acquisitions of the Insyte, LionShares, Mergerstat, CallStreet, JCF, TrueCourse, Derivative Solutions, AlphaMetrics, Global
Filings, DealMaven, Thomson Fundamentals and Market Metrics businesses. Goodwill resulting from the acquisitions of LionShares, Mergerstat, TrueCourse, Derivative Solutions and Market Metrics are income tax-deductible based on the structure of the
acquisition. On an ongoing basis, the Company evaluates goodwill at the reporting unit level for indications of potential impairment. Goodwill is tested for impairment based on the present value of discounted cash flows, and, if impaired, written
down to fair value. The Company has determined that there were three reporting units during fiscal years 2010, 2009 and 2008, which are consistent with the operating segments reported because there is no discrete financial information available for
the subsidiaries within each operating segment. The Companys reporting units evaluated for potential impairment during fiscal years 2010, 2009 and 2008 were the U.S., Europe and Asia Pacific, which reflects the level of internal reporting the
Company uses to manage its business and operations. The Company performed an annual goodwill impairment test during the fourth quarter of fiscal years 2010, 2009 and 2008 and determined that there were no reporting units that were deemed at risk and
there had been no impairment. Intangible Assets Intangible assets consist of certain acquired content databases, software technology, client relationships, trade names and non-compete agreements resulting from the acquisitions of Insyte data central
application, LionShares global equity ownership data, Mergerstat MA data, CallStreet events and transcripts, JCF earnings and other estimates, TrueCourse takeover defense intelligence, Derivative Solutions fixed income,

networking tool, Global Filings equity and fixed income prospectuses, DealMaven investment banking workflow tool, Thomson Fundamentals financial data and Market Metrics market research
data on advisor-sold investments and insurance products and depending on the nature of the intangible asset, are amortized on either a straight-line or an accelerated basis using estimated useful lives ranging between two and twenty years.
Intangible assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of such assets may not be recoverable. Determination of recoverability is based on an estimate of undiscounted future cash
flows resulting from the use of the asset and its eventual disposition. Measurement of any impairment loss for intangible assets that management expects to hold and use is based on the amount the carrying value exceeds the fair value of the asset.
There has been no impairment of intangible assets as of August31, 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively. Internal
Use Software Certain costs related to computer software developed or obtained for internal use are capitalized. FactSet
capitalizes only those direct costs incurred during the application development and implementation stages for developing, purchasing or otherwise acquiring software solely to meet the Companys internal needs. Capitalized costs are amortized on
a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of the underlying software, generally three years or less. During fiscal 2010, 2009 and 2008, the Company capitalized $08 million, $08 million and $04 million, respectively of internal
employee compensation costs associated with the application development and implementation stages for developing software for internal use only. In fiscal 2010, 2009 and 2008, FactSet recorded amortization expense related to capitalized software of
$06 million, $03 million and $03 million, respectively. Product Development 
The Company capitalizes software development costs related to software to be sold, leased, or otherwise marketed. Capitalized software
development costs include purchased materials and services, the salary and benefits for the Companys development and technical support staff and other costs associated with the enhancements of existing products and services and development of
new products and services. Software development costs are expensed as incurred until technological feasibility has been established, at which time such costs are capitalized until the product is available for general release to the public. Once the
point of technological feasibility is reached, which is generally the completion of a working prototype that has been certified as having no critical bugs and is a release candidate or has alternative future uses, development costs are capitalized
until the product is ready for general release. Capitalized software development costs are amortized over the estimated product useful life, principally three years using the straight-line method. Research and product development costs not subject
to capitalization are expensed as incurred. As of August31, 2010 and 2009, there were no software development costs capitalized related to software to be sold, leased, or otherwise marketed. 
Landlord Contributions to Leasehold Improvements In conjunction with entering into leases for office space, the Company receives contributions from landlords toward leasehold improvements which are reported in the Deferred Rent and Other Non-Current
Liabilities line item of the Companys Consolidated Statements of Financial Condition. These contributions are amortized as a reduction to rent expense over the non-cancelable lease terms to which they pertain. During fiscal 2010, 2009 and
2008, cash contributions from landlords were $05 million, $26 million and $10 million, respectively. Derivative
Instruments FactSet conducts business outside the U.S. in several currencies including the British PoundSterling, Euro,
Japanese Yen, Indian Rupee and Philippines Peso. As such, it is exposed to movements in foreign currency exchange rates compared to the U.S. dollar. To manage the exposures related to the effects of foreign exchange rate fluctuations, the Company
utilizes derivative instruments foreign currency forward contracts. The Companys primary objective in holding derivatives is to reduce the volatility of earnings and cash flows associated with changes in foreign currency. The Company does
not enter into foreign exchange forward contracts for trading or speculative purposes. These hedging programs are not designed to provide
long-term foreign currency protection as the contracts have maturities of up to eighteen months. In designing a specific hedging approach, FactSet considered several factors, including offsetting exposures, significance of exposures, forecasting
risk and potential effectiveness of the hedge. These transactions are designated and accounted for as cash flow hedges. The effective portion of the derivatives gain or loss is initially reported as a component of accumulated other
comprehensive income and subsequently reclassified into operating expense when the hedged exposure affects earnings. Theses gains and losses are designed to offset the variability in operating expenses associated with currency movements. 
61 Table of Contents
Accrued
Liabilities Accrued liabilities include estimates relating to employee compensation, operating expenses and tax liabilities.
Approximately 20% of the Companys employee incentive compensation programs are discretionary. FactSet conducts a final review of Company and departmental individual performance each year end to determine the amount of discretionary employee
compensation. The Company also reviews compensation throughout the year to determine how overall performance tracks against managements expectations. Management takes these and other factors, including historical performance, into account in
reviewing accrued compensation estimates quarterly and adjusting accrual rates as appropriate. The amount of the variable employee compensation recorded within accrued compensation as of August31, 2010 and 2009, were $375million and
$320 million, respectively. Treasury Stock The Company accounts for repurchased common stock under the cost method and includes such treasury stock as a component of its stockholders equity. Retirement of treasury stock is recorded as a
reduction of common stock and additional paid-in-capital at the time such retirement is approved by the Companys Board of Directors. Income and Deferred Taxes Income tax expense is based on taxable income
determined in accordance with current enacted laws and tax rates. Deferred income taxes are recorded for the temporary differences between the financial statement and tax bases of assets and liabilities using currently enacted tax rates. Valuation
allowances are established against deferred tax assets whenever circumstances indicate that it is more likely than not that such assets will not be realized in future periods. The Company applies a comprehensive model for the recognition, measurement and disclosure in financial statements of uncertain income tax positions that a company has taken or expects to take on a tax
return. FactSet can recognize the benefit of an income tax position only if it is more-likely-than-not that the tax position will be sustained upon tax examination, based solely on the technical merits of the tax position as of the
reporting date. Otherwise, no benefit can be recognized. The tax benefits recognized are measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than 50% likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement. The Company will classify the liability
for unrecognized tax benefits as current to the extent that the Company anticipates payment or receipt of cash within one year. Additionally, the Company accrues interest and related penalties, if applicable, on all tax exposures for which
reserves have been established consistent with jurisdictional tax laws. Interest and penalties are classified as income tax expense in the financial statements. Comprehensive Income Loss The Company discloses comprehensive income
loss in accordance with applicable standards for the reporting and display of comprehensive income loss in a set of financial statements. Comprehensive income loss is defined as the change in net assets of a business enterprise during a period
from transactions generated from non-owner sources. It includes all changes in equity during a period except those resulting from investments by owners and distributions to owners. See Note 12 for further disclosure of comprehensive income loss.
Foreign Currency Translation Certain wholly owned subsidiaries within the Europe and Asia Pacific segments operate under a functional currency different from the U.S. dollar, such as the British PoundSterling, Euro, Japanese
Yen, Indian Rupee and Philippines Peso. The financial statements of these foreign subsidiaries are translated into U.S. dollars using period-end rates of exchange for assets and liabilities, and average rates for the period for revenues and
expenses. Translation gains and losses that arise from translating assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses of foreign operations are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income as a component of stockholders equity. Accumulated
foreign currency translation adjustments totaled $211 million and $111 million at August31, 2010 and 2009, respectively. Stock-Based Compensation Accounting guidance requires the measurement and
recognition of compensation expense for all share-based payment awards made to employees and directors including stock options, restricted stock and common shares acquired under employee stock purchases based on estimated fair values of the share
awards that are scheduled to vest during the period. FactSet uses the straight-line attribution method for all awards with graded vesting features and service conditions only. Under this method, the amount of compensation cost that is recognized on
any date is at least equal to the vested portion of the award on that date. For all stock-based awards with performance conditions, the graded vesting attribution method is used by the Company to determine the monthly stock-based compensation
expense over the applicable vesting periods. 
62 Table of Contents
As stock-based compensation expense
recognized in the Consolidated Statements of Income is based on awards ultimately expected to vest, it has been reduced for estimated forfeitures. Forfeitures are estimated at the time of grant and revised, if necessary, in subsequent periods if
actual forfeitures differ from those estimates. Forfeitures were estimated based primarily on historical experience. Windfall tax benefits, defined as tax deductions that exceed recorded stock-based compensation, are classified as cash inflows from
financing activities. Performance-based stock options require management to make assumptions regarding the likelihood of achieving Company
performance targets on a quarterly and on-going basis. The number of performance-based options that vest will be predicated on the Company achieving certain performance levels. A change in the financial performance levels achieved by FactSet could
result in changes to the Companys current estimate of the vesting percentage and related stock-based compensation. See Note 14 for
additional disclosures relating to stock-based compensation. Legal Matters 
FactSet accrues non-income tax liabilities for contingencies when management believes that a loss is probable and the amounts can be reasonably estimated,
while contingent gains are recognized only when realized. From time to time the Company is involved in litigation, claims and legal proceedings arising out of the ordinary course of business. Legal costs for services rendered in the course of these
proceedings are charged to expense as they are incurred. Leases 
The Company conducts all of its operations in leased facilities which have minimum lease obligations under non-cancelable operating leases. Certain of
these leases contain rent escalations based on specified percentages. Most of the leases contain renewal options and require payments for taxes, insurance and maintenance. Rent expense is charged to operations as incurred except for escalating
rents, which are charged to operations on a straight-line basis over the life of the lease. Segment Reporting
The Companys operations are organized into three reportable segments based on geographic operations: U.S., Europe and Asia
Pacific. These reportable segments are consistent with how the Company, including its chief operating decision maker, manages the business and the demographic markets in which the Company serves. Each segment provides integrated global financial and
economic information to investment managers, investment banks and other financial services professionals. The U.S. segment services finance professionals including financial institutions throughout North America, while the European and Asia Pacific
segments service investment professionals located throughout Europe and Asia. There are no intersegment or intercompany sales of the FactSet
service. Each segment records compensation, including stock-based compensation, amortization of intangible assets, depreciation of furniture and fixtures, amortization of leasehold improvements, communication costs, professional fees, rent expense,
travel, marketing, office and other direct expenses related to its employees. Expenditures associated with the Companys data centers, product development and corporate headquarters charges are recorded by the U.S. segment and are not allocated
to the European and Asia Pacific segments. Certain Risks and Concentrations 
Financial instruments that potentially subject the Company to concentrations of credit risk consist principally of cash equivalents, foreign currency
forward contracts, accounts receivable and data content providers. Cash equivalents 
Cash and cash equivalents are maintained with several financial institutions. Deposits held with banks may exceed the amount of insurance provided on such
deposits. Generally, these deposits may be redeemed upon demand and are maintained with financial institutions with reputable credit and therefore bear minimal credit risk. The Company seeks to mitigate its credit risks by spreading such risks
across multiple counterparties and monitoring the risk profiles of these counterparties. Derivative Instruments
As a result of the use of derivative instruments, the Company is exposed to counterparty credit risk. FactSet has incorporated
counterparty risk into the fair value of its derivative assets and its own credit risk into the value of the Companys derivative liabilities. FactSet calculates credit risk from observable data related to credit default swaps CDS
as quoted by publicly available information. Counterparty risk is represented by CDS spreads related to the senior secured debt of the respective bank with whom FactSet has executed these derivative transactions. Because CDS spread information is
not available for FactSet, the Companys credit risk is determined based on using a simple average of CDS spreads for peer companies as determined by FactSet. To mitigate counterparty credit risk, FactSet enters into contracts with large
financial institutions JPMorgan Chase and Bank of America. The Company regularly reviews its credit exposure balances as well as the creditworthiness of the counterparties. 
63 Table of Contents
Accounts Receivable
Accounts receivable are unsecured and are derived from revenues earned from clients located around the globe. FactSet maintains reserves
for potential write-offs and these losses have been within expectations. At August31, 2010 and 2009, no single client accounted for more than 2% of total subscriptions. Data Content Providers The Company seeks to maintain contractual relationships with a
minimum of two content providers for each type of financial data; however this is not possible for all types of data. Certain data sets that FactSet relies on have a limited number of suppliers, although the Company makes every effort to assure that
alternative sources are available. The data provided to FactSet clients from each of these databases is essential to the end users workflow and financial analysis. FactSet combines the data from these commercial databases into its own
dedicated single online service, which the client accesses to perform their analysis. The failure of its suppliers to deliver accurate data and in a timely manner could adversely affect the Companys business. 
Recently Adopted Accounting Guidance Fair Value Measures On September1, 2009, the Company adopted the
authoritative accounting guidance for the fair value measurement and disclosure of its non-financial assets and non-financial liabilities, except for items that are recognized or disclosed at fair value in the consolidated financial statements on a
recurring basis at least annually. The adoption of this accounting guidance did not have a material impact on the Companys financial position or results of operations. In January 2010, the FASB issued authoritative guidance to require additional disclosures about athe different classes of assets and liabilities measured at fair value, bthe valuation
techniques and inputs used, cthe activity in Level 3 fair value measurements and dthe transfers between Levels 1, 2, and 3. The disclosure requirements related to recurring and nonrecurring fair value measurements. The guidance was
effective for the Company on March1, 2010, except for the disclosure on the roll forward activities for Level 3 fair value measurements, which will become effective beginning September1, 2011. Other than requiring additional fair value
disclosures, adoption of this new guidance will not have an impact on the Companys financial position and results of operations. Business Combinations On September1, 2009, the Company adopted the
authoritative accounting guidance on business combinations. The guidance retains the fundamental requirements that the acquisition method of accounting previously referred to as the purchase method of accounting be used for all business
combinations, but requires a number of changes. The more significant changes include an expanded definition of a business and a business combination; recognition of assets acquired and liabilities assumed at their acquisition date fair values with
subsequent changes recognized in earnings; recognition of acquisition-related expenses and restructuring costs separately from the business combination; and capitalization of in-process research and development at fair value as an indefinite-lived
intangible asset. The guidance also amends and clarifies the application issues on initial recognition and measurement, subsequent measurement and accounting, and disclosure of assets and liabilities arising from contingencies in a business
combination. The impact of this accounting guidance and its relevant updates on the Companys results of operations or financial position will vary depending on each specific business combination or asset purchase. 
Subsequent Events 
On April1, 2009, the Company adopted new guidance that addressed the accounting for and disclosure requirements of events or transactions that occur
after the balance sheet date, but before the financial statements are issued. In February2010, the FASB issued amended guidance to arequire an SEC filer to evaluate subsequent events through the date the financial statements are issued
with the SEC, badd the definitions of an SEC filer and revised financial statements, cno longer require that an SEC filer disclose the date through which subsequent events have been reviewed and dremove the definition of a
public entity. The adoption of the new guidance did not have an impact on the Companys financial position and results of operations. Recent Accounting Guidance Not Yet Adopted Revenue
Recognition In October 2009, the FASB issued authoritative guidance on revenue recognition that will be effective for the Company
beginning September1, 2010. Under the new guidance on arrangements that include software elements, tangible products that have software components that are essential to the functionality of the tangible product will no longer be within the
scope of the software revenue recognition guidance, and software-enabled products will now be subject to other relevant revenue recognition guidance. Additionally, the FASB issued authoritative guidance on revenue arrangements with multiple
64 Table of Contents
deliverables that are outside the scope of the software revenue recognition guidance. Under the new guidance, when vendor specific objective evidence or third party evidence for deliverables in
an arrangement cannot be determined, a best estimate of the selling price is required to separate deliverables and allocate arrangement consideration using the relative selling price method. The new guidance includes new disclosure requirements on
how the application of the relative selling price method affects the timing and amount of revenue recognition. The new guidance is not expected to change the accounting for the Companys revenue transactions. 
Other Recent Accounting Guidance FASB Accounting Standards Update 
During the first quarter of fiscal 2010, the FASB issued several ASUs ASU No2009-06 through ASU No2009-15. Except for
ASUs No2009-13 and 2009-14 regarding revenue recognition discussed above, the ASUs entail technical corrections to existing guidance or affect guidance related to specialized industries or entities and do not have a material
impact on the Companys financial position and results of operations. During the second quarter of fiscal 2010, the FASB issued several
ASUs ASU No2009-16 through ASU No2009-17 and ASU No2010-01 through ASU No2010-10. Except for ASU No2010-06 requiring additional fair value disclosures and ASU No2010-09 regarding subsequent
events, both discussed above, the ASUs entail technical corrections to existing guidance or affect guidance related to specialized industries or entities and do not have a material impact on the Companys financial position and results of
operations. During the third quarter of fiscal 2010, the FASB issued several ASUs ASU No2010-11 through ASU
No2010-19. The ASUs entail technical corrections to existing guidance or affect guidance related to specialized industries or entities and do not have a material impact on the Companys financial position and results of operations.
During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2010, the FASB issued several ASUs ASU No2010-20 through ASU No2010-24. The
ASUs entail technical corrections to existing guidance or affect guidance related to specialized industries or entities and do not have a material impact on the Companys financial position and results of operations. 
3. ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE Accounts
receivable from clients are reported net of receivable reserves. The Company calculates its receivable reserve through analyzing aged client receivables and reviewing the recent history of client receivable write-offs. 
Accounts receivable, net of reserves, consists of the following in thousands:  At August31 2010 2009 Accounts receivable 61,555 64,566 Accounts receivable reserve 1,862 1,712 Accounts receivable, net of reserves 59,693 62,854
4. FAIR VALUE MEASURES
Pursuant to the accounting guidance for fair value measurements, fair value is defined as the price that would be received from selling an
asset or paid to transfer a liability i.e.,the exit price in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. In determining fair value, the use of various valuation methodologies, including market,
income and cost approaches is permissible. The Company considers the principal or most advantageous market in which it would transact and considers assumptions that market participants would use when pricing the asset or liability. 
a Fair Value Hierarchy The accounting guidance establishes a fair value hierarchy that requires an entity to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs when measuring fair value. There are
three levels of inputs that may be used to measure fair value based on the reliability of inputs. A financial instruments categorization within the fair value hierarchy is based upon the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair
value measurement. The Companys assessment of the significance of a particular input to the fair value measurement requires judgment and may affect their placement within the fair value hierarchy levels. FactSet has categorized its cash
equivalents and derivatives within the hierarchy as follows: Level 1 
Level 1 applies to assets or liabilities for which there are quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. These Level 1 assets and
liabilities include FactSets investments in institutional money market funds that are classified as cash equivalents. 
65 Table of Contents
Level 2
Level 2 applies to assets or liabilities for which there are inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are
observable for the asset or liability such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets; quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities in markets with insufficient volume or infrequent transactions less active markets;
or model-derived valuations in which significant inputs are observable or can be derived principally from, or corroborated by, observable market data. The Companys derivative instruments are classified as Level 2 as they are valued using
pricing models that use observable market inputs. Level 3 
Level 3 applies to assets or liabilities for which there are unobservable inputs to the valuation methodology that are significant to the measurement of
the fair value of the assets or liabilities. Certain assets would be classified within Level3 of the fair value hierarchy because they trade infrequently and, therefore, have little or no transparency. There were no Level 3 assets or
liabilities held by FactSet as of August31, 2010 or 2009. b Assets and Liabilities Measured at Fair Value on
a Recurring Basis The following tables shows by level within the fair value hierarchy the Companys assets and liabilities
that are measured at fair value on a recurring basis at August31, 2010 and 2009 in thousands:   August31, 2010

The Companys institutional money market funds are traded in an active market and the net asset value of each fund on the last day of
the quarter is used to determine its fair value. As such, the Companys cash equivalents are classified as Level 1. 
Derivative Instruments 
The Company utilizes the income approach to measure fair value for its derivative instruments foreign exchange forward contracts. The income approach
uses pricing models that rely on market observable inputs such as spot, forward and interest rates, as well as credit default swap spreads and therefore are classified as Level 2.

Assets and liabilities measured at

Liabilities Measured at Fair Value on a Non-recurring Basis Certain assets, including goodwill and intangible assets, and liabilities,
are measured at fair value on a non-recurring basis; that is, the assets and liabilities are not measured at fair value on an ongoing basis but are subject to fair value adjustments in certain circumstances such as when they are deemed to be
other-than-temporarily impaired. The fair values of these non-financial assets and liabilities are determined based on valuation techniques using the best information available, and may include quoted market prices, market comparables, and
discounted cash flow projections. An impairment charge is recorded when the cost exceeds its fair value and this condition is determined to be other-than-temporary. During fiscal 2010, no fair value adjustments were required for the Companys
non-financial assets or liabilities. 5. CASH, CASH EQUIVALENTS AND INVESTMENTS 
Cash and Cash Equivalents Cash and cash equivalents consist of demand deposits and money market funds with maturities of three months or
less at the date of acquisition and are reported at fair value. Investments Investments which have maturities greater than
three months from the date of acquisition are classified as available-for-sale securities and are reported at fair value. Unrealized gains and losses on available-for-sale securities are included net of tax in accumulated other comprehensive income
in stockholders equity. From time to time, the Company maintains a portfolio of investments that is managed to preserve principal.
Pursuant to the investment guidelines established by the Company, the Companys investments attempt to achieve high levels of credit quality, liquidity and diversification. The weighted average duration of the Companys portfolios is
managed not to exceed two years. Eligible investments include obligations issued by the U.S. Treasury and other governmental agencies, money market securities and highly rated commercial paper to be held in the custody of major financial
institutions. Investments such as puts, calls, strips, straddles, short sales, options, futures, commodities, precious metals or investments on margin are not permitted under the Companys investment guidelines.

losses as a result of counterparty credit risk or ratings change during fiscal 2010 and 2009. 6. DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS 
Foreign Exchange Risk Management FactSet conducts business outside the U.S. in several currencies including the British PoundSterling, Euro, Japanese Yen, Indian Rupee and Philippines Peso. As such, it is exposed to movements in
foreign currency exchange rates compared to the U.S. dollar. To manage the exposures related to the effects of foreign exchange rate fluctuations, the Company utilizes derivative instruments foreign currency forward contracts. The Companys
primary objective in holding derivatives is to reduce the volatility of earnings and cash flows associated with changes in foreign currency. The Company does not enter into foreign exchange forward contracts for trading or speculative purposes.
Cash Flow Hedges FactSet enters into foreign currency forward contracts to reduce the effects of foreign currency fluctuations. These hedging programs are not designed to provide long-term foreign currency protection as
the contracts have maturities of less than two years. In designing a specific hedging approach, FactSet considered several factors, including offsetting exposures, significance of exposures, forecasting risk and potential effectiveness of the hedge.
The gains and losses on foreign currency forward contracts offset the variability in operating expenses associated with currency movements. There was no discontinuance of cash flow hedges during fiscal 2010 or fiscal 2009 and as such, no
corresponding gains or losses were reclassified into earnings. During fiscal 2010 FactSet entered into foreign currency forward contracts to
hedge approximately 95% of its net Euro exposure through the end of the first quarter of fiscal 2012 and 95% of its net British PoundSterling exposure through the end of the third quarter of fiscal 2011. At August31, 2010, the notional
principal and fair value liability of foreign exchange contracts to purchase Euros with U.S. dollars were 325million and $12 million, respectively. The notional principal and fair value of foreign exchange contracts to purchase
British PoundSterling with U.S. dollars were 211million and $09 million, respectively, at August31, 2010. The gains and losses on foreign currency forward contracts mitigate the variability in operating expenses associated
with currency movements. These transactions are designated and accounted for as cash flow hedges in accordance with applicable accounting guidance. The changes in fair value for these foreign currency forward contracts are initially reported
as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income AOCI and subsequently reclassified into operating expenses when the hedged exposure affects earnings. No amount of ineffectiveness was recorded in the Consolidated Statements of
Income for these designated cash flow hedges. All components of each derivatives gain or loss were included in the assessment of hedge effectiveness. The following is a summary of all hedging positions and corresponding fair values in thousands:  Gross Notional Value FairValueAssetLiability CurrencyHedgedBuy/Sell

Counterparty
Credit Risk As a result of the use of derivative instruments, the Company is exposed to counterparty credit risk. FactSet has
incorporated counterparty risk into the fair value of its derivative assets and its own credit risk into the value of the Companys derivative liabilities. FactSet calculates credit risk from observable data related to credit default swaps
CDS as quoted by publicly available information. Counterparty risk is represented by CDS spreads related to the senior secured debt of the respective bank with whom FactSet has executed these derivative transactions. Because CDS spread
information is not available for FactSet, the Companys credit risk is determined based on using a simple average of CDS spreads for peer companies as determined by FactSet. To mitigate counterparty credit risk, FactSet enters into contracts with large financial institutions JPMorgan Chase and Bank of America. The Company regularly reviews its credit exposure balances as
well as the creditworthiness of the counterparties. The Company does not expect any losses as a result of default of its counterparties. Fair Value of Derivative Instruments The following tables provide a summary

7. BUSINESS COMBINATION
Market Metrics On June1, 2010, FactSet acquired Market Metrics for a total purchase price of $577 million. Formed in 1996 and headquartered in Massachusetts, Market Metrics is the leading market research firm in
the U.S. focused on advisor-sold investments and insurance products.Each year Market Metrics conducts more than 20,000 in-depth surveys of financial advisors, brokers, research analysts and gatekeepers.Leveraging this unique body of
data, Market Metrics helps senior managers to understand better their competitive strengths and weaknesses, and how they can improve their relationships with customers and increase market share. As of the date of acquisition, Market Metrics had
annual subscriptions of $16 million and employed 25 individuals. As of August31, 2010, Market Metrics does not have an international
presence and FactSet believes it can leverage its international network to sell Market Metrics products outside the U.S. as many of their current clients would like to see their service offering expand its reach into Europe. Market Metrics also
represents a new, unique content set for FactSet. The analytical content Market Metrics creates is original and is in demand in this industry, but it is not available from any other source. The opportunity for FactSet to grow by providing this new
type of unique content to clients worldwide contributed to a purchase price in excess of fair value of the Market Metrics net tangible and intangible assets. As a result, FactSet recorded goodwill in connection with this transaction. 
The total purchase price of the acquisition is as follows in thousands:  Cash consideration 57,100 Working capital 632 Total purchase price 57,732 Allocation of the purchase price to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed has been finalized for this acquisition. The
total purchase price was allocated to Market Metrics net tangible and intangible assets based upon their estimated fair value as of the date of acquisition. Based upon the purchase price and the valuation, the allocation is as follows in
thousands:  Tangible assets acquired 4,587 Amortizable intangible assets Data content 8,070 Client relationships 6,990 Non-compete agreements 1,750 Trade name 380 Goodwill 46,130 Total assets acquired 67,907 Liabilities assumed 10,175 Net assets acquired 57,732 Intangible assets of $172 million have been allocated to amortizable intangible assets consisting of data content,
amortized over five years using a straight-line amortization method; client relationships, amortized over nine years using an accelerated amortization method; non-compete agreements, amortized over five years using a straight-line amortization
method; and trade name, amortized over three years using a straight-line amortization method. Goodwill totaling $461 million represents the
excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the net tangible and intangible assets acquired. Goodwill will not be amortized and will be tested for impairment at least annually. Goodwill generated from the Market Metrics acquisition is
included in the U.S. segment and is deductible for income tax purposes. The results of operations of Market Metrics have been included in the Companys Consolidated Statement of Income since the completion of the acquisition on June1,
2010 and did not have a material impact on the fiscal 2010 fourth quarter. Pro forma information has not been presented because the effect of this acquisition was not material on the Companys consolidated financial results.

8. INTANGIBLE ASSETS
The Companys identifiable intangible assets consist of acquired content databases, software technology, client relationships, trade
names and non-compete agreements resulting from previous acquisitions, which have been fully integrated into the Companys operations. The weighted average useful life of all acquired intangible assets is 119 years at August31, 2010.
The Company amortizes intangible assets over their estimated useful lives. Amortizable intangible assets are tested for impairment based on
undiscounted cash flows, and, if impaired, written down to fair value based on either discounted cash flows or appraised values. No impairment of intangible assets has been identified during any of the periods presented. These intangible assets have
no assigned residual values. The gross carrying amounts and accumulated amortization totals related to the Companys identifiable

9. GOODWILL 
On an ongoing basis, the Company evaluates goodwill at the reporting unit level for indications of potential impairment. Goodwill is tested for impairment
based on the present value of discounted cash flows, and, if impaired, written down to fair value based on discounted cash flows. The Company has three reporting units, which are consistent with the operating segments reported because there is no
discrete financial information available for the subsidiaries within each operating segment. The Companys reporting units evaluated for potential impairment were U.S., Europe and Asia Pacific, which reflects the level of internal reporting the
Company uses to manage its business and operations. The Company performed an annual goodwill impairment test during the fourth quarter of fiscal years 2010, 2009, and 2008 and determined that there were no reporting units that were deemed at risk
and there had been no impairment. During fiscal 2010, $461 million of goodwill was acquired as result of the purchase of the Market Metrics business on June1, 2010. There was no goodwill acquired during fiscal 2009. 
Changes in the carrying amount of goodwill by segment for fiscal years ended August31, 2010 and 2009 are as follows in thousands: U.S. Europe AsiaPacific Total Balance at August31, 2008 99,599 85,174 3,007 187,780 Goodwill acquired during the period Purchase price adjustments 97 97 Foreign currency translation adjustments 6,937 512 6,425 Balance at August31, 2009 99,696 78,140 3,519 181,355 Goodwill acquired during the period 46,130 46,130 Purchase price adjustments Foreign currency translation adjustments 5,862 368 5,494 Balance at August31, 2010 145,826 72,278 3,887 221,991
The decrease in the gross carrying amount of goodwill within the European segment during fiscal 2010 was due to strengthening of the U.S. dollar against the Euro and
British Pound Sterling. 10. PROPERTY, EQUIPMENT AND LEASEHOLD IMPROVEMENTS 
Property, equipment and leasehold improvements consist of the following in thousands:  At August31 2010 2009 Leasehold improvements 75,453 70,368 Computers and related equipment 63,958 63,822 Furniture and fixtures 21,541 27,289 Subtotal 160,952 161,479 Less accumulated depreciation and amortization 81,457 73,100  Property, equipment and leasehold improvements, net 79,495 88,379
The decrease of $57 million in gross asset value of furniture and fixtures during fiscal 2010 was from the disposal of fully depreciated assets that were no longer in
use within the Companys leased office space in the U.S. Depreciation expense was $288 million, $261 million and $229 million for fiscal 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively. 11.

on a compounded annual basis for the two years ended August31, 2008 and as such, 60% of the initial 924,989 performance-based employee stock options granted will vest and the remaining 341,729 stock options were recorded as forfeitures in
August 2008.  In August 2007, the Company granted 896,194 performance-based employee stock options. None of these performance-based stock options granted vested because FactSet did

price of $2591. The aggregate intrinsic value of in-the-money stock options exercisable at August31, 2010 and 2009 was $1301 million and $1220 million, respectively. Aggregate intrinsic value represents the difference between the
Companys closing stock price of $7355 at August31, 2010 and the exercise price multiplied by the number of options exercisable as of that date. The total pre-tax intrinsic value of stock options exercised during fiscal 2010, 2009 and
2008 was $835 million, $197 million and $348 million, respectively. Performance-based Stock Options
Performance-based stock options require management to make assumptions regarding the likelihood of achieving Company performance
targets. The number of performance-based options that vest will be predicated on the Company achieving performance levels for both organic ASV and diluted earnings per share during the two fiscal years subsequent to the date of grant. Dependent on
the financial performance levels attained by FactSet during the two subsequent fiscal years, 0%, 20%, 60% or 100% of the performance-based stock options will vest to the grantees of those stock options. There is no current guarantee however that
such options will vest in whole or in part. August 2007 Performance-based Option Grant Review 
In August 2007, the Company granted 896,194 performance-based employee stock options. None of these performance-based stock options granted vested because
FactSet did not achieve certain performance levels for both organic ASV and diluted earnings per share during the two fiscal years ended August31, 2009. These performance-based options were recorded as forfeitures in August 2009. 
August 2008 Performance-based Option Grant Review In August 2008, the Company granted 1,058,981 performance-based employee stock options. None of these performance-based stock options granted vested because FactSet did not achieve certain performance
levels for both organic ASV and diluted earnings per share during the two fiscal years ended August31, 2010. These performance-based options were recorded as forfeitures in August 2010. 
October 2009 Performance-based Option Grant Review In October 2009, the Company granted 900,665 performance-based employee stock options. The number of performance-based options that vest is based on the Company achieving performance levels for both
organic ASV and diluted earnings per share during the two fiscal years ended August31, 2011. At August31, 2010, the Company estimated that 20% or 180,133 of the performance-based stock options will vest which results in unamortized
stock-based compensation expense of $23 million to be recognized over the remaining vesting period. A change in the actual financial
performance levels achieved by FactSet could result in the following changes to the Companys current estimate of the vesting percentage and related expense in thousands:  Vesting Percentage

cumulative adjustment increments each quarter by the amount stated in the average remaining quarterly expense to be recognized column. June 2010 Performance-based Option Grant Review In June 2010, the Company granted 820,202
performance-based employee stock options. The number of performance-based options that vest is based on FactSet achieving certain ASV targets over a six year period. At August31, 2010, the Company estimated that 139,509 of the
performance-based stock options will vest which results in unamortized stock-based compensation expense of $26 million to be recognized over the remaining vesting period. Restricted Stock and Stock Unit Awards The Companys option plans
permit the issuance of restricted stock and restricted stock units. Restricted stock awards are subject to continued employment over a specified period. A summary of restricted stock award activity is as follows in thousands, except per award
data:  NumberOutstanding  Award Balance at August31, 2009 Granted restricted stock and stock units 267 6167 Vested Canceled/forfeited 6 6285 Balance at August31, 2010 261 6165
No restricted stock awards were granted or vested in fiscal years 2009 or 2008. During fiscal 2010, there were three restricted stock awards grants as summarized below. October23, 2009 Employee Restricted Stock Award On October23, 2009, the
Company granted 161,794 restricted stock awards which entitle the holder to shares of common stock as the award vests over time. The Companys restricted stock awards cliff vest 60% after three years and the remaining 40% after five years.
Restricted stock grants are amortized to expense over the vesting period using the straight-line attribution method. Employees granted restricted stock awards on October23, 2009 are not entitled to dividends declared on the underlying shares
while the restricted stock is unvested. As such, the grant date fair value of the award was measured by reducing the grant date price of FactSets share by the present value of the dividends expected to be paid on the underlying shares during
the requisite service period, discounted at the appropriate risk-free interest rate. The closing price of FactSet common stock on the grant date of $6646 was reduced to reflect the loss of future dividends non-dividend protection right. The
resulting fair value of the restricted stock awards granted on October23, 2009 was $6285. As of August31, 2010, unamortized stock-based compensation expense of $70 million is to be amortized ratably to compensation expense over the
remaining vesting period of 50 months. February9, 2010 Employee Restricted Stock Award 
On February9, 2010, the Company granted 90,030 restricted stock awards to employees which entitle the holder to shares of common stock as the award
vests over time, but are not entitled to dividends declared on the underlying shares while the restricted stock is unvested. Of the total number of restricted stock awards granted on February9, 2010, 55,572 awards cliff vest 100% after three
years and are amortized to expense over the vesting period using the straight-line attribution method. The remaining 34,458 restricted stock awards cliff vest 50% after four years and the other 50% after six years and are amortized to expense using
the straight-line attribution method over the vesting period. The grant date fair value of the awards were measured by reducing the grant date price of FactSets share by the present value of the dividends expected to be paid on the underlying
shares during the requisite service period, discounted at the appropriate risk-free interest rate. As such, the closing price of FactSet common stock on the grant date of $6309 was reduced to reflect the loss of future dividends non-dividend
protection right. The resulting weighted average fair value of the restricted stock awards granted on February9, 2010 was $5942. As of August31, 2010, unamortized stock-based compensation expense of $43 million is to be amortized to
compensation expense over the remaining vesting periods between 29 and 65 months. June1, 2010 Employee Restricted
Stock Unit Award On June1, 2010, the Company granted 15,000 restricted stock units which entitle the holder to shares of common
stock as the awards vests over time. A restricted stock unit is a promise to deliver shares to the employee at a future date if certain vesting conditions are met. The primary difference between a restricted stock unit and restricted stock is the
timing of the delivery of the underlying shares. FactSet is not required to deliver the shares to the employees until the vesting conditions are met. The Companys restricted stock units are performance-based and cliff vest 25% when serviced
ASV targets are achieved during a six year period. Restricted stock grants are amortized to expense based on a graded-vesting attribution

approach over the vesting period. The closing price of FactSet common stock on the grant date of $6741 was reduced to reflect the loss of future dividends. The resulting fair value of the
restricted stock units granted on June1, 2010 was $6249. As of August31, 2010, unamortized stock-based compensation expense of $09 million is to be amortized to compensation expense over the remaining vesting period of 69 months.

price equal to at least 85% of the lesser of the fair market value of the Companys common stock on either the first day or the last day of each three-month offering period. Employee purchases may not exceed 10% of their gross compensation
during an offering period. During fiscal 2010, employees purchased 91,429 shares at an average price of $5384 as compared to 144,513 shares
at an average price of $3453 in fiscal 2009. At August31, 2010, 356,256 shares were reserved for future issuance under the Purchase Plan.

The Company uses the Black-Scholes
model to calculate the estimated fair value for the employee stock purchase plan. The weighted average estimated value of employee stock purchase plan grants during fiscal years 2010, 2009 and 2008 were $1121, $912 and $1034 per share,
respectively. The following weighted average assumptions were used to calculate the estimated fair value of employee stock purchase plan grants for fiscal years 2010, 2009 and 2008: 2010 2009 2008 Risk-free interest rate 012 031 234  Expected life 3months 3months 3months Expected volatility 14 25 19  Dividend yield 13 17 10 
% 14. STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION
Accounting guidance requires the measurement and recognition of compensation expense for all share-based payment awards made to employees
and directors including stock options, restricted stock and common shares acquired under employee stock purchases based on estimated fair values of the share awards that are scheduled to vest during the period. 
The following table summarizes stock-based compensation expense for fiscal years 2010, 2009 and 2008 in thousands: 2010 2009 2008  Stock-based compensation 14,065 13,623 13,651 Tax impact of stock-based compensation 4,627 4,550 4,682  Stock-based compensation, net of tax 9,438 9,073 8,969  Included in fiscal 2008 was a pre-tax charge of $24 million related to an increase in the estimate of the number of performance-based stock options that would vest in
August 2008. During the second quarter of fiscal 2008, the Company estimated that it was probable it would achieve organic ASV and diluted earnings per share growth of at least 20% on a compounded annual basis for the two years ended August31,
2008. This reflected a higher performance level than previously estimated and accordingly increased the number of options that was estimated to vest at the end of fiscal 2008. As stock-based compensation expense recognized in the Consolidated Statements of Income is based on awards ultimately expected to vest, it has been reduced for estimated forfeitures. Forfeitures are
estimated at the time of grant and revised, if necessary, in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates. Forfeitures were estimated based primarily on historical experience. 
As of August31, 2010, $378 million of total unrecognized compensation expense related to non-vested awards is expected to be recognized over a
weighted average period of 377 years. There were no stock-based compensation costs capitalized as of August31, 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively. Employee Stock Option Fair Value Determinations The Company utilizes the
lattice-binomial option-pricing model binomial model to estimate the fair value of new employee stock option grants. The Companys determination of fair value of stock option awards on the date of grant using the binomial model is
affected by the Companys stock price as well as assumptions regarding a number of variables. These variables include, but are not limited to the Companys expected stock price volatility over the term of the awards, interest rates, option
forfeitures and employee stock option exercise behaviors.  Fiscal 2010 329,959 non performance-based employee options and 1,720,867 performance-based employee stock options were granted at a
weighted average exercise price of $6635 and a weighted average estimated fair value of $2022 per share.  Fiscal 2009 329,857 non performance-based employee options granted at an exercise price of $3600 and a weighted average estimated fair
value of $939 per share.  Fiscal 2008 795,391 non performance-based employee options and 1,058,981 performance-based employee stock options were granted at an
exercise price of $6505 and a weighted average estimated fair value of $1905 per share, The weighted average estimated
value of employee stock options granted during fiscal 2010, 2009 and 2008 were determined using the binomial model with the following weighted average assumptions:  2010 2009 2008 Term structure of risk-free interest rate 015%-330 089%-309 189%-346 Expected life 40-67 years 50-54years 49-54 years Term structure of volatility 27%-36 33%-38 29%-39 Dividend yield 15 20 10  79 Table of Contents
The risk-free interest rate assumption
for periods within the contractual life of the option is based on the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant. Expected volatility is based on a combination of historical volatility of the Companys stock and implied
volatilities of publicly traded options to buy FactSet common stock with contractual terms closest to the expected life of options granted to employees. The approach to utilize a mix of historical and implied volatility was based upon the
availability of actively traded options on the Companys stock and the Companys assessment that a combination of implied volatility and historical volatility is best representative of future stock price trends. The Company uses historical
data to estimate option exercises and employee termination within the valuation model. The dividend yield assumption is based on the Companys history and expectation of dividend payouts. The expected life of employee stock options represents
the weighted average period the stock options are expected to remain outstanding and is a derived output of the binomial model. The binomial model estimates employees exercise behavior is based on the options remaining vested life and the
extent to which the option is in-the-money. The binomial model estimates the probability of exercise as a function of these two variables based on the entire history of exercises and cancellations of all past option grants made by the Company.
Non-Employee Director Stock Option Grants On December16, 2008, the Companys stockholders approved the 2008 Non-Employee Directors Stock Option Plan the Plan that provides for the grant of share-based awards,
including stock options, to non-employee directors of FactSet. The ratification of the Plan replaced the FactSet 1998 Non-Employee Directors Stock Option Plan, which had expired on November1, 2007, except with respect to outstanding
options previously granted thereunder. A total of 250,000 shares of FactSet common stock have been reserved for issuance under the Plan. The expiration date of the Plan is December1, 2018. The shares of common stock to be issued may be either
authorized and unissued shares or shares held by the Company in its treasury. Consistent with the 1998 Non-Employee Directors Stock Option Plan, the new Plan provides for annual equity grants for each non-employee director and will provide the
Company greater flexibility to change the vesting schedule per option grant, modify the number of options granted on an annual basis and adjust the term of the grants. As such, the Compensation Committee approved an annual equity grant of 3,085
non-qualified stock options to each of the six non-employee directors on January15, 2010. The Company utilizes the Black-Scholes model
to estimate the fair value of new non-employee Director stock option grants. The Companys determination of fair value of share-based payment awards on the date of grant is affected by the Companys stock price as well as assumptions
regarding a number of variables. These variables include, but are not limited to the Companys expected stock price volatility over the term of the awards, interest rates, option forfeitures and employee stock option exercise behaviors.
Fiscal 2010 January15, 2010 During the second quarter of fiscal 2010, 18,510 stock options were granted to the Companys non-employee Directors with an estimated fair value of $2106 per share, using the Black-Scholes
option-pricing model with the following assumptions:  Risk-free interest rate 254  Expected life 543years Expected volatility 354 Dividend yield 14
% Fiscal 2009 January15,
2009 During the second quarter of fiscal 2009, 68,890 stock options were granted to the Companys non-employee Directors with a
weighted average estimated fair value of $1208 per share, using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model with the following weighted average assumptions:  Risk-free interest rate 145 Expected life 551years Expected volatility 352 Dividend yield 17
% There were no stock options granted to the
Companys non-employee Directors during fiscal 2008 due to the expiration of the Companys non-employee Directors plan. The
risk-free interest rate assumption for periods within the contractual life of the option is based on the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant. Expected volatility is based on a combination of historical volatility of the
Companys stock and implied volatilities of publicly traded options to buy FactSet common stock with contractual terms closest to the expected life of options granted to employees. The approach to utilize a mix of historical and implied
volatility was based upon the availability of actively traded options on the Companys stock and the Companys assessment that a combination of implied volatility and historical volatility is best representative of future stock price
trends. The Company uses historical data to estimate option exercises and non-employee director terminations within the valuation model. The dividend yield assumption is based on the Companys history and expectation of dividend payouts.

Restricted Stock
Awards On October23, 2009, the Company granted 161,794 restricted stock awards which entitle the holder to shares of common
stock as the award vests over time. The grant date fair value of the award was measured by reducing the grant date price of FactSets share by the present value of the dividends expected to be paid on the underlying shares during the requisite
service period, discounted at the appropriate risk-free interest rate. The resulting fair value of the restricted stock awards granted on October23, 2009 was $6285. On February9, 2010, the Company granted 90,030 restricted stock awards to employees which entitle the holder to shares of common stock as the award vests over time, but are not entitled to dividends
declared on the underlying shares while the restricted stock is unvested. The grant date fair value of the awards were measured by reducing the grant date price of FactSets share by the present value of the dividends expected to be paid on the
underlying shares during the requisite service period, discounted at the appropriate risk-free interest rate. The resulting weighted average fair value of the restricted stock awards granted on February9, 2010 was $5942. 
On June1, 2010, the Company granted 15,000 restricted stock units which entitle the holder to shares of common stock as the awards vests over time.
The closing price of FactSet common stock on the grant date of $6741 was reduced to reflect the loss of future dividends. The resulting fair value of the restricted stock units granted on June1, 2010 was $6249. 
There were no restricted stock awards granted during fiscal 2009. Accuracy of Fair Value Estimates The Company is responsible for determining the
assumptions used in estimating the fair value of its share-based payment awards. The Companys determination of fair value of share-based payment awards on the date of grant using an option-pricing model is affected by the Companys stock
price as well as assumptions regarding a number of highly complex and subjective variables. These variables include, but are not limited to the Companys expected stock price volatility over the term of the awards, interest rates, option
forfeiture rates and actual and projected employee stock option exercise behaviors. Option-pricing models were developed for use in estimating the value of traded options that have no vesting or hedging restrictions and are fully transferable.

Unrecognized
Tax Benefits Applicable accounting guidance prescribes a comprehensive model for the financial statement recognition, measurement,
classification and disclosure of uncertain tax positions that a company has taken or expects to take on a tax return. A company can recognize the financial effect of an income tax position only if it is more likely than not greater than 50% that
the tax position will prevail upon tax examination, based solely on the technical merits of the tax position. Otherwise, no benefit or expense can be recognized in the consolidated financial statements. The tax benefits recognized are measured based
on the largest benefit that has a greater than fifty percent likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement. Additionally, companies are required to accrue interest and related penalties, if applicable, on all tax exposures for which reserves
have been established consistent with jurisdictional tax laws. As of August31, 2010, the Company had gross unrecognized tax benefits
totaling $73 million, including $11 million of accrued interest, recorded as non-current taxes payable in the Statement of Financial Condition. Unrecognized tax benefits represent tax positions taken on tax returns but not yet recognized in the
consolidated financial statements. If recognized, essentially all of the unrecognized tax benefits and related interest would be recorded as a benefit to tax expense on the consolidated statement of income. Audits by multiple tax authorities are
currently ongoing. The Company has no reason to believe that such audits will result in the payment of additional taxes and/or penalties that would have a material adverse effect on the Companys results of operations or financial position,
beyond current estimates. Any changes in accounting estimates resulting from new developments with respect to uncertain tax positions will be recorded as appropriate. The Company does not currently anticipate that the total amounts of unrecognized
tax benefits will significantly change within the next 12months.

A provision has not been made for
additional U.S. Federal or foreign taxes as of August31, 2010 on undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries, except for the United Kingdom and France, because the Company intends to reinvest these funds indefinitely to support foreign
growth opportunities. The amount of such undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries included in consolidated retained earnings was immaterial at August31, 2010 and 2009, respectively. It is not practicable to estimate the unrecognized
deferred tax liability on these undistributed earnings. These earnings could become subject to additional tax if they are remitted as dividends, loaned to FactSet, or upon sale of the subsidiarys stock.

SEGMENT INFORMATION Operating segments are defined as components of an enterprisethat engage in business activities from which it
may earn revenues and incur expenses, whose operating results are regularly reviewed by the enterprises chief operating decision maker CODM to make decisions about resources to be allocated to the segment and assess its
performance, and for which discrete financial information is available. FactSets CODM is its Chief Executive Officer, who is responsible for making decisions about resources allocated amongst the operating segments based on actual results.
The Companys operations are organized into three reportable segments based on geographic operations: the U.S., Europe and Asia Pacific.
These reportable segments are consistent with how the Company, including its CODM, manages the business and the demographic markets in which the Company serves. Each segment provides integrated global financial and economic information to investment
managers, investment banks and other financial services professionals. The U.S. segment services finance professionals including financial institutions throughout North America, while the European and Asia Pacific segments service investment
professionals located throughout Europe and Asia. The accounting policies of the segments are the same as those described in the Note 2, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies. The European segment is headquartered in London, England and maintains office locations in France, Germany, the Netherlands and Italy. The Asia Pacific segment is headquartered in Tokyo, Japan with office
locations in Hong Kong, Australia, India and the Philippines. Sales, consulting and data collection are the primary functional groups based at the Companys non-U.S. operations. Segment revenues reflect direct sales to clients based in their
respective geographic locations. There are no intersegment or intercompany sales of the FactSet service. Each segment records compensation, including stock-based compensation, amortization of intangible assets, depreciation of furniture and
fixtures, amortization of leasehold improvements, communication costs, professional fees, rent expense, travel, marketing, office and other direct expenses related to its employees. Of the total $222 million of goodwill reported by the Company at
August31, 2010, 66% was recorded in the U.S. segment, 32% in the European segment and the remaining 2% in the Asia Pacific segment. The
following reflects the results of operations of the segments consistent with the Companys management system. These results are used, in part, by management, both in evaluating the performance of, and in allocating resources to, each of the
segments in thousands.

Expenditures associated with the Companys data centers, product development and corporate headquarters charges are recorded by the U.S. segment and are not
allocated to the European and Asia Pacific segments.  The decrease in the Asia Pacific operating profit in fiscal 2010 as compared to fiscal 2009 was driven by the offshore expansion of the Companys proprietary
content operations in India and the Philippines. In fiscal 2010, FactSet increased its content collection headcount at its facilities in India and the Philippines by over 900 employees.

SIGNIFICANT CLIENTS No
single client represented 10% or more of FactSets total revenues in any fiscal year presented. As of August31, 2010 and 2009, respectively, the Companys largest individual client accounted for less than 2% of total subscriptions.
In both years, subscriptions from the ten largest clients did not surpass 16% of total subscriptions. SIGNIFICANT VENDORS 
FactSet maintains contractual relationships with a minimum of two content providers for each type of financial data, when possible. No single vendor or data supplier represented 10% or more of FactSets total expenses in any fiscal year

Long-lived assets consist of property, equipment and leasehold improvements, net of accumulated depreciation and amortization and exclude goodwill, identifiable
intangible assets, deferred taxes and other assets. 17. COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES 
Commitments represent obligations, such as those for future purchases of goods or services that are not yet recorded on the balance sheet as liabilities.
FactSet records liabilities for commitments when incurred i.e., when the goods or services are received. 
Lease Commitments At August31, 2010, the Company leases approximately 169,000 square feet of office space at its headquarters in Norwalk, Connecticut. In addition, FactSet leases office space in the U.S. in New York,
New York; Boston, Massachusetts; Chicago, Illinois; Manchester, New Hampshire; Reston, Virginia; Austin, Texas; San Mateo, California; Newark, New Jersey; and Tuscaloosa, Alabama. Outside the U.S., the Companys operations are conducted in
leased office space in London, England; Paris and Avon, France; Amsterdam, the Netherlands; Frankfurt, Germany; Milan, Italy; Tokyo, Japan; Hong Kong; Hyderabad and Mumbai, India; Sydney, Australia; and Manila, the Philippines. The leases expire on
various dates through March 2021. Total minimum rental payments associated with the leases are recorded as rent a component of selling, general and administrative expenses on a straight-line basis over the periods of the respective non-cancelable
lease terms. The Company believes that its leased office space is adequate for its current needs and that additional space is available for lease to meet any future needs. During fiscal 2010, the Company entered into new lease agreements in the ordinary course of business to support operations in New York and the Philippines resulting in incremental future minimum rental
payments of $71 million over the remaining non-cancelable lease term. The new office space expanded the existing New York location by 22,000 square feet and the Companys Manila office by 17,200 square feet. Including the agreements signed
during fiscal 2010 for additional space in New York and Manila, the Companys worldwide leased office space increased to approximately 640,000 square feet, up 6% from a year ago. The additional office space is necessary to support the
Companys employee base that rose by 39% over the last twelve months driven by the growth of the FactSet proprietary content collection operation and the hiring of consultants and software engineers in the second half of fiscal 2010.
85 Table of Contents
At August31, 2010, the
Companys lease commitments for office space provide for the following future minimum rental payments under non-cancelable operating leases with remaining terms in excess of one year in thousands:  Years Ended August31 MinimumLeasePayments 2011 22,495 2012 20,468 2013 19,439 2014 16,188 2015 13,944 Thereafter 48,270 Total 140,804
During fiscal 2010, 2009 and 2008,
rental expense for all operating leases amounted to approximately $306 million, $267 million and $221 million, respectively. Approximately $43 million of standby letters of credit have been issued during the ordinary course of business in
connection with the Companys current lease office space as of August31, 2010. Purchase Commitments with
Suppliers Purchase obligations represent payment due in future periods in respect of commitments to the Companys various
data vendors as well as commitments to purchase goods and services such as telecommunication and computer maintenance services. These purchase commitments are agreements that are enforceable and legally binding on FactSet and that specify all
significant terms, including: fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased; fixed, minimum or variable price provisions; and the approximate timing of the transaction. As of August31, 2010 and 2009, the Company had total purchase commitments of
$456 million and $421 million, respectively. Contingencies 
Legal matters 
FactSet accrues non income-tax liabilities for contingencies when management believes that a loss is probable and the amounts can be reasonably estimated,
while contingent gains are recognized only when realized. The Company is subject to legal proceedings, claims, and litigation arising in the ordinary course of business. Although management currently believes that resolving claims against the
Company, individually or in the aggregate, will not have a material adverse impact on its consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows, these matters are subject to inherent uncertainties and managements view of these
matters may change in the future. Income Taxes Uncertain income tax positions are accounted for in accordance with applicable accounting guidance see Note 15. FactSet is currently under audit by multiple tax authorities. The Company has reserved for
potential adjustments to its provision for income taxes that may result from examinations by, or any negotiated agreements with, these tax authorities, and the Company believes that the final outcome of these examinations or agreements will not have
a material effect on its results of operations. If events occur which indicate payment of these amounts is unnecessary, the reversal of the liabilities would result in the recognition of tax benefits in the period FactSet determines the liabilities
are no longer necessary. If the Companys estimates of the federal, state, and foreign income tax liabilities are less than the ultimate assessment, a further charge to expense would result. 
Indemnifications 
As permitted or required under Delaware law and to the maximum extent allowable under that law, FactSet has certain obligations to indemnify its current
and former officers and directors for certain events or occurrences while the officer or director is, or was serving, at FactSets request in such capacity. These indemnification obligations are valid as long as the director or officer acted in
good faith and in a manner the person reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best interests of the Company, and with respect to any criminal action or proceeding, had no reasonable cause to believe his or her conduct was unlawful. The
maximum potential amount of future payments FactSet could be required to make under these indemnification obligations is unlimited; however, FactSet has a director and officer insurance policy that mitigates FactSets exposure and enables
FactSet to recover a portion of any future amounts paid. The Company believes the estimated fair value of these indemnification obligations is minimal.

18. REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITIES
The Company maintains its three-year credit facility with JPMorgan Chase Bank. The credit facility is available in an aggregate principal
amount of up to $125 million for working capital and general corporate purposes, maturing on March31, 2011. Approximately $33 million of the credit facility with JPMorgan Chase has been utilized for standby letters of credit issued during
the ordinary course of business as of August31, 2010. The Company is obligated to pay a commitment fee on the unused portion of the facility at a weighted average annual rate of 0125%. The facility also contains covenants that, among other
things, require the Company to maintain minimum levels of consolidated net worth and certain leverage and fixed charge ratios. 19. RISK
AND CONCENTRATIONS OF CREDIT RISK Financial Risk Management 
In the normal course of business, FactSet is exposed to foreign currency exchange risk and interest rate risk that could impact its financial position and
results of operations. Foreign Currency Exchange Risk The Company is exposed to changes in foreign currency exchange rates, which could affect its operating results, financial position and cash flows. The Companys primary foreign currency market
exposures include the Euro, British PoundSterling, Japanese Yen, Indian Rupee and Philippines Peso. The Companys non-U.S. dollar denominated revenues expected to be recognized over the next twelve months are estimated to be $17 million
while our non-U.S. dollar denominated expenses are $128 million, which translates into a net foreign currency exposure of $111 million per year. To the extent that FactSets international activities recorded in local currencies increase in the
future, its exposure to fluctuations in currency exchange rates will correspondingly increase. FactSet manages its exposure to foreign currency exchange risk through its regular operating and financing activities and, when appropriate, through the
use of derivative financial instruments. These derivative financial instruments are utilized to hedge currency exposures as well as to reduce earnings volatility resulting from shifts in market rates. FactSet only enters into foreign currency
forward contracts to manage foreign currency exposures. The fair market values of all the Companys derivative contracts change with fluctuations in currency rates and are designed so that any changes in their values are offset by changes in
the values of the underlying exposures. See Note 6 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional analysis of our foreign currency exchange rate risk. Interest Rate Risk The fair market value of the Companys cash and cash
equivalents at August31, 2010 was $196 million and consisted of demand deposits and money market funds with maturities of three months or less at the date of acquisition. It is anticipated that the fair market value of the Companys
portfolio will continue to be immaterially affected by fluctuations in interest rates. Concentrations of Credit Risk
Financial instruments that potentially subject the Company to concentrations of credit risk consist principally of cash
equivalents, accounts receivable, foreign currency forward contracts and data content providers. Cash equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents are maintained with several financial institutions. Deposits held with banks may exceed the amount of
insurance provided on such deposits. Generally, these deposits may be redeemed upon demand and are maintained with financial institutions with reputable credit and therefore bear minimal credit risk. The Company seeks to mitigate its credit risks by
spreading such risks across multiple counterparties and monitoring the risk profiles of these counterparties. Accounts
Receivable Accounts receivable are unsecured and are derived from revenues earned from clients located around the globe. FactSet
performs ongoing credit evaluations of its clients and does not require collateral from its clients. The Company reviews its receivables from clients for collectability and provides for an allowance for doubtful accounts to the extent that amounts
are not expected to be collected. Historical write-offs and losses have been within expectations. At August31, 2010 and 2009, no single client accounted for more than 2% of total subscriptions. For both years, subscriptions from the ten
largest clients did not surpass 16% of total client subscriptions. Derivative Instruments 
As a result of the use of derivative instruments, the Company is exposed to counterparty credit risk. FactSet has incorporated counterparty risk into the
fair value of its derivative assets and its own credit risk into the value of the Companys derivative liabilities. FactSet calculates credit risk from observable data related CDS as quoted by publicly available information. Counterparty risk
is represented by CDS spreads related to the senior secured debt of the respective bank with whom FactSet 
87 Table of Contents
has executed these derivative transactions. Because CDS spread information is not available for FactSet, the Companys credit risk is determined based on using a simple average of CDS
spreads for peer companies as determined by FactSet. To mitigate counterparty credit risk, FactSet enters into contracts with large financial institutions JPMorgan Chase and Bank of America. The Company regularly reviews its credit exposure
balances as well as the creditworthiness of the counterparties. Data Content Providers 
The Company seeks to maintain contractual relationships with a minimum of two content providers for each type of financial data; however this is not
possible for all types of data. Certain data sets that FactSet relies on have a limited number of suppliers, although the Company makes every effort to assure that alternative sources are available. The data provided to FactSet clients from each of
these databases is essential to the end users workflow and financial analysis. FactSet combines the data from these commercial databases into its own dedicated single online service, which the client accesses to perform their analysis.

to improve controls and increase efficiency, while ensuring that the Company maintains an effective internal control environment. Changes may include such activities as implementing new, more efficient systems, consolidating activities, and
migrating processes. There have been no changes in the Companys internal control over financial reporting as such
term is defined in Rules 13a-15f and 15d-15f under the Exchange Act during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2010 that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, the Companys internal control over financial
reporting. Managements Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting
