Management Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
Operations
The following discussion should be read in conjunction with, and is
qualified in its entirety by, the Financial Statements and the Notes thereto and
Selected Financial Data included elsewhere in this Form 10-K. Historical
operating results and percentage relationships among any amounts included in the
Financial Statements are not necessarily indicative of trends in operating
results for any future period.
Overview
The Company core business is the manufacture and sale of high quality,
precision steel balls and rollers. In 2000, sales of balls and rollers accounted
for approximately 77% of the Company total net sales. Of this 77%, balls
accounted for 72% and rollers accounted for 5%. Sales of precision molded
plastic parts accounted for the remaining 23%. See Note 10 of the Notes to
Financial Statements.
Since the Company was formed, growth factors include its displacement of
captive ball manufacturing divisions of domestic and international bearing
manufacturers as a source of precision balls and increased sales of high
precision balls for quiet bearing applications. Sales of high precision balls
produced by the Company for use in quiet bearing applications has grown to
approximately 85% of total net ball sales. Management believes that the
Company sales growth since its formation has been due to its ability to
capitalize on opportunities in overseas markets and provide precision balls at
competitive prices, as well as its emphasis on product quality and customer
service.
As a result of changing dynamics in the marketplace, the Company
developed and is implementing an extensive new long-term growth strategy
involving both its core business and opportunities beyond the core markets that
are consistent with the Company strengths and culture.
On July 4, 1999, the Company, acquired substantially all of the assets
of Earsley Capital Corporation, formerly known as Industrial Molding Corporation
IMC. Formed in 1947, IMC provides full-service design and manufacture of
plastic injection molded components to the bearing, automotive, electronic,
leisure and consumer markets with an emphasis on value-added products that take
advantage of its capabilities in product development, tool design and tight
tolerance molding processes. IMC operates two manufacturing facilities in
Lubbock, Texas. During 2000, IMC sold its products to approximately 55 customers
in 12 different countries.
On March 16, 2000, the Company entered into a 50/50 joint venture with
General Bearing Corporation called NN General LLC NN General, which owns a
60% position in Jiangsu General Ball & Roller Company, Ltd. JGBR, a Chinese
precision ball and roller manufacturer located in Rugao City, Jiangsu
Providence, China. The Company investment includes a cash loan of $34
million. The remaining 40% of the Chinese company is owned by Jiangsu Steel Ball
Factory.
On July 31, 2000, the Company formed a majority owned stand-alone
company in Europe, NN Euroball ApS Euroball, for the manufacture and sale of
chrome steel balls used for ball bearings and other products. The Company owns
54% of Euroball. AB SKF and FAG Kugelfisher Georg Shafer AG, the parent
companies of SKF and FAG respectively each own 23%. As part of the transaction,
Euroball acquired the ball factories located in Pinerolo, Italy previously
owned by SKF, Eltmann, Germany previously owned by FAG, and Kilkenny, Ireland
previously owned by the Company. Acquisition financing of approximately 315
million euro approximately $297 million was drawn at closing, and the credit
facility provides for additional working capital expenditure financing. The
Company is required to consolidate Euroball due to its ability to exercise
control over its operations and has accounted for the acquisitions of the
Pinerolo, Italy and Eltmann, Germany ball factories using the purchase method of
accounting. Goodwill arising from this acquisition is being amortized on a
straight-line basis over 20 years.
On August 31, 2000 the Company acquired a 51% ownership interest in NN
Mexico, LLC NN Mexico, a Delaware limited liability company. NN Mexico holds
as its sole investment a 100% ownership interest in NN Arte, a manufacturer of
plastic components located in Guadalajara, Mexico. To acquire its 51% ownership
of NN Mexico, the Company made an initial contribution of $879,000, an
additional contribution of $671,000 and is obligated to provide
11 additional funding of $600,000 payable upon certain performance conditions
at NN Arte. The Company is required to consolidate NN Mexico due to its ability
to exercise control over NN Arte operations and has accounted for this
acquisition using the purchase method of accounting. At December 31, 2000, NN
Arte had not commenced operations.

Year Ended December 31, 2000 Compared to the Year Ended December 31, 1999
Net Sales. The Company net sales increased $468 million or 549 from $853 million in 1999 to $1321 million in 2000. The formation of Euroball
in August of 2000 contributed $304 million of the increase, excluding the third
and fourth quarter sales of the Ireland facility, which were consolidated into
the results of the Company prior to the formation of Euroball. Additionally the
inclusion of a full year of IMC net sales contributed $156 million. The
Company acquired IMC on July 4, 1999, thus six months of IMC results were
included in the Company 1999 results. The remainder of the increase is due to
increased ball and roller sales in the first half of the year, offset by slowing
domestic demand for balls and rollers in the second half of the year. The
Company experienced decreased sales in the second half of the year for the
Plastics Division due primarily to decreased sales to one customer.
12     Gross Profit. Gross profit increased by $129 million, or 508% from
$253 million in 1999 to $382 million in 2000. Net of the Ireland facility
third and fourth quarter gross profit, the Euroball joint venture accounted for
$75 million of the increase. The inclusion of a full year of IMC gross profit
contributed an additional $40 million in gross profit. The remainder of the
increase is primarily attributed to increased sales at the Domestic Ball and
Roller Division. To a lesser degree, decreased costs as a percentage of sales at
the Domestic Ball and Roller Division contributed to the increase in gross
profit. This was due mainly to inventory builds during the fourth quarter of
2000. As a percentage of net sales, gross profit decreased from 297% in 1999 to
289% in 2000.
Selling, General and Administrative Expenses. Selling, general and
administrative expenses increased by $47 million, or 688% from $69 million in
1999 to $116 million in 2000. The Euroball Division, net of the Ireland
facility, accounted for $24 million of the increase. The inclusion of a full
year of IMC results accounted for $16 million of the increase. The remainder
of the increase is primarily attributed to increased administrative expenses
associated with the Company business development activity during the year. As
a percentage of net sales, selling, general and administrative expenses
increased from 80% in 1999 to 88% in 2000.
Depreciation and Amortization. Depreciation and amortization expenses
increased $30 million, or 495% from $61 million in 1999 to $92 million in
2000. The addition of Euroball, adjusting for the Ireland facility, accounted
for $24 million of the increase. The inclusion of a full year of IMC results
accounted for the remainder of the increase. As a percentage of net sales,
depreciation and amortization decreased from 72% in 1999 to 69% in 2000.
Interest Expense. Interest expense increased by $12 million from
$523,000 in 1999 to $18 million in 2000. Interest expense related to the debt
incurred by Euroball to finance the joint venture transaction accounted for
$622,000 of the increase. Additionally, the inclusion of a full year of interest
expense related to the purchase of the IMC business accounted for approximately
$500,000 of the increase. The remainder of the increase is due to increased
expenditures associated with the Company business development activity during
2000. Additionally, the timing of expenditures associated with the March 12,
2000 fire and the reimbursement of insurance proceeds has caused an increase in
the levels outstanding under the Company domestic line of credit. As a
percentage of net sales, interest expense increased from 06% in 1999 to 13% in
2000. See Management Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition -
Liquidity and Capital Resources.
Equity in Earnings of Unconsolidated Affiliates. Equity in earnings of
unconsolidated affiliates increased $48,000 from $0 in 1999 to $48,000. The
increase is due to the Company share of earnings from the NN General joint
venture with General Bearing Corporation. Earnings from this venture were offset
by losses incurred from the start-up of the marketing arm of this venture and
losses sustained from start-up expenses from the investment in NN Mexico LLC.
Gain on Involuntary Conversion. The Company had a gain on involuntary
conversion of $728,000 in 2000 related to the excess of insurance proceeds over
the net book value of assets destroyed in the fire and direct costs due to the
March 12, 2000 fire at the Erwin facility.
Minority Interest of Consolidated Subsidiary. Minority interest of
consolidated subsidiary increased $660,000 from $0 in 1999 to $660,000 in 2000.
This increase is due entirely to the Euroball joint venture. The Company is
required to consolidate Euroball due to its ability to exercise control over the
operations. The Company owns 54% of the shares of the joint venture with the
minority partners owning the remaining 46%. Minority interest of consolidated
interest represents the combined 46% interest of the minority partners.
Net Income. Net income increased $22 million, or 287%, from $78
million in 1999 to $100 million in 2000. As a percentage of net sales, net
income decreased from 91% in 2000 to 76% in 2000.
13 Year Ended December 31, 1999 Compared to the Year Ended December 31, 1998
Net Sales. The Company net sales increased $123 million, or 168 from $730 million in 1998 to $853 million in 1999. The IMC acquisition
accounted for $176 million in additional sales for the twelve-month period in
1999. Foreign net sales decreased $13 million or 39%, from $337 million in
1998 to $324 million in 1999. The decrease in foreign net sales was due
primarily to decreased sales volumes with existing customers, largely due to
general economic conditions in Asia and the impact of the relative strength of
the U.S. dollar against world currencies in the first two quarters of the year.
This was partially offset by the addition of $880,000 in foreign sales
contributed by the IMC acquisition. Domestic net sales increased $136
million, or 346%, from $393 million in 1998 to $529 million in 1999. This
increase was primarily due to the IMC acquisition which contributed $167
million in domestic sales for 1999. This was partially offset by decreased
domestic sales primarily to one customer.
Gross Profit. Gross profit increased by $26 million, or 115% from
$227 million in 1998 to $253 million in 1999. The IMC acquisition accounted
for $43 million in increased gross profit but was mostly offset by increased
costs associated with capacity under-utilization in the Ball & Roller division
due to decreased levels of volume during 1999 as well as the short-term impact
of the inventory reduction efforts. As a percentage of net sales, gross profit
decreased from 310% in 1998 to 297% in 1999.
Selling, General and Administrative Expenses. Selling, general and
administrative expenses increased by $958,000, or 162% in 1999 to $69 million
from $59 million in 1998. The acquisition of IMC accounted for $18 million of
the increase offset by decreased spending in the Ball & Roller division. As a
percentage of net sales, selling, general and administrative expenses decreased
slightly to 80% in 1999 from 81% in 1998.
Depreciation and Amortization Expense. Depreciation expense increased
$15 million, or 345%, to $61 million in 1999 from $46 million in 1998. The
acquisition of IMC accounted for $12 million of increased depreciation and
amortization expense. The remainder of the increase was due to purchases of
capital equipment at the Company ball and roller facilities. As a percentage
of net sales, depreciation increased to 72% in 1999 from 62% in 1998.
Interest Expense. Interest expense increased $459,000 from $64,000 in
1998 to $523,000 in 1999. The increase was due to increased levels outstanding
under the Company line of credit in 1999. In July of 1999, the Company
borrowed $185 million under the line of credit for the purchase of selected
assets of the Earsley Capital Corporation. See Management Discussion and
Analysis of Financial Condition --Liquidity and Capital Resources.
Net Income. Net income increased $103,000, or 13% from $77 million in
1998 to $78 million in 1999. As a percentage of net sales, net income decreased
to 91% in 1999 from 105% in 1998. The decrease in net income as a percentage
of net sales was due primarily to excess capacity at the Company Ball & Roller
division and a related gross profit margin decrease, increased depreciation
expense and interest expense related to the IMC acquisition. Offsetting these
factors was a slightly lower federal tax rate.
Liquidity and Capital Resources
In July 1997, the Company entered into a loan agreement with First
American National Bank First American which provides for a revolving credit
facility of up to $25 million, expiring on June 30, 2000. In July, 1999, the
Company extended the terms of the loan agreement with First American to expire
on October 30, 2001. Amounts outstanding under the revolving facility are
unsecured and bear interest at a floating rate equal to, at the Company
option, either LIBOR plus 065% or the Fed Funds effective rate plus 15%. In
August 2000, the Company entered into an agreement, which provided an additional
$2 million of availability to the revolving credit facility through December 31,
2000. The loan agreement contains customary financial and operating restrictions
on the Company, including covenants, restricting the Company, without First
American consent, from incurring additional indebtedness from, or pledging any
of its assets to, other lenders and from disposing of a substantial portion of
its assets. In addition, the Company is prohibited from declaring any dividend
if a default exists under the revolving credit facility at the time of, or would
occur as a result of, such declaration. The loan agreement also prohibits sales
of property outside of the ordinary
14 course of business. The loan agreement also contains customary financial
covenants with respect to the Company, including a covenant that the Company
earnings will not decrease in any year by more than fifty percent of earnings in
the Company immediately preceding fiscal year. The Company extended and
restated this facility in February 2001. See Management Discussion and
Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Subsequent Events.
In July 2000, NN Euroball ApS, and its subsidiaries entered into a loan
agreement with HypoVereinsbank Luxembourg S.A. as agent for Bayerische Hypo-und
Vereinsbank AG of Munich, Germany for a senior secured revolving credit facility
of Euro 5,000,000, expiring on July 15, 2006 and a senior secured term loan of
Euro 36,000,000, expiring on July 15, 2006. On July 31, 2000, upon closing of
the joint venture, NN Euroball ApS borrowed a total of Euro 31,500,000 against
these facilities for acquisition financing. Additional working capital and
capital expenditure financing are provided for under the facility. Amounts
outstanding under the facilities accrue interest at a floating rate equal to
EURIBOR plus an applicable margin of between 1125% to 225% based upon
calculated financial ratios. The loan agreement contains various restrictive
financial and non financial covenants. The Company, as of December 31, 2000, was
in compliance with all such covenants.
The Company arrangements with its domestic customers typically provide
that payments are due within 30 days following the date of the Company
shipment of goods, while arrangements with foreign customers other than foreign
customers that have entered into an inventory management program with the
Company generally provide that payments are due within either 90 or 120 days
following the date of shipment. Under the Company inventory management
program, payments typically are due within 30 days after the product is used by
the customer. The Company net sales historically have not been of a seasonal
nature. However, seasonality has become a factor for the foreign ball and roller
sales in that many foreign customers cease production during the month of
August. The Company also experiences seasonal fluctuation through its Plastics
Division which provides several lines of seasonal hardware. For information
concerning the Company quarterly results of operations for the years ended
December 31, 2000 and 1999, see Note 14 of the Notes to Financial Statements.
The Company bills and receives payment from some of its foreign
customers in their local currency. To date, the Company has not been materially
adversely affected by currency fluctuations or foreign exchange restrictions.
Nonetheless, as a result of these sales, the Company foreign exchange risk has
increased. Various strategies to manage this risk are under development and
implementation, including a hedging program. In addition, a strengthening of the
U.S. dollar against foreign currencies could impair the ability of the Company
to compete with international competitors for foreign as well as domestic sales.
Working capital, which consists principally of accounts receivable and
inventories, was $282 million at December 31, 2000 as compared to $229 million
at December 31, 1999. The ratio of current assets to current liabilities
decreased from 32:1 at December 31, 1999 to 179:1 at December 31, 2000. Cash
flow from operations increased to $242 million during 2000 from $178 million
during 1999. This increase was primarily attributed to changes in working
capital accounts due to Euroball joint venture transaction completed in August
of 2000.
During 2001, the Company plans to spend approximately $53 million on
capital expenditures. The Company intends to finance these activities with cash
generated from operations and funds available under the credit facility
described above. The Company believes that funds generated from operations and
borrowings from the credit facility will be sufficient to finance the Company
working capital needs and projected capital expenditure requirements through
December 2001.
Subsequent Events
On February 16, 2001, the Company completed the acquisition of all of
the outstanding stock of The Delta Rubber Company, a Connecticut corporation
Delta for $225 million in cash, of which $500,000 is to be held in escrow
for one year from the date of closing. Delta provides high quality engineered
bearing seals and other precision-molded rubber products to original equipment
manufacturers. NN plans to continue the operation of the Delta business, which
operates a manufacturing facility in Danielson, Connecticut. AmSouth Bank
provided financing for the transaction.
15     In February of 2001, the Company extended and restated the $25 million
revolving credit facility with AmSouth Bank to temporarily increase the facility
to $50 million. The facility will be reduced to $25 million on June 30, 2001 in
anticipation of the Company structuring long-term financing arrangements for
this amount. The original $25 million revolving credit facility will expire on
July 25, 2003. In February 2001, the Company drew $23 million against the new
line to finance the acquisition of Delta. Amounts outstanding under the amended
revolving facility are unsecured and bear interest at a floating rate equal to
LIBOR plus an applicable margin of between 065% and 215% based upon calculated
financial ratios. The loan contains various restrictive financial and
non-financial covenants. The Company, as of March 23, 2001, was in compliance
with all such covenants.
On March 1, 2001, the Company entered into an agreement with AmSouth
Bank which provides an additional $2 million of availability to the revolving
credit facility through June 1, 2001. At March 23, 2001, the Company had no
amounts outstanding under this agreement.
The Euro
The treaty on European Union provided that an economic and monetary
union be established in Europe whereby a single European currency, the Euro, was
introduced to replace the currencies of participating member states. The Euro
was introduced on January 1, 1999, at which time the value of participating
member state currencies were irrevocably fixed against the Euro and the European
Currency Unit. For the three year transitional period ending December 31, 2001,
the national currencies of member states will continue to circulate but be in
sub-units of the Euro. At the end of the transitional period, Euro bank notes
and coins will be issued, and the national currencies of the member states will
be legal tender no later than June 30, 2002.
The Company currently has operations in Ireland, Germany and Italy,
which are Euro participating countries, and each facility sells product to
customers in many of the participating countries. The functional currency of the
Company Euroball operations is the Euro.
Seasonality and Fluctuation in Quarterly Results
The Company net sales historically have not been of a seasonal nature.
However, as foreign sales have increased as a percentage of total sales,
seasonality has become a factor for the Company in that many foreign customers
cease production during the month of August. For information concerning the
Company quarterly results of operations for the years ended December 31, 2000
and 1999, see Note 14 of the Notes to Financial Statements.
Inflation and Changes in Prices
While the Company operations have not been affected by inflation
during recent years, prices for 52100 Steel and other raw materials purchased by
the Company are subject to change. For example, during 1995, due to an increase
in worldwide demand for 52100 Steel and the decrease in the value of the United
States dollar relative to foreign currencies, the Company experienced an
increase in the price of 52100 Steel and some difficulty in obtaining an
adequate supply of 52100 Steel from its existing suppliers. Typically, the
Company pricing arrangements with its steel suppliers are subject to
adjustment once every six months. In an effort to limit its exposure to
fluctuations in steel prices, the Company has generally avoided the use of
long-term, fixed price contracts with its customers. Instead, the Company
typically reserves the right to increase product prices periodically in the
event of increases in its raw material costs. The Company was able to minimize
the impact on its operations resulting from the 52100 Steel price increases by
taking such measures.
Cautionary Statements for Purposes of the Safe Harbor Provisions of the
Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995
The Company wishes to caution readers that this report contains, and
future filings by the Company, press releases and oral statements made by the
Company authorized representatives may contain, forward-looking statements
that involve certain risks and uncertainties. Readers can identify these
forward-looking statements by the use of such verbs as expects, anticipates,
believes or similar verbs or
16 conjugations of such verbs. The Company actual results could differ materially
from those expressed in such forward-looking statements due to important factors
bearing on the Company business, many of which already have been discussed in
this filing and in the Company prior filings. The differences could be caused
by a number of factors or combination of factors including, but not limited to,
the risk factors described below. Readers are strongly encouraged to consider
these factors when evaluating any such forward-looking statement.
The following paragraphs discuss the risk factors the Company regards as
the most significant, although the Company wishes to caution that other factors
that are currently not considered as significant or that currently cannot be
foreseen may in the future prove to be important in affecting the Company
results of operations. The Company undertakes no obligation to update or revise
any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future
events or otherwise.
Industry Risks. Both the precision ball and roller and precision
plastics industries are cyclical and tend to decline in response to overall
declines in industrial production. The Company sales in the past have been
negatively affected, and in the future very likely would be negatively affected,
by adverse conditions in the industrial production sector of the economy or by
adverse global or national economic conditions generally.
Competition. The precision ball and roller market and the precision
plastics market are highly competitive, and many of manufacturers in each of the
markets are larger and have substantially greater resources than the Company.
The Company competitors are continuously exploring and implementing
improvements in technology and manufacturing processes in order to improve
product quality, and the Company ability to remain competitive will depend,
among other things, on whether it is able, in a cost effective manner, to keep
pace with such quality improvements. In addition, the Company competes with many
of its ball and roller customers that, in addition to producing bearings, also
internally produce balls and rollers for sale to third parties. The Company
faces a risk that its customers will decide to produce balls and rollers
internally rather than outsourcing their needs to the Company
Rapid Growth. The Company has significantly expanded its ball and roller
production facilities and capacity over the last several years. During 1997, the
Company purchased an additional manufacturing plant in Kilkenny, Ireland. The
Company continued this expansion in 2000 through its 54% ownership of the NN
Euroball joint venture with SKF and FAG. In addition, the Company invested in
Jiangsu General Ball & Roller Company, a Chinese joint venture specializing in
various types of ball production. The Company Ball & Roller Division currently
is not operating at full capacity and faces risks of further under-utilization
or inefficient utilization of its production facilities in future years. The
Company also faces risks associated with start-up expenses, inefficiencies,
delays and increased depreciation costs associated with these joint ventures and
expansions.
Raw Material Shortages. Because the balls and rollers manufactured by
the Company have highly-specialized applications, their production requires the
use of very particular types of steel. Due to quality constraints, the Company
obtains the majority of its steel from overseas suppliers. Steel shortages or
transportation problems, particularly with respect to 52100 Steel, could have a
detrimental effect on the Company business.
Risks Associated with International Trade. Because the Company a
obtains a majority of its raw materials for the manufacture of balls and rollers
from overseas suppliers, b now actively participates in overseas manufacturing
operations and c sells to a large number of international customers, the
Company faces risks associated with i adverse foreign currency
fluctuations,ii changes in trade, monetary and fiscal policies, laws and
regulations, and other activities of governments, agencies and similar
organizations, iii the imposition of trade restrictions or prohibitions, iv
the imposition of import or other duties or taxes, and v unstable governments
or legal systems in countries in which the Company suppliers, manufacturing
operations, and customers are located. An increase in the value of the United
States dollar relative to foreign currencies adversely affects the ability of
the Company to compete with its foreign-based competitors for international as
well as domestic sales.
17
Dependence on Major Customers. During 2000, the Company ten largest
customers accounted for approximately 69% of its net sales. Sales to various US
and foreign divisions of SKF, which is one of the largest bearing manufacturers
in the world, accounted for approximately 32% of net sales in 2000, and sales to
FAG accounted for approximately 17% of net sales. None of the Company other
customers accounted for more than 5% of its net sales in 2000. The loss of all
or a substantial portion of sales to these customers would have a material
adverse effect on the Company business.
Acquisitions. The Company growth strategy includes growth through
acquisitions. In 1999, the Company acquired the IMC businesses as part of that
strategy. In 2000, the Company formed the NN Euroball joint venture with SKF and
FAG and began operating two new ball manufacturing facilities. Although the
Company believes that it will be able to continue to integrate the operations of
IMC, NN Euroball and other companies acquired in the future into its operations
without substantial cost, delays or other problems, its ability to do so will
depend on, among other things, the adequacy of its implementation plans, the
ability of its management to effectively oversee and operate the combined
operations of the Company and the acquired businesses and its ability to achieve
desired operating efficiencies and sales goals. If the Company is not able to
successfully integrate the operations of acquired companies into its business,
its future earnings and profitability could be materially and adversely
affected.
Recently Issued Accounting Standards
In June 1998, the FASB issued SFAS No. 133 Accounting for Derivative
Instruments and Hedging Activities which establishes accounting and reporting
standards for derivative instruments and hedging activities and is effective for
the Company 2001 reporting cycle. The adoption of this standard by the Company
is not expected to result in significant adjustments to existing accounting
practices as the Company does not currently hold any derivative financial
instruments as of December 31, 2000.
In June 2000 the FASB issued SFAS No. 138, Accounting for Certain
Derivative Instruments and Certain Hedging Activity, an Amendment of SFAS 133.
SFAS No. 133 and SFAS No. 138 require that all derivative instruments be
recorded on the balance sheet at their respective fair values. SFAS No. 133 and
SFAS No. 138 are effective for all fiscal quarters of all fiscal years beginning
after June 30, 2000, which for the Company will be effective January 1, 2001.
The adoption of this standard by the Company is not expected to result in
significant adjustments to existing accounting practices as the Company does not
currently hold any derivative financial instruments or participate in
speculative activities.
Item 7A    Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk
The Company is exposed to changes in financial market conditions in the
normal course of its business due to its use of certain financial instruments as
well as transacting in various foreign currencies. To mitigate its exposure to
these market risks, the Company has established policies, procedures and
internal processes governing its management of financial market risks.
The Company is exposed to changes in interest rates primarily as a
result of its borrowing activities, which include a $27 million floating rate
revolving credit facility which is used to maintain liquidity and fund its
business operations domestically. Additionally, Euroball has a 5 million euro
floating rate revolving credit facility and a 360 million euro floating rate
secured term loan. At December 31, 2000, the Company had $267 million
outstanding under the domestic revolving credit facility and Euroball had $258
million outstanding under the Euroball revolving credit facility and term loan.
A one-percent increase in the interest rate charged on the Company outstanding
borrowings under the revolving credit facility would result in interest expense
increasing by approximately $564,000. The nature and amount of the Company
borrowings may vary as a result of future business requirements, market
conditions and other factors.
The Company operating cash flows denominated in foreign currencies are
exposed to changes in foreign exchange rates. Beginning in the 1997 fourth
quarter, upon the commencement of production in its Kilkenny, Ireland facility,
the Company began to bill and receive payment from some of its foreign customers
in their own currency. To date, the Company has not been materially adversely
affected by currency fluctuations of foreign exchange restrictions. However, to
help reduce exposure to foreign currency fluctuations, management has
implemented a foreign currency hedging program. The Company did not hold a
position in any foreign currency instruments of December 31, 2000.

a   Description of Business
NN, Inc. the Company is a manufacturer of precision balls,
rollers, and plastic injection molded products. The Company balls
and rollers are used primarily in the domestic and international
anti-friction bearing industry. The Company plastic injection
molded products are used in the bearing, automotive, instrumentation,
fiber optic, and consumer hardware industries. The ball and roller
segment comprises three manufacturing facilities located in the
eastern United States. The Company Euroball segment, which was
acquired in July 2000 see note 2 comprises manufacturing facilities
located in Kilkenny, Ireland, Eltman, Germany, and Pinerolo, Italy.
All of the facilities in the Euroball segment are engaged in the
production of precision balls and rollers. The plastic injection
molding segment, which was acquired in July 1999, See note 2 has a
manufacturing facility located in Texas. All of the Company
segments sell to foreign and domestic customers.
b Cash and Cash Equivalents
The Company considers all highly liquid investments with an original
maturity of three months or less as cash equivalents.
c Inventories
Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market. Cost is
determined using the first-in, first-out method.
d Property, Plant and Equipment
Property, plant and equipment are stated at cost less
accumulated depreciation. Expenditures for maintenance and
repairs are charged to expense as incurred. Major renewals and
betterments are capitalized. When a major property item is retired,
its cost and related accumulated depreciation or amortization are
removed from the property accounts and any gain or loss is recorded
in income or expense, respectively. The Company reviews the carrying
values of long-lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes
in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of an asset may not be
recoverable. In management opinion, no material impairment exists
at December 31, 2000 or 1999.
Depreciation is provided principally on the straight-line method over
the estimated useful lives of the depreciable assets for financial
reporting purposes. Accelerated depreciation methods are used for
income tax purposes.                                   Continued                    26                   NN, INC.

In thousands, except per share data    e Revenue Recognition
The Company generally recognizes a sale when goods are shipped and
ownership is assumed by the customer. The Company has an inventory
management program for certain major ball and roller customers
whereby sales are recognized when products are used by the customer
from consigned stock, rather than at the time of shipment. Inventory
on consignment at December 31, 2000 and 1999 was approximately $4,083
and $2,766, respectively.
f Income Taxes
Income taxes are accounted for under the asset and liability
method. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the
future tax consequences attributable to differences between the
financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and
liabilities and their respective tax bases and operating loss and tax
credit carryforwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are
measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income
in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be
recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets
and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in
the period that includes the enactment date.
g Net Income Per Common Share
Basic earnings per share reflect reported earnings divided by the
weighted average number of common shares outstanding. Diluted
earnings per share include the effect of dilutive stock options
outstanding during the year.
h Stock Incentive Plan
The Company applies the intrinsic value-based method of accounting
prescribed by Accounting Principles Board APB Opinion No. 25,
Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees, and related
interpretations including Financial Accounting Standards
Board FASB Interpretation No. 44, Accounting for Certain
Transactions involving Stock Compensation an interpretation of APB
Opinion No. 25 issued in March 2000, to account for its fixed plan
stock options. Under this method, compensation expense is recorded on
the date of grant only if the current market price of the underlying
stock exceeded the exercise price. Statement of Financial Accounting
Standards SFAS No. 123, Accounting for Stock-Based
Compensation, established accounting and disclosure
requirements using a fair value-based method of accounting for
stock-based employee compensation plans. As allowed by SFAS No. 123,
the Company has elected to continue to apply the intrinsic
value-based method of accounting described above, and has adopted the
disclosure requirements of SFAS No. 123.

December 31, 2000, 1999 and 1998
In thousands, except per share data    i Principles of Consolidation
The Company consolidated financial statements include the accounts
of NN, Inc. and subsidiaries in which the Company owns more than
50%. Unconsolidated subsidiaries and investments where ownership is
between 20% and 50% are accounted for under the equity method. All
significant intercompany profits, transactions, and balances have
been eliminated in consolidation. The ownership interests of other
shareholders in companies that are more than 50% owned, but
less than 100% owned, are reflected as minority interests.
Minority interest represents the minority shareholders of NN
Euroball ApS and the minority shareholder of NN Mexico, LLC.
j Foreign Currency Translation
Assets and liabilities of the Company foreign subsidiary are
translated at current exchange rates, while revenue and expenses are
translated at average rates prevailing during the year. Translation
adjustments are reported as a component of other comprehensive
income.
k Goodwill
Goodwill, which represents the excess of purchase price over fair
value of net assets acquired, is amortized on a straight-line basis
over the expected periods to be benefited, generally 20 years. The
Company assesses the recoverability of this intangible asset by
determining whether the amortization of the goodwill balance over its
remaining life can be recovered through undiscounted future operating
cash flows of the acquired operation. The amount of goodwill
impairment, if any, is meansred based on projected discounted future
operating cash flows using a discount rate reflecting the Company
average cost of funds.
l  Impairment of Long-Lived Assets and Long-Lived Assets to Be
Disposed Of
The Company accounts for long-lived assets in accordance with the
provisions of SFAS No. 121, Accounting for the Impairment of
Long-Lived Assets and for Long-Lived Assets to Be Disposed Of.
This statement requires that long-lived assets and certain
identifiable intangibles be reviewed for impairment whenever
events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount
of an asset may not be recoverable. Recoverability of assets to be
held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of
an asset to future net cash flows expected to be generated by the
asset. If such assets are considered to be impaired, the impairment
to be recognized is measured by the amount by which the carrying
amount of the assets exceeds the fair value of the assets. Assets to
be disposed of are reported at the lower of the carrying amount or
fair value less costs to sell.

December 31, 2000, 1999 and 1998
In thousands, except per share data    m Use of estimates in the preparation of financial statements.
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally
accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates
and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and
liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at
the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of
revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results
could differ from those estimates.
n Recently Issued Accounting Standards
In June 1998 the Financial Accounting Standards Board FASB issued
Statement of Financial Accounting Standards SFAS No. 133,
Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Certain Hedging
Activities. In June 2000 the FASB issued SFAS No. 138, Accounting
for Certain Derivative Instruments and Certain Hedging Activity, an
Amendment of SFAS 133. SFAS No. 133 and SFAS No. 138 require that
all derivative instruments be recorded on the balance sheet at their
respective fair values. SFAS No. 133 and SFAS No. 138 are effective
for all fiscal quarters of all fiscal years beginning after June 30,
2000, which for the Company will be effective January 1, 2001. The
adoption of this standard by the Company is not expected to result in
significant adjustments to existing accounting practices as
the Company does not currently hold any derivative financial
instruments or participate in speculative activities.
o Reclassifications
Certain 1999 and 1998 amounts have been reclassified to conform with
the 2000 presentation.
2  Acquisitions
Effective July 31, 2000, the Company completed its Euroball
transaction. Completion of the transaction required the Company to
start a majority owned stand-alone company in Europe, NN Euroball ApS, for
the manufacture and sale of precision steel balls used for ball bearings
and other products. The Company owns 54% of the shares of NN Euroball,
ApS, AB SKF SKF, a Swedish Company, and FAG Kugelfischer Georg Schager
AG FAG, a German Company, own 23% each. NN Euroball ApS subsequently
acquired the steel ball manufacturing facilities located in Pinerolo,
Italy previously owned by SKF, Eltman, Germany previously owned by FAG
and Kilkenny, Ireland previously owned by the Company. NN Euroball ApS
paid approximately $57,788 for the net assets acquired from SKF and FAG.
The acquisitions of the Pinerolo, Italy and Eltmann, Germany ball
manufacturing facilities have been accounted for by the purchase method of
accounting and, accordingly, the results of operations of Euroball have
been included in the Company consolidated financial statements from July
31, 2000. The excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the net
identifiable assets acquired of $15,507 has been recorded as goodwill and
is being amortized on a straight-line basis over twenty years.                                   Continued                    29                   NN, INC.

In thousands, except per share data
On December 7, 1998 the Company granted a total of 20 options to the
members of its Board of Directors. These options carry an exercise price
equal to the market price on the date of issuance and vest equally over a
period of five years, beginning one year from date of grant. The maximum
term of these options is 10 years. On July 4, 1999 the Company granted an
additional 20 options to the members of its Board of Directors. These
options carry an exercise price equal to the market price on the date of
issuance and vest six months from the date of grant. The maximum term of
these options is 10 years.
On August 4, 1998 the Company Board of Directors authorized the
repurchase of up to 740 shares of its Common Stock, equaling 5% of the
Company issued and outstanding shares as of August 4, 1998. The program
may be extended or discontinued at any time, and there is no assurance that
the Company will purchase any or all of the full amount authorized. The
Company has not repurchased any shares under this program through December
31, 2000.
All options granted in the period January 1, 2000 through December 31,
2000, except those granted to the Company Board of Directors as described
above, vest ratably over periods ranging from six months to five years,
beginning one year from date of grant. The exercise price of each option
equals the market price of the Company stock on the date of grant, and an
option maximum term is 10 years. All options granted in the period
January 1, 1995 through December 31, 1998, except those granted to the
Company Board of Directors as described above, vest 20% annually
beginning one year from date of grant. The exercise price of each option
equals the market price of the Company stock on the date of grant, and an
option maximum term is 10 years. Certain options granted in July, 1999
were deemed to be repriced options under the applicable accounting
requirements. These options which were fully vested as of the effective
date of FIN 44 are treated under variable accounting. Accordingly,
compensation expense will be recognized to the extent the market price of
the Company stock exceeds $1050 compensation expense will be recognized.
The Company has adopted the provisions of Statement of Financial Accounting
Standards No. 123, Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation SFAS 123.
SFAS 123 encourages but does not require a fair value based method of
accounting for stock compensation plans. the Company has elected to
continue accounting for its stock compensation plan using the intrinsic
value based method and, accordingly, has not recorded compensation expense
for each of the three years ended December 31, 2000. Had compensation cost
for the Company stock compensation plan been determined based on the fair
value at the option grant dates, the Company net income and earnings per
share would have been reduced to the proforma amounts indicated below                                Year ended December 31,

10 Segment Information
The Company adopted the provisions of SFAS No. 131, Disclosures about
Segments of an Enterprise and Related Information, effective with its
December 31, 1998 reporting and identified its reportable segments based
upon the geographic location of its business units. During 2000, the
Company reportable segments are based on differences in product lines
and geographic locations and are divided between balls and rollers,
Euroball and plastics. The ball and roller segment comprises three
manufacturing facilities in the eastern United States. The Euroball
segment acquired in July 2000, comprises manufacturing facilities located
in Kilkenny, Ireland, Eltmann, Germany and Pinerolo, Italy. All of the
facilities in the ball and roller and Euroball segments are engaged in the
production of precision balls and rollers used primarily in the bearing
industry. The plastics segment is concentrated in one facility located in
Lubbock, Texas which represents the IMC business acquired in July 1999.
This facility is engaged in the production of plastic injection molded
products for the bearing, automotive, instrumentation, fiber optic and
consumer hardware markets.
The accounting policies of the segments are the same as those described in
the summary of significant accounting policies. The Company evaluates
segment performance based on profit or loss from operations before income
taxes not including nonrecurring gains and losses. The Company accounts
for intersegment sales and transfers at current market prices; however,
the Company did not have any material intersegment transactions during
2000, 1999 or 1998.                  December 31,        December 31,      December 31,

Although realization of deferred tax assets is not assured, management
believes that it is more likely than not that all of the deferred tax
assets will be realized. However, the amount of the deferred tax assets
considered realizable could be reduced based on changing conditions.
The Company has not recognized a deferred tax liability for the
undistributed earnings of its non-U.S. subsidiaries and non-U.S. corporate
joint ventures. The Company expects to reinvest these undistributed
earnings indefinitely and does not expect such earnings to become subject
to U.S. taxation in the foreseeable future. A deferred tax liability will
be recognized when the Company expects that it will recover these
undistributed earnings in a taxable manner, such as through the receipt of
dividends or sale of the investments. It is not practicable to determine
the U.S. income tax liability, if any, that would be payable if such
earnings were not reinvested indefinitely.
Income tax payments were approximately $5,207, $3,123 and $3,052 in 2000,
1999, 1998, respectively.

16 Fire
On March 12, 2000, a fire damaged a portion of the Company manufacturing
plant in Erwin, Tennessee. The fire was contained to approximately
30% of the productions area and did not result in serious injury to any
employee. Effected production was shifted to the Company other
facilities as possible as well as the use of other suppliers to protect
product supply to customers. Insurance coverage for the loss provides for
reimbursement of the replacement value of property and equipment damaged
in the fire. At December 31, 2000 the Company is in the process of
settling the insurance claim. For the year ended December 31, 2000, the
net gain on involuntary conversion of $728 represents insurance proceeds
received in excess of costs incurred to date.
17 Subsequent Event
On February 16, 2001, the Company completed the acquisition of all of the
outstanding stock of The Delta Rubber Company, a Connecticut
corporation Delta. Delta provides high quality engineered bearing
seals and other precision-molded rubber products to original equipment
manufacturers. NN plans to continue the operation of the Delta business,
which consists of one manufacturing facility located in Danielson,
Connecticut.
NN acquired Delta by purchasing the outstanding stock from Delta
shareholders for $22,500 in cash, of which $500 is to be held in escrow
for one year from the date of closing. The purchase price was based on
Delta' existing base, financial performance and the expectation that
Delta products and customers will compliment the Company existing
businesses.
