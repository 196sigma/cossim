Millennium Pharmaceuticals,Inc. Report of Independent Auditors    
Board
of Directors and Stockholders
Millennium Pharmaceuticals,Inc. 
We
have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Millennium Pharmaceuticals,Inc. as of December31, 2003 and 2002, and the related consolidated statements
of operations, stockholders' equity, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December31, 2003. These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company
management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audits. 
We
conducted our audits in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in the United States. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable
assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial
statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe
that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. 
In
our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated financial position of Millennium
Pharmaceuticals,Inc. at December31, 2003 and 2002, and the consolidated results of its operations, stockholders' equity and cash flows for each of
the three years in the period ended December31, 2003, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. As
discussed in Note2 to the consolidated financial statements, in 2002, the Company adopted Financial Accounting Standards Board Statement of Financial Accounting Standards

56   
Millennium Pharmaceuticals,Inc.      Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements December31, 2003     1] The Company 
Millennium Pharmaceuticals,Inc. Millennium or the Company is a leading biopharmaceutical company focused on developing and commercializing
breakthrough products in the disease areas of cancer, cardiovascular disease and inflammatory disease. The Company currently has a cancer product and a cardiovascular disease product on the market.
The Company also has other potential products in various stages of preclinical and clinical development in all three of its therapeutic disease areas of focus. Millennium
strategy is to develop multiple products in several disease areas through clinical trials and regulatory approvals and to be involved in the marketing and sale of many of
these products. The Company plans to develop and commercialize many of its products on its own, but will seek development and commercial partners when it believes that this will maximize product
value. 2]Summary of Significant Accounting Policies  Basis of Presentation 
The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Millennium and its majority-owned subsidiaries. All significant intercompany accounts and
transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. Investment in the Company unconsolidated joint venture in 2001 is accounted for using the equity method see Note5. 
The
preparation of financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect
the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the
reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. 
Reclassifications 
In connection with the launch of VELCADE bortezomib for Injection in May2003 and the recognition of related costs of sales, the Company
reclassified certain INTEGRILIN eptifibatide Injection related manufacturing expenses to cost of goods sold so that cost of goods sold now includes manufacturing-related expenses
associated with the sales of INTEGRILIN and VELCADE. These reclassified manufacturing-related expenses were previously included in cost of co-promotion revenue and certain INTEGRILIN
related advertising and promotional expenses that were previously included in cost of co-promotion revenue have been reclassified to selling, general and administrative expenses.
Advertising and promotional expenses are expensed as incurred. During the years ended December31, 2003 and 2002, advertising and promotional expenses were $370million and
$159million, respectively. The Company did not incur any advertising and promotional expenses during the year ended December31, 2001. 
Prior
period amounts have been adjusted to conform to the current year presentation. There was no impact on net loss in any period. Cash Equivalents and Marketable Securities 
Cash equivalents consist principally of money market funds and corporate bonds with maturities of three months or less at the date of purchase. Marketable
securities consist primarily of investment-grade corporate bonds, asset-backed debt securities and U.S. government agency debt securities. 
57  Management
determines the appropriate classification of marketable securities at the time of purchase and reevaluates such designation at each balance sheet date. Marketable securities
at December31, 2003 and December31, 2002 are classified as available-for-sale. Available-for-sale securities are carried at fair
value, with the unrealized gains and losses reported in a separate component of stockholders' equity. The cost of debt securities in this category is adjusted for amortization of premiums and
accretion of discounts to maturity. Such amortization and accretion are included in investment income. Realized gains and losses and declines in value judged to be
other-than-temporary on available-for-sale securities and other investments are included in investment income. The cost of securities sold is based on
the specific identification method. Interest and dividends on securities classified as available-for-sale are included in investment income. During
the years ended December31, 2003 and 2002, the Company recorded realized gains on marketable securities of $63million and $534million, respectively, and
realized losses on marketable securities and other investments of $33million and $213million, respectively. 
Concentrations of Credit Risk 
Cash and cash equivalents are primarily maintained with two major financial institutions in the United States. Deposits with banks may exceed the amount of
insurance provided on such deposits. Generally, these deposits may be redeemed upon demand and, therefore, bear minimal risk. Financial instruments that potentially subject the Company to
concentrations of credit risk consist principally of marketable securities. Marketable securities consist of investment-grade corporate bonds, asset-backed and U.S. government agency securities. The
Company investment policy, approved by the Board of Directors, limits the amount the Company may invest in any one type of investment, thereby reducing credit risk concentrations. 
Segment Information 
Statement of Financial Accounting Standards SFAS No131, Disclosures about Segments of an Enterprise and Related Information SFAS No131,
establishes standards for the way that public business enterprises report information about operating segments in their financial statements. SFAS No131 also establishes standards for related
disclosures about products and services, geographic areas, and major customers. 
The
Company operates in one business segment, which focuses on the development and commercialization of proprietary therapeutic products. All of the Company product sales are currently
related to sales of VELCADE bortezomib for Injection. All of the Company co-promotion revenue is currently related to sales of INTEGRILIN eptifibatide
Injection. 
Revenues
from Ortho Biotech Products, L.P. Ortho Biotech accounted for approximately 11% of consolidated revenues for the year ended December31, 2003. Revenues from Bayer, AG
Bayer accounted for approximately 14%, 22%, and 39% of consolidated revenues for the years ended December31, 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively. Revenues from Aventis
Pharmaceuticals,Inc. Aventis accounted for approximately 15%, 12% and 16% of consolidated revenues for the years ended December31, 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively. Revenues from
Monsanto Company Monsanto accounted for approximately 12% and 18% of consolidated revenues for the years ended December31, 2002 and 2001, respectively. There were no other significant
customers in 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively. 
58  Information Concerning Market and Source of Supply Concentration 
Millennium and Schering-PloughLtd. and Schering Corporation collectively SGP co-promote INTEGRILIN eptifibatide Injection
in the United States and share any profits and losses. INTEGRILIN has received regulatory approval in the European Union and a number of other countries for various indications. The Company has
exclusively licensed to SGP rights to market INTEGRILIN outside of the United States, and SGP pays the Company royalties based on these sales of INTEGRILIN. The Company has long-term
supply arrangements with two suppliers for the bulk product and with another two suppliers, one of which is SGP, for the filling and final packaging of INTEGRILIN. 
Fair Value of Financial Instruments 
The carrying amounts reported in the Company balance sheets for other current assets and long-term debt approximate their fair value. The fair
values of the Company long-term debt are estimated using discounted cash flow analyses based on the Company current incremental borrowing rates for similar types of borrowing
arrangements. 
Inventory 
Inventories are stated at the lower of cost first in, first out or market. Inventories are reviewed periodically for slow-moving or obsolete status
based on sales activity, both projected and historical. 
Inventory
consists of the following in thousands: December 31, 2003
December 31, 2002 Raw materials 77,485 65,039 Work in process 3,382 10,534 Finished goods 29,346 29,773 110,213 105,346 Property and Equipment 
Property and equipment are stated at cost. Equipment consists principally of assets held under capitalized leases and are stated at the present value of future
minimum lease obligations. Application development costs incurred for computer software developed or obtained for internal use are capitalized in accordance with Statement of Position SOP
No98-1, Accounting for the Costs of Computer Software Developed for Internal Use. Leasehold improvements are stated at cost and are amortized over the shorter of the remaining
life of the building lease or useful life. Depreciation is recorded on the straight-line method over the shorter of the estimated useful life of the asset or the term of the lease as
follows: Equipment
3 to 4 years Capitalized software
3 to 5 years Leasehold improvements
4 to 27 years 59 
Goodwill and Intangible Assets 
Intangible assets consist of specifically identified intangible assets. Goodwill is the excess of any purchase price over the estimated fair market value of net
tangible assets acquired not allocated to specific intangible assets. 
Intangible

expense was approximately $389million, $349million and $646million in 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively. In addition, in connection with its
restructuring initiative discussed in Note3, the Company recognized an impairment charge of approximately $113million for technology it no longer intends to pursue. 
The
Company expects to incur amortization expense of approximately $335million for each of the next five years. 
As
required by SFAS No142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets are not amortized but are reviewed annually for impairment, or
more frequently if impairment indicators arise. Separable intangible assets that are not deemed to have an indefinite life are amortized over their useful lives and reviewed for impairment when events
or changes in circumstances suggest that the assets may not be recoverable. The Company tests for goodwill impairment annually, on October1 and whenever events or changes in circumstances
suggest that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. 
On
October1, 2003, the Company performed its annual goodwill impairment test and determined that no impairment existed on that date. The Company continually monitors business and
market conditions to assess whether an impairment indicator exists. If the Company were to determine that an 
60  impairment
indicator exists, it would be required to perform an impairment test which might result in a material impairment charge to the statement of operations. 
The
Company adopted SFAS No142 effective January1, 2002 and reclassified amounts to goodwill which were previously allocated to assembled workforce. Upon adoption, the
Company ceased the amortization of goodwill. 
The
following unaudited pro forma adjusted net losses have been prepared as if SFAS No142 had been applied retroactively: Year Ended December 31 2003

The Company recognizes revenue from the sale of its products, co-promotion collaboration and strategic alliances. The Company revenue arrangements
with multiple elements are divided into separate units of accounting if certain criteria are met, including whether the delivered element has stand-alone value to the customer and whether there is
objective and reliable evidence of the fair value of the undelivered items. The consideration received is allocated among the separate units based on their respective fair values, and the applicable
revenue recognition criteria are applied to each of the separate units. Advance payments received in excess of amounts earned are classified as deferred revenue until earned.  Net product sales  The Company records product sales of VELCADE bortezomib for Injection when delivery has occurred and title passes to the customer, collection is
reasonably assured and the Company has no further obligations. Allowances are recorded as a reduction to product sales for estimated returns and discounts at the time of sale. Costs incurred by the
Company for shipping and handling are recorded in cost of goods sold. 
61  Co-promotion revenue  Co-promotion revenue includes the Company share of profits from the sale of INTEGRILIN eptifibatide Injection in
co-promotion territories by SGP. Also included in co-promotion revenue are reimbursements from SGP of the Company manufacturing-related costs, advertising and promotional
expenses associated with the sale
of INTEGRILIN within co-promotion territories and royalties from SGP on sales of INTEGRILIN outside of the co-promotion territory. The Company recognizes revenue when SGP ships
INTEGRILIN to wholesalers and records it net of allowances, if any. The Company defers certain manufacturing-related expenses until the time SGP ships related product to its customers inside and
outside of co-promotion territories. Deferred revenue also includes cash advances from SGP to the Company for the Company prepayments to its manufacturers of INTEGRILIN.  Revenue under strategic alliances  The Company recognizes revenue from nonrefundable license payments, milestone payments and reimbursement of development costs. Nonrefundable upfront fees for
which no further performance obligations exist are recognized as revenue on the earlier of when payments are received or collection is assured. 
Nonrefundable
upfront licensing fees and certain guaranteed, time-based payments that require continuing involvement in the form of development, manufacturing or other
commercialization efforts by the Company are recognized as revenue: ratably
over the development period if development risk is significant,
ratably
over the manufacturing period or estimated product useful life if development risk has been substantially eliminated, or
based
upon the level of research services performed during the period of the research contract. Milestone
payments are recognized as revenue when the performance obligation, as defined in the contract, are achieved. Performance obligations typically consist of significant
milestones in the development life cycle of the related technology, such as initiation of clinical trials, filing for approval with regulatory agencies and approvals by regulatory agencies. 
Reimbursements
of development costs are recognized as revenue as the related costs are incurred. 
Income Taxes 
The liability method is used to account for income taxes. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on differences between financial reporting and
income tax basis of assets and liabilities, as well as net operating loss carryforwards, and are measured using the enacted tax rates and laws that will be in effect when the differences reverse.
Deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance to reflect the uncertainty associated with their ultimate realization. 
Net Loss Per Common Share 
Basic net loss per common share is computed using the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the period. Diluted net loss per common share is
typically computed using the weighted average number of common and dilutive common equivalent shares from stock options, 
62  warrants
and convertible debt using the treasury stock method. However, for all periods presented, diluted net loss per share is the same as basic net loss per share as the inclusion of weighted
average shares of common stock issuable upon the exercise of stock options, warrants and convertible debt would be antidilutive. Foreign Currency Translation 
The financial statements of the Company foreign subsidiary are measured using the local currency as the functional currency, with results of operations and cash
flows translated at average exchange rates during the period, and assets and liabilities translated at end of period exchange rates. Foreign currency transaction gains and losses are included in the
results of operations and are not material to the Company consolidated financial statements. Translation adjustments are excluded from the determination of net loss and are accumulated in a separate
component of accumulated other comprehensive income loss in stockholders' equity. Comprehensive Loss 
Comprehensive loss is comprised of net loss, unrealized gains and losses on marketable securities and cumulative foreign currency translation adjustments.
Accumulated other comprehensive income as of December31, 2003 and 2002 included $49million and $24million, respectively of unrealized gains on marketable securities and
$003 million and $17million, respectively, of cumulative foreign currency translation adjustments. Comprehensive loss is reflected in the consolidated statements of stockholders' equity. Stock-Based Compensation 
The Company follows the intrinsic value method under Accounting Principles Board Opinion No25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees APB 25 and
related interpretations, in accounting for its stock-based compensation plans, rather than the alternative fair value accounting method provided for under SFAS No123, Accounting for
Stock-Based Compensation SFAS No123. Under APB 25, when the exercise price of options granted equals the market price of the underlying stock on the date of grant, no compensation
expense is recognized. In accordance with Emerging Issues Task Force EITF 96-18, the Company records compensation expense equal to the fair value of options granted to

Accounting Pronouncements 
In November2002, the EITF issued EITF 00-21, Revenue Arrangements with Multiple Deliverables, EITF 00-21 which addressed
certain aspects of the accounting for arrangements that involve the delivery or performance of multiple products, services and/or rights to use assets. Under EITF 00-21, revenue
arrangements with multiple deliverables should be divided into separate accounting units if the deliverables meet certain criteria, including whether the fair value of the delivered items can be
determined and whether there is evidence of fair value of the undelivered items. In addition, the consideration should be allocated among the separate units of accounting based on their fair values,
and the applicable revenue recognition criteria should be considered separately for each of the separate units of accounting. EITF 00-21 is effective for revenue arrangements entered into
after June30, 2003. The Company has not entered into any such arrangements since the effective date of EITF 00-21. 
64  In
January2003, the FASB issued Interpretation No46, Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities, an Interpretation of Accounting Research Bulletin No51 FIN
46 and in December 2003 issued a revised FIN 46 FIN 46R which addressed the period of adoption of FIN 46 for entities created before January31, 2003. FIN 46 provides a new consolidation
model which determines control and consolidation based on potential variability in gains and losses. The provisions of FIN 46 are effective for enterprises with variable interests in variable interest
entities created after January31, 2003. For its interests in variable interest entities created before February1, 2003, the Company must adopt the provisions of FIN 46 in the first
quarter of fiscal 2004 and does not expect the adoption to have a material impact on its financial position or results of operations. 
In
May2003, the FASB issued SFAS No150, Accounting for Certain Financial Instruments with Characteristics of both Liabilities and Equity SFAS No150. SFAS
No150 establishes standards for classifying and measuring as liabilities certain financial instruments that embody obligations of the issuer and have characteristics of both liabilities and
equity. SFAS No150 is effective for all financial instruments created or modified after May31, 2003, and otherwise effective at the beginning of the first interim period beginning
after June15, 2003. The adoption of SFAS No150 did not have a material impact on the financial position or results of operations of the Company. 3]Restructuring 
In December2002, the Company announced the first in a series of steps to realign the Company resources to become a commercially-focused
biopharmaceutical company. The Company discontinued certain discovery research efforts, reduced headcount in its discovery group and began reallocating certain resources to enhance its commercial
capabilities. As of December1, 2002, the Company adopted SFAS No146, Accounting for Costs Associated with Exit or Disposal Activities SFAS No146. SFAS No146
requires that a liability for a cost associated with an exit or disposal activity be recognized and measured initially at its fair value in the period in which the liability is incurred, except for
one-time termination benefits that meet certain requirements. These actions resulted in the recognition of restructuring charges in the fourth quarter of 2002 and first quarter of 2003. 
In
June2003, the Company announced a broad, accelerated restructuring plan to focus the Company resources on product development and commercialization. The plan includes
consolidation of research and development facilities, overall headcount reduction to approximately 1,700 employees by the end of 2004 and streamlining of the number of discovery and development
projects. Certain of these actions resulted in the recognition of restructuring charges in the second, third and fourth quarters of 2003, including the termination of approximately 700 employees and
the vacating of several of the Company facilities. 
65  
These
costs are included in restructuring charges in the statements of operations and accrued expenses and restructuring, net of current portion on the balance sheet at
December31, 2003. The following table displays the restructuring activity and liability balance included in accrued expenses in thousands: Balance at

of termination benefits relate to severance packages, out-placement services and career counseling for employees affected by the restructuring. Charges related to
facilities include estimated remaining rental obligations, net of estimated sublease income, for facilities that the Company no longer occupies. Included in other facilities charges is the
write-off deferred rent recorded in accordance with SFAS No13, Accounting for Leases. The Company decisions to vacate certain facilities and abandon the related leasehold
improvements as well as terminate certain research programs were deemed to be impairment indicators under SFAS No144, Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived
Assets. As a result of performing the impairment evaluations, asset impairment charges were recorded to adjust the carrying value of the related long-lived assets to their net realizable
values. The fair values of the assets were estimated based upon anticipated future cash flows, discounted at a rate commensurate with the risk involved. 
The
projected payments of the remaining balances of the restructuring charges for the year ended December31, 2003 are approximately $366million in 2004 and
$466million thereafter through 2022. During
2004, the Company expects to recognize an additional $600million in termination benefits and lease obligations as a result of the restructuring plan, the majority of
which will be paid out in cash. 
66  4]COR Acquisition 
On February12, 2002, the Company acquired COR for an aggregate purchase price of $18billion primarily consisting of 551million shares of
Millennium common stock pursuant to the merger agreement between the Company and COR. Through the merger, the Company added approximately 300 new employees and a leased facility in South San
Francisco, California and acquired INTEGRILIN eptifibatide Injection for the treatment of acute coronary syndromes and substantial research capabilities in the areas of cardiovascular
disease and oncology. The purchase price calculation was based on COR outstanding common stock at February12, 2002 using the conversion ratio of 09873 of a share of Millennium common stock
for each share of outstanding COR common stock. In addition, options to purchase approximately 62million shares of COR common stock with a weighted average exercise price of $1290 were
assumed by Millennium pursuant to the merger agreement and converted into options to purchase approximately 61million shares of Millennium common stock. 
The
total cost of the merger was determined as follows in thousands, except per share: Fair value of Millennium shares calculated using $3057 per share average fair value for the three days prior to and after announcement of the merger 1,685,334 Value of COR options assumed net of intrinsic value of unvested options 127,714 Millennium transaction costs, consisting primarily of financial advisory, legal and accounting fees 20,281 1,833,329 The
fair value of options assumed was determined using the Black-Scholes method assuming expected lives ranging from one to five years, a risk-free interest rate of 435 volatility of 8688% and no expected dividends. In accordance with FASB Interpretation No44, or FIN 44, Accounting for Certain Transactions Involving Stock Compensationan
Interpretation of APB 25, a portion of the intrinsic value of unvested options of COR has been allocated to deferred stock compensation. Deferred stock compensation is amortized on a
straight-line basis over the estimated remaining vesting period of the related options, or approximately five years. The
transaction was recorded as a purchase for accounting purposes and the Company consolidated financial statements include COR operating results from the date of the acquisition.
The purchase price was allocated to the assets purchased and the liabilities assumed based upon their respective fair values, with the excess of the purchase price over the estimated fair value of net
tangible assets allocated to specific intangible assets and goodwill as follows in thousands: Net tangible assets acquired 37,585 In-process research and development 242,000 Identifiable intangible assets primarily developed technology13 year useful life and trademarkindefinite life 494,000 Goodwill 1,059,744 1,833,329 67 
The
Company recorded a one-time, noncash charge to operations in 2002 of $2420million for acquired in-process research and development. The valuation of
acquired in-process research and development represents the estimated fair value related to incomplete projects that, at the time of the acquisition, had no alternative future use and for
which technological feasibility had not been established. During 2003, the Company discontinued four of the five programs as part of its restructuring initiatives. As of December31, 2003, the
Company expects to incur an additional $450million to $700million of research and development expenses for this project, which the Company expects to complete by 2015. 
The
income approach was used to establish the fair values of developed technology, trademark and acquired in-process research and development. This approach establishes the
fair value of an asset by estimating the after-tax cash flows attributable to the asset over its useful life and then discounting these after-tax cash flows back to a present
value. The discounting process uses a rate of return commensurate with the time value of money and investment risk factors. 5]Revenue and Strategic Alliances 
Historically, the Company has formed strategic alliances with major pharmaceutical companies where its discovery expertise and technology platform are applicable.
These agreements include alliances based on the transfer of technology platforms, alliances which combine technology transfer with a focus on a specific disease or therapeutic approach, and
disease-focused programs under which the Company conducts research funded by its partners. The Company disease-based alliances and alliances which combine technology transfer with a disease focus
are generally structured as research collaborations. Under these arrangements, the Company performs research in a specific disease area aimed at discoveries leading to novel pharmaceutical small
molecule products. These alliances generally provide research funding over an initial period, with renewal provisions, varying by agreement. 
Under
these agreements, the Company partners may make up-front payments, additional payments upon the achievement of specific research and product development milestones,
ongoing research funding and/or pay royalties to or in some cases share profits with the Company based upon any product sales resulting from the collaboration. In certain alliances, collaborators may
make equity investments in the Company common stock.  Product Alliances  On June30, 2003, the Company entered into an agreement with Ortho Biotech, a wholly owned subsidiary of Johnson Johnson, to collaborate on the
commercialization and continued clinical development of VELCADE bortezomib for Injection. Under the terms of the agreement, the Company retains all commercialization rights to and
profits from VELCADE in the U.S. Subject to obtaining regulatory approvals of VELCADE outside of the U.S., Ortho Biotech and its affiliate, Janssen-Cilag, will commercialize VELCADE outside of the
U.S. The Company is entitled to royalties from Ortho Biotech and its affiliate Janssen-Cilag on sales, if any, of VELCADE outside of the U.S. The Company also retains an option to
co-promote VELCADE at a future date in certain European countries. 
The
Company and Ortho Biotech and its research affiliate, Johnson Johnson Pharmaceutical Research Development, L.L.C., will jointly engage in an extensive global
program for further clinical 
68  development
of VELCADE bortezomib for Injection with the purpose of maximizing the clinical and commercial potential of VELCADE. This program will investigate the potential of VELCADE
to treat multiple forms of solid and hematological cancers, including continued clinical development of VELCADE for multiple myeloma. Ortho Biotech is responsible for 40% of the joint development
costs through 2005 and for 45% of such costs thereafter. 
In
connection with the agreement, the Company received a nonrefundable payment from Ortho Biotech of $150million in July2003. In addition, the Company may receive
payments for achieving clinical development milestones, for achieving regulatory milestones outside of the United States and for achieving agreed-upon sales levels of VELCADE. The Company
may also receive additional payments for achieving specified clinical and regulatory approval milestones outside of the United States for additional solid and hematological cancers and for achieving
sales milestones outside of the United States. During the year ended December31, 2003, the Company recognized approximately $330million of milestone payments as revenue under this
alliance. 
Through
its merger with LeukoSite,Inc. LeukoSite in 1999, the Company became a party to a joint venture agreement with ILEX Products,Inc. ILEX to form Millennium
and ILEX Partners, L.P. MI for the purpose of developing and commercializing the CAMPATH for use in the treatment of chronic lymphocytic leukemia. The Company accounted for its investment in the
joint venture under the equity method of accounting. During the year ended December31, 2001, the Company recognized $33million of revenue from research and development activities
performed on behalf of and to be reimbursed by MI. On December31, 2001, ILEX Oncology acquired the Company equity interest in MI which owns the CAMPATH product in exchange for
$200million plus additional consideration contingent upon future sales of CAMPATH. The Company earned $400million of such consideration in each of 2003 and 2002. The Company is
entitled to receive additional payments of $400million in 2004 if sales of CAMPATH in the United States meet specified thresholds. In addition, the Company may be entitled to additional
payments from ILEX Oncology based on future U.S. sales of CAMPATH.  Research and Discovery Alliances  The Company has entered into research, development, technology-transfer and commercialization arrangements with major pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies
relating to a broad range of therapeutic and predictive medicine products and services. These alliances provide Millennium with the opportunity to receive various combinations of equity investments,
license fees and research funding, and may provide certain additional payments contingent upon the achievement of research and
regulatory milestones and royalties and/or share profits if the Company collaborations are successful in developing and commercializing products. On
March9, 2001, the Company entered into a strategic alliance with Abbott Laboratories Abbott. This alliance was for a five-year term, and is a research and
development collaboration in the area of metabolic diseases. The Company and Abbott agreed to share the cost of developing, manufacturing and marketing products on a worldwide basis. This arrangement
with Abbott also included a technology exchange and development agreement and a $2500million equity investment agreement. As part of this $2500million equity investment agreement,
Abbott made investments in 2002 and 2001 totaling $2214million. Abbott made the remaining $286million investment in March2003. 
69  On
August8, 2003, the Company and Abbott agreed to terminate their alliance covering joint discovery, development and commercialization of certain metabolic disease products in
connection with the Company June2003 restructuring plan. Included in restructuring charges for the three months ended September30, 2003 are restructuring charges specifically related
to the discontinuation of metabolic research and development, which include termination benefits and costs associated with the Abbott separation agreement. On
June22, 2000, the Company entered into an alliance with Aventis, the pharmaceutical company of Aventis S.A., covering the joint development and commercialization of drugs for
the treatment of inflammatory diseases; joint development of new drug discovery technologies; transfer of key elements of the Company technology platform to Aventis to enhance its existing
capabilities; and purchase of an equity interest in the Company by Aventis. The companies have agreed to share the responsibility for and cost of developing, marketing and manufacturing products
arising from the alliance, as well as profits in North America. Outside of North America, Aventis is responsible for developing and marketing products arising from the alliance, with a royalty
obligation to the Company. Under a Technology Transfer Agreement, the Company agreed to provide Aventis with rights to its drug discovery technologies in exchange for payments between
$1600million and $2000million over a three to five-year period. Aventis has purchased $2500million of the Company common stock as agreed under an Investment
Agreement with the Company. 
On
April22, 2003, Aventis exercised its option to terminate the Technology Transfer Agreement between the Company and Aventis effective on the third anniversary of the Agreement,
July21, 2003. Pursuant to the terms of the Agreement, upon providing this notice to the Company, Aventis paid the Company $400million in consideration for future use of certain
Millennium technology transferred to Aventis, which is included in revenue under strategic alliances for the year ended December31, 2003. On
October31, 2003, the research phase of the Company five year strategic alliance with Bayer concluded. On October10, 2003, Bayer and Millennium amended the agreement
to provide both parties access to certain identified drug targets for a period of seven years. If Bayer successfully develops and commercializes any of these targets discovered in the alliance, Bayer
may make success payments and royalties to Millennium on the sale of products generated from the alliance. 
Revenues
recognized under the research phase of the Bayer alliance were approximately $455million, $601million and $806million for the years ended
December31, 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively. The Company recognized the research funding portion of the alliance on a percentage-of-completion basis. The
percentage-of-completion was determined at each measurement date based upon the actual full-time equivalents to date as compared to management estimate of the
total full-time equivalents needed to complete the deliverables required by the alliance. In September2001, the Company revised the estimate of total full-time
equivalents required to complete the project downward as a result of productivity improvements made at the Company and changes to the program requirements made by Bayer. During each subsequent
reporting period, the Company continued to monitor the full-time equivalent estimate necessary to complete the deliverables and compared the estimate to the actual effort put forth. No
further adjustments were necessary and the accounting estimates used approximated actual efforts from September2001 to the end of the research phase of the agreement, October31, 2003.

Lease Commitments 
The Company conducts the majority of its operations in leased facilities with a combination of leased and owned equipment. At December31, 2003 and 2002,
respectively, the Company has capitalized leased equipment totaling $894million and $1048million, with related accumulated amortization of $667million and
$705million. Such amounts are included in the appropriate categories of property and equipment in Note7. The
Company leases certain of its laboratory and office space under operating lease agreements with various terms and renewal options, including major facilities with lease expirations
ranging from 2004 through 2022. In addition to minimum lease commitments, these lease agreements require the Company to pay its pro rata share of property taxes and building operating expenses. 
On
August4, 2000, the Company entered into lease agreements, relating to two buildings for laboratory and office space in Cambridge, Massachusetts. The rent obligation for the
first of these buildings began in July2002 and the rent obligation on the second building began in July2003. The Company was responsible for a portion of the construction costs for
both buildings and was deemed to 
72  be
the owner during the construction period of each building under EITF 97-10, The Effect of Lessee Involvement in Asset Construction. In July2002 and July2003, upon
completion of the construction period of the buildings, respectively, the Company recorded the leases as capital leases. At
December31, 2003, the Company has pledged $163million of marketable securities and cash equivalents, included in restricted cash, as collateral for letters of credit
for certain leased facilities. 
At
December31, 2003, future minimum commitments under leases with noncancelable terms, including leases for facilities that the Company no longer occupies as part of its

External Collaborations 
The Company funds research efforts of its strategic alliance and various academic collaborators in connection with its research and development programs. Total
future fixed commitments under these agreements approximate $47million in 2004 and $29million in 2005. The
Company has also made strategic commitments to purchase debt and/or equity securities from certain of its partners. The Company may also owe its partners milestone payments and
royalties and the Company has committed to fund development costs incurred by some of its partners. Total future fixed purchases of debt and/or equity commitments under these agreements approximate
$197million as of December31, 2003.
73  10]Convertible Debt 
The Company had the following convertible notes outstanding at December31, 2003: 163million
of principal of 50% convertible subordinated notes due March1, 2007, that are convertible into Millennium common stock at any time prior to
maturity at a price equal to $3421 per share the 50% notes 59million
of principal of 45% convertible senior notes due June15, 2006, that are convertible into Millennium common stock at any time prior to maturity
at a price equal to $4061 per share the 45% notes; and
$833million
of principal of 55% convertible subordinated notes due January15, 2007, that are convertible into Millennium common stock at any time prior to
maturity at a price equal to $4207 per share the 55% notes. Under
the terms of these notes, the Company is required to make semi-annual interest payments on the outstanding principal balance of the 50% notes on March1 and
September1 of each year, of the 45% notes on June15 and December15 of each year and of the 55% notes on January15 and July15 of each year. All required
interest payments to date have been made. 
In
April2002, the Company amended the 45% notes and 50% notes to add put options permitting noteholders to require the Company on April29, 2003, to repurchase the 45%
notes for cash at a price of $1,095 per $1,000 of principal amount and the 50% notes for cash at a price of $1,085 per $1,000 of principal amount, resulting in a maximum aggregate payment obligation
of $6540million. These put options on the notes were derivative instruments. SFAS No133, Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities and as such we recorded on the
balance sheet at fair value and recognized as a debt financing charge in the 2002 statement of operations. The fair value of the derivative was $540million at December31, 2002. On
April29, 2003, the Company completed the repurchase of $5778million of aggregate principal amount of the outstanding 45% notes and 50% notes for an aggregate
payment of approximately $6371million, including principal, accrued interest and put premium. Approximately $221million of aggregate principal amount of these notes were not tendered
in the offer and remain outstanding as of December31, 2003. As a result of the repurchase, the Company recorded a charge in 2003 of approximately $105million which represents the
write-off of approximately $124million of unamortized original debt issuance costs associated with the 45% notes and 50% notes, offset by $19million relating to the
expired put premium on the untendered notes. 11]Stockholders' Equity 
Preferred Stock 
The Company has 5,000,000 authorized shares of preferred stock, $0001 par value, issuable in one or more series, each of such series to have such rights and
preferences, including voting rights, dividend rights, conversion rights, redemption privileges and liquidation preferences, as shall be determined by the Board of Directors. Common Stock 
The Company had 500,000,000 authorized shares of common stock, $0001 par value, and 302,290,853 shares issued and outstanding at December31, 2003. 
74  Common Stock Warrants  At December31, 2003, the Company has outstanding exercisable warrants to purchase 529,154 shares of Common Stock with a weighted-average exercise price of
$781 per share, which expire through 2007. 
Stock Option Plans 
In December2002, the Company Board of Directors reduced the number of shares authorized for issuance under certain of the Company older plans and
acquired plans so that the Company cannot issue new options under those plans. Additionally, the Board of Directors amended certain of the Company option plans to provide for full vesting of options
issued under the plans to optionholders who terminate their employment for good reason or are terminated without cause within the period one month before and one year after a change of control. 
The
Company 1993 Incentive Stock Plan the 1993 Plan allowed for the granting of incentive and nonstatutory options to purchase up to 21,600,000 shares of common stock. At
December31, 2003, a total of 461,554 shares of common stock have been reserved for the exercise of options outstanding under the 1993 Plan. No options are available for future grant under the
1993 Plan.

The difference between the Company expected tax provision benefit, as computed by applying the U.S. federal corporate tax rate of 35% to loss before
minority interest and provision for income taxes, and actual tax is reconciled in the following chart in thousands: 2003
2002
2001 Loss before minority interest and provision for income taxes 483,687 590,193 191,850 Expected tax benefit at 35 169,290 206,568 67,148 Write off of purchased research and development 84,700 Amortization of goodwill 17,503 Change in valuation allowance for deferred tax assets allocated to tax expense 164,904 119,602 49,486 Other permanent items 4,386 2,266 159 Income tax provision At
December31, 2003, the Company has unused net operating loss carryforwards of approximately $12billion available to reduce federal taxable income expiring in 2004
through 2023 and $10billion available to reduce state taxable income expiring in 2004 through 2008. The Company also has federal and net state research tax credits of approximately
$849million available to offset federal and state income taxes, both of which expire beginning in 2004. Due to the degree of uncertainty related to the 
77  ultimate
use of the loss carryforwards and tax credits, the Company has fully reserved these tax benefits. No income tax payments were made in 2003, 2002 and 2001. 
Deferred
income taxes reflect the net tax effects of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used
for income tax purposes. Significant components of the Company deferred tax assets as of December31 are as follows in thousands: 2003
2002
2001 Net operating loss carryforwards 479,076 443,776 334,251 Research and development tax credit carryforwards 84,912 78,823 50,651 Capitalized research costs 275,303 185,521 17,507 Property and other intangible assets 67,435 31,340 22,719 Deferred revenue 40,930 53,677 62,005 Accrued restructuring 31,274 1,117 Other 13,810 19,824 4,722 Total deferred tax assets 992,740 814,078 491,855 Valuation allowance 819,003 629,041 479,636 Total deferred tax assets 173,737 185,037 12,219 Deferred tax liability Intangible assets 172,504 185,888 Unrealized gain loss on marketable securities 1,233 851 12,219 Net deferred tax asset The
valuation allowance increased by $1900million during 2003 due primarily to net operating loss carryforwards from operations and the exercise of stock options as well as
differences in the timing of
capitalized research costs and restructuring costs for financial accounting and tax purposes. The valuation allowance increased by $1494million during 2002 due primarily to the increase in
research and development tax credits, net operating loss carryforwards from operations and differences in the timing of capitalized research costs for financial accounting and tax purposes. The
deferred tax assets acquired from COR, LeukoSite and ChemGenics are subject to review and possible adjustments by the Internal Revenue Service and may be limited due to the change in ownership
provisions of the Internal Revenue Code. 
Any
subsequently recognized tax benefits relating to the valuation allowance for deferred tax assets as of December31, 2003 would be allocated as follows in thousands: Reported in the statement of operations 549,952 Reported as a decrease to goodwill 20,316 Reported in additional paid-in capital 248,735 819,003 78  13]Related Party Transaction 
In November2003, the Company sold certain assets, including intellectual property to Portola Pharmaceuticals,Inc. Portola, a company founded
and owned in part by a member of Millennium board of directors. In exchange for these assets, the Company received Portola SeriesA preferred convertible stock, representing less than a 5%
ownership in Portola. The investment in Portola is accounted for using the cost method and is included in other long term assets on the balance sheet at December31, 2003. In addition,
commencing in June2004, Portola will sublease certain research facilities of the Company in South San Francisco, CA. The Company believes these lease terms are comparable to those that would
be available from unaffiliated third parties. 14]Quarterly Financial Information unaudited  First Quarter
