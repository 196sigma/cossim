NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
CORPORATE RESTRUCTURING
On January 1, 1998 Consolidated Edison Company of New York, Inc. Con Edison,
the regulated utility, became a subsidiary of its new parent holding company,
Consolidated Edison, Inc. CEI, when the outstanding shares of common stock 250 par value, of Con Edison were exchanged on a share-for-share basis for
shares of common stock, $10 par value, of CEI. Con Edison debt securities and
preferred stock remained securities of Con Edison.
OPERATIONS
CEI, through its subsidiaries, provides a wide range of energy-related products
and services to its customers. The principal subsidiaries, in addition to Con
Edison, are Con Edison Solutions and Con Edison Development. Con Edison supplies
electric service in all of New York City except part of Queens and most of
Westchester County, a service area with a population of more than eight million.
It also supplies gas in Manhattan, The Bronx and parts of Queens and
Westchester, and steam in part of Manhattan. Con Edison Solutions is a
full-service energy company offering wholesale and retail electricity and
natural gas sales, as well as energy-related products and services, primarily in
the Northeast. Con Edison Development invests in energy infrastructure projects
and markets technical services worldwide.
NOTE A SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
PRINCIPLES OF CONSOLIDATION The accompanying consolidated financial statements
include the accounts of Con Edison and its wholly-owned subsidiaries and,
therefore, also represent the consolidated financial statements of CEI and its
wholly-owned subsidiaries. Intercompany transactions have been eliminated.
PSC SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT The New York State Public Service Commission PSC, by
order issued and effective May 20, 1996 in its Competitive Opportunities
proceeding, endorsed a fundamental restructuring of the electric utility
industry in New York State, based on competition in the generation and energy
services sectors of the industry. The PSC, by order issued and effective
September 23, 1997, approved a settlement agreement between Con Edison, the PSC
staff and certain other parties the Settlement Agreement.
The Settlement Agreement provides for a transition to a competitive electric
market through the development of a retail access plan, a rate plan for the
period ending March 31, 2002 the Transition, a reasonable opportunity for
recovery of strandable costs and the divestiture by Con Edison to unaffiliated
third parties of at least 50 percent of its New York City fossil-fueled electric
generating capacity.
The retail access plan will eventually permit all of Con Edison electric
customers to buy electricity from other suppliers. The delivery of electricity
to customers will continue to be through Con Edison transmission and
distribution systems. Con Edison electric fossil-fueled generating capacity
not divested to third parties will be transferred by December 31, 2002 to an
unregulated subsidiary of CEI. Con Edison contracts with non-utility                    -52 generators NUGs, absent renegotiation of these contracts,  will remain
contractual obligations of Con Edison, which could resell electricity provided
under the contracts in the competitive energy supply market. The Settlement
Agreement does not contemplate the divestiture or transfer of Con Edison
Indian Point 2 nuclear generating unit. In August 1997 the PSC solicited
comments as to the future treatment of nuclear generating facilities in New
York.
Con Edison potential electric strandable costs are those prior utility
investments and commitments that may not be recoverable in a competitive energy
supply market,  including the unrecovered cost of Con Edison electric
generating plants, the future cost of decommissioning the Indian Point nuclear
generating station and charges under contracts with NUGs. During the Transition
Con Edison will continue to recover its potential electric strandable costs in
the rates it charges all customers, including those customers purchasing
electricity from others. Following the Transition Con Edison will be given a
reasonable opportunity to recover, through a non-bypassable charge to customers,
remaining strandable costs, including a reasonable return on investments. For
remaining fossil-related strandable costs, the recovery period will be 10 years.
For remaining nuclear-related strandable costs, the recovery period will be the
then-remaining life of Con Edison Indian Point 2 nuclear unit the operating
license for which extends to 2013. With respect to its NUG contracts, Con
Edison will be permitted to recover at least 90 percent of the amount, if any,
by which the actual costs of its purchases under the contracts exceed market
value after the Transition. potential NUG contract disallowance after the
Transition will be limited to the lower of i 10 percent of the above-market
costs or ii $300 million net present value in 2002. The potential
disallowance will be offset by the amount of NUG contract mitigation achieved by
Con Edison after April 1, 1997 and 10 percent of the gross proceeds of
generating unit sales to third parties. Con Edison will be permitted a
reasonable opportunity to recover any costs subject to disallowance that are not
offset by these two factors if it makes good faith efforts in implementing
provisions of the Settlement Agreement leading to the development of a
competitive electric market in its service territory and the development of an
independent system operator which is expected to administer the wholesale
electric market in New York State.
ACCOUNTING POLICIES The accounting policies of CEI and its subsidiaries conform
to generally accepted accounting principles. For regulated public utilities,
generally accepted  accounting  principles include Statement of Financial
Accounting Standards SFAS No. 71, Accounting for the Effects of Certain Types
of Regulation, and, in accordance with SFAS No. 71, the accounting requirements
and rate-making practices of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission FERC and
the PSC.
In September 1997 Con Edison applied the standards in SFAS No. 101, Regulated
Enterprises - Accounting for the Discontinuation of Application of the Financial
Accounting Standards Board FASB Statement No. 71, to the non-nuclear electric
supply portion of its business that is being deregulated as a result of the
Settlement Agreement the Deregulated Business. The Deregulated Business
includes all of Con Edison fossil electric generating assets, which had a net
book value of approximately $14 billion at December 31, 1997, including
approximately $196 million relating to Con Edison share of the Bowline Point
and Roseton stations which are located outside New York City and operated by
other utilities. The application of SFAS No. 101 to the Deregulated Business
had no material adverse effect on Con Edison financial position or results of
operations.
SFAS No. 121, Accounting for the Impairment of Long-Lived Assets and for
Long-Lived Assets to be Disposed of, requires certain assets to be reviewed for
impairment if the carrying amount of the assets may not be recoverable, requires
that assets to be disposed of be carried at the lower of net book value or fair
value, and amends SFAS No. 71 to require that regulatory assets be charged to
earnings if such assets are no longer considered probable of recovery. Con
Edison has not recognized an impairment of its fossil generating assets because
the estimated cash flows from the operation and/or sale of the assets, together
with the cash flows from the strandable cost recovery provisions of the
Settlement Agreement, will not be less than the net carrying amount of the
generating assets.
Certain deferred charges regulatory assets principally relating to future
federal income taxes and certain deferred credits regulatory liabilities have
resulted from transactions relating or allocated to the Deregulated Business. At
December 31, 1997 regulatory assets net of regulatory liabilities amounted to
approximately $14 billion, of which approximately $300 million is attributable
to the Deregulated Business. Con Edison has not written-off against earnings any
net regulatory assets because recovery of the assets is probable under the
Settlement Agreement.
SFAS No. 5, Accounting for Contingencies, requires accrual of a loss if it is
probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of loss can be
reasonably estimated. Con Edison has not accrued a loss for its contracts with
NUGs because it is not probable that the charges by NUGs under the contracts
will exceed the cash flows from the sale by Con Edison of the electricity
provided by the NUGs, together with the cash flows provided pursuant to the
Settlement Agreement.
UTILITY PLANT AND DEPRECIATION The capitalized cost of additions to utility
plant includes indirect costs such as engineering, supervision, payroll taxes,
pensions, other benefits and an allowance for funds used during construction
AFDC. The original cost of property, together with removal cost, less salvage,
is charged to accumulated depreciation as property is retired.                    -53 The cost of repairs and maintenance is charged to expense, and the cost of
betterments is capitalized.
Rates used for AFDC include the cost of borrowed funds and a reasonable rate on
Con Edison own funds when so used, determined in accordance with PSC and FERC
regulations. The AFDC rate was 91 percent in 1997, 90 percent in 1996 and 91
percent in 1995. The rate was compounded semiannually, and the amounts
applicable to borrowed funds were treated as a reduction of interest charges.
The annual charge for depreciation is computed on the straight-line method for
financial statement purposes using rates based on average lives and net salvage
factors, with the exception of the Indian Point 2 nuclear unit, Con Edison
share of the Roseton generating station, certain leaseholds and certain general
equipment, which are depreciated on a remaining life amortization method.
Depreciation rates averaged approximately 34 percent in 1997 and 1996 and 33
percent in 1995. In 1996 an additional provision for depreciation of $139
million was accrued in connection with a preferred stock refunding. See Note B.
Con Edison is a joint owner of two 1,200-megawatt MW electric generating
stations: 1 Bowline Point, operated by Orange and Rockland Utilities, Inc.,
with Con Edison owning a two-thirds interest, and 2 Roseton, operated by
Central Hudson Gas & Electric Corp., with Con Edison owning a 40 percent
interest. Central Hudson has the option to acquire Con Edison interest in the
Roseton station in 2004. Con Edison share of the investment in these stations
at original cost and as included in its balance sheet at December 31, 1997 and
1996 was Thousands of Dollars                   1997       1996

Con Edison share of accumulated depreciation for the Roseton station at
December 31, 1997 and 1996 was $753 million and $703 million, respectively. A
separate depreciation account is not maintained for Con Edison share of the
Bowline Point station. Con Edison share of operating expenses for these
stations is included in its income statement. Both Orange and Rockland and
Central Hudson have agreed to divest generation as part of their Competitive
Opportunities settlements with the PSC.
NUCLEAR  DECOMMISSIONING  Depreciation  charges  include a provision  for
decommissioning both the Indian Point 2 and the retired Indian Point 1 nuclear
units. Decommissioning costs are being accrued ratably over the Indian Point 2
license period, which extends to the year 2013. Con Edison has been accruing for
the costs of decommissioning within the internal accumulated depreciation
reserve since 1975. In 1989 the PSC permitted Con Edison to establish an
external trust fund for the costs of decommissioning the nuclear portions of the
plants,  pursuant to Nuclear  Regulatory  Commission  NRC  regulations.
Accordingly, beginning in 1989, Con Edison has made contributions to such a
trust. The external trust fund is discussed below under Investments in this
Note A.
Accumulated decommissioning provisions at December 31, 1997 and 1996, which
include earnings on funds externally invested, were as follows                               Amounts Included in
Accumulated Depreciation
- 
Millions of Dollars                   1997       1996
- 
Nuclear                        $ 2117      $ 1647

- 
Total                         $ 2699      $ 2217

In 1994 a site-specific decommissioning study was prepared for both the Indian
Point 2 and the retired Indian Point 1 nuclear units. Based upon this study, the
estimated decommissioning cost in 1993 dollars is approximately $657 million, of
which $252 million is for extended on-site storage of spent nuclear fuel. Using
a 325 percent annual escalation factor, the estimated cost in 2016, the assumed
midpoint for decommissioning expenditures, is approximately $1,372 million.
Under a 1995 electric rate agreement, effective April 1995, the PSC approved an
annual decommissioning expense allowance for the nuclear and non-nuclear
portions of the plants of $213 million and $18 million, respectively, to fund
the future estimated costs of decommissioning. The annual expense allowance
assumes a 6 percent after-tax annual return on fund assets.
The FASB is currently reviewing the utility industry accounting treatment of
nuclear and certain other plant decommissioning costs. In an exposure draft
issued in February 1996, the FASB concluded that decommissioning costs should be
accounted for as a liability at present value, with a corresponding asset in
utility plant, rather than as a component of depreciation. Discussions of issues
addressed in the exposure draft are ongoing.                    -54 NUCLEAR FUEL Nuclear fuel assemblies and components are amortized to operating
expenses  based on the quantity of heat produced in the generation of
electricity. Fuel costs also include provisions for payments to the U.S.
Department of Energy DOE for future off-site storage of the spent fuel and for
a portion of the costs to decontaminate and decommission the DOE facilities used
to enrich uranium purchased by Con Edison. Such payments amounted to $74
million in 1997. Nuclear fuel costs are recovered in revenues through base rates
or through the fuel adjustment clause.
LEASES In accordance with SFAS No. 71, those leases that meet the criteria for
capitalization are capitalized for accounting  purposes.  For rate-making
purposes, all leases have been treated as operating leases.
REVENUES Revenues for electric, gas and steam service are recognized on a
monthly billing cycle basis. Pursuant to the 1992 and 1995 electric rate
agreements, actual electric net revenues operating revenues less fuel and
purchased power costs and revenue taxes were adjusted by accrual to target
levels established under the agreements in accordance with an electric revenue
adjustment mechanism ERAM. Revenues were also increased or decreased each
month to reflect rewards or penalties earned under incentive mechanisms for
the Enlightened Energy demand-side management program and for customer service
activities. The agreements provided that the net regulatory asset or liability
thus accrued in each rate year would be reflected in customers' bills in the
following rate year. Effective April 1, 1997 the Settlement Agreement eliminated
the ERAM and the Enlightened Energy and electric customer service incentives.
The Settlement Agreement includes a penalty mechanism estimated maximum, $26
million per year for failure to maintain certain customer service standards.
The 1994 gas rate agreement provided for revenues to be increased or decreased
each month to reflect rewards or penalties earned under incentive mechanisms
related to gas customer service and system improvement targets. The 1997 gas
rate agreement discontinued the incentive mechanisms effective October 1, 1997,
after which Con Edison is subject to a penalty maximum, $17 million per year
if it fails to maintain targeted levels of customer service.
RECOVERABLE FUEL COSTS Fuel and purchased power costs that are above the levels
included in base rates are recoverable under electric, gas and steam fuel
adjustment clauses. If costs fall below these levels, the difference is credited
to customers. For electric and steam, such costs are deferred until the period
in which they are billed or credited to customers 40 days for electric, 30 days
for steam. For gas, the excess or deficiency is accumulated for refund or
surcharge to customers on an annual basis.
Effective April 1992 a partial pass-through electric fuel adjustment clause
PPFAC was implemented with monthly targets for electric fuel and purchased
power costs. Con Edison retains for stockholders 30 percent of any savings in
actual costs below the target amount, but must bear 30 percent of any excess of
actual costs over the target. For each rate year there is a $35 million cap on
the maximum incentive or penalty, with a limit within the $35 million of $10
million for costs associated with generation at Con Edison Indian Point 2
nuclear unit.
REGULATORY ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE Regulatory accounts receivable at December 31,
1997 amounted to a credit due customers of $17 million, reflecting an accrual
for the PPFAC. The amounts accrued under the PPFAC are billed or credited to
customers on a monthly basis through the electric fuel adjustment clause.
Effective April 1, 1997 the Settlement Agreement eliminated the modified ERAM
and the Enlightened Energy and electric customer service incentives; at that
time, the regulatory accounts receivable recorded for the modified ERAM and
these incentives were, along with certain other debit and credit balances in Con
Edison financial statements, eliminated. The elimination of these balances had
no material adverse effect on Con Edison financial position or results of
operations.
ENLIGHTENED ENERGY PROGRAM COSTS In accordance with PSC directives, Con Edison
deferred the costs of its Enlightened Energy program for future recovery from
ratepayers. Such deferrals amounted to $1178 million at December 31, 1997 and
$1337 million at December 31, 1996. In accordance with the 1992 and 1995
electric rate agreements, deferred charges for the Enlightened Energy program
are generally recoverable over a five-year period.
TEMPORARY CASH INVESTMENTS Temporary cash investments are short-term, highly
liquid investments which generally have maturities of three months or less. They
are stated at cost which approximates market. CEI and Con Edison consider
temporary cash investments to be cash equivalents.
INVESTMENTS  For 1997  investments  consisted  primarily  of the nuclear
decommissioning trust fund $2117 million at December 31, 1997 and investments
of Con Edison Solutions and Con Edison Development $660 million at December
31,  1997.  For 1996  investments  consisted  primarily of the nuclear
decommissioning trust fund $1647 million at December 31, 1996. The nuclear
decommissioning trust fund is stated at market; investments of Con Edison
Solutions and Con Edison Development are stated at cost. Earnings on the nuclear
decommissioning trust fund are not recognized in income but are included in the
accumulated depreciation reserve. See Nuclear Decommissioning in this Note A.
GAS HEDGING Con Edison purchases put options and sells futures contracts under
its gas hedging program in order to protect its gas inventory against adverse
market price fluctuations. Con Edison defers the related hedging gains and
losses until the underlying gas commodity is withdrawn from storage and then
adjusts the cost of its gas in storage accordingly.                    -55 All hedging gains or losses are credited or charged to customers through Con
Edison gas fuel adjustment clause. Con Edison Solutions uses futures contracts
to hedge natural gas transactions in order to minimize the risk of unfavorable
market price fluctuations. Gains or losses on these futures contracts are
deferred until gas is purchased, at which time gas expense is adjusted
accordingly. At December 31, 1997 deferred gains or losses on open positions
were not material.
Neither CEI nor any of its consolidated subsidiaries, including Con Edison,
enters into derivative transactions that do not meet the criteria for hedges and
that do not qualify for deferred accounting treatment. If for any reason a
derivative transaction were no longer classified as a hedge, inventory or gas
expense, as appropriate, would be adjusted for unrealized gains and losses
relating to the transaction.
FEDERAL INCOME TAX In accordance with SFAS No. 109, Accounting for Income
Taxes, Con Edison has recorded an accumulated deferred federal income tax
liability for substantially all temporary differences between the book and tax
bases of assets and liabilities at current tax rates. In accordance with rate
agreements, Con Edison has recovered amounts from customers for a portion of the
tax expense it will pay in the future as a result of the reversal or
turn-around of these temporary differences. As to the remaining temporary
differences, in accordance with SFAS No. 71, Con Edison has established a
regulatory asset for the net revenue requirements to be recovered from customers
for the related future tax expense. In 1993 the PSC issued an Interim Policy
Statement proposing accounting procedures consistent with SFAS No. 109 and
providing assurances that these future increases in taxes will be recoverable in
rates. The final policy statement is not expected to differ materially from the
interim policy statement. See Note I.
Accumulated deferred investment tax credits are amortized ratably over the lives
of the related properties and applied as a reduction in future federal income
tax expense.
Con Edison and its subsidiaries file, and CEI expects that it and its
subsidiaries will file, a consolidated federal income tax return. Income taxes
are allocated to each company based on its taxable income.
RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT COSTS Research and development costs relating to
specific construction projects are capitalized. All other such costs are charged
to operating expenses as incurred. Research and development costs in 1997, 1996
and 1995, amounting to $259 million, $323 million and $450 million,
respectively, were charged to operating expenses. No research and development
costs were capitalized in these years.
NEW FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING STANDARDS The FASB has issued the following two
standards effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 1997: SFAS No.
130, Reporting Comprehensive Income, and SFAS No. 131, Disclosures about
Segments of an Enterprise and Related Information. The application of these
standards will not have a material effect on CEI financial position or results
of operations or materially change its current disclosure practices.
RECLASSIFICATION Certain prior year amounts have been reclassified to conform
with current year presentation.
ESTIMATES The accompanying consolidated financial statements reflect judgments
and estimates made in the application of the above accounting policies.
NOTE B CAPITALIZATION
COMMON STOCK AND PREFERRED STOCK NOT SUBJECT TO MANDATORY REDEMPTION In December
1997 Con Edison redeemed its Series B preference stock. Each share of Series B
preference stock was convertible into 13 shares of common stock at a conversion
price of $769 per share. During 1997, 1996 and 1995, 38,158 shares, 2,869
shares and 3,928 shares of Series B preference stock were converted into 496,054
shares, 37,297 shares and 51,064 shares of common stock, respectively.
The prices at which Con Edison has the option to redeem its preferred stock
other than Series I and Series J in each case, plus accrued dividends are as
follows  
$5 Cumulative Preferred Stock                      $ 10500
- 
Cumulative Preferred Stock:
Series A                               $ 10200
Series B                                10200
Series C                                10100
Series D                                10100
- 
PREFERRED STOCK SUBJECT TO MANDATORY REDEMPTION Con Edison is required to redeem
25,000 of the Series I shares on May 1 of each year in the five-year period
commencing with the year 2002 and to redeem the remaining Series I shares on May
1, 2007. Con Edison is required to redeem the Series J shares on August 1, 2002.
In each case the redemption price is $100 per share plus accrued and unpaid
dividends to the redemption date. In addition, Con Edison may redeem Series I
shares at a redemption price of $10360 per share, plus accrued dividends, if
redeemed prior to May 1, 1998 and thereafter at prices declining annually to
$100 per share, plus accrued dividends, after April 30, 2002. Neither Series I
nor Series J shares may be called for redemption while dividends are in arrears
on outstanding shares of $5 cumulative preferred stock or cumulative preferred
stock.                    -56 PREFERRED STOCK REFUNDING In March 1996 Con Edison canceled approximately $227
million of its preferred stock purchased pursuant to a tender offer and redeemed
an additional $90 million of its preferred stock. In accordance with the PSC
order approving the issuance of subordinated deferrable interest debentures to
refund the preferred stock, Con Edison offset the net gain of $139 million by
accruing an additional provision for depreciation equal to the net gain.
DIVIDENDS Beginning in 1998, dividends on CEI common shares will depend
primarily on the dividends and other distributions that Con Edison and the other
subsidiaries will pay to CEI and the capital requirements of CEI and its
subsidiaries. The PSC Settlement Agreement limits the dividends that Con Edison
may pay to not more than 100 percent of Con Edison income available for
dividends, calculated on a two-year rolling average basis. Excluded from the
calculation of income available for dividends are non-cash charges to income
resulting from accounting  changes or charges to income  resulting from
significant unanticipated events. The restriction also does not apply to
dividends necessary to transfer to CEI proceeds from major transactions, such as
asset sales, or to dividends reducing Con Edison equity ratio to a level
appropriate to Con Edison business risk.
Payment of Con Edison common stock dividends to CEI is subject to certain
additional restrictions. No dividends may be paid, or funds set apart for
payment, on Con Edison common stock until all dividends accrued on the $5
cumulative preferred stock and cumulative preferred stock have been paid, or
declared and set apart for payment, and unless Con Edison is not in arrears on
its mandatory redemption obligation for the Series I and Series J cumulative
preferred stock. No dividends may be paid on any of Con Edison capital stock
during any period in which Con Edison has deferred payment of interest on its
subordinated deferrable interest debentures.
LONG-TERM DEBT In December 1997 Con Edison issued $330 million of 10-year 645%
Series 1997 B debentures to refund in January 1998 three series of tax-exempt
debt that Con Edison issued through the New York State Energy Research and
Development Authority: 7-1/2% Series 1986 A, 9-1/4% Series 1987 B and 7-3/4%
Series 1989 A.
Long-term debt maturing in the period 1998-2002 is as follows  
1998                                $200,000,000
1999                                 225,000,000
2000                                 275,000,000
2001                                 300,000,000
2002                                 300,000,000
- 
Con Edison long-term debt is stated at cost which, as of December 31, 1997,
approximates fair value. The fair value of the company long-term debt is
estimated based on current rates for debt of the same remaining maturities.
NOTE C SHORT-TERM BORROWING
Con Edison has been authorized by FERC to issue short-term debt of up to $500
million outstanding at any one time. At December 31, 1997 Con Edison had no
short-term debt outstanding. In January 1998 Con Edison initiated a $500 million
commercial paper program, supported by revolving credit agreements with banks.
Bank commitments under the revolving credit agreements may terminate upon a
change in control of CEI and borrowings under the agreements are subject to
certain conditions, including that Con Edison ratio calculated in accordance
with the agreements of debt to total capital not at any time exceed 065 to 1.
At December 31, 1997 this ratio was 043 to 1. Borrowings under the commercial
paper program or the revolving credit facilities are expected to be at
prevailing market rates.
NOTE D PENSION BENEFITS
Con Edison has pension plans that cover substantially all of its employees and
certain employees of other CEI subsidiaries. The plans are designed to comply
with the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 ERISA. Contributions
are made solely by Con Edison and the other subsidiaries based on an actuarial
valuation, and are not less than the minimum amount required by ERISA. Con
Edison policy is to fund the actuarially computed net pension cost as such
cost accrues subject to statutory maximum and minimum limits. Benefits are
generally based on a final five-year average pay formula.
In accordance with SFAS No. 87, Employers' Accounting for Pensions, Con Edison
uses the projected unit credit method for determining pension cost. Pension
costs for 1997, 1996 and 1995 amounted to $118 million, $732 million and $114
million, respectively, of which $93 million for 1997, $578 million for 1996
and $89 million for 1995 was charged to operating expenses. Pension costs
reflect the amortization of a regulatory asset established pursuant to SFAS No.
71 to offset the $333 million increase in pension obligations from a special
retirement  program Con Edison offered in 1993,  which provided special
termination benefits as described in SFAS No. 88, Employers' Accounting for
Settlements  and  Curtailments of Defined Benefit Pension Plans and for
Termination Benefits. Pension cost for 1995 also includes an actuarially
determined credit of $73 million representing a prepayment on one of the plans.
This credit reduced pension funding in 1996.
Con Edison recognizes investment gains and losses over five years and amortizes
unrecognized actuarial gains and losses over ten years.                    -57 The components of net periodic pension cost for 1997, 1996 and 1995 were as

To determine the present value of the projected benefit obligation, the discount
rates assumed were 725 percent for 1997 and 1996 and 7 percent for 1995. A
weighted average rate of increase in future compensation levels of 58 percent
and long-term rate of return on plan assets of 85 percent were assumed for all
years.
The pension plan assets consist primarily of corporate common stocks and bonds,
group annuity contracts and debt of the United States government and its
agencies.
NOTE E POSTRETIREMENT BENEFITS OTHER THAN PENSIONS OPEB
Con Edison has a contributory comprehensive hospital, medical and prescription
drug program for all retirees, their dependents and surviving spouses. Con
Edison also provides life insurance benefits for approximately 6,400 retired
employees. All of Con Edison employees become eligible for these benefits upon
retirement, except that the amount of life insurance is limited and is available
only to management employees and to those bargaining unit employees who
participated in the optional program prior to retirement. Con Edison has
reserved the right to amend or terminate these programs.
Con Edison policy is to fund in external trusts the actuarially determined
annual costs for retiree health and life insurance subject to statutory maximum
limits.
Con Edison recognizes investment gains and losses over five years and amortizes
unrecognized actuarial gains and losses over ten years.
The cost to Con Edison for retiree health benefits for 1997, 1996 and 1995
amounted to $767 million, $892 million and $655 million, respectively, of
which $610 million for 1997, $705 million for 1996 and $516 million for 1995
was charged to operating expenses. The cost of the retiree life insurance plan
for 1997, 1996 and 1995 amounted to $208 million, $228 million and $180
million, respectively, of which $165 million for 1997, $180 million for 1996
and $142 million for 1995 was charged to operating expenses.                    -58 The components of postretirement benefit health and life insurance costs for

To determine the accumulated postretirement benefit obligation, the discount
rates assumed were 725 percent for 1997 and 1996 and 7 percent for 1995. The
assumed long-term rate of return on plan assets was 85 percent for these years.
The health care cost trend rate assumed for 1997 was 85 percent, for 1998, 8
percent, and then declining one-half percent per year to 5 percent for 2004 and
thereafter. If the assumed health care cost trend rate were to be increased by
one percentage point each year, the accumulated  postretirement  benefit
obligation would increase by approximately $1148 million and the service cost
and interest component of the net periodic postretirement benefit cost would
increase by $126 million.
Postretirement plan assets consist of corporate common stocks and bonds, group
annuity contracts, debt of the United States government and its agencies and
short-term securities.
NOTE F CONTINGENCIES
INDIAN POINT Nuclear generating units similar in design to Con Edison Indian
Point 2 unit have experienced problems that have required steam generator
replacement. Inspections of the Indian Point 2 steam generators since 1976 have
revealed various problems, some of which appear to have been arrested, but the
remaining service life of the steam generators is uncertain. The projected
service life of the steam generators is reassessed periodically in the light of
the inspections made during scheduled outages of the unit. Based on the latest
available data and current NRC criteria, Con Edison estimates that steam
generator replacement will not be required before 2001. Con Edison has
replacement steam generators, which are stored at the site. Replacement of the
steam  generators  would require  estimated  additional  expenditures  of
approximately $108 million 1997 dollars, exclusive of replacement power costs
and an outage of approximately four months. However, securing necessary permits
and approvals or other factors could require a substantially longer outage if
steam generator replacement is required on short notice.
NUCLEAR  INSURANCE The insurance  policies covering Con Edison nuclear
facilities for property damage, excess property damage, and outage costs permit
assessments under certain conditions to cover insurers' losses. As of December
31, 1997, the highest amount that could be assessed for losses during the
current policy year under all of the policies was $24 million. While assessments
may also be made for losses in certain prior years, Con Edison is not aware of
any losses in such years that it believes are likely to result in an assessment.
Under certain circumstances, in the event of nuclear incidents at facilities
covered by the federal government third-party liability indemnification
program, Con Edison could be assessed up to $793 million per incident, of which
not more than $10 million may be assessed in any one year. The per-incident
limit is to be adjusted for inflation not later than 1998 and not less than once
every five years thereafter.
Con Edison participates in an insurance program covering liabilities for
injuries to certain workers in the nuclear power industry. In the event of such
injuries, Con Edison is subject to assessment up to an estimated maximum of
approximately $31 million.                    -59 ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS The normal course of Con Edison operations necessarily
involves activities and substances that expose it to potential liabilities under
federal, state and local laws protecting the environment. Such liabilities can
be material and in some instances may be imposed without regard to fault, or may
be imposed for past acts, even though such past acts may have been lawful at the
time they occurred. Sources of such potential liabilities include but are not
limited to the Federal Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and
Liability Act of 1980 Superfund, a 1994 settlement with the New York State
Department of Environmental Conservation DEC, asbestos, and electric and
magnetic fields EMF.
SUPERFUND By its terms Superfund imposes joint and several strict liability,
regardless of fault, upon generators of hazardous substances for resulting
removal and remedial costs and environmental damages. Con Edison has received
process or notice concerning possible claims under Superfund or similar state
statutes relating to a number of sites at which it is alleged that hazardous
substances generated by Con Edison and, in most instances, a large number of
other potentially responsible parties were deposited.  Estimates of the
investigative, removal, remedial and environmental damage costs if any that
Con Edison will be obligated to pay with respect to each of these sites range
from extremely preliminary to highly refined. Based on these estimates Con
Edison had accrued at December 31, 1997 a liability of approximately $254
million. There will be additional costs with respect to these and possibly other
sites, the materiality of which is not presently determinable.
DEC SETTLEMENT In 1994 Con Edison agreed to a consent order settling a civil
administrative  proceeding  instituted by the DEC alleging  environmental
violations by the company. Pursuant to the consent order, Con Edison has
conducted an environmental management systems evaluation and an environmental
compliance audit. Con Edison also must implement best management practices
plans for certain facilities and undertake a remediation program at certain
sites. At December 31, 1997 Con Edison had an accrued liability of $169 million
for these sites. Expenditures for environmental-related capital projects in the
five years 1998-2002, including expenditures to comply with the consent order,
are estimated at $148 million. These estimated expenditures do not reflect
divestiture by Con Edison of generating plants pursuant to the Settlement
Agreement see Note A or otherwise.
ASBESTOS CLAIMS Suits have been brought in New York State and federal courts
against Con Edison and many other defendants, wherein several hundred plaintiffs
sought large amounts of compensatory and punitive damages for deaths and
injuries allegedly caused by exposure to asbestos at various premises of Con
Edison. Many of these suits have been disposed of without any payment by Con
Edison, or for immaterial amounts. The amounts specified in all the remaining
suits total billions of dollars but Con Edison believes that these amounts are
greatly exaggerated, as were the claims already disposed of. Based on the
information and relevant circumstances known to Con Edison at this time, it is
the opinion of Con Edison that these suits will not have a material adverse
effect on the company financial position, results of operations or liquidity.
EMF Electric and magnetic fields are found wherever electricity is used. Con
Edison is the defendant in several suits claiming property damage resulting from
EMF. The aggregate amount sought in these suits is not material. In the event,
however, that a causal relationship between EMF and adverse health effects is
established, or independently of any such causal determination, in the event of
adverse developments in related legal or public policy doctrines, there could be
a material adverse effect on the electric utility industry, including Con
Edison.
NOTE G NON-UTILITY GENERATORS NUGS
Con Edison has contracts with NUGs for 2,059 MW of electric generating capacity.
Payments by Con Edison under the contracts are reflected in rates. Assuming
performance by the NUGs, Con Edison is obligated over the terms of these
contracts which extend for various periods, up to 2036 to make capacity and
other fixed payments.
For the years 1998 - 2002, capacity and other fixed payments are estimated to be
$510 million, $508 million, $478 million, $485 million and $494 million. Such
payments  gradually increase to approximately $600 million in 2013, and
thereafter decline significantly.
For energy delivered under these contracts, Con Edison is obligated to pay
variable prices that are estimated to be approximately at market levels.
NOTE H STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION
Under CEI Stock Option Plan, options may be granted to officers and key
employees for up to 10,000,000 shares of CEI common stock. Generally, options
become exercisable three years after the grant date and remain exercisable until
ten years from the grant date.
As permitted by SFAS No. 123, Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation, CEI has
elected to follow Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 25 APB 25,
Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees and related interpretations in
accounting for its employee stock options. Under APB 25, because the exercise
price of CEI employee stock options equals the market price of the underlying
stock on the date of grant, no compensation expense is recognized.                    -60 Disclosure of pro-forma information regarding net income and earnings per share
is required by SFAS No. 123. This information has been determined as if CEI had
accounted for its employee stock options under the fair value method of that
statement. The fair values of 1997 and 1996 options are $284 and $249 per
share, respectively. They were estimated at the date of grant using the
Black-Scholes  option  pricing model with the following  weighted-average
assumptions used for grants in 1997 and 1996, respectively: risk-free interest
rates of 646 percent and 674 percent; expected lives of eight years for 1997
and 1996; expected volatility of 1408 percent and 1628 percent; and dividend
yields of 667 percent and 746 percent.
Had CEI used SFAS No. 123, basic and diluted earnings per share for 1997 and
1996 would be unaffected and pro-forma net income for common stock would be
$693,680,000  or $799,000 less than the amount  reported for 1997, and
$687,938,000 or $231,000 less than the amount reported for 1996.
A summary of the status of the Plan as of December 31, 1997 and 1996 and changes
during those years is as follows                            1997         1996
