REPORT ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING   The Companys management is responsible for establishing
and maintaining adequate internal control over financial
reporting, as such term is defined in Exchange Act
Rules13a-15f.
Under the supervision and with the participation of management,
including the principal executive officer and acting principal
financial officer, management conducted an evaluation of the
effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting
based on the criteria established in Internal
Control Integrated Framework issued by the
Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway
Commission. Managements assessment of and conclusion on
the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting
did not include the internal controls of Cepheid AB, which was
acquired on February14, 2007 and at the date of
acquisition was named Sangtec Molecular Diagnostics AB, which is
included in the Companys 2007 consolidated financial
statements and constituted 03% and 06% of total net assets,
respectively, as of December31, 2007 and 56% and 40% of
revenue and net loss, respectively, for the year then ended.   Based on managements evaluation under the framework in
Internal Control Integrated Framework,
management has concluded that the Companys internal
control over financial reporting was effective as of
December31, 2007. Ernst Young LLP, an
independent registered public accounting firm, has audited the
consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report
on
Form10-K
and, as part of its audit, has issued an attestation report,
included herein, on the effectiveness of the Companys
internal control over financial reporting.   February29, 2008

42 Table of Contents   REPORT OF
INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM   The Board of Directors and Shareholders Cepheid   We have audited Cepheids internal control over financial
reporting as of December31, 2007 based on criteria
established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework
issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the
Treadway Commission the COSO criteria.
Cepheids management is responsible for maintaining
effective internal control over financial reporting included in
the accompanying Report on Managements Assessment of
Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is
to express an opinion on the Companys internal control
over financial reporting based on our audit.   We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the
Public Company Accounting Oversight Board United States. Those
standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control
over financial reporting was maintained in all material
respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of
internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk
that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the
design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on
assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we
considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our
audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.   A companys internal control over financial reporting is a
process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the
reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of
financial statements for external purposes in accordance with
generally accepted accounting principles. A companys
internal control over financial reporting includes those
policies and procedures that 1pertain to the maintenance
of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly
reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the
company; 2provide reasonable assurance that transactions
are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial
statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting
principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company
are being made only in accordance with authorizations of
management and directors of the company; and 3provide
reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of
unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the
companys assets that could have a material effect on the
financial statements.   Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over
financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.
Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future
periods are subject to the risk that controls may become
inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree
of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.   As indicated in the accompanying Managements Report on
Internal Control over Financial Reporting, managements
assessment of and conclusion on the effectiveness of internal
control over financial reporting did not include the internal
controls of Cepheid AB, which was acquired on February14,
2007 and at the date of acquisition was named Sangtec Molecular
Diagnostics AB, which is included in the 2007 consolidated
financial statements of Cepheid and constituted 03% and 06% of
total and net assets, respectively, as of December31, 2007
and 56% and 40% of revenue and net loss for the year then
ended. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting
of Cepheid also did not include an evaluation of the internal
control over financial reporting of Cepheid AB.   In our opinion, Cepheid maintained, in all material respects,
effective internal control over financial reporting as of
December31, 2007, based on the COSO criteria   We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the
Public Company Accounting Oversight Board United States, the
consolidated balance sheets of Cepheid as of December31,
2007 and 2006, and the related consolidated statements of
operations, shareholders equity and cash flows for each of
the three years in the period ended December31, 2007 and
our report dated February29, 2008 expressed an unqualified
opinion thereon.   /s/ Ernst Young LLP   SanJose, California   February29, 2008   
43 Table of Contents   REPORT OF
INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM   The Board of Directors and Shareholders   Cepheid   We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of
Cepheid as of December31, 2007 and 2006, and the related
consolidated statements of operations, shareholders equity
and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended
December31, 2007. Our audits also included the financial
statement schedule listed in the index at b. These
financial statements and schedule are the responsibility of
Cepheids management. Our responsibility is to express an
opinion on these financial statements and schedule based on our
audits.   We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the
Public Company Accounting Oversight Board United States. Those
standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are
free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a
test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in
the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the
accounting principles used and significant estimates made by
management, as well as evaluating the overall financial
statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a
reasonable basis for our opinion.   In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above
present fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated
financial position of Cepheid at December31, 2007 and
2006, and the consolidated results of its operations and its
cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended
December31, 2007, in conformity with U.S.generally
accepted accounting principles. Also in our opinion, the related
financial statement schedule, when considered in relation to the
basic financial statements taken as a whole, presents fairly in
all material respects, the information set forth therein.   As discussed in Note1 to the consolidated financial
statements, Cepheid changed its method of accounting for
stock-based compensation as of January1, 2006, and its
method of accounting for uncertain tax positions as of
January1, 2007.   We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the
Public Company Accounting Oversight Board United States,
Cepheids internal control over financial reporting as of
December31, 2007, based on criteria established in
Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of
Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission and our
report dated February29, 2008 expressed an unqualified
opinion thereon.   /s/Ernst

Organization
and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies   Organization
and Business   Cepheid the Company was incorporated in the State
of California on March4, 1996. The Company is a molecular
diagnostics company that develops, manufactures, and markets
fully-integrated systems for genetic analysis in the Clinical
Molecular Diagnostic, Industrial and Biothreat markets. The
Companys systems enable rapid, sophisticated genetic
testing for organisms and genetic-based diseases by automating
otherwise complex manual laboratory procedures.   Principles
of Consolidation   The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of
the Company and its wholly-owned subsidiaries after elimination
of intercompany transactions and balances. In August 2006, the
Companys French subsidiary acquired Actigenics SA
Actigenics, which was subsequently merged into the
French subsidiary. In February2007, the Company acquired
Sangtec Molecular Diagnostics AB Sangtec. The
consolidated financial statements include the results of
operations of Actigenics and Sangtec subsequent to their
respective acquisition dates of August8, 2006 and
February14, 2007, respectively. The functional currency of
the French subsidiary is the Euro, and the functional currency
of the Swedish subsidiary is the Swedish Krona; accordingly, all
gains and losses arising from foreign currency transactions in
currencies other than the functional currency are included in
the consolidated statements of operations. Adjustments resulting
from translating the financial statements of foreign
subsidiaries into U.S.Dollars are reported as a separate
component of accumulated other comprehensive income in
shareholders equity.   Use of
Estimates   The preparation of consolidated financial statements in
conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the
United States requires management to make estimates and
assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated
financial statements and accompanying notes. Actual results
could differ from these estimates.   Financial
Instruments   The carrying amounts of financial instruments, including cash
and cash equivalents, marketable securities, accounts
receivable, accounts payable, short-term debt and long-term
debt, approximated fair value as of December31, 2007 and
2006, due to their short-term nature.   Cash,
Cash Equivalents and Marketable Securities   Cash and cash equivalents consist of cash on deposit with banks,
money market instruments, commercial paper and debt securities
with maturities from the date of purchase of 90days or
less. Interest income includes interest, dividends, amortization
of purchase premiums and discounts and realized gains and losses
on sales of securities.   The Companys marketable securities are designated as
available-for-sale and recorded at fair value, and realized and
unrealized gains and losses on investments are determined on the
specific identification method. Unrealized holding gains or
losses are reported as a component of accumulated other
comprehensive income loss. Marketable securities with
maturities greater than 90days and less than one year are
classified as short-term; otherwise they are classified as
long-term.   
49 Table of Contents   The following is a summary of the Companys cash, cash
equivalents and marketable securities in thousands   	
December31   2007   2006   Cash and cash equivalents   Cash     12,207     13,753   Money market funds   4,269   3,433   16,476   17,186   Marketable securities   Taxable auction variable rate notes   27,550   77,750     44,026     94,936   As of December 31, 2007, the average auction rate securities
portfolio duration was less than 30 days and the securities had
contractual maturities greater than twenty years.   An impairment charge is recognized when the decline in the fair
value of a security below the amortized cost basis is determined
to be other-than-temporary. The Company considers various
factors in determining whether to recognize an impairment
charge, including the duration of time and the severity to which
the fair value has been less than our amortized cost basis, any
adverse changes in the investees financial condition and
the Companys intent and ability to hold the investment for
a period of time sufficient to allow for any anticipated
recovery in market value. To date, the Company has not recorded
any impairment charges on investments related to
other-than-temporary declines in market value.   In February 2008, the Company had $250million invested in
auction rate securities of which $205million in principal
amount failed to settle at auction in February 2008. The Company
continues to earn interest on the investments that failed to
settle at auction, at the maximum contractual rate. As of
December31, 2007 the carrying value of these investments
was equal to the fair value based on successful auctions
preceding and subsequent to year end. All of the auction rate
securities held by the Company continue to carry a high credit
rating. Approximately $207million of principal amount of
auction rate securities owned by the Company are either backed
by federal student loans, which are guaranteed by the Federal
Family Educational Loan Program FFELP, or are
insured.   Restricted
Cash   Restricted cash consists of a certificate of deposit and bank
term deposits all with maturities of greater than 90days,
and is collateral for a standby letter of credit issued in
connection with a facility lease obligation.   Inventory   Inventory is stated at the lower of standard cost which
approximates actual cost or market, with cost determined on the
first-in-first-out
method. Accordingly, allocation of fixed production overheads to
conversion costs is based on normal capacity of the production.
Abnormal amounts of idle facility expense, freight, handling
costs and spoilage are expensed as incurred and not included in
overhead.   The components of inventories were as follows in thousands

50 Table of Contents   Property
and Equipment   Property and equipment are stated at cost. Depreciation is
calculated using the straight-line method, and the cost is
amortized over the estimated useful lives of the assets, which
range from 3 to 10years. Leasehold improvements are
amortized using the straight-line method over the estimated

Assets and Goodwill   As of December31, 2007, intangible assets consisted
primarily of rights to certain patented technologies licensed
from F. Hoffmann-LaRoche Ltd. Roche and
Applera Corporation Applera, see Note3,
Patent License Agreements and Note5,
Collaborative Agreements and Contracts and
intangible assets acquired in the acquisition of Sangtec see
Note7, Acquisitions.   Intangible assets related to licenses are recorded at cost, less
accumulated amortization. Intangible assets related to
technology acquired in acquisitions and other intangible assets
are recorded at fair value at the date of acquisition, less
accumulated amortization. Intangible assets are amortized over
their estimated useful lives, ranging from 3 to 20years,
on a straight-line basis, except for intangible assets acquired
in the acquisition of Sangtec, which are amortized on the basis
of economic useful life. Amortization of intangible assets is
included in cost of product sales in the accompanying
consolidated statements of operations.   The Company reviews its intangible assets for impairment under
Statement of Financial Accounting Standards SFAS
No144, Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of
Long-Lived Assets. The Company conducts the impairment
review when events or circumstances indicate the carrying value
of a long-lived asset may be impaired by estimating the future
undiscounted cash flows to be derived from an asset to assess
whether or not a potential impairment exists. If the carrying
value exceeds the Companys estimate of future undiscounted
cash flows, an impairment value is calculated as the excess of
the carrying value of the asset over the Companys estimate
of its fair market value. Events or circumstances which could
trigger an impairment review include a significant adverse
change in the business climate, an adverse action or assessment
by a regulator, unanticipated competition, significant changes
in the Companys use of acquired assets, the Companys
overall business strategy, or significant negative industry or
economic trends. There were no impairment charges recorded in
any of the periods presented.

effective July1, 2004. The net book value of this license
was $155million and $167million at
December31, 2007 and 2006, respectively.   Amortization expense of intangible assets was $43million,
$28million and $25million for the years ended
December31, 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. The
expected future annual amortization expense of intangible assets
recorded on the Companys consolidated balance sheet as of
December31, 2007 is as follows, assuming no impairment

SFASNo142, Goodwill and Other Intangible
Assets. If the fair value of the Company exceeds its net
book value including goodwill, then goodwill is not considered
impaired. The initial step is to compare Companys fair
value as determined by its market capitalization to its net book
value. If the market capitalization exceeds the net book value,
goodwill is presumed to be unimpaired. Otherwise, the Company
would estimate expected future cash flows of its business, which
operates in a number of markets and geographical regions. The
Company would then determine the carrying value of its business
and compare its carrying value including goodwill and other
intangibles to the discounted future cash flows. If the total of
future cash flows is less than the carrying amount of the
assets, the Company would recognize an impairment loss based on
the excess of the carrying amount over the fair value of the
assets. At December31, 2007, the Company compared its
market capitalization to its net book value and determined that
goodwill was not impaired.   Warranty
Reserve   The Company warrants its instrument products to be free from
defects for a period of 12 to 15months from the date of
sale and its disposable products to be free from defects, when
handled according to product specifications, for the stated life
of such products. Accordingly, a provision for the estimated
cost of warranty repair or replacement is recorded at the time
revenue is recognized. The Companys warranty provision is
established using   
52 Table of Contents   managements estimate of future failure rates and of the
future costs of repairing any instrument failures during the
warranty period or replacing any disposable products with
defects. The activities in the warranty provision for each of
the three years ended December31, 2007 consisted of the

Recognition   In accordance with Staff Accounting Bulletin SAB
No104, Revenue Recognition, the Company
recognizes revenue from product sales when there is persuasive
evidence that an arrangement exists, delivery has occurred, the
price is fixed or determinable and collectibility is reasonably
assured. No right of return exists for the Companys
products except in the case of damaged goods. The Company has
not experienced any significant returns of its products.
Contract revenues include fees for technology licenses and
research and development services, royalties under license and
collaboration agreements. Contract revenue related to technology
licenses is generally fully recognized only after the license
period has commenced, the technology has been delivered and no
further involvement of the Company is required. When the Company
has continuing involvement related to a technology license,
revenue is recognized over the license term. Royalties are
typically based on licensees net sales of products that
utilize the Companys technology, and royalty revenues are
recognized as earned in accordance with the contract terms when
the royalties can be reliably measured and their collectibility
is reasonably assured, such as upon the receipt of a royalty
statement from the customer. Service revenue is recognized when
the services have been provided. Shipping and handling costs are
expensed as incurred and included in cost of product sales. In
those cases where the Company bills shipping and handling costs
to customers, the amounts billed are classified as revenue.   The Company recognizes revenue from product sales and contract
arrangements. From time to time, the Company enters into revenue
arrangements with multiple deliverables. Multiple element
revenue agreements are evaluated under Emerging Issues Task
Force EITF Issue
No00-21,
Revenue Arrangements with Multiple Deliverables
EITF00-21,
to determine whether the delivered item has value to the
customer on a stand-alone basis and whether objective and
reliable evidence of the fair value of the undelivered item
exists. Deliverables in an arrangement that do not meet the
separation criteria in
EITF00-21
must be treated as one unit of accounting for purposes of
revenue recognition. Advance payments received in excess of
amounts earned, such as funds received in advance of products to
be delivered or services to be performed, are classified as
deferred revenue until earned.   Grants and government sponsored research revenue and contract
revenue related to research and development services are
recognized as the related services are performed based on the
performance requirements of the relevant contract. Under such
agreements, the Company is required to perform specific research
and development activities and is compensated either based on
the costs or costs plus a
mark-up
associated with each specific contract over the term of the
agreement or when certain milestones are achieved and
recoverability is reasonably assured.   Research
and Development   Research and development expenses consist of costs incurred for
company-sponsored and collaborative research and development
activities. These costs include direct and research-related
overhead expenses. The Company expenses research and development
costs, including the expenses for research under collaborative
agreements, as such costs are incurred.   Stock-Based
Compensation   Effective January1, 2006, the Company adopted the fair
value recognition provisions of SFASNo123 revised
2004, Share-Based Payment
SFAS123R, using the modified prospective
transition method. Under   
53 Table of Contents   the modified prospective transition method, prior periods are
not restated for the effect of SFAS123R. Commencing with
the first quarter of 2006, compensation cost includes all
share-based awards granted to employees and directors, including
employee stock option awards, restricted stock and employee
stock purchases made under our Employee Stock Purchase Plan
ESPP, prior to but not yet vested as of
January1, 2006, based on the grant date fair value
estimated in accordance with the original provisions of
SFASNo123, Accounting for Stock-Based
Compensation SFAS123 , and
compensation for all share-based awards granted to employees and
directors subsequent to January1, 2006, based on the grant
date fair value estimated in accordance with the provisions of
SFAS123R. The Company recognizes the fair value of its
stock option awards as compensation expense on a straight-line
basis over the requisite service period of each award, which is
generally four years. Compensation expense related to stock
options granted to employees and directors prior to
January1, 2006 is accounted for under the recognition and
measurement provisions of Accounting Principles Board Opinion
APB No25, Accounting for Stock Issued
to Employees APB 25, and related
interpretations, as permitted by SFASNo123.
Stock-based compensation to other than employees was not
impacted by the adoption of SFAS123R and is determined
in accordance with SFAS123 and EITF Issue
No96-18,
Accounting for Equity Instruments That Are Issued to Other
than Employees for Acquiring, or in Conjunction with Selling,
Goods, or Services.   Determining
Fair Value Under SFAS123R   Valuation and amortization method The Company
estimates the fair value of other than restricted stock awards
granted using the Black-Scholes option-pricing formula and a
single option award approach. The fair value of restricted stock
awards is measured at the market price of non-restricted stock
at the date of grant. This fair value is then amortized on a
straight-line basis over the requisite service periods of the
awards, which is generally the vesting period.   Expected Term The expected term of the award
represents the period that the Companys stock-based awards
are expected to be outstanding and was determined based on
historical experience, giving consideration to the contractual
terms of the stock-based awards, vesting schedules and
expectations of future employee behavior as influenced by
changes to the terms of its stock-based awards.   Expected VolatilityVolatility is a measure of
the amounts by which a financial variable such as stock price
has fluctuated historical volatility or is expected to
fluctuate expected volatility during a period. The Company
uses the historical volatility for the past 5years to
estimate expected volatility, which matches the expected term of
the option grant.   Risk-Free Interest Rate The Company bases the
risk-free interest rate used in the Black-Scholes valuation
method on the implied yield currently available on
U.S.Treasury zero-coupon issues with a remaining term
equivalent to the expected term of a stock award.   Estimated Forfeitures When estimating
forfeitures, the Company considers voluntary termination
behavior as well as analysis of actual option forfeitures.   The adoption of SFAS123R also requires additional
accounting related to income taxes. Due to the full valuation
allowance provided on its net deferred tax assets, the Company
has not recorded any tax benefit attributable to stock-based
compensation expense.   Pro Forma
Information for Periods Prior to the Adoption of
SFAS123R   Prior to the adoption of SFAS123R, the Company applied
SFAS123, amended by SFASNo148,
Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation
Transition and Disclosure SFAS148,
which allowed companies to apply the former accounting rules
under APB 25 and related interpretations. In general, as the
exercise price of options granted under the Companys plans
was equal to the market price of the underlying common stock on
the grant date, no stock-based employee compensation cost was
recognized in the Companys consolidated statement of
operations for periods prior to the adoption of
SFAS123R. As required by SFAS148 prior to the
adoption of SFAS123R, the Company provided pro forma net
loss and pro forma net loss per common share disclosures for
stock-based awards, as if the fair-value-based method defined in
SFAS123 had been applied.   
54 Table of Contents   The following table illustrates the effect on net loss and net
loss per share if the Company had applied the fair value
recognition provision of SFAS123 to options granted under
the Companys stock-based compensation plans for the year
ended December31, 2005. For purposes of this pro-forma
disclosure, the value of the options was estimated using a
Black-Scholes option pricing formula and amortized on a
straight-line basis over the respective vesting periods of the
awards in thousands, except per share data.   	
Net loss as reported     13,594     Deduct: total pro forma stock-based compensation determined
under the fair value method of all employee related stock-based
awards, net of related tax effects   8,710     Pro forma net loss     22,304     Basic and diluted net loss per share   As reported     032     Pro forma     052     The fair value of these options was estimated at the date of
grant using the Black-Scholes option pricing model with the
following weighted average assumptions   	
Risk-free interest rate   384     Dividend yield   000     Volatility factors of the expected market price of the
Companys common stock   09   Weighted average expected life of option years   401   The same assumptions were applied in the determination of the
option values related to stock options granted to non-employees,
except the option life, for which the term of the consulting
contracts was used.   Comprehensive
Income Loss   Comprehensive loss includes net loss as well as other
comprehensive income or loss. The Companys other
comprehensive income or loss consists of foreign currency
translation adjustments and unrealized gains and losses on
available-for-sale securities. Total accumulated comprehensive
income loss in the accompanying consolidated statements of
shareholders equity at December31, 2007 and 2006
consisted entirely of cumulative translation adjustments.   Net
Loss Per Share   Basic net loss per share has been calculated based on the
weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the
period. Shares used in diluted net loss per share calculations
exclude anti-dilutive common stock equivalent shares, consisting
of stock options and restricted awards. These anti-dilutive
common stock equivalent shares totaled 8,905,000, 7,402,000 and
6,644,000, at December31, 2007, 2006 and 2005,
respectively.   Income
Taxes   In June 2006, the Financial Accounting Standards Board
FASB issued Interpretation No48,
Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes an
interpretation of FASB Statement No109
FIN48. FIN48 clarifies the recognition
threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement
recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected
to be taken in a tax return. FIN48 also provides guidance
on de-recognition, classification, interest and penalties,
accounting in interim periods, disclosure and transition. As a
result of the implementation of FIN48 on January1,
2007, the Company recognized no material adjustment in the
liability for unrecognized income tax benefits.   The Company recognizes interest and penalties related to
uncertain tax positions in income tax expense. For the year
ended December31, 2007, the Company did not recognize any
interest or penalties related to uncertain tax positions in the
consolidated statements of operations, and at December31,
2007, the Company had no accrued interest or penalties.   
55 Table of Contents   Recent
Accounting Pronouncements   In September 2006, the FASB issued SFASNo157,
Fair Value Measurements SFAS157.
SFAS157 defines fair value, establishes a framework for
measuring fair value in generally accepted accounting
principles, and expands disclosures about fair value
measurements. SFAS157 does not require any new fair value
measurements, rather, it applies under existing accounting
pronouncements that require or permit fair value measurements.
SFAS157 is effective for fiscal years beginning after
November15, 2007. The Company will adopt SFAS157 as
required. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of
SFAS157 on its consolidated financial statements.   In February 2007, the FASB issued SFASNo159,
The Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and Financial
Liabilities Including an Amendment of FASB Statement
No115 SFAS159. The fair value
option established by SFAS159 permits all entities to
choose to measure eligible items at fair value at specified
election dates. A business entity will report unrealized gains
and losses on items for which the fair value option has been
elected in earnings or another performance indicator if the
business entity does not report earnings at each subsequent
reporting date. The fair value option: amay be applied
instrument by instrument, with a few exceptions, such as
investments otherwise accounted for by the equity method;
bis irrevocable unless a new election date occurs; and
cis applied only to entire instruments and not to
portions of instruments. SFAS159 is effective as of the
beginning of fiscal years beginning after November15,
2007. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of
SFAS159 on its consolidated financial statements.   In December 2007, the FASB issued SFASNo, 141revised
2007, Business Combinations
SFAS141R. SFAS141R will
significantly change the accounting for business combinations in
a number of areas including the treatment of contingent
consideration, contingencies, acquisition costs, in-process
research and development and restructuring costs. In addition,
under SFAS141R, changes in deferred tax asset valuation
allowances and acquired income tax uncertainties in a business
combination after the measurement period will impact income tax
expense. SFAS141R is effective for fiscal years
beginning after December15, 2008, and earlier application
is prohibited. Accordingly, any business combinations the
Company engages in will be recorded and disclosed following
existing generally accepted accounting principles until
January1, 2009, when the Company will adopt this standard.
The Company expects SFAS141R will have an impact on
accounting for business combinations once adopted, but the
effect is dependent upon acquisitions at that time.   In December 2007, the FASB issued SFASNo160,
Noncontrolling Interests in Consolidated Financial
Statements, an amendment of ARB No51
SFAS160. SFAS160 will change the
accounting and reporting for minority interests, which will be
recharacterized as noncontrolling interests and classified as a
component of equity. This new consolidation method will
significantly change the accounting for transactions with
minority interest holders. SFAS160 is effective for fiscal
years beginning after December15, 2008, and, as such, the
Company will adopt this standard in fiscal 2009. The effect of
adopting this standard is dependent upon the extent, if any, of
noncontrolling financial interests at that time.   
2.
Segment
and Significant Concentrations   The Company and its wholly owned subsidiaries operate in one
business segment.   The Company currently sells its products through its direct
sales force and through third-party distributors. For the years
ended December31, 2007 and 2006, there was one customer
that accounted for 36% and 58% of total products sales,
respectively. For the year ended December31, 2005, there
were two direct customers that represented 61% and 12% of total
product sales. The Company has distribution agreements with
several companies to distribute products in the U.S.and
has several regional distribution arrangements throughout
Europe, Japan   
56 Table of Contents   South Korea, China, Mexico and other parts of the world. The
following table provides a breakdown of product sales by
geographic region for the three years ended December31,
2007, 2006 and 2005

than 10% of the Companys total revenues, total net assets
or total net property, plant and equipment in any period
presented.   Concentration
of Credit Risk   Financial instruments that potentially subject the Company to
concentrations of credit risk consist principally of bank
deposits and accounts receivable. The Company maintains its
portfolio of cash equivalents in short-term commercial paper,
auction rate securities and money market funds. The
Companys accounts receivable are derived primarily from
sales to customers. The Company performs ongoing credit
evaluations of its customers and limits the amount of credit
extended when deemed necessary, but generally requires no
collateral. In addition, the Company maintains an allowance for
potential doubtful accounts.   There was one customer whose accounts receivable balance
represented 22% of total receivables as of December31,
2007 and 35% of total receivables as of December31, 2006.
The Company relies on several companies as its sole source for
various materials used in its manufacturing process. Any
extended interruption in the supply of these materials could
result in the failure to meet customer demand.

Patent
License Agreements   In April 2004, the Company entered into a patent license
agreement with Applera, through its Applied Biosystems Group
ABI and its Celera Diagnostics joint venture, for
a non-exclusive worldwide license to make, use, and sell the
Companys products incorporating technology covered by
Applera patents. The Company also entered into a patent license
agreement with Roche, effective July1, 2004, for a
non-exclusive worldwide license to make, use, and sell the
Companys products incorporating technology covered by
Roche patents. Under the license agreements, the Company agreed
to pay aggregate license fees of $322million, of which
$235million was paid as of December31, 2005 and
$87million was paid in 2006. In connection with the
license agreements, the Company recorded intangible assets of
$311million, representing the present value of license
fee obligations which is net of imputed interest of
$11million. The effective interest rate used to calculate
the present value of the discounted payments was 40% for both
the Roche and Applera licenses. In June 2006, the Applera patent
license agreement was expanded to include additional Company
products, for which the Company paid an additional
$05million. The intangible assets related to the Applera
and Roche licenses are amortized on a straight-line basis over
their useful lives of approximately 10 and 15years,
respectively, with the amortization recorded as part of the cost
of product sales. The Company also paid approximately
$12million in back royalties related to the Applera
license, which was expensed during the quarter ended
March31, 2004.   The Company also agreed to pay Applera and Roche ongoing
royalties on sales of any products incorporating the licensed
patents. Resulting product royalties are recorded as part of the
cost of product sales when the related product sales are
recognized.   In September 2005, the Company entered into a license agreement
with Abaxis, Inc. Abaxis, pursuant to which Abaxis
granted the Company a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-bearing
license to certain Abaxis patents relating to lyophilization
technology in accordance with the provisions specified in the
agreement. Under the agreement, the Company will be able to
make, distribute and sell products for nucleic acid based
amplification   
57 Table of Contents   assays. In exchange for the license rights, the Company agreed
to imake an upfront license payment of
$05million, iipay royalties during the term of
the agreement and iiipay a yearly license maintenance
fee during the term of the agreement, which fee will be
creditable against any royalties due during such calendar year.   In November 2005, Cepheid entered into a license agreement with
DxS Limited DxS, a private United Kingdom based
company, pursuant to which DxS granted Cepheid a non-exclusive,
worldwide, royalty-bearing license to the DxS Scorpions patents
and other intellectual property rights relating to its Scorpions
technology for the real-time PCR detection of nucleic acid
amplification. This amends a December 2004 agreement, which
provided for license rights to develop and commercialize license
technology in the environmental, veterinarian, forensics
identity relationship testing, and agricultural fields. Under
the Agreement, and subject to certain limitations set forth
therein, Cepheid will be able to use the licensed rights to
develop and sell assay products incorporating the licensed
technology in the human invitro diagnostics field.   In September 2006, Cepheid entered into a sublicense agreement
with Abbott Laboratories Abbott, pursuant to which
Abbott granted Cepheid a non-exclusive, world-wide,
non-transferable right to Abbotts exclusive license to
certain patents from the Baylor College of Medicine. Under this
sublicense agreement, the Company will be able to make, use,
distribute and sell products incorporating the patented
technology generally characterized as multiple genomic DNA
amplification for deletion detection. In September 2006, Cepheid
also entered into a license agreement with Abbott, pursuant to
which Abbott granted Cepheid a non-exclusive, world-wide,
non-transferable right to a certain Abbott patent. Under this
license agreement, the Company will be able to make, use,
distribute and sell products incorporating the patented
technology generally characterized as detection of cervical
chlamydia trachomatis infection. License payments for these
agreements totaled $20million. The intangible assets
related to these sublicenses are amortized on a straight-line
basis over their useful lives of approximately 7 and
9years, respectively, with the amortization recorded as
part of the cost of product sales.   In January 2007, Cepheid entered into a sublicense agreement
with bioMerieux SA, pursuant to which bioMerieux SA granted
Cepheid a non-exclusive, worldwide, irrevocable sublicense to
certain patents that relate to the diagnosis of methicillin
resistant staphylococcus aureus. The patents are owned by Kainos
Laboratories Inc. and Professor Keiichi Hiramatsu and have been
exclusively licensed to bioMerieux SA with the right for
bioMerieux SA to sub-license. Under the sublicense agreement,
and subject to certain limitations set forth therein, Cepheid is
able to use the licensed rights to develop and sell products for
use in connection with its GeneXpert and SmartCycler platforms.
In exchange for such rights, Cepheid agreed to pay an initial
license fee of approximately $40million and quarterly
royalties based on net product sales during the term of the
sublicense agreement, which expires when the last of the patents
licensed under the agreement expires. The license fee was paid
in the first quarter of 2007 and is being amortized on a
straight-line basis over the useful life of approximately
9years, with the amortization recorded as part of the cost
of product sales.

Collaboration
Profit Sharing   Collaboration profit sharing represents the amount that the
Company pays to ABI under our collaboration agreement to develop
reagents for use in the Biohazard Detection System
BDS developed for the United States Postal Service
USPS. Under the agreement, computed gross margin
on anthrax cartridge sales are shared equally between the two
parties. As of December31, 2007 and 2006, the accrued
profit sharing liability was $05million and
$35million, respectively. Collaboration profit sharing
expense was $123million, $150million and
$145million for the years ended December31, 2007,
2006 and 2005. The total revenues and cost of sales related to
these cartridge sales are included in the respective balances in
the consolidated statement of operations.   
5.
Collaborative
Agreements and Contracts   bioMerieux,
Inc.   In December 2003, the Company entered into an agreement with
bioMerieux, Inc. for bioMerieux to develop DNA testing products
using its proprietary nucleic acid sequence-based amplification
technology to be run on systems employing the Companys
GeneXpert systems. Under the agreement, bioMerieux has paid the
Company a $100million license fee, and an additional
$50million payment will become due when and if bioMerieux
commercializes its first product based on our technology. The
Company may also receive potential product   
58 Table of Contents   purchases and royalty payments on end-user GeneXpert test
cartridge sales under the agreement. The $100million
license fee received from bioMerieux was deferred and is being
amortized over the period of approximately five years, which
represents the estimated period of our continuing involvement
under this agreement.   Infectio
Diagnostic, Inc./GeneOhm Sciences, Inc.   In November 2003, the Company entered into a series of
agreements with Infectio Diagnostics, Inc. IDI.
IDI merged with GeneOhm Sciences, Inc. in 2004. GeneOhm
Sciences, Inc. was acquired by Becton, Dickson and Company

Equipment
Financing and Line of Credit   In November 2004, the Company entered into an agreement with a
financial lending institution for a revolving line of credit
totaling $40million of which up to $20million
could be used for letters of credit. The agreement was
subsequently amended in May 2005 to increase the existing line
of credit to $43million and to add an equipment financing
line of $30million. The equipment line of credit and
revolving line of credit were collateralized by the
Companys accounts receivable, certain equipment, tenant
improvements, or other personal property of the Company financed
pursuant to the agreement, and bore an annual interest rate, at
the Companys option, equal to the lenders prime rate
or LIBOR plus 25% per annum. After being extended in November
2006, the agreement matured in February 2007. As of
December31, 2006 and 2007, the Company had no balance
outstanding under the revolving or equipment line of credit.   The Company also financed a portion of its equipment purchases
under an equipment financing agreement with another financial
lending institution. The equipment loans under this financing
arrangement were to be repaid over 36 to 48months at
interest rates ranging from 74% to 99% and were secured by the
related equipment. As of December31, 2007 and 2006, the
balance outstanding totaled $0 and $03million,
respectively.

Acquisitions   Sangtec   On February14, 2007, Cepheid completed the purchase of
100% of the outstanding stock of Sangtec, a company located in
Bromma, Sweden, from Nycomed-owned Altana Technology Projects
GmbH. Sangtec was a broad-based PCR molecular diagnostics
company that developed and manufactured products for
standardized nucleic acid testing of infectious diseases. The
acquisition brought Cepheid the ability to provide a line of
products for potential use in managing infections of
immuno-compromised patients, a research and development
operation to develop and expand its clinical test products, and
a reagent manufacturing base in Europe. Subsequent to the
acquisition, Sangtecs name was changed to Cepheid AB.   The acquisition was accounted for as a purchase transaction in
accordance with SFASNo141, Business
Combinations, and accordingly, the tangible and intangible
assets acquired and liabilities assumed were recorded at their
estimated fair value at the date of the acquisition. The
aggregate purchase price of the acquisition was approximately
$275million, including $267million cash net of
$06million cash acquired and $08million

considered, among other factors, its intention for future use of
the acquired assets, analyses of historical financial
performance and estimates of future performance of
Sangtecs products. The fair value of intangible assets was
based in part on a valuation completed by a third-party
valuation firm using a discounted cash flow and income
approaches and other valuation techniques, as well as estimates
and assumptions provided by the Company. The acquired intangible
assets consisted of the following

subsidiary, Cepheid SA, purchased 100% of the stock of
Actigenics, a French micro RNA research and services company.
The acquisition gave Cepheid direct access to micro RNA markers
used in diagnostic and therapeutic products and the related
discovery, validation and development processes. Cepheid paid
$12million in cash. In addition, Cepheid assumed
approximately $07million of liabilities, and acquired
$02million of tangible assets.   
61 Table of Contents   Of the $12million paid, $07million represented
deferred prepaid compensation expense to be recognized over a
service period of three years from the August 2006 acquisition
date. This deferred compensation expense is being amortized on a
straight line basis.   The acquisition was accounted for as a purchase transaction in
accordance with SFAS141, and accordingly, the tangible and
intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed were recorded
at their estimated fair value at the date of the acquisition.
The results of Actigenics operations have been included in the

Commitments,
Contingencies and Legal Matters   Facility
Leases   The Company leases its Sunnyvale, California headquarters under
two operating leases. The primary lease expires in March 2012
and provides for a three percent annual base rent increase. In
connection with this lease agreement, the Company obtained an
irrevocable standby letter of credit collateralized by a
certificate of deposit, which has been classified as restricted
cash on the consolidated balance sheet. In April 2007, the
Company entered into a sublease of additional office and
manufacturing space that expires in September 2009. In December
2005, the Company also entered into a lease for additional
warehouse space that expires in September 2010. In May 2005, the
Company entered into a facility lease for a research and
development center in Bothell, Washington that expires in August
2011. In Bromma, Sweden, the Company leases office and
manufacturing space pursuant to a lease that expires in December
2009. Minimum annual rental commitments under facility operating
leases at December31, 2007 are as follows in thousands

and 2005 was $26million, $19million and
$17million, respectively.   
62 Table of Contents   Contingencies   The Company responds to claims arising in the ordinary course of
business. In certain cases, management has accrued estimates of
the amounts it expects to pay upon resolution of such matters,
and such amounts are included in other accrued liabilities.
Should the Company not be able to secure the terms it expects,
these estimates may change and will be recognized in the period
in which they are identified. Although the ultimate outcome of
such claims is not presently determinable, management believes
that the resolution of these matters will not have a material
adverse effect on the Companys financial position, results
of operations and cash flows.   Legal
Matters   A complaint filed on December22, 2005, in the United
States District Court for the District of Utah by Idaho
Technology, Inc. Idaho Technology and University
of Utah Research Foundation was served on the Company in March
2006. The complaint alleged that the Company infringed certain
patents licensed by the University of Utah Research Foundation
to Idaho Technology.   On January2, 2007, the Company entered into a Settlement
and Cross-License Agreement the Settlement
Agreement with Idaho Technology regarding certain Company
and Idaho Technology intellectual property the
Intellectual Property. The Settlement Agreement
provided that the parties dismiss with prejudice litigation
related to the Intellectual Property. In addition, the
Settlement Agreement provides each of the parties with a
non-exclusive, worldwide, fully paid, non-terminable,
irrevocable license to certain of the others patents for
use in their respective lines of products and contains certain
covenants by each of the parties not to sue the other. Pursuant
to the Settlement Agreement, the Company made a payment of
$335million to Idaho Technology in January 2007. As of
December31, 2006, the settlement amount was accrued and
recorded as an expense in the consolidated statement of
operations. Although the Company believed it would not be held
liable for infringement had the issue ultimately gone to
litigation, it came to the conclusion to settle the litigation.
The Company made the Settlement Agreement and payment to avoid
incurring significant legal costs to defend its case. The
Companys belief that it did not infringe Idaho
Technologys patents was based on the Companys
detailed legal analysis by outside counsel that the patents
referenced in the litigation were either not being infringed
and/or that
the patents referenced were potentially invalid, due to prior
art not specified or referenced in the patents. Due to the fact
that the Company did not believe there to be any validity to the
patent infringement case, it did not ascribe any value to future
product sales and recorded the whole amount as a fiscal 2006
expense.

options ISOs and non-qualified stock options
NQSOs, restricted stock awards RSAs,
stock bonus awards SBAs, stock appreciation rights
SARs, restricted stock units RSUs
and performance share awards PSAs. ISOs may be

for a stock option or a SAR this ratio shall remain 1:1. The
2006 Plan is administered by the Compensation Committee of the
Board Committee. The following provides a general
description of each type of award under the 2006 Plan.   Stock options may be granted at no less than the fair
market value per share of common stock on the date of the grant
at 110% of fair market value for ISOs granted to 10%
shareholders, expire not later than 7years from the date
of grant 5years from the date of grant for ISOs granted
to 10% shareholders and generally vest 25% one year after the
date of grant and then on a pro rata basis over the following
36months.   RSAs may be granted at a purchase price that is less than
fair market value on the date of grant, and the restrictions are
determined by the Committee and may be based on years of service
with the Company or completion of performance goals during a
period. The Committee will determine the extent that the RSA is
earned prior to the payment for the shares awarded.   SBAs may be granted for past or future services and may
contain restrictions based on years of service with the Company
or completion of performance goals during a period. No payment
will be required for shares awarded under an SBA. Payments to
recipients of an SBA may be in the form of cash, shares of
common stock, or a combination thereof, based on the fair market
value of shares earned under the SBA. The Committee will
determine the number of shares to be awarded under the SBA and
the extent that the SBA is earned prior to the payment for the
shares awarded.   SARs are awards for past or future services that may be
settled in cash or shares of common stock, including restricted
stock, having a value equal to the number of shares subject to
the SAR multiplied by the difference between the fair market
value on the date of grant and the exercise price. The Committee
determines the terms of each SAR, including the number of shares
of common stock subject to the SAR, the exercise price and the
times during which the SAR may be settled, consideration to be
made on settlement, and effect of the participants
termination. If SARs are awarded based on performance goals, the
Committee will determine the extent that the SAR is earned. SARs
may be granted at an exercise price that may be less than fair
market value per share of common stock on the date of grant, may
be exercisable at one time or from time to time, and have a term
not to exceed seven years.   RSUs are awards for past or future services that may be
settled in cash or shares of common stock, including restricted
stock. The Committee determines the terms of each RSU, including
the number of shares of common stock subject to the RSU, the
times during which the RSU may be settled, consideration to be
made on settlement, and effect of the participants
termination. If RSUs are awarded based on performance goals, the
Committee will determine the extent that the RSU is earned. The
number of shares subject to the RSU may be fixed or may vary   
64 Table of Contents   depending on in accordance with performance goals as determined
by the Committee. While the RSU shall be paid currently, under
certain circumstances the Committee may permit the participant
to defer settlement of the RSU.   PSAs are awards denominated in shares of common stock
that may be settled in cash or issuance of such shares which
may consist of restricted stock. The Committee will determine
the terms of each PSA, including the number of shares of common
stock subject to the PSA, the performance factors and period
that shall determine the time and extent to which each PSA shall
be settled, consideration to be made on settlement, and effect
of the participants termination. The Committee will
determine the extent that the PSA is earned. The number of
shares subject to the PSA may be fixed or may vary depending on
in accordance with performance goals as determined by the
Committee.   Pursuant to the Change of Control Retention and Severance
Agreements between the Company and its executives, in the event
of an executives termination upon a change of control, all
of the executives outstanding stock options granted by the
Company to the executive prior to the change of control shall
become fully vested and exercisable immediately prior to the
effective date of the termination upon a change of control.
Approximately 10million shares of the executive options
outstanding were remeasured at various dates in 2003 and 2002,
the dates of the modification, for the change in control
provision. Such remeasured shares, if outstanding at the time of
a change in control, would result in additional stock-based
compensation recorded at that time. The amount of such
additional stock-based compensation would not be significant.   A summary of option activity under all plans is as follows

maximum of 15% of compensation through payroll deductions during
defined offering periods. The price at which stock is purchased
under the ESPP is equal to 85% of the fair market value of the
common stock on the first or last day of the offering period,
whichever is lower. The number of shares available for future
issuance increase annually equal to the lesser of
200,000shares, 075% of the outstanding shares on the date
of the annual increase or a lesser amount determined by the
Board.   Non-Employee
Director Stock Options   In March 2000, the Company adopted the Directors Plan and
reserved a total of 200,000shares of common stock for
issuance thereunder. Each non-employee director who becomes a
director of the Company will be automatically granted a NQSO to
purchase 15,000shares of common stock on the date on which
such person first becomes a director. At the first board meeting
following each annual shareholders meeting, beginning with the
first board meeting after the first annual shareholders
meeting, each non-employee director then in office for over six
months will automatically be granted a NQSO to purchase
5,000shares of common stock. The exercise price of options
under the Directors Plan will be equal to the fair market
value of the common stock on the date of the grant. The term of
these options is 10years.   In May 2003, the Directors Plan was terminated pursuant to
amendments to the 1997 Plan approved by the Board and the
shareholders. Upon the termination of the Directors Plan,
no further options were granted under the Directors Plan,
and all shares then reserved for issuance under the
Directors Plan that were not subject to outstanding
options granted under the Directors Plan became reserved
and available for issuance under the 1997 Plan. Options and
shares granted or issued under the Directors Plan that
were outstanding on the date the Directors Plan was
terminated will remain subject to the terms of the
Directors Plan. After the Directors Plan was
terminated, any shares subject to options issued under the
Directors Plan that cease to be subject to the options for
any reason other than option exercise, and any shares issued
under the Directors Plan that are repurchased by the
Company or forfeited, become available for grant under the 1997
Plan. Under the 1997 Plan, as amended, new non-employee
directors will receive nondiscretionary, automatic grants of
options to purchase 15,000shares of the common stock upon
joining the Board, and the continuing non-employee directors
will receive nondiscretionary, automatic grants of options to
purchase 7,500shares of common stock each year after the
annual meeting of shareholders.   On April27, 2006, the 1997 Plan was terminated and
replaced by the 2006 Plan. Under the 2006 Plan, non-employee
directors will automatically be granted NQSOs to purchase
25,000shares of common stock upon initial election or
appointment to the Board, which vest and become exercisable in
equal amounts on each of three annual anniversary dates of the
grant date as long as the director remains on the Board. On the
date of the first Board meeting following each annual
shareholder meeting each non-employee director then in office
for longer than six months will automatically be granted NQSOs
to purchase 12,500shares of common stock, which vest and
become exercisable on the one-year anniversary from the grant
date as long as the director remains on the Board. The Board may
also make discretionary grants to purchase common stock to any
non-employee director that vest and become exercisable as
determined by the Board. On April27, 2006, the Board
granted an option under the 2006 Plan to purchase
10,000shares of common stock at $918 per share to a
non-employee director who became a member of the Board in
February 2006. Such option vests and becomes exercisable in
equal amounts on each of three annual anniversary dates of the
grant date as long as the director remains on the Board. The
exercise price of non-employee director options will be equal to
the fair market value of the common stock on the date of the
grant.

adoption of SFAS123R, the Company recorded stock-based
compensation in accordance with APB 25 when the option price was
less than the fair market value. As of December31, 2003,
all deferred compensation previously recognized had been
amortized to expense. The following table is a summary of the
major categories of stock compensation expense recognized in
accordance with SFAS123R for the year ended
December31, 2007 and 2006 in thousands.   	
Years Ended December31   2007   2006   Cost of product sales     794     584   Research and development   4,294   2,839   Selling, general and administrative   6,032   3,907   Total stock-based compensation cost     11,120     7,330   The impact on 2007 and 2006 basic and diluted net loss per share
resulting from the adoption of SFAS123R was $020 and
$014, respectively.   
68 Table of Contents   The above stock-based compensation cost includes
$15million and $11million related to ESPP for 2007
and 2006, respectively. In addition, stock-based compensation
cost of approximately $05million and $02million
was included in inventory as of December31, 2007 and 2006,
respectively.   In December 2007, the Company entered into a separation and
consulting agreement with John R. Sluis, the Companys
former Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Under
the terms of the agreement, during the twelve months following
December31, 2007, Mr.Sluis is to provide consulting
services to the Company up to a predetermined number of hours.
During the twelve-month period ending December31, 2008,
unvested options previously granted to Mr.Sluis will
continue to vest according to the schedules set forth in each
such option. At the conclusion of the consulting period,
provided Mr.Sluis has completed his duties to the
satisfaction of the Companys Chief Executive Officer, an
additional 24,000 then-unvested shares that are subject to such
options will become vested and exercisable. As a result of the
modification of Mr.Sluis existing options, the
Company recorded additional stock- based compensation of
$08million in 2007. In addition, Mr.Sluis will
continue to receive his existing salary on the effective date of
his retirement of $03million for his consulting services,
which was accrued and recorded as an expense in 2007.   As of December31, 2007, the total compensation cost
related to unvested stock-based grants awarded under the
Companys 1997 Plan and 2006 Plan but not yet recognized
was approximately $207million, which is net of estimated
forfeitures of $39million. This cost will be amortized on
a straight line basis over a weighted average period of
approximately 273years and will be adjusted for
subsequent changes in estimated forfeitures.   At December31, 2007, the total compensation cost related
to options to purchase the Companys common shares under
the ESPP but not yet recognized was approximately
$09million. The cost will be amortized on a straight-line
basis over the two year offering period, as such term is defined
in the ESPP.

Employee
Benefit Plan   Effective January1, 1998, the Company adopted a 401k
plan that allows eligible employees to contribute a percentage
of their qualified compensation subject to IRS limits. The
Company has the discretion to make matching contributions each
year. Contributions made by the Company for the years ended
December31, 2007, 2006 and 2005 were $02million,
$0, and $0, respectively.   
11.
Income
Taxes   The Company has no U.S.federal or state income tax
provision for any period as it has incurred operating losses in
all periods. Income tax expense of $02million in 2007
represents current foreign income taxes related to our French
subsidiary, and no foreign income taxes were recorded in 2006 or
2005.   The Company has substantially concluded all U.S.federal
income tax matters for years through December31, 2002. For
federal income tax purposes, the open years are from 1996
through 2007 due to net operating loss carryforwards relating to
these years. Substantially all material state, local and foreign
income tax matters have been concluded for years through
December31, 2001. For California state income tax
purposes, the open years are from 1997 through 2007 due to
either research credit carryovers or net operating loss
carryforwards.   The Company anticipates that the total unrecognized tax benefits
will not significantly change due to the settlement of audits
and the expiration of statute of limitations prior to
December31, 2008.   
69 Table of Contents   Deferred income taxes reflect the net tax effect of temporary
differences between the carrying amounts of assets and
liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts
used for income tax purposes. Significant components of the
Companys deferred tax assets are as follows in thousands   	
December31   2007   2006   Net operating loss carryforwards     45,272     43,811   Capitalized research and development costs   1,384   1,855   Research and other credit carryforwards   7,105   8,489   Accruals and reserves   414   335   Stock option compensation   5,031   2,074   Other   3,951   3,401   Total deferred tax assets   63,157   59,965   Valuation allowance for deferred tax assets   59,893     59,965     Deferred tax liability   3,264        Net deferred tax assets             Realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon future
earnings, if any, the timing and amount of which are uncertain.
Accordingly, the net deferred tax assets have been fully offset
by a valuation allowance. The valuation allowance decreased by
approximately $01million and increased by
$176million and $55million during the years ended
December31, 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively.   As of December31, 2007, the Company had net operating loss
carryforwards for federal income tax purposes of approximately
$1248million, which expire in the years 2011 through
2027, and federal research and development tax credits of
approximately $41million, which expire in the years 2012
through 2026. As of December31, 2007, the Company had net
operating loss carryforwards for state income tax purposes of
approximately $472million, which expire in the years 2011
through 2017, and state research and development tax credits of
approximately $29million, which have no expiration date.   Utilization of the Companys net operating loss may be
subject to a substantial annual limitation due to ownership
change limitations provided by the Internal Revenue Code and
similar state provisions. Such annual limitation may result in
the expiration of net operating loss before utilization.   Undistributed earnings of the Companys foreign
subsidiaries of approximately $14million and
$05million at December31, 2007 and 2006,
respectively, are considered to be indefinitely reinvested, and,
accordingly, no provisions for federal and state income taxes
have been provided thereon. Upon distribution of those earnings
in the form of dividends or otherwise, the Company would be
subject to both federal income taxes, subject to an adjustment
for foreign income tax credit, and withholding taxes payable to
various foreign countries. The distribution of such foreign
earnings to the U.S.parent would have no U.S.tax
impact as the net operating loss carryforwards exceed the
undistributed earnings.   The following table summarizes the activity related to our
unrecognized tax benefits in thousands   	
Balance at January1, 2007     200   Increase related to current year tax positions   673   Increase for tax positions of prior years   2,802   Balance at December31., 2007     3,675   All of the unrecognized tax benefits would affect our effective
tax rate if recognized, before consideration of certain
valuation allowances.
