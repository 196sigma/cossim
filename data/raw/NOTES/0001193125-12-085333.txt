SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES 
Description of BusinessFARO Technologies, Inc. and its subsidiaries
collectively the Company or FARO design, develop, manufacture, market and support software-based three-dimensional measurement and imaging systems for manufacturing, industrial, building construction and forensic
applications. The Companys principal products include the FaroArm, FARO Laser ScanArm and FARO Gage, all articulated electromechanical measuring devices, and the FARO Laser Tracker ION, FARO Focus3D and FARO 3D Imager AMP, all laser-based measuring devices. Markets
for the Companys products include automobile, aerospace, heavy equipment, and law enforcement agencies. The Company sells the vast majority of its products through a direct sales force located in many of the worlds largest industrialized
countries. Principles of ConsolidationThe consolidated financial statements of the Company include the
accounts of FARO Technologies, Inc. and all of its subsidiaries. All intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated. The financial statements of the Companys foreign subsidiaries are translated into U.S. dollars using exchange
rates in effect at period-end for assets and liabilities and average exchange rates during each reporting period for results of operations. Adjustments resulting from financial statement translations are reflected as a separate component of
accumulated other comprehensive income. Revenue Recognition, Product Warranty and Extended Maintenance
ContractsRevenue related to the Companys measurement systems integrated combinations of a measurement device, a computer and software loaded on the computer and the measurement device is generally recognized upon shipment, as
the Company considers the earnings process substantially complete as of the shipping date. The Company warrants its products against defects in design, materials and workmanship for one year. A provision for estimated future costs relating to
warranty expense is recorded when products are shipped. The Company separately sells one and three year extended warranties. Extended warranty revenues are recognized on a straight-line basis over the term of the warranty. Costs relating to extended
maintenance plans are recognized as incurred. Revenue from sales of software only is recognized when no further significant production, modification or customization of the software is required and when the following criteria are met: persuasive
evidence of a sales agreement exists, delivery has occurred, and the sales price is fixed or determinable and deemed collectible. Revenues resulting from sales of comprehensive support, training and technology consulting services are recognized as
such services are performed and are deferred when billed in advance of the performance of services. Revenue from the licensing agreements for the use of the Companys technology for medical applications is generally recognized as licensees use
the technology. Amounts representing royalties for the current year and not received as of year-end are estimated as due based on historical data and recognized in the current year. 
Cash and Cash EquivalentsThe Company considers cash on hand and amounts on deposit with financial institutions with
maturities of three months or less when purchased to be cash and cash equivalents. The Company had deposits with foreign banks totaling $37,531 and $34,763 as of December31, 2011 and 2010, respectively. The Company does not intend to
repatriate those funds. 
41 Table of Contents
Accounts Receivable and Related Allowance for Doubtful AccountsCredit
is extended to customers based on an evaluation of a customers financial condition and, generally, collateral is not required. Accounts receivable are generally due within 30 to 90 days and are stated at amounts due from customers net of an
allowance for doubtful accounts. Accounts outstanding longer than the contractual payment terms are considered past due. The Company makes judgments as to the collectability of accounts receivable based on historical trends and future expectations.
Management estimates an allowance for doubtful accounts, which adjusts gross trade accounts receivable to its net realizable value. The allowance for doubtful accounts is based on an analysis of all receivables for possible impairment issues and
historical write-off percentages. The Company writes off accounts receivable when they become uncollectible, and payments subsequently received on such receivables are credited to the allowance for doubtful accounts. The Company does not generally
charge interest on past due receivables. InventoriesInventories are stated at the lower of cost or net
realizable value using the first-in first-out method. Shipping and handling costs are classified as a component of cost of sales in the consolidated statements of operations. Sales demonstration inventory is comprised of measuring devices utilized
by sales representatives to present the Companys products to customers. These products remain in sales demonstration inventory for approximately 6 to 12 months and are subsequently sold at prices that produce slightly reduced gross margins.
Service inventory is comprised of inventory that is not expected to be sold within twelve months, such as training and loaned equipment. Property and EquipmentProperty and equipment purchases exceeding a thousand dollars are capitalized and recorded at cost. Depreciation is computed using the straight-line method over
the estimated useful lives of the various classes of assets as follows:  Machinery and equipment 2 to 5 years
Furniture and fixtures 3 to 10 years
Leasehold improvements are amortized on a straight-line basis over the lesser of the life of the asset or
the remaining term of the lease, not to exceed 7 years. Depreciation expense was $5,394, $4,842 and $4,143 in 2011, 2010 and
2009, respectively. Accelerated methods of depreciation are used for income tax purposes in contrast to book purposes, and as a result, appropriate provisions are made for the related deferred income taxes. 
Goodwill and IntangiblesGoodwill represents the excess cost of a business acquisition over the fair value of the net
assets acquired. Indefinite-life identifiable intangible assets and goodwill are not amortized but are tested for impairment. The Company performs an annual review in the fourth quarter of each year, or more frequently if indicators of potential
impairment exist, to determine if the carrying value of the recorded goodwill or indefinite lived intangible assets is impaired. If an asset is impaired, the difference between the value of the asset reflected on the financial statements and its
current fair value is recognized as an expense in the period in which the impairment occurs. The Company first performs a
qualitative assessment to determine whether it is necessary to perform the two-step goodwill impairment test. If the Company believes, as a result of its qualitative assessment, that it is not more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting
unit is less than its carrying amount, then the first and second steps of the goodwill impairment test are unnecessary. The Company elected to early adopt this accounting guidance at the beginning of its fourth quarter of 2011 on a prospective basis
for goodwill impairment tests. 
42 Table of Contents
If necessary, the goodwill impairment test is applied using a two-step approach. In
performing the first step, the Company calculates the fair values of the reporting units using discounted cash flows DCF of each reporting unit. If the carrying amount of the reporting unit exceeds the fair market value, the second
step is performed to measure the amount of the impairment loss, if any. In the second step, the implied fair value of the goodwill is estimated as the fair value of the reporting unit as calculated in the first step, less the fair values of the net
tangible and intangible assets of the reporting unit other than goodwill. If the carrying amount of goodwill exceeds its implied fair market value, an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess, not to exceed the carrying amount
of the goodwill. Management has concluded there was no goodwill impairment in the years ended December31, 2011, 2010 and 2009. Other intangible assets principally include patents, existing product technology and customer relationships that arose in connection with the Companys acquisition of iQvolution AG and Dimensional
Photonics International. Other intangible assets are recorded at fair value at the date of acquisition and are amortized over their estimated useful lives of 3 to 20 years. Product technology and patents are recorded at cost. Amortization is computed using the straight-line method over the lives of the patents. 
Long-Lived AssetsLong-lived assets, other than goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets, are evaluated for
impairment when events or changes in business circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not be fully recoverable. Management has concluded that there was no impairment of these assets for the years ended December31,
2011, 2010 and 2009. Research and DevelopmentResearch and development costs incurred in the discovery of
new knowledge and the resulting translation of this new knowledge into plans and designs for new products, prior to the attainment of the related products technological feasibility, are recorded as expenses in the period incurred. 
Reserve for WarrantiesThe Company establishes a liability for the twelve-month warranties included with its products
by the creation of a warranty reserve, which is an estimate of the repair expenses likely to be incurred for the remaining period of the warranty measured in installation-months in each major product group. Warranty reserve is reflected in accrued
liabilities in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. The warranty expense is estimated by determining the total repair expenses for each product group in the period and determining a rate of repair expense per installation month and included
in Cost of Sales-Service in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations. This repair rate is multiplied by the number of installation-months of warranty for each product group sold during the period to determine the provision for warranty
expenses for the period. The Company evaluates its exposure to warranty costs at the end of each period using the estimated expense per installation month for each major product group, the number of units remaining under warranty, and the remaining
number of months each unit will be under warranty. While such expenses have historically been within its expectations, the Company cannot guarantee this will continue in the future. 
Income TaxesThe Company reviews its deferred tax assets on a regular basis to evaluate their recoverability based
upon expected future reversals of deferred tax liabilities, projections of future taxable income, and tax planning strategies that the Company might employ to utilize such assets, including net operating loss carryforwards. Based on the positive and
negative evidence for recoverability, the Company establishes a valuation allowance against the net deferred tax assets of a taxing jurisdiction in which the Company operates unless it is more likely than not that the Company will
recover such assets through the above means. In the future, the Companys evaluation of the need for the valuation allowance will be significantly influenced by the Companys ability to achieve profitability and the Companys ability
to predict and achieve future projections of taxable income over a two-year period. 
43 Table of Contents
The Company recognizes tax benefits related to uncertain tax positions only if it is more
likely than not the tax position will be sustained upon examination by taxing authorities. For those positions where there is less than a 50% likelihood that a tax benefit will be sustained, no tax benefit has been recognized in the financial
statements. In the ordinary course of business, the Company and its subsidiaries are examined by various federal, state, and foreign tax authorities. The Company regularly assesses the potential outcomes of these examinations and any future
examinations for the current or prior years in determining the adequacy of its provision for income taxes. Fair Value
of Financial InstrumentsThe Companys financial instruments include cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments, accounts receivable and accounts payable and accruals. Due to their short-term nature, the carrying amounts of
such financial instruments approximate their fair value. Earnings Per ShareBasic earnings per share
EPS is computed by dividing earnings available to common shareholders by the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding for the period. Diluted EPS includes the effect of all dilutive stock options and equity instruments. A
reconciliation of the number of common shares used in calculation of basic and diluted EPS is presented in Note 15 - Earnings Per Share. Concentration of Credit RiskFinancial instruments that expose the Company to concentrations of credit risk consist principally of short-term investments and operating demand deposit
accounts. The Companys policy is to place its operating demand deposit accounts with high credit quality financial institutions. EstimatesThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America U.S. GAAP requires management
to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the
reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. Impact of Recently Issued Accounting Standards 
In January 2010, the Financial Accounting Standards Board FASB issued ASU 2010-6, Improving Disclosures About Fair Value
Measurements ASU 2010-6, which requires reporting entities to make new disclosures about recurring or nonrecurring fair-value measurements, including significant transfers into and out of Level 1 and Level 2 fair-value measurements
and information on purchases, sales, issuances, and settlements on a gross basis in the reconciliation of Level 3 fair-value measurements. ASU 2010-6 is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December15, 2009, except for Level
3 reconciliation disclosures, which are effective for annual periods beginning after December15, 2010. The adoption of ASU 2010-6 did not have a material impact on the Companys consolidated financial statements or disclosures nor is it
expected to have a material impact in future periods. In July 2010, the FASB issued guidance to enhance disclosures about the
credit quality of a creditors financing receivables and the adequacy of its allowance for credit losses. The amended guidance is effective for period-end balances beginning with the first interim or annual reporting period ending on or after
December15, 2010. The amended guidance is effective for activity during a reporting period beginning with the first interim or annual reporting period beginning on or after December15, 2010. The adoption of the amended guidance had no
impact on the Companys disclosure or on its consolidated financial statements. 
44 Table of Contents
In May 2011, the Financial Accounting Standards Board FASB issued Accounting Standards
Update No2011-04: Fair Value Measurement Topic 820: Amendments to Achieve Common Fair Value Measurement and Disclosure Requirements in U.S. GAAP and IFRSs ASU 2011-04. ASU 2011-04 clarifies application of fair value
measurement and disclosure requirements and is effective for annual periods beginning after December15, 2011. We are currently evaluating the provisions of ASU 2011-04 and assessing the impact, if any, it may have on our financial position and
results of operations. In December 2010, the FASB issued accounting standard ASU 2010-28, Intangibles-Goodwill and Other
Topic 350: When to Perform Step 2 of the Goodwill Impairment Test for Reporting Units with Zero or Negative Carrying Amounts a consensus of the FASB Emerging Issues Task Force ASU 2010-28. ASU 2010-28 provides amendments to
Topic 350 that modifies Step 1 of the goodwill impairment test for reporting units with zero or negative carrying amounts. As a result, goodwill impairments may be reported sooner than under current practice. For public entities, ASU 2010-28 is
effective for fiscal years and interim periods within those years beginning after December15, 2010, with early adoption not permitted. The adoption of ASU 2010-28 did not have a material impact on the Companys consolidated results of
operations or financial condition. In June 2011, the FASB issued ASU 2011-05, Comprehensive Income Topic 220:
Presentation of Comprehensive Income ASU 2011-05. ASU 2011-05 will require companies to present the components of net income and other comprehensive income either as one continuous statement or as two consecutive statements. It
eliminates the option to present components of other comprehensive income as part of the changes in shareholders equity. The standard does not change the items which must be reported in other comprehensive income, how such items are measured
or when they must be reclassified to net income. ASU 2011-05 is effective for interim and annual periods beginning after December15, 2011, with early adoption permitted. The adoption of ASU 2011-05 will only impact presentation and will not
have any effect on the Companys condensed consolidated financial statements or on its financial condition. In December
2011, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No2011-12: Comprehensive Income Topic 220: Deferral of the Effective Date for Amendments to the Presentation of Reclassifications of Items Out of Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income in
Accounting Standards Update No2011-05 ASU 2011-12. The Update defers the specific requirement to present items that are reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive income to net income separately with their respective components
of net income and other comprehensive income. As part of this update, the FASB did not defer the requirement to report comprehensive income either in a single continuous statement or in two separate but consecutive financial statements. ASU 2011-12
is effective for annual periods beginning after December15, 2011. In September 2011, the FASB issued ASU 2011-08,
Intangibles-Goodwill and Other Topic 350 ASU 2011-08. ASU 2011-08 allows entities to first assess qualitatively whether it is necessary to perform the two-step goodwill impairment test. If an entity believes, as a result of
its qualitative assessment, that it is not more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, then the first and second steps of the goodwill impairment test are unnecessary. The Company elected to early
adopt this accounting guidance at the beginning of its fourth quarter of 2011 on a prospective basis for goodwill impairment tests. The adoption of this standard did not have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements and footnote
disclosures. 
45 Table of Contents
In October 2009, the FASB issued ASU No2009-13, Revenue Recognition 
Multiple-Deliverable Revenue Arrangements. The new standard changes the requirements for establishing separate units of accounting in a multiple element arrangement and requires the allocation of arrangement consideration to each
deliverable based on the relative selling price. The selling price for each deliverable is based on vendor-specific objective evidence VSOE if available, third-party evidence if VSOE is not available, or estimated selling price if
neither VSOE or third-party evidence is available. ASU 2009-13 is effective for revenue arrangements entered into in fiscal years beginning on or after June15, 2010. The Company adopted ASU 2009-13 effective January1, 2011. The adoption
of ASU 2009-13 did not have an impact on our consolidated financial statements.  2.

GOODWILL 
The Companys goodwill at December31, 2011 and 2010 is related to its acquisition of three previous
businesses. The Company evaluates each reporting units fair value as compared to its carrying value on December31 of each year or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may exceed the fair
value. The Company first performs a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is necessary to perform the two-step goodwill impairment test. Recoverability of goodwill is measured using a discounted cash flow model incorporating discount rates
commensurate with the risks involved for each reporting unit. The key assumptions used in the discounted cash flow model include discount rates, growth rates, cash flow projections and terminal value rates. These rates are susceptible to change and
require significant management judgment. Impairments to goodwill are charged against earnings in the period the impairment is identified. The Company has three reporting units for which goodwill was tested on December31, 2011: the Americas
Region, the Europe/Africa Region, and the Asia Pacific Region, as shown in the table below. As of December31, 2011 and 2010, the Company did not have any goodwill that was identified as impaired. The changes in goodwill of $04 million in 2011
and $09 million in 2010 are to adjustments for changes in foreign exchange rates related to an acquisition made in 2005.

LINE OF CREDIT 
On July11, 2006, the Company entered into a loan agreement providing for an available line of credit of $300
million, which was most recently amended on June18, 2009. Loans under the Amended and Restated Loan Agreement, as amended, bear interest at the rate of LIBOR plus a fixed percentage between 225% and 250% and require the Company to maintain a
minimum cash balance and tangible net worth measured at the end of each of the Companys fiscal quarters. As of December31, 2011, the Company was in compliance with all of the covenants under the Amended and Restated Loan Agreement, as
amended. The term of the Amended and Restated Loan Agreement, as amended, extends to March31, 2012. The Company has not drawn on this line of credit. The Company believes it will be able to renew its line of credit upon the expiration of the

The Company recognizes accrued interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits in tax
expense. The total amount of unrecognized tax benefits that, if recognized, would affect the effective tax rate is $03 million.FARO does not currently anticipate that the total amount of unrecognized tax benefits will result in material
changes to its financial position. The Company is subject to income taxes at the federal, state and foreign country level. The Companys tax returns are subject to examination at the U.S. federal level from 2005 forward and at the state level
subject to a three to five year statute of limitations.

The United States Internal Revenue Service IRS commenced an examination of the
Companys 2009 income tax returns in June 2011 that is currently in process. The IRS completed an examination of the Companys 2005 to 2007 income tax returns in late 2009. This examination resulted in an assessment of approximately $26
million related to the valuation of certain intangible assets contributed to a foreign subsidiary of the Company under a RD Cost Sharing Arrangement entered into in 2001. This assessment was paid in January 2010 and included in income tax
expense for the year ended December31, 2009. The Company does not expect this assessment will have a prospective impact on its global effective tax rate. The Company believes that it has provided appropriately for any uncertain tax positions
that may arise. The effective income tax rate for 2011, 2010, and 2009 includes a reduction in the statutory corporate tax
rates for the Companys operations in Switzerland. The favorable tax rate ruling requires the Company to maintain a certain level of manufacturing operations in Switzerland. The aggregate dollar effect of this favorable tax rate was
approximately $09 million, or $005 per share, in the year ended December31, 2011, $02 million, or $001 per share, in the year ended December31, 2010, and $12 million, or $007 per share, in the year ended December31, 2009.
In 2005, the Company opened a regional headquarters and began to manufacture its products in Singapore. In the third quarter
of 2006, the Company received confirmation of a tax holiday for its operations from the Singapore Economic Development Board for a period of four years commencing January1, 2006 and an additional six-year extension at a favorable tax rate
subject to certain terms and conditions including employment, spending, and capital investment. The aggregate dollar effect of this favorable tax rate was approximately $03 million, or $002 per share, during the year ended December31,
2011, $07 million, or $004 per share, in the year ended December31, 2010 and $11 million, or $007 per share, during the year ended December31, 2009. At December31, 2011 and 2010, the Companys domestic entities had deferred income tax assets in the amount of $4,957 and $4,564, respectively. 
At December31, 2011 and 2010, the Companys foreign subsidiaries had deferred income tax assets relating to net operating loss
carry forwards, some of which expire in 5 to 15 years and others which can be carried forward indefinitely, of $14,939 and $14,084, respectively. For financial reporting purposes, a valuation allowance of $11,760 and $11,148, respectively, has been
recognized to offset the deferred tax assets relating to net operating losses. The Company maintains a valuation allowance on net operating losses in jurisdictions for which it does not have a history of earnings over the last three years and where
the Company believes that the deferred tax assets are not more-likely-than-not to be realized based upon two-year projections of taxable income. The Company released a valuation allowance of approximately $12 million in the year ended
December31, 2010 related to net operating losses of a subsidiary in Germany as a result of being included in a group consolidated tax filing with net taxable earnings. The Company has not recognized any U.S. tax expense on undistributed international earnings, as it intends to reinvest the earnings outside the U.S. for the foreseeable future. The Companys net
undistributed international earnings were approximately $508 million and $384 million at December31, 2011 and 2010, respectively. Significant judgment is required in determining the Companys worldwide provision for income taxes. In the ordinary course of a global business, there are many transactions for which the ultimate tax
outcome is uncertain. The Company reviews its tax contingencies on a regular basis and makes appropriate accruals as necessary.

Patent Matters On July11, 2008, Metris USA, Inc. and its affiliates, Metris N.V., Metris IPR N.V.
and 3-D Scanners Ltd., filed a complaint against the Company for patent infringement in the U.S. District Court for the District of Massachusetts the Massachusetts Court concerning U.S. Patent Nos. 6,611,617 and 7,313,264 hereinafter,
the patents-in-suit. Following an acquisition by Nikon Corporation in late 2009, Metris USA, Inc. subsequently changed its name to Nikon Metrology, Inc., Metris N.V. changed its name to Nikon Metrology NV, and Metris IPR N.V. was
dissolved and merged into Nikon Metrology NV. We refer to each of Nikon Metrology, Inc., Nikon Metrology NV, and 3-D Scanners Ltd. as Plaintiffs or Nikon. 
The Company responded to the complaint with counterclaims alleging that the patents-in-suit, which are generally directed to laser
scanning devices, are invalid, non-infringed, and unenforceable due to fraud during prosecution of the patents in the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office. On August31, 2009, the Massachusetts Court granted the Companys motion to add
counterclaims and defenses for violation of federal and state antitrust and unfair competition laws based on the alleged knowing assertion of invalid and fraudulent patents. The Company also filed an amended counterclaim to add the Plaintiffs
parent company, Nikon Corporation, as a counterclaim defendant. On January29, 2010, the Company filed a motion for
summary judgment that the patents-in-suit are unenforceable due to inequitable conduct during patent prosecution. Evidentiary hearings on the issue of inequitable conduct commenced on July19, 2010 and concluded on October22, 2010.
Post-trial briefing concluded on December10, 2010. On July14, 2010, the Company filed a motion for summary judgment of non-infringement of both patents-in-suit. In addition, during the first quarter of 2010, Nikon served a supplemental
interrogatory answer revising its alleged date of conception of the patents-in-suit to an earlier date. The Company filed a motion to strike the supplemental interrogatory answer. On August31, 2010, Nikon filed a motion for summary judgment
against the Companys counterclaims for antitrust violations and unfair trade practices. The Company filed its opposition on October12, 2010. A mediation hearing held on February18, 2011 to settle the matter was unsuccessful. On February22, 2011, the Massachusetts Court denied Nikons motion for summary judgment on the
Companys counterclaims for antitrust violations and unfair trade practices without prejudice.On February24, 2011, the Massachusetts Court denied the Companys motion for summary judgment of non-infringement without
prejudice.On May4, 2011, the Massachusetts Court found that, with respect to U.S. Patent No6,611,617, Nikons patent is unenforceable due to inequitable conduct. 
55 Table of Contents
On May26, 2011, the Company renewed its motion for summary judgment of
non-infringement. On June28, 2011, the Massachusetts Court heard oral arguments on the Companys motion, as well as on Nikons renewed motion for summary judgment on the Companys counterclaims for anti-trust violations and
unfair trade practices. The Massachusetts Court also heard oral arguments regarding an intervening change in the law of inequitable conduct and whether it changes the Massachusetts Courts May4, 2011 finding that Nikons U.S. Patent
No6,611,617 is unenforceable due to inequitable conduct. On September19, 2011, as a result of these changes in
the law of inequitable conduct, the Massachusetts Court vacated its May4, 2011 decision that U.S. Patent No6,611,617 is unenforceable.However, in the same order, the Massachusetts Court ruled that the Company did not infringe U.S.
Patent No6,611,617.The Massachusetts Court also granted Nikons motion for summary judgment on the Companys counterclaims for anti-trust violations and unfair trade practices.The Massachusetts Court denied the
Companys motion for summary judgment of non-infringement of U.S. Patent No7,313,264.The effect of the ruling is to reduce or eliminate the Companys exposure with respect to claims associated with US. Patent
No6,611,617, while the patent dispute with respect to U.S. Patent No7,313,264 remains ongoing.The Company believes it does not infringe U.S. Patent No7,313,264 and that the patent is invalid and unenforceable, and the
Company will continue to vigorously defend itself against these claims. The Company does not anticipate this lawsuit will
have a material impact on the Company; however, the outcome is difficult to predict, and an adverse determination could have a material impact on the Companys business, financial condition or results of operations. 
Other than the litigation mentioned above, the Company is not involved in any other legal proceedings other than routine litigation
arising in the normal course of business, none of which the Company believes will have a material adverse effect on the Companys business, financial condition or results of operations. 14.
STOCK COMPENSATION PLANS 
The Company has four stock option plans that provide for the granting of stock options to key employees and
non-employee members of the Board of Directors. The 1997 Employee Stock Option Plan 1997 Plan provides for granting incentive stock options and nonqualified stock options to officers and key employees of the Company. The 1997
Non-employee Director Stock Option Plan provides for granting nonqualified stock options and formula options to non-employee directors. The 2004 Equity Incentive Plan 2004 Plan and the 2009 Equity Incentive Plan 2009 Plan
provide for granting options, restricted stock, restricted stock units or stock appreciation rights to employees and non-employee directors. 
56 Table of Contents
The Company was authorized to grant awards for up to 1,400,000 shares of common stock under
the 1997 Plan, of which 28,583 options are currently outstanding at exercise prices between $168 and $2740. These options have a 10-year term and vest over a 3-year period. The Company was also authorized to grant awards for up to 250,000 shares
of common stock under the 1997 Non-employee Stock Option Director Plan, of which 3,000 options are currently outstanding at an exercise price of $2156. The Company was also authorized to grant awards for up to 1,750,000 shares of common stock under
the 2004 Plan, of which 397,170 options are currently outstanding at exercise prices between $1250 and $3106, and 5,251 restricted stock units are outstanding at a stock price of $1304 to $2430. These options and restricted stock units have a
10-year term 7 years on grants beginning in 2010 and vest over a 3-year period. The Company will not make any further grants under the 1997 Plan, the 1997 Non-employee Stock Option Director Plan or the 2004 Plan. The Company is authorized to grant
awards for up to 1,781,546 shares of common stock under the 2009 Plan, as well as any shares underlying awards outstanding under the 2004 Plan as of the effective date of the 2009 Plan that thereafter terminate or expire unexercised or are canceled,
forfeited or lapse for any reason. There are 436,692 options currently outstanding under the 2009 Plan at exercise prices between $1704 and $3933. Prior to 2009, upon election to the Board, each non-employee director was granted 3,400 restricted
shares of common stock that vested ratably over three years. On the day following the Annual Meeting of Shareholders, each non-employee director, other than a non-employee director who received the initial equity grant in that same year, was granted
2,200 restricted shares of common stock that vested ratably over three years. Beginning in 2009, upon election to the Board,
each non-employee director receives an initial equity grant of shares of restricted common stock with a value equal to $100,000, calculated as of the closing share price on the date of the non-employee directors election to the Board. The
initial restricted stock grant vests on the third anniversary of the grant date, subject to the non-employee directors continued membership on the board. Annually on the first business day following the annual meeting of stockholders, each
non-employee director is granted restricted shares of common stock with a value equal to $70,000, calculated as of the closing share price on that day. The shares of restricted stock vest on the day prior to the following years annual meeting
date, subject to a directors continued membership on the Board. The Company records compensation cost associated with its restricted stock unit grants on a straight-line basis over the vesting term. 
Compensation costs charged to operations associated with the Companys stock incentive plans were $2,756, $2,416, and $2,449 in
2011, 2010, and 2009, respectively. The changes in stock option associated compensation cost were due to the vesting of options and the accrual of expenses relating to the issuance of restricted stock. 
The Company used the Black-Scholes option-pricing model to determine the fair value of grants made using the following assumptions:
For the Years Ended December31 2011 2010 2009 Risk-free interest rate 066%and183 185%and214 138%and144 Expected dividend yield 0 0 0 Expected option life 4 years 4 years 4 years Expected volatility 479% - 487 435%and465 483 Weighted-average expected volatility 487 465 483 Historical information was the primary basis for the selection of the expected dividend yield, expected
volatility and the expected lives of the options. The risk-free interest rate was based on yields of U.S. zero coupon issues and U.S. Treasury issues, with a term equal to the expected life of the option being valued.

CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES. Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures The Company
maintains disclosure controls and procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by the Company in the reports it files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the
time periods specified in the SECs rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to the Companys management, including its Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate to allow timely
decisions regarding required disclosure. As of the end of the period covered by this report, the Companys management
carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of its Chief Executive Officer and its Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of the Companys disclosure controls and procedures. Based upon that evaluation,
the Companys Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that the Companys disclosure controls and procedures, as defined by Rule 13a-15e under the Exchange Act, were effective as of December31, 2011.
Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting There were no changes in the Companys internal control over financial reporting during the fourth quarter ended December31, 2011 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to
materially affect, the Companys internal control over financial reporting. Managements Report on Internal Control Over
Financial Reporting Management of the Company is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal
control over financial reporting. Internal control over financial reporting is the process designed under the Chief Executive Officers and the Chief Financial Officers supervision, and effected by the Companys Board of Directors,
management and other personnel, to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the
United States. Under the supervision and with the participation of the Companys management, including its Chief
Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, the Company conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of the Companys internal control over financial reporting as of December31, 2011, as required by Exchange Act Rule 13a-1c. In
making this assessment, the Company used the criteria set forth in the framework in Internal Control Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Based on the Companys
evaluation under the framework in Internal Control Integrated Framework, management concluded that the Companys internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December31, 2011. 
There are inherent limitations in the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, including the possibility that
misstatements may not be prevented or detected. Accordingly, an effective control system, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the designed control objectives, and management is required to
apply its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible controls and procedures. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and
instances of fraud, if any, within the company have been detected. The design of any system of controls also is based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed
in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions. Grant Thornton LLP, the independent registered public
accounting firm that audited the Companys consolidated financial statements, has issued an attestation report on the Companys internal control over financial reporting as of December31, 2011, which appears below.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM 
Board of Directors and Shareholders FARO
Technologies, Inc. and Subsidiaries We have audited FARO Technologies, Inc. a Florida Corporation and subsidiaries internal control
over financial reporting as of December31, 2011, based on criteria established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission COSO. FARO Technologies, Inc. and
subsidiaries management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Managements
Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on FARO Technologies, Inc. and subsidiaries internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. 
We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board United States. Those standards require that we
plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial
reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the
circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion. A companys internal control over financial
reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A
companys internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that 1pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the
assets of the company; 2provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of
the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and 3provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the
companys assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of
effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. 
In our opinion, FARO Technologies, Inc. and subsidiaries maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of
December31, 2011, based on criteria established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by COSO. We also have audited,
in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board United States, the consolidated balance sheets of FARO Technologies, Inc. and subsidiaries as of December31, 2011 and 2010, and the related consolidated
statements of operations, shareholders equity and other comprehensive income and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December31, 2011 and our report dated February28, 2012 expressed an unqualified opinion.
