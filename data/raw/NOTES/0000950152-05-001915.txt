Caribbean.
2. SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
Principles of Consolidation The accompanying consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the
company and its subsidiaries. All significant intercompany accounts and
transactions have been eliminated.
Use of Estimates The preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with
accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America
U.S. requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the
reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses, and related
disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. On an ongoing basis, the
company evaluates its estimates, including those related to customer programs
and incentives, product returns, doubtful accounts, inventories, intangible
assets, income taxes, warranty obligations, copyright fees, product royalty
obligations, restructurings, pension and other postretirement benefits, and
contingencies and litigation. The company bases its estimates on historical
experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable
under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making
judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not
readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these
estimates under different assumptions or conditions.
Foreign Currency Translation Assets and liabilities of non-U.S. subsidiaries that operate in a local currency
environment are translated into U.S. dollars at period-end exchange rates.
Income and expense accounts are translated at average exchange rates prevailing
during the period. Adjustments arising from the translation of assets and
liabilities are accumulated as a separate component of accumulated other
comprehensive earnings loss in stockholders' equity.
Cash Equivalents All highly liquid investments with an original maturity of three months or less
at the company date of purchase are considered to be cash equivalents.
Marketable Securities The company evaluates its marketable securities in accordance with Statement of
Financial Accounting Standards SFAS No. 115, Accounting for Certain
Investments in Debt and Equity Securities, and classifies these investments as
held-to-maturity, trading or available-for-sale.
42 Based on the company expected holding period, the company has classified all
of its marketable securities as available-for-sale and reported these
investments in the Consolidated Statements of Financial Position as current
assets. The company reports its available-for-sale marketable securities at fair
value with unrealized gains or losses recorded on the accumulated other
comprehensive earnings loss line in the Consolidated Statements of Financial
Position. The company assesses its marketable securities for
other-than-temporary declines in value by considering various factors that
include, among other things, any events that may affect the creditworthiness of
a security issuer, the length of time the security has been in a loss position
and the company ability and intent to hold the security until a forecasted
recovery of fair value that may include holding the security to maturity.
Realized gains or losses are included in net earnings and are derived using the
specific identification method for determining the cost of the securities.
Allowance for Doubtful Accounts The company maintains allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses
resulting from the inability of its customers to make required payments. The
company estimates the allowance for doubtful accounts based on a variety of
factors including the length of time receivables are past due, the financial
health of customers, unusual macroeconomic conditions and historical experience.
If the financial condition of the company customers deteriorates or other
circumstances occur that result in an impairment of customers' ability to make
payments, the company records additional allowances as needed.
Fair Value of Financial Instruments The financial instruments of the company consist mainly of cash and cash
equivalents, marketable securities, trade receivables, short-term debt,
long-term debt and derivatives. The fair value of cash and cash equivalents,
trade receivables and short-term debt approximates their carrying values due to
the relatively short-term nature of the instruments. The fair value of the
company marketable securities are based on quoted market prices, or in some
cases, the company amortized cost, which approximates fair value due to the
frequent resetting of interest rates resulting in repricing of the investments.
The fair value of long-term debt is based on current rates available to the
company for debt with similar characteristics. The fair value of derivative
financial instruments is based on quoted market prices of comparable instruments
or, if none are available, on pricing models or formulas using current
assumptions.
Inventories Inventories are stated at the lower of average cost or market. The company
considers all raw materials to be in production upon their receipt.
Property, Plant and Equipment Property, plant and equipment are stated at cost and depreciated over their
estimated useful lives using the straight-line method. Property, plant and
equipment accounts are relieved of the cost and related accumulated depreciation
when assets are disposed of or otherwise retired.
Internal Use Software Costs The company capitalizes direct costs incurred during the application development
and implementation stages for developing, purchasing, or otherwise acquiring
software for internal use. These software costs are included on the property,
plant and equipment line in the Consolidated Statements of Financial Position
and are depreciated over the estimated useful life of the software, generally
three years. All costs incurred during the preliminary project stage are
expensed as incurred.
43 Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets The company accounts for goodwill and other intangible assets in accordance with
SFAS No. 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets. The company annually reviews
its goodwill for impairment and currently does not have any indefinite-lived
intangible assets. The company goodwill and intangible assets are immaterial,
and therefore are not separately presented in the Consolidated Statements of
Financial Position.
Long-Lived Assets The company performs reviews for the impairment of long-lived assets whenever
events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset
may not be recoverable. An impairment loss is recognized when estimated
undiscounted future cash flows expected to result from the use of the asset and
its eventual disposition are less than its carrying amount. If future expected
undiscounted cash flows are insufficient to recover the carrying value of the
assets, then an impairment loss is recognized based upon the excess of the
carrying value of the asset over the anticipated cash flows on a discounted
basis. The company also reviews any legal and contractual obligations associated
with the retirement of its long-lived assets and records assets and liabilities,
as necessary, related to the cost of such obligations.
Warranty Reserves The company provides for the estimated cost of product warranties at the time
revenue is recognized. The reserve for product warranties is based on the
quantity of units sold under warranty, estimated product failure rates, and
material usage and service delivery costs. The estimates for product failure
rates and material usage and service delivery costs are periodically adjusted
based on actual results. For extended warranty programs, the company defers
revenue in short-term and long-term liability accounts based on the extended
warranty contractual period for amounts invoiced to customers for these
programs and recognizes the revenue ratably over the contractual period. Costs
associated with extended warranty programs are expensed as incurred.
Revenue Recognition Accounting Changes
In December 2003, the Securities and Exchange Commission SEC issued Staff
Accounting Bulletin SAB No. 104, Revenue Recognition, which superceded SAB
101, Revenue Recognition in Financial Statements. SAB 104 updated certain
interpretive guidance included in SAB 101, including the SAB 101 guidance
related to multiple element revenue arrangements, to reflect the issuance by the
Emerging Issues Task Force EITF of EITF 00-21, Accounting for Revenue
Arrangements with Multiple Deliverables. The basic revenue recognition
principles of SAB 101 were largely unchanged by the issuance of SAB 104, and
therefore, did not have a material impact on the company financial position,
results of operations and cash flows.
General
The company recognizes revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement
exists, delivery has occurred, the sales price is fixed or determinable and
collectibility is probable. The following are the policies applicable to
Lexmark major categories of revenue transactions Products
Revenue from product sales, including sales to distributors and resellers, is
recognized when title and risk of loss transfer to the customer, generally when
the product is shipped to the customer. When other significant obligations
remain after products are delivered, revenue is recognized
44 only after such obligations are fulfilled. At the time revenue is recognized,
the company provides for the estimated cost of post-sales support, principally
product warranty, and reduces revenue for estimated product returns.
Additionally, the company records estimated reductions to revenue and the
related trade receivables at the time of sale for customer programs and
incentive offerings including special pricing agreements, promotions and other
volume-based incentives. Estimated reductions in revenue are based upon
historical trends and other known factors at the time of sale. In addition, the
company provides price protection to substantially all of its reseller
customers. The company records reductions to revenue for the estimated impact of
price protection when price reductions to resellers are anticipated.
Services
Revenue from support or maintenance contracts, including extended warranty
programs, is recognized ratably over the contractual period. Amounts invoiced to
customers in excess of revenue recognized on support or maintenance contracts
are recorded as deferred revenue until the appropriate revenue recognition
criteria are met. Revenue for time and material contracts is recognized as the
services are performed.
Multiple Element Revenue Arrangements
The company enters into transactions that include multiple elements, such as a
combination of products and services. Revenue for these arrangements is
allocated to each element based on its relative fair value and is recognized
when the revenue recognition criteria for each element have been met. Relative
fair value may be determined by the price of an element if it were sold on a
stand-alone basis referred to as vendor-specific objective evidence VSOE.
In the absence of VSOE, third party evidence e.g., competitors' prices of
comparable products or services is used to determine relative fair value.
Advertising Costs The company expenses advertising costs when incurred. Advertising expense was
approximately $1081 million, $807 million and $762 million in 2004, 2003 and
2002, respectively.
Pension and Postretirement Benefits The company accounts for its defined benefit pension plans and its non-pension
postretirement benefit plans using actuarial models required by SFAS No. 87,
Employers' Accounting for Pensions, and SFAS No. 106, Employers' Accounting for
Postretirement Benefits Other Than Pensions, respectively. Liabilities are
computed using the projected unit credit method. The objective under this method
is to expense each participant benefits under the plan as they accrue, taking
into consideration future salary increases and the plan benefit allocation
formula. Thus, the total pension to which each participant is expected to become
entitled is broken down into units, each associated with a year of past or
future credited service.
The discount rate assumption for the pension and postretirement benefit plan
liabilities reflects the rates available on high-quality fixed-income
investments at December 31 each year. The company assumed long-term rate of
return on plan assets is based on long-term historical actual return
information, the mix of investments that comprise plan assets and future
estimates of long-term investment returns by reference to external sources.
Differences between actual and expected asset returns are recognized in the
calculation of net periodic cost benefit over five years. The rate of
compensation increase is determined by the company based upon its long-term
plans for such increases. Unrecognized actuarial gains and losses are amortized
on a straight-line basis over the remaining estimated service period of
participants.
45 The company funding policy for its pension plans is to fund minimum amounts
according to the regulatory requirements under which the plans operate. From
time to time, the company may choose to fund amounts in excess of the minimum
for various reasons.
The company accrues for the cost of providing postretirement benefits such as
medical and life insurance coverage over the remaining estimated service period
of participants. These benefits are funded by the company when paid.
Stock-Based Compensation In December 2002, the Financial Accounting Standards Board FASB issued SFAS
No. 148, Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation -- Transition and
Disclosure -- an Amendment of SFAS 123, which provided alternative methods for a
voluntary change to the fair value method of accounting for stock-based employee
compensation and amended the disclosure requirements of SFAS No. 123, Accounting
for Stock-Based Compensation. The company elected to continue to account for its
stock-based employee compensation plans under Accounting Principles Board
APB Opinion No. 25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees, and related
interpretations. The following disclosures are provided in accordance with SFAS
148.
The company has various stock-based employee compensation plans, which are
described in Note 12 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. No
stock-based employee compensation cost associated with stock options is
reflected in net earnings as all options granted under those plans had an
exercise price at least equal to the market value of the underlying common stock
on the date of grant.
The following table illustrates the effect on net earnings and earnings per
share if the company had applied the fair value recognition provisions of SFAS
123 to stock-based employee compensation.                                YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31

Basic -- pro  $ 407  $ 312  $ 260
Diluted -- as  $ 428  $ 334  $ 279
Diluted -- pro  $ 397  $ 304  $ 254
-  In December 2004, the FASB issued SFAS No. 123 revised 2004, Share-Based
Payment SFAS 123R, which replaces SFAS 123 and supercedes APB 25. SFAS 123R
requires that all share-based payments to employees, including grants of stock
options, be recognized in the financial statements based on their fair value
beginning with the first interim or annual reporting period that begins after
June 15, 2005. The company will be required to adopt SFAS 123R at the beginning
of the third quarter of 2005 and is currently evaluating the requirements of
SFAS 123R, including selection of the transition method. SFAS 123R allows for
prospective and retroactive transition alternatives. The prospective alternative
requires that compensation expense be recorded for all unvested stock-based
awards at the beginning of the first quarter of adoption of SFAS 123R, while the
retroactive alternatives require that compensation expense for all unvested
awards be recognized beginning with the first period restated. The retroactive
alternatives allow
46 for the restatement of prior periods either as of the beginning of the year of
adoption or for all periods presented. The company expects that the adoption of
SFAS 123R will have a material impact on its results of operations and earnings
per share.
Income Taxes The provision for income taxes is computed based on pre-tax income included in
the Consolidated Statements of Earnings. The company recognizes deferred tax
assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of events that
have been included in the financial statements or tax returns. Under this
method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the
difference between the financial statement carrying amounts and tax bases of
assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which
the differences are expected to reverse.
Derivatives The company accounts for derivative instruments in accordance with SFAS No. 133,
Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities, SFAS No. 138,
Accounting for Certain Derivative Instruments and Certain Hedging Activities,
and SFAS No. 149, Amendment of Statement No. 133 on Derivative Instruments and
Hedging Activities. SFAS 138 and SFAS 149 amended certain portions of SFAS 133.
These statements require that all derivatives, including foreign currency
exchange contracts, be recognized in the statement of financial position at
their fair value. Derivatives that are not hedges must be recorded at fair value
through earnings. If a derivative is a hedge, depending on the nature of the
hedge, changes in the fair value of the derivative are either offset against the
change in fair value of underlying assets or liabilities through earnings or
recognized in other comprehensive earnings loss until the underlying hedged
item is recognized in earnings. Any ineffective portion of a derivative change
in fair value is immediately recognized in earnings.
Net Earnings Per Share Basic net earnings per share is calculated by dividing net income by the
weighted average number of shares outstanding during the reported period. The
calculation of diluted net earnings per share is similar to basic, except that
the weighted average number of shares outstanding includes the additional
dilution from potential common stock such as stock options and stock under
long-term incentive plans.
Other Comprehensive Earnings Loss Other comprehensive earnings loss refers to revenues, expenses, gains and
losses that under accounting principles generally accepted in the United States
of America are included in comprehensive earnings loss but are excluded from
net income as these amounts are recorded directly as an adjustment to
stockholders' equity, net of tax. The company other comprehensive earnings
loss is composed of deferred gains and losses on cash flow hedges, net
unrealized gains and losses on marketable securities, foreign currency
translation adjustments and adjustments made to recognize additional minimum
liabilities associated with the company defined benefit pension plans.
Segment Data The company manufactures and sells a variety of printing and multifunction
products and related supplies and services and is primarily managed along
business and consumer market segments. Refer to Note 17 of the Notes to
Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding the
company reportable segments.
47 Recent Accounting Pronouncements In January 2003, the FASB issued FASB Interpretation No. 46 FIN 46,
Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities, an Interpretation of Accounting
Research Bulletin ARB No. 51. FIN 46 requires certain variable interest
entities to be consolidated by the primary beneficiary of the entity if the
equity investors in the entity do not have the characteristics of a controlling
financial interest or do not have sufficient equity at risk for the entity to
finance its activities without additional subordinated financial support from
other parties. In December 2003, the FASB issued FIN 46-R, Consolidation of
Variable Interest Entities, an Interpretation of ARB No. 51 revised December
2003, which replaces FIN 46. FIN 46-R incorporates certain modifications to FIN
46 adopted by the FASB subsequent to the issuance of FIN 46, including
modifications to the scope of FIN 46. Additionally, FIN 46-R also incorporates
much of the guidance previously issued in the form of FASB Staff Positions. For
all special purpose entities SPEs created prior to February 1, 2003, public
entities must apply either the provisions of FIN 46 or early adopt the
provisions of FIN 46-R at the end of the first interim or annual reporting
period ending after December 15, 2003. The company has evaluated the provisions
of this interpretation and determined that the interpretation has no impact on
its financial position, results of operations and cash flows.
In May 2004, the FASB issued Staff Position No. 106-2 FSP 106-2, Accounting
and Disclosure Requirements Related to the Medicare Prescription Drug
Improvement and Modernization Act of 2003 the Act. The Act introduced a
prescription drug benefit under Medicare as well as a federal subsidy to
sponsors of post-retirement health care benefit plans plan sponsors that
provide a benefit that is at least actuarially equivalent to Medicare Part D.
FSP 106-2 superceded FSP 106-1, which was issued in January 2004, and permitted
plan sponsors of a post-retirement health care plan that provides a prescription
drug benefit to make a one-time election to defer accounting for the effects of
the Act until more authoritative guidance on the accounting for the federal
subsidy was issued. The company had elected to defer accounting for the effects
of the Act under FSP 106-1. FSP 106-2 was effective for the first interim or
annual period beginning after June 15, 2004. On January 21, 2005, the Centers
for Medicare and Medicaid Services released final regulations implementing major
provisions of the Act. The company evaluated the provisions of FSP 106-2 and the
new regulations and determined that they did not have a material impact on the
company financial position, results of operations and cash flows.
In November 2004, the FASB issued SFAS No. 151, Inventory Costs, an amendment of
ARB No. 43, Chapter 4. SFAS 151 amends the guidance in ARB 43, Chapter 4,
Inventory Pricing, to clarify the accounting for abnormal amounts of idle
facility expense, freight, handling costs, and wasted material spoilage.
Paragraph 5 of ARB 43, Chapter 4, previously stated that.. under some
circumstances, items such as idle facility expense, excessive spoilage, double
freight, and rehandling costs may be so abnormal as to require treatment as
current period charges... This Statement requires that those items be
recognized as current-period charges regardless of whether they meet the
criterion of so abnormal. In addition, SFAS 151 requires that allocation of
fixed production overheads to the costs of conversion be based on the normal
capacity of the production facilities. The provisions of SFAS 151 are applicable
to inventory costs incurred during fiscal years beginning after June 15, 2005,
and is required to be adopted by the company in the first quarter of fiscal
2006. The company is currently evaluating the provisions of this statement.
In December 2004, the FASB issued SFAS No. 153, Exchanges of Nonmonetary Assets
- - an amendment of APB Opinion No. 29, Accounting for Nonmonetary Transactions.
The guidance in APB 29 is based on the principle that exchanges of nonmonetary
assets should be measured based on the fair value of the assets exchanged. The
guidance in that Opinion, however, included certain exceptions to that
principle. SFAS 153 amends APB 29 to eliminate the exception for nonmonetary
exchanges of similar productive assets and replaces it with a general exception
for exchanges of nonmonetary assets that do not have commercial substance. A
nonmonetary
48 exchange has commercial substance if the future cash flows of the entity are
expected to change significantly as a result of the exchange. The provisions of
SFAS 153 are applicable for nonmonetary asset exchanges occurring in fiscal
periods beginning after June 15, 2005. The company is currently evaluating the
provisions of this statement.
In December 2004, the FASB issued SFAS 123R, which replaces SFAS 123 and
supercedes APB 25. SFAS 123R requires that all share-based payments to
employees, including grants of stock options, be recognized in the financial
statements based on their fair value beginning with the first interim or annual
reporting period that begins after June 15, 2005. The company will be required
to adopt SFAS 123R at the beginning of the third quarter of 2005 and is
currently evaluating the requirements of SFAS 123R, including selection of the
transition method. SFAS 123R allows for prospective and retroactive transition
alternatives. The prospective alternative requires that compensation expense be
recorded for all unvested stock-based awards at the beginning of the first
quarter of adoption of SFAS 123R, while the retroactive alternatives require
that compensation expense for all unvested awards be recognized beginning with
the first period restated. The retroactive alternatives allow for the
restatement of prior periods either as of the beginning of the year of adoption
or for all periods presented. The company expects that the adoption of SFAS 123R
will have a material impact on its results of operations and earnings per share.
In December 2004, the FASB issued FSP 109-1, Application of FASB Statement No.
109, Accounting for Income Taxes, for the Tax Deduction Provided to U.S.-Based
Manufacturers by the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004 FSP 109-1. FSP 109-1
clarifies that the tax deduction for domestic manufacturers under the American
Jobs Creation Act of 2004 should be accounted for as a special deduction in
accordance with SFAS No. 109, Accounting for Income Taxes. The FSP, issued on
December 21, 2004, went into effect upon being issued.
In December 2004, the FASB also issued FSP 109-2, Accounting and Disclosure
Guidance for the Foreign Earnings Repatriation Provision within the American
Jobs Creation Act of 2004 FSP 109-2. FSP 109-2 provides enterprises more
time beyond the financial-reporting period during which the American Jobs
Creation Act took effect to evaluate the impact on the enterprise plan for
reinvestment or repatriation of certain foreign earnings for purposes of
applying SFAS 109. The FSP, issued on December 21, 2004, went into effect upon
being issued. The company is not yet in a position to decide on whether, and to
what extent, it might repatriate foreign earnings that have not yet been
remitted to the U.S. The company expects to conclude its analysis of this
repatriation incentive during 2005.
Reclassifications Certain prior year amounts have been reclassified, if applicable, to conform to
the presentation.
49 3. MARKETABLE SECURITIES
The company evaluates its marketable securities in accordance with SFAS No. 115,
Accounting for Certain Investments in Debt and Equity Securities, and has
determined that all of its investments in marketable securities should be
classified as available-for-sale and reported at fair value, with unrealized
gains and losses recorded in other comprehensive earnings loss. The fair
values of the company available-for-sale marketable securities are based on
quoted market prices or, in some cases, the company amortized cost, which
approximates fair value due to the frequent resetting of interest rates
resulting in repricing of the investments. As of December 31, 2004, the company
had unrealized losses of $09 million related to its marketable securities. The
company had no unrealized gains or losses related to its marketable securities
as of December 31, 2003. The unrealized losses as of December 31, 2004, have
been in a continuous loss position for less than 12 months. The company assesses
its marketable securities for other-than-temporary declines in value by
considering various factors that include, among other things, any events that
may affect the creditworthiness of a security issuer, the length of time the
security has been in a loss position, and the company ability and intent to
hold the security until a forecasted recovery of fair value that may include
holding the security to maturity.
At December 31, 2004, the company available-for-sale marketable securities
consisted of the following                               GROSS    GROSS

marketable securities were $2,4379 million in 2004 and $6623 million in 2003.
The company recognized gross realized gains and gross realized losses from these
sales totaling $02 million and $01 million, respectively, in 2004. The company
did not incur any gross realized gains or losses from sales during 2003. The
company uses the specific identification method when accounting for the costs of
its available-for-sale marketable securities sold.
4. TRADE RECEIVABLES
The company trade receivables are reported in the Consolidated Statements of
Financial Position net of allowances for doubtful accounts and product returns.
Trade receivables consisted of the following at December 31                                2004   2003
- 
Gross trade  $7849  $6635
405  481
- 
Trade receivables,  $7444  $6154
-  In the U.S., the company sells a majority of its receivables to its wholly-owned
subsidiary, Lexmark Receivables Corporation LRC, which then sells the
receivables to an unrelated third party. The financial results of LRC are
included in the company consolidated financial results. LRC is a separate
legal entity with its own separate creditors who, in a liquidation of LRC, would
be entitled to be satisfied out of LRC assets prior to any value in LRC
becoming available for equity claims of the company. The company accounts for
the transfers of receivables as sales transactions.
In October 2001, the company entered into an agreement to sell its U.S. trade
receivables on a limited recourse basis that allowed for a maximum amount of
financing availability of $2250 million. In October 2003, the agreement was
amended and the maximum amount of U.S. trade receivables to be sold was
decreased to $2000 million. In October 2004, the company entered into an
amended and restated agreement to sell its U.S. trade receivables on a limited
recourse basis. The amended agreement allows for a maximum financing
availability of $2000 million under this facility. The primary purpose of the
amendment was to extend the term of the facility to October 16, 2007, with
required annual renewal of commitments in October 2005 and 2006.
This facility contains customary affirmative and negative covenants as well as
specific provisions related to the quality of the accounts receivables sold. As
collections reduce previously sold receivables, the company may replenish these
with new receivables. The company bears a
51 limited risk of bad debt losses on U.S. trade receivables sold, since the
company over-collateralizes the receivables sold with additional eligible
receivables. The company addresses this risk of loss in its allowance for
doubtful accounts. Receivables sold may not include amounts over 90 days past
due or concentrations over certain limits with any one customer. At December 31,
2004 and 2003, the facility had no U.S. trade receivables sold and outstanding.
Expenses incurred under this program totaling $04 million, $03 million and
$13 million for 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively, are included on the other
expense line in the Consolidated Statements of Earnings.

8. DEBT
LONG-TERM DEBT
The company has outstanding $1500 million principal amount of 675% senior
notes due May 15, 2008, which was initially priced at 98998%, to yield 689% to
maturity. A balance of $1495 million net of unamortized discount of $05
million was outstanding at December 31, 2004. At December 31, 2003, the balance
was $1493 million net of unamortized discount of $07 million. The senior
notes contain typical restrictions on liens, sale leaseback transactions,
mergers and sales of assets. There are no sinking fund requirements on the
senior notes and they may be redeemed at any time at the option of the company,
at a redemption price as described in the related indenture agreement, as
supplemented and amended, in whole or in part.
During October 2003, the company entered into interest rate swap contracts to
convert its $1500 million principal amount of 675% senior notes from a fixed
interest rate to a variable interest rate. Interest rate swaps with a notional
amount of $1500 million were executed whereby the company will receive interest
at a fixed rate of 675% and pay interest at a variable rate of approximately
276% above the six-month London Interbank Offered Rate LIBOR. These
interest rate swaps have a maturity date of May 15, 2008, which is equivalent to
the maturity date of the senior notes.
CREDIT FACILITY
Effective May 29, 2002, the company entered into a $5000 million unsecured,
revolving credit facility with a group of banks, including a $2000 million
364-day portion and a $3000 million 3-year portion. Upon entering into the
credit agreement, the company terminated the prior $3000 million unsecured,
revolving credit facility that was due to expire on January 27, 2003. There were
no amounts outstanding under the prior facility upon its termination.
Under the credit facility, the company may borrow in dollars, euros and certain
other currencies. The interest rate ranges from 035% to 125% above the LIBOR
for borrowings denominated in U.S. dollars, the Eurocurrency Interbank Offered
Rate EURIBOR for borrowings denominated in euros, or other relevant
international interest rate for borrowings denominated in another currency. The
interest rate spread is based upon the company debt ratings. In addition, the
company is required to pay a facility fee on the line of credit of 0075% to
025% based upon the company debt ratings. The interest and facility fees are
payable quarterly.
53 The credit agreement contains customary default provisions, leverage and
interest coverage restrictions and certain restrictions on secured and
subsidiary debt, disposition of assets, liens and mergers and acquisitions. The
364-day portion of the $5000 million credit facility had a maturity date of May
28, 2003. During May 2003, each lender approved the extension of the $2000
million 364-day portion of the revolving credit facility with a new maturity
date of May 26, 2004. The company did not renew the $2000 million 364-day
portion of the revolving credit facility in 2004. The 3-year portion of the
credit facility has a maturity date of May 29, 2005. As of December 31, 2004 and
2003, there were no amounts outstanding under the credit facility.
Effective January 20, 2005, the company entered into a $3000 million 5-year
senior, unsecured, multicurrency revolving credit facility with a group of
banks. Upon entering into the new credit agreement, the company terminated the
prior $3000 million unsecured, revolving credit facility that was due to expire
on May 29, 2005. There were no amounts outstanding under the prior facility upon
its termination. Under the new credit facility, the company may borrow in
dollars, euros, British pounds sterling and Japanese yen. Under certain
circumstances, the aggregate amount available under the new facility may be
increased to a maximum of $5000 million.
Interest on all borrowings under the new facility depends upon the type of loan,
namely alternative base rate loans, swingline loans or eurocurrency loans.
Alternative base rate loans bear interest at the greater of the prime rate or
the federal funds rate plus one-half of one percent. Swingline loans limited to
$500 million bear interest at an agreed upon rate at the time of the
borrowing. Eurocurrency loans bear interest at the sum of i a LIBOR rate for
the applicable currency and interest period and ii an interest rate spread
based upon the company debt ratings ranging from 018% to 080%. In addition,
the company is required to pay a facility fee on the $3000 million line of
credit of 007% to 020% based upon the company debt ratings. The interest and
facility fees are payable at least quarterly.
The new credit agreement contains usual and customary default provisions,
leverage and interest coverage restrictions and certain restrictions on secured
and subsidiary debt, disposition of assets, liens and mergers and acquisitions.
The $3000 million new credit facility has a maturity date of January 20, 2010.
SHORT-TERM DEBT
The company Brazilian operation has a short-term, uncommitted line of credit
with an outstanding balance of $15 million and $11 million at December 31,
2004 and 2003, respectively. The interest rate on this line of credit varies
based upon the local prevailing interest rates at the time of borrowing, and
averaged approximately 19% and 25%, during 2004 and 2003, respectively.
During 2002, the company operation in the People Republic of China entered
into a short-term, uncommitted revolving loan facility. As of December 31, 2004
and 2003, there were no amounts outstanding under this facility. The interest
rate on this facility varies based upon the local prevailing interest rates at
the time of borrowing. While no amounts were outstanding under this facility at
December 31, 2004 and 2003, it was utilized during 2004 and 2003 and the
interest rate averaged approximately 5% during 2004 and 2003.
OTHER
In February 2001, the company filed a shelf registration statement with the SEC
to register $2000 million of debt securities. Due to the company strong cash
position, in early 2004 the company determined that it did not plan to utilize
the shelf registration, and on January 28, 2004, withdrew its registration
pursuant to the rules and regulations of the SEC.
Total cash paid for interest amounted to $108 million, $111 million and $126
million in 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively.

taxes payable and an increase in capital in excess of par.

During 2004, the Internal Revenue Service IRS completed its examination of
the company income tax returns for all years through 2001. As a result of the
completion of those audits, the company reversed previously accrued taxes,
reducing the income tax provision by $200 million, or $015 per share, in the
third quarter of 2004. The IRS has now started its examination of tax years 2002
and 2003. The company and its subsidiaries are also subject to tax examinations
in various state and foreign jurisdictions. The company believes that adequate
amounts have been provided for any adjustments that may result from these
examinations.
Deferred income taxes have not been provided on the undistributed earnings of
foreign subsidiaries. Undistributed earnings of non-U.S. subsidiaries included
in the consolidated retained earnings were approximately $1,234 million as of
December 31, 2004. It is not practicable to estimate the amount of additional
tax that may be payable on the foreign earnings. Other than considering the
implications of the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004 discussed in the next
paragraph, the company does not plan to initiate any action that would
precipitate the payment of income taxes.
On October 22, 2004, the President signed the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004
the Jobs Act. The Jobs Act creates a temporary incentive for U.S.
corporations to repatriate accumulated income earned abroad by providing an 85
percent dividends received deduction for certain dividends from controlled
foreign corporations. The deduction is subject to a number of limitations, and
as of today, uncertainty remains as to how to interpret numerous provisions in
the Jobs Act. The company is not yet in a position to decide on whether, and to
what extent, it might repatriate foreign earnings that have not yet been
remitted to the U.S. Based on the company analysis to date, it is possible
that the company could repatriate as much as $6839 million. If that full amount
is repatriated in 2005, the estimated income tax effect of that repatriation
would be approximately $70 million, based on the information available and the
law in effect on December 31, 2004. The company expects to conclude its analysis
of this repatriation incentive during 2005.

10. STOCKHOLDERS' EQUITY
The Class A common stock is voting and exchangeable for Class B common stock in
very limited circumstances. The Class B common stock is non-voting and is
convertible, subject to certain limitations, into Class A common stock.
At December 31, 2004, approximately 7128 million and 18 million shares of
Class A and Class B common stock were unissued and unreserved. These shares are
available for a variety of general corporate purposes, including future public
offerings to raise additional capital and for facilitating acquisitions.
In October 2004, the company received authorization from the board of directors
to repurchase an additional $10 billion of its Class A common stock for a total
repurchase authority of $24 billion. At December 31, 2004, there was
approximately $09 billion of share repurchase authority remaining. This
repurchase authority allows the company, at management discretion, to
selectively repurchase its stock from time to time in the open market or in
privately negotiated transactions depending upon market price and other factors.
During 2004, the company repurchased approximately 32 million shares at a cost
of approximately $281 million. As of December 31, 2004, since the inception of
the program, the company had repurchased approximately 380 million shares for
an aggregate cost of approximately $15 billion. As of December 31, 2004, the
company had reissued 04 million shares of previously repurchased shares in
connection with certain of its employee benefit programs. As a result of these
issuances, the net treasury shares outstanding at December 31, 2004, were 376
million.
In 1998, the company board of directors adopted a stockholder rights plan the
Rights Plan which provides existing stockholders with the right to purchase
one one-thousandth 0001 of a share of Series A Junior Participating preferred
stock for each share of Class A and Class B common stock held in the event of
certain changes in the company ownership. The rights will expire on January
31, 2009, unless earlier redeemed by the company.

shares of Class A common stock in 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively, were
outstanding but were not included in the computation of diluted net earnings per
share because the options' exercise prices were greater than the average market
price of the common shares and, therefore, the effect would have been
antidilutive.
12. STOCK INCENTIVE PLANS
The company has various stock incentive plans to encourage employees and
nonemployee directors to remain with the company and to more closely align their
interests with those of the company stockholders. Under the employee plans, as
of December 31, 2004, approximately 69 million shares of Class A common stock
are reserved for future grants in the form of stock options, stock appreciation
rights, restricted stock, performance shares or deferred stock units of which
up to 30 million shares can be used for restricted stock, performance shares
and deferred stock units. Under the nonemployee director plan, as of December
31, 2004, approximately 01 million shares of Class A common stock are reserved
for future grants in the form of stock options and deferred stock units. As of
December 31, 2004, awards under the programs have been limited to stock options,
restricted stock, performance shares and deferred stock units.
The exercise price of options awarded under stock option plans is at least equal
to the fair market value of the underlying common stock on the date of grant.
Generally options expire ten years from the date of grant. Options granted
during 2004 vest over a three-year period, based upon continued employment or
the completion of three years of service on the board of directors. Prior to
2004, options granted generally became fully vested at the end of five years.
The company applies APB 25 and related interpretations in accounting for its
plans. Accordingly, no compensation expense has been recognized for its
stock-based compensation plans other than for restricted stock,
performance-based awards and deferred stock units. Refer to significant
accounting policies -- stock-based compensation in Note 2 of the Notes to
Consolidated Financial Statements for the effects on net earnings and earnings
per share had the company applied the fair value methodology prescribed under
SFAS 123, as amended by SFAS 148.
The weighted average fair value of options granted during 2004, 2003 and 2002
was $1645, $2594 and $2414 per share, respectively.
58 The fair value of each option grant on the grant date was estimated using the
Black-Scholes option-pricing model with the following assumptions                                2004  2003  2002

-                      59 As of December 31, 2004, the company had granted approximately 576,000
restricted stock units and supplemental deferred stock units with various
vesting periods. During 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively, the company granted
77,000, 50,000 and 29,000 restricted stock units and supplemental deferred stock
units with weighted average grant prices of $8388, $6078 and $5202. As of
December 31, 2004, there were approximately 290,000 restricted stock units and
supplemental deferred stock units outstanding. The cost of the awards,
determined to be the fair market value of the shares at the date of grant, is
charged to compensation expense ratably over the vesting periods.
The company has also issued approximately 354,000 deferred stock units to
certain members of management who have elected to defer all or a portion of
their annual bonus into such units and to certain nonemployee directors who
elected to defer all or a portion of their annual retainer, chair retainer
and/or meeting fees into such units. These deferred stock units are 100% vested
at all times. As of December 31, 2004, there were approximately 164,000 such
deferred stock units outstanding.
In addition, the company awarded approximately 134,000 performance shares, the
vesting of which was based on the attainment of certain performance goals by the
end of the four-year period 1997 through 2000. Based on the certification in
early 2001 that such performance goals were satisfied, the shares were fully
vested but receipt of these shares was deferred by the grantees. In January
2003, 113,000 of these shares were issued and 21,000 shares were further
deferred until February 2005. The compensation expense in connection with the
performance shares was estimated over the four year period based on the fair
market value of the shares during that period. In order to mitigate the impact
of stock price changes on compensation expense, the company entered into a
forward equity contract on its common stock during 2000 which was settled in
cash in 2001.
The company recorded compensation expense of $25 million, $21 million and $30
million in 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively, related to these stock incentive
plans.
The company also has an Employee Stock Purchase Plan ESPP which enables
substantially all regular employees to purchase full or fractional shares of
Lexmark Class A common stock through payroll deductions of up to 10% of eligible
compensation. Effective July 1, 2002, the ESPP was amended whereby the share
price paid by an employee changed from 85% of the closing market price on the
last business day of each month, to 85% of the lesser of the closing market
price on i the last business day immediately preceding the first day of the
respective offering period and ii the last business day of the respective
offering period. The current plan provides semi-annual offering periods
beginning each January 1 and July 1. During 2004, 2003 and 2002, employees paid
the company $81 million, $79 million and $45 million, respectively, to
purchase approximately 125,000 shares, 160,000 shares and 93,000 shares,
respectively. As of December 31, 2004, there were approximately 23 million
shares of Class A common stock reserved for future purchase under the ESPP.
60 13. EMPLOYEE PENSION AND POSTRETIREMENT PLANS
The company and its subsidiaries have defined benefit and defined contribution
pension plans that cover a majority of its regular employees, and a supplemental
plan that covers certain executives. Medical, dental and life insurance plans
for retirees are provided by the company and certain of its non-U.S.
subsidiaries.
DEFINED BENEFIT PLANS
The non-U.S. pension plans are not significant and use economic assumptions
similar to the U.S. pension plan and therefore are not shown separately in the

corporate debt and annuity contracts. The U.S. defined benefit plan comprises a
significant portion of the assets and liabilities relating to the defined
benefit plans. The investment goal of the U.S. defined benefit plan is to
achieve an adequate net investment return in order to provide for future benefit
payments to its participants. The target asset allocation percentages approved
by the
62 compensation and pension committee of the company board of directors are 75%
equity securities and 25% fixed income securities. The plan currently employs
professional investment managers to invest in two asset classes: U.S. equity and
U.S. fixed income. Each investment manager operates under an investment
management contract that includes specific investment guidelines, requiring
among other actions, adequate diversification, prudent use of derivatives and
standard risk management practices such as portfolio constraints relating to
established benchmarks. The plan currently uses a combination of both active
management and passive index funds to achieve its investment goals.
The company U.S. pension plan weighted-average asset allocations at December
31, 2004 and 2003, by asset category were as follows                                2004  2003

The company also sponsors defined contribution plans for employees in certain
countries. Company contributions are based upon a percentage of employees'
contributions. The company expense under these plans was $128 million, $128
million and $114 million in 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively.
ADDITIONAL INFORMATION
Other postretirement benefits For measurement purposes, a 90% annual rate of increase in the per capita cost
of covered health care benefits was assumed for 2005. The rate is assumed to
decrease gradually to 525% in 2012 and remain at that level thereafter. Since
the net employer costs for postretirement medical benefits reach the preset caps
within the next one to three years, a 1% increase or decrease in trend has a de
minimis effect on costs.
Related to the company acquisition of the Information Products Corporation
from IBM in 1991, IBM agreed to pay for its pro rata share currently estimated
at $777 million of future postretirement benefits for all the company U.S.
employees based on pro rated years of service with IBM and the company.
As discussed in Note 2 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, FSP
106-2, Accounting and Disclosure Requirements Related to the Medicare
Prescription Drug Improvement and Modernization Act of 2003 the Act, was
effective for the first interim or annual period beginning after June 15, 2004.
Also, on January 21, 2005, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services
released final regulations implementing major provisions of the Act. The company
is eligible to receive the subsidy, but only for a limited number of retired
individuals who are receiving benefits under a plan provision that is no longer
offered to employees. The effects of the Act and the new regulations were not
significant for the company.
Cash flows In 2005, the company is currently expecting to contribute $60 million to its
pension and postretirement plans.

DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS AND HEDGING ACTIVITIES
The company activities expose it to a variety of market risks, including the
effects of changes in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates. The
company risk management program seeks to reduce the potentially adverse
effects that market risks may have on its operating results.
The company maintains a foreign currency risk management strategy that uses
derivative instruments to protect its interests from unanticipated fluctuations
in earnings and cash flows caused by volatility in currency exchange rates. The
company does not hold or issue financial instruments for trading purposes nor
does it hold or issue leveraged derivative instruments. The company maintains an
interest rate risk management strategy that may, from time to time use
derivative instruments to minimize significant, unanticipated earnings
fluctuations caused by interest rate volatility. By using derivative financial
instruments to hedge exposures to changes in exchange rates and interest rates,
the company exposes itself to credit risk and market risk. The company manages
exposure to counterparty credit risk by entering into derivative financial
instruments with highly rated institutions that can be expected to fully perform
under the terms of the agreement. Market risk is the adverse effect on the value
of a financial instrument that results from a change in currency exchange rates
or interest rates. The company manages exposure to market risk associated with
interest rate and foreign exchange contracts by establishing and monitoring
parameters that limit the types and degree of market risk that may be
undertaken.
The company uses the following hedging strategies to reduce the potentially
adverse effects that market volatility may have on its operating results Fair Value Hedges: Fair value hedges are hedges of recognized assets or
liabilities. The company enters into forward exchange contracts to hedge actual
purchases and sales of inventories. The forward contracts used in this program
generally mature in three months or less, consistent with the related purchase
and sale commitments. Foreign exchange option contracts, as well as forward
contracts, may be used as fair value hedges in situations where derivative
instruments, for which hedge accounting has been discontinued, expose earnings
to further change in exchange rates. The company is using interest rate swaps to
convert its fixed rate financing activities to variable rates.
Cash Flow Hedges: Cash flow hedges are hedges of forecasted transactions or of
the variability of cash flows to be received or paid related to a recognized
asset or liability. The company enters into foreign exchange options and forward
exchange contracts expiring within eighteen months as hedges of anticipated
purchases and sales that are denominated in foreign currencies. These contracts
are entered into to protect against the risk that the eventual cash flows
resulting from such transactions will be adversely affected by changes in
exchange rates. The company also enters into currency swap contracts to hedge
foreign currency risks that result from the transfer
64 of various currencies within the company. The currency swap contracts entered
into generally expire within one month.
ACCOUNTING FOR DERIVATIVES AND HEDGING ACTIVITIES
All derivatives are recognized in the Consolidated Statements of Financial
Position at their fair value. Fair values for the company derivative financial
instruments are based on quoted market prices of comparable instruments or, if
none are available, on pricing models or formulas using current assumptions. On
the date the derivative contract is entered into, the company designates the
derivative as either a fair value or cash flow hedge. Changes in the fair value
of a derivative that is highly effective as -- and that is designated and
qualifies as -- a fair value hedge, along with the loss or gain on the hedged
asset or liability are recorded in current period earnings on the cost of
revenue line in the Consolidated Statements of Earnings. Changes in the fair
value of a derivative that is highly effective as -- and that is designated and
qualifies as -- a cash flow hedge are recorded in other comprehensive earnings
loss, until the underlying transactions occur, at which time the loss or gain
on the derivative is recorded in current period earnings on the cost of revenue
line in the Consolidated Statements of Earnings.
At December 31, 2004, the company had derivative assets of $136 million
recorded on the prepaid expenses and other current assets line in the
Consolidated Statements of Financial Position as well as derivative liabilities
of $495 million recorded on the accrued liabilities line in the Consolidated
Statements of Financial Position. At December 31, 2003, the company had
derivative assets of $81 million recorded on the prepaid expenses and other
current assets line in the Consolidated Statements of Financial Position as well
as derivative liabilities of $500 million recorded on the accrued liabilities
line in the Consolidated Statements of Financial Position. As of December 31,
2004, a total of $288 million of deferred net losses on derivative instruments
were accumulated in other comprehensive earnings loss, of which $288 million
is expected to be reclassified to earnings during the next twelve months. As of
December 31, 2003, a total of $365 million of deferred net losses on derivative
instruments were accumulated in other comprehensive earnings loss, of which
$353 million was reclassified to earnings during 2004.
The company formally documents all relationships between hedging instruments and
hedged items, as well as its risk management objective and strategy for
undertaking various hedge items. This process includes linking all derivatives
that are designated as fair value and cash flow to specific assets and
liabilities on the balance sheet or to forecasted transactions. The company also
formally assesses, both at the hedge inception and on an ongoing basis,
whether the derivatives that are used in hedging transactions are highly
effective in offsetting changes in fair value or cash flows of hedged items.
When it is determined that a derivative is not highly effective as a hedge or
that it has ceased to be a highly effective hedge, the company discontinues
hedge accounting prospectively, as discussed below.
The company discontinues hedge accounting prospectively when 1 it is
determined that a derivative is no longer effective in offsetting changes in the
fair value or cash flows of a hedged item; 2 the derivative expires or is
sold, terminated, or exercised or 3 the derivative is discontinued as a hedge
instrument, because it is unlikely that a forecasted transaction will occur.
When hedge accounting is discontinued because it is determined that the
derivative no longer qualifies as an effective fair value hedge, the derivative
will continue to be carried in the Consolidated Statements of Financial Position
at its fair value. When hedge accounting is discontinued because it is probable
that a forecasted transaction will not occur, the derivative will continue to be
carried in the Consolidated Statements of Financial Position at its fair value,
and gains and losses that were accumulated in other comprehensive earnings
loss are recognized immediately in earnings. In all other situations in which
hedge accounting is discontinued, the derivative will be carried at its fair
value in the Consolidated Statements of Financial Position, with changes in its
fair value recognized in current period earnings. A fair
65 value hedge is entered into when the derivative instrument, for which hedge
accounting has been discontinued, exposes earnings to further change in exchange
rates. An immaterial portion of the company cash flow hedges was determined to
be ineffective as of December 31, 2004 and 2003, because it was unlikely that
the forecasted transactions would occur. During 2004 and 2003, an immaterial
loss was reclassified to current period earnings.
The company recorded $71 million, $104 million and $130 million of aggregate
net foreign currency transaction losses in 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively.
The aggregate foreign currency transaction net loss amounts include the
gains/losses on the company foreign currency fair value hedges for all periods
presented.
FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS
At December 31, 2004, the carrying value of the company long-term debt was
$1495 million and the fair value was $1627 million. At December 31, 2003, the
carrying value of the company long-term debt was $1493 million and the fair
value was $1669 million. The fair value of the long-term debt was estimated
based on current rates available to the company for debt with similar
characteristics. At December 31, 2004 and 2003, the carrying value of the
company short-term debt was $15 million and $11 million, respectively, which
approximated its fair value.
During October 2003, the company entered into interest rate swap contracts to
convert its $1500 million principal amount of 675% senior notes from a fixed
interest rate to a variable interest rate. The interest rate swaps are
designated as a fair value hedge of the company $1500 million long-term debt.
The interest rate swaps are recorded at their fair value and the company
long-term debt is adjusted by the same corresponding value in accordance with
the short-cut method of SFAS 133. The fair value of the interest rate swaps is
combined with the fair value adjustment of the company long-term debt due to
immateriality and is presented on the long-term debt line in the company
Consolidated Statements of Financial Position. At December 31, 2004 and 2003,
the fair value of the interest rate swap contracts was a liability of $02
million and an asset of $04 million, respectively.
CONCENTRATIONS OF RISK
The company main concentrations of credit risk consist primarily of temporary
cash investments, marketable securities and trade receivables. Cash and
marketable securities investments are made in a variety of high quality
securities with prudent diversification requirements. Credit risk related to
trade receivables is dispersed across a large number of customers located in
various geographic areas. Collateral such as letters of credit and bank
guarantees is required in certain circumstances. The company sells a large
portion of its products through third-party distributors and resellers and
original equipment manufacturer OEM customers. If the financial condition or
operations of these distributors, resellers and OEM customers were to
deteriorate substantially, the company operating results could be adversely
affected. The three largest distributor, reseller and OEM customer trade
receivable balances collectively represented approximately 31% of total trade
receivables at December 31, 2004, and approximately 29% at December 31, 2003, of
which Dell receivables were $1472 million or 188% of total trade receivables
at December 31, 2004, and $1021 million or 154% of total trade receivables at
December 31, 2003. However, the company performs ongoing credit evaluations of
the financial position of its third-party distributors, resellers and other
customers to determine appropriate credit limits.
The company generally has experienced longer accounts receivable cycles in its
emerging markets, in particular, Asia Pacific and Latin America, when compared
to its U.S. and European markets. In the event that accounts receivable cycles
in these developing markets lengthen further, the company could be adversely
affected.
66 The company also procures a wide variety of components used in the manufacturing
process. Although many of these components are available from multiple sources,
the company often utilizes preferred supplier relationships to better ensure
more consistent quality, cost and delivery. The company also sources some
printer engines and finished products from OEMs. Typically, these preferred
suppliers maintain alternate processes and/or facilities to ensure continuity of
supply. Although the company plans in anticipation of its future requirements,
should these components not be available from any one of these suppliers, there
can be no assurance that production of certain of the company products would
not be disrupted.
15. RESTRUCTURING AND OTHER CHARGES
As of December 31, 2002, the company had substantially completed all
restructuring activities and, therefore, reversed approximately $59 million
$44 million, net of tax during the fourth quarter of 2002. The reversal was
primarily due to lower severance costs approximately $35 million and lower
other exit costs approximately $24 million. The severance payments were lower
than originally estimated due to higher than expected attrition, which resulted
in the company being able to achieve headcount reductions at a lower cost.
Although the restructuring activities were substantially complete at year-end
2002 and the employees exited the business, approximately $47 million of
severance payments were paid during 2003.
16. COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES
COMMITMENTS
The company is committed under operating leases containing various renewal
options for rental of office and manufacturing space and equipment. Rent
expense net of rental income of $26 million, $21 million and $20 million
was $517 million, $451 million and $414 million in 2004, 2003 and 2002,
respectively. Future minimum rentals under terms of non-cancelable operating
leases at December 31 are: 2005-$403 million; 2006-$348 million; 2007-$283
million; 2008-$215 million; 2009-$179 million and thereafter-$148 million.
Future sublease rental income at December 31 is: 2005-$04 million; 2006-$04
million and thereafter-$03 million.
CONTINGENCIES
Certain countries primarily in Europe and/or collecting societies representing
copyright owners' interests have commenced proceedings to impose fees on devices
such as scanners, printers and multifunction devices alleging the copyright
owners are entitled to compensation because these devices enable reproducing
copyrighted content. Other countries are also considering imposing fees on
certain devices. The amount of fees, if imposed, would depend on the number of
products sold and the amounts of the fee on each product, which will vary by
product and by country. The company has accrued amounts that it believes are
adequate to address the currently pending copyright fee proceedings. The
financial impact on the company, which will depend in large part upon the
outcome of local legislative processes, the company and other industry
participants' outcome in contesting the fees and the company ability to
mitigate that impact by increasing prices, which ability will depend upon
competitive market conditions, remains uncertain.
The company is subject to legal proceedings and claims that arise in the
ordinary course of business. The company does not believe that the outcome of
any of those matters will have a material adverse effect on the company
financial position, results of operations and cash flows.
67 17. SEGMENT DATA
The company manufactures and sells a variety of printing and multifunction
products and related supplies and services and is primarily managed along

70 REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM
To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of Lexmark International, Inc. We have completed an integrated audit of Lexmark International, Inc. 2004
consolidated financial statements and of its internal control over financial
reporting as of December 31, 2004 and audits of their 2003 and 2002 consolidated
financial statements in accordance with the standards of the Public Company
Accounting Oversight Board United States. Our opinions, based on our audits,
are presented below.
Consolidated financial statements and financial statement schedule
In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements listed in the accompanying
index present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of
Lexmark International, Inc. and its subsidiaries at December 31, 2004 and 2003,
and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three
years in the period ended December 31, 2004 in conformity with accounting
principles generally accepted in the United States of America. In addition, in
our opinion, the financial statement schedule listed in the index appearing
under a2 presents fairly, in all material respects, the information
set forth therein when read in conjunction with the related consolidated
financial statements. These financial statements and financial statement
schedule are the responsibility of the Company management. Our responsibility
is to express an opinion on these financial statements and financial statement
schedule based on our audits. We conducted our audits of these statements in
accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board
United States. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to
obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of
material misstatement. An audit of financial statements includes examining, on a
test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial
statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates
made by management, and evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.
We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
Internal control over financial reporting
Also, in our opinion, management assessment, included in Management Report
on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting appearing under Item 9A, that the
Company maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of
December 31, 2004 based on the criteria established in Internal
Control -- Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring
Organizations of the Treadway Commission COSO, is fairly stated, in all
material respects, based on those criteria. Furthermore, in our opinion, the
Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over
financial reporting as of December 31, 2004, based on criteria established in
Internal Control -- Integrated Framework issued by COSO. The Company
management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over
financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal
control over financial reporting. Our responsibility is to express opinions on
management assessment and on the effectiveness of the Company internal
control over financial reporting based on our audit. We conducted our audit of
internal control over financial reporting in accordance with the standards of
the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board United States. Those standards
require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about
whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in
all material respects. An audit of internal control over financial reporting
includes obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial
reporting, evaluating management assessment, testing and evaluating the design
and operating effectiveness of internal control, and performing such other
procedures as we consider necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our
audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinions.
71 A company internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to
provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting
and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance
with generally accepted accounting principles. A company internal control over
financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that i pertain to
the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly
reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; ii
provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to
permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted
accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are
being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of
the company; and iii provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or
timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the
company assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting
may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of
effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become
inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance
with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. s/ PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP
