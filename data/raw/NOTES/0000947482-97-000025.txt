Notes to Consolidated Financial                      REPORT OF INDEPENDENT ACCOUNTANTS
To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of HPR Inc   We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of HPR Inc. as
of June 30, 1996 and 1997, and the related consolidated statements of
operations, stockholders' equity and cash flows for each of the three years in
the period ended June 30, 1997.  These  financial  statements  are the
responsibility of the Company management. Our responsibility is to express an
opinion on these financial statements based on our audits.
We conducted our audits in accordance with generally accepted auditing
standards. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material
misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting
the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes
assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by
management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.
We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly,
in all material respects, the consolidated financial position of HPR Inc. as of
June 30, 1996 and 1997 and the consolidated results of its operations and its
cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended June 30, 1997, in
conformity with generally accepted accounting principles.                             COOPERS & LYBRAND L.L.P.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
1 Description of Business
HPR develops and markets software and proprietary  database products
incorporating clinical knowledge that enable payors and providers of healthcare
services to better manage the financial risk associated with the delivery of
healthcare and the quality of care. HPR products are used to manage healthcare
costs and quality of care by clinically evaluating providers' claims for
payment; measuring efficiency, quality, and medical outcomes; determining
appropriate utilization of medical services; influencing physician referral
patterns and profiling practice patterns; assisting in HEDISR reporting; and
managing and supporting the physician credentialing and accreditation processes.
The Company clinical knowledge bases are developed and maintained by a full
time medical staff in consultation with board-certified physicians serving on
Company-organized panels.
The Company products are designed to meet the needs of parties assuming
financial risk for the delivery of healthcare. HPR believes that providing
clinical knowledge in usable form is essential to its customers. The Company
believes it can be distinguished from its competitors through the depth and
integrity of its clinical knowledge bases. HPR is currently marketing its
CodeReviewR, Medicare CodeReviewTM, ProMatchTM, Patterns ReviewR, CRMS
FundamentalsTM,  Episode  ProfilerTM,  Quality  ProfilerTM,  Referral
ProfilerTM, Patterns ProfilerTM, HealthPlan ReporterTM, CredentialerTM,
and CCMS CoreTM products. HPR markets its products through a combination of a
national direct sales force and third-party marketing agreements.
The Company was incorporated on September 28, 1987 in Massachusetts under
the name HPR, Inc. The Company re-incorporated in Delaware on December 20, 1991,
under the name Health Payment Review, Inc. On July 24, 1995, the name of the
Company was changed to HPR Inc. Unless the context otherwise requires,
references herein to the Company and HPR refer to HPR Inc., a Delaware
corporation, its wholly-owned subsidiaries and HPR, Inc., its Massachusetts
predecessor. On June 3, 1992, Concurrent Review Technology, Inc., a California
corporation, was merged into the Company wholly-owned subsidiary, Concurrent
Review Technology, Inc., a Delaware corporation. On August 16, 1995 the Company
established a wholly-owned subsidiary, HPR Securities Corp., a Massachusetts
corporation. On April 30, 1996, the Company acquired The Integrity Group, Inc.,
an Alabama corporation, which became a wholly-owned subsidiary of HPR. On April
18, 1997 the Company established a wholly-owned subsidiary, HPR International,
Inc., a Barbados corporation. 2 Summary of Significant Accounting Policies
Principles of Consolidation
The accompanying financial statements include the accounts of the Company
and its wholly-owned subsidiaries, Concurrent Review Technology, Inc., HPR
Securities Corp., The Integrity Group, Inc., and HPR International, Inc. All
significant intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated in
consolidation.
Financial Statement Presentation
On July 20, 1995, the stockholders of the Company approved a 25-for-1 stock
split of the Company common stock and preferred stock and approved an increase
of the authorized number of common shares to 35,000,000 and of preferred shares
to 3,000,000. On April 16, 1996, the Company announced a stock split effected in
the form of a 100% stock dividend to all shareholders of record on April 26,
1996. The stock dividend was granted on May 6, 1996. Accordingly, all share and
per share amounts have been adjusted to reflect the stock splits as though they
had occurred at the beginning of the initial period presented.
Reclassification
Certain  reclassifications  have been made to prior year financial
statements to conform to the fiscal 1997 presentation.
Cash and Cash Equivalents
The Company considers all highly liquid instruments purchased with original
maturities of three months or less at the time of acquisition to be cash
equivalents. Cash and cash equivalents include U.S. government obligations and
U.S. government money market mutual funds used for temporary cash management
purposes.
Investments in Marketable Securities
In accordance with FAS 115, the Company  determines the appropriate
classification of its investments in debt and equity securities at the time of
purchase and reevaluates such determination at each balance sheet date. Debt
securities which the Company has the intent or ability to hold to maturity are
classified as held to maturity. The Company held no investments in equity
securities at June 30, 1996 and 1997. Securities held to maturity are carried at
amortized cost which approximates fair market value. At June 30, 1997 the
Company had no investments that qualified as trading or available for sale. The
Company classifies investments that mature greater than 12 months from the
balance sheet date as long term investments.
Concentration of Credit Risk
Financial instruments which potentially expose the Company to concentrations
of credit risk consist primarily of cash, investments, and accounts and contract
receivables. The Company places its temporary cash investments in three
financial institutions. The Company has not experienced any losses on these
investments to date. The Company has not experienced significant losses related
to receivables from individual customers or groups of customers in the
healthcare industry or by geographic area.
Property and Equipment
Property and equipment are stated at cost. Depreciation is computed on a
straight-line basis over a two-to five year estimated useful life for all
property and equipment with the exception of leasehold improvements, which are
amortized over the shorter of the life of the improvement or the remaining life
of the lease. Repairs and maintenance costs are charged to expense as incurred.
Upon retirement or sale, the cost of the assets disposed of and the related
accumulated depreciation are removed from the accounts and any resulting gain or
loss is included in the determination of net income.
Software Development Costs
The Company capitalizes software costs for internally developed software in
accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 86, Accounting
for the Costs of Computer Software to be Sold, Leased or Otherwise Marketed.
These costs relate primarily to the development of new products and extending
existing applications to new markets or platforms using existing technologies
and programming methods.  All costs incurred to establish  technological
feasibility are charged to expenses as incurred. Internally developed software
costs capitalized were $591,261, $366,332 and $1,025,009 for fiscal years 1995,
1996, and 1997, respectively. The capitalized costs are amortized on a
straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives typically three years,
commencing when each product is available to the market. Amortization of these
software development costs is included in costs of revenues. Amortization
expense for computer software was $608,285, $578,125 and $550,782 during 1995,
1996, and 1997, respectively. Accumulated amortization of software development
costs was $1,438,254, $2,016,379 and $2,567,161 at June 30, 1995, 1996, and
1997, respectively.
The Company evaluates,  on a quarterly basis, the recoverability of
capitalized software costs on the basis of whether such costs are fully
recoverable from projected undiscounted cash flows of individual products. In
performing its evaluation, the Company must make estimates of anticipated future
gross revenues as well as the remaining economic life of the product. It is
reasonably possible that those estimates could be reduced in the near term as a
result of items such as competitive pressures. As a result, the carrying amount
of the capitalized software costs for a particular product line may be reduced
materially in the near term.
Revenue Recognition
The Company licenses its products  primarily  pursuant to multi-year
non-cancellable agreements that provide for payment of equal annual license fees
over their terms. The Company recognizes revenue in accordance with Statement of
Position No. 91-1, Software Revenue Recognition, issued by the American
Institute of Certified Public Accountants. Revenue from software license
agreements is recognized upon execution of a contract and shipment of the
software provided that no significant vendor obligations remain outstanding and
the related receivable is due within one year of the contract date and
collection is deemed probable by management. For recurring license fees,
revenues are recognized on the contract anniversary date. The Company also
accrues incidental support costs associated with these licenses when revenues
are recognized. Revenues from services are recognized when the services are
delivered.
In fiscal 1995, the Company retroactively changed its method of recognizing
renewal or recurring revenue from the recognition of the annual contract amount
ratably over the renewal period to the recognition of the entire recurring
amount on the contract anniversary date. The change was made in accordance with
the Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 20 in contemplation of an initial
public distribution of the financial statements. The financial statements for
all periods presented have been restated to reflect the change in accounting.
The effect of the restatement was an increase to revenue of $1,703,000 for the
year ended June 30, 1995. The effect of the restatement was an increase to net
income and net income per share of $987,000 or $007.
Customer payment terms vary. Amounts billed in advance of satisfying revenue
recognition criteria are classified in current and long term liabilities as
deferred revenue in the accompanying balance sheets. Costs and earnings
recognized in advance of billing are classified in current assets as contract
receivables.
Research and Development
Research and development costs are charged to expense as incurred.
Income Taxes
Under the liability method specified by SFAS No. 109, a deferred tax asset
or liability is determined based on the difference between the financial
statement and tax basis of assets and liabilities, as measured by the enacted
tax rates expected to apply when these differences reverse. SFAS No. 109 also
requires a valuation allowance against net deferred tax assets if, based upon
the available evidence, it is more likely than not that some or all of the
deferred tax assets will not be realized.
Net Income Per Share
Net income per share of common stock is computed for each year based upon
the weighted average number of common shares outstanding and dilutive common
stock equivalents. For purposes of this calculation, outstanding options are
considered common stock equivalents using the treasury stock method. Pursuant
to Securities and Exchange Commission Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 83, common
and common equivalent shares issued during the 12 month period prior to the date
of the initial filing of the Company Registration Statement have been included
in the calculation, using the treasury stock method, as if they were outstanding
for all periods presented. Fair market value for the purpose of this calculation
was assumed to be $675, which is the midpoint of the initial public offering
price range. The number of shares used in this calculation has been adjusted to
reflect a 25-for-1 stock split in July 1995 and a 2 for 1 stock split effected
in the form of a 100% stock dividend in May 1996.
Use of Estimates in the Preparation of the Financial Statements
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally
accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and
assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and
disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial
statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the
reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. 3 Line of Credit
On February 1, 1997, the Company received an extension and modification of
its revolving bank credit facility from $5,000,000 to $7,500,000 with an
expiration  date of December 30, 1997. The $7,500,000 bank line is an
uncollateralized borrowing line. The current and prior agreements require the
Company to achieve certain levels of tangible net worth and to maintain certain
financial ratios. Borrowings under the new agreement bear interest at prime
rate, 850% at June 30, 1997. During 1996 and 1997 the line of credit was
unused; therefore, no interest was paid.

respectively.
The Company Executive Separation Benefits Plan provides for severance
payments to be made to members of its senior management in the event of
termination of the eligible employee employment. The Plan provides for payment
for up to 24 months of annual base salary upon termination by the Company for
reasons other than disability or good cause as defined therein. The Company
Non-Executive Separation Benefits Plan for key contributors and other employees
as defined therein provides for payment of up to six months annual base salary
upon termination by the Company for reasons other than disability or good
cause as defined.
The Company has also entered into non-competition agreements with certain of
its executive officers. These agreements provide that upon termination of such
officer employment by the Company, he or she will refrain for a period of up
to 24 months, to be determined by the Company, from certain competitive
activities with respect to the Company. If the Company exercises its option to
restrain any such officer from competitive activity, it will pay such officer
33% of his or her monthly salary as of termination for each month for which the
executive officer agrees to refrain from competing with the Company.
The Company has third party royalty and marketing agreements for certain of
its products. The agreements call for the payment of predetermined royalty
amounts over the life of the Company software license agreements with
customers. All amounts due under such agreements have been accrued as of June
30, 1997. 7 Income Taxes
The Company follows SFAS No. 109, Accounting for Income Taxes. Under SFAS

Stock Option Plans
1991 Stock Plan. The Company 1991 Stock Plan the 1991 Stock Plan
provides for the grant of nonqualified and incentive stock options to employees
and others to purchase up to 1,160,000 shares of the Company common stock.
Options granted under the plan are exercisable at the fair market value of the
stock at the date of grant, are exercisable in full at any time, vest over three
to four years and expire ten years from the date of grant.
1995 Stock Plan. The Company 1995 Stock Plan the 1995 Stock Plan was
approved by the Board of Directors on June 26, 1995, and by the Company
stockholders on July 20, 1995, and amended by the Board of Directors on July 22,
1996 and approved as amended by the Company stockholders on November 1,
1996. The 1995 Stock Plan provides for the grant or award of stock options,
restricted stock, stock appreciation rights and other performance awards which
may or may not be denominated in shares of Common Stock or other securities
collectively, the Awards. Stock options granted under the 1995 Stock Plan

the 1995 Stock Plan is to attract and retain outstanding employees through the
incentives of stock ownership and monetary payments. Every regular full-time
employee of the Company, including officers but excluding directors who are not
officers, is eligible to receive awards.
The 1995 Stock Plan is administered by the Compensation Committee of the
Board of Directors. Subject to the provisions of the 1995 Stock Plan and
approval by the Board of Directors, the Compensation Committee has the authority
to designate participants, determine the types of Awards to be granted, the
number of shares to be covered by each Award, the time at which each Award is
exercisable or may be settled, the method of payment and any other terms and
conditions of the Awards. All Awards are evidenced by an Award Agreement between
the Company and the participant.
While the Compensation Committee determines the prices at which options and
other Awards may be exercised under the 1995 Stock Plan, the exercise price per
share of an incentive stock option shall be at least 100% of the fair market
value as determined under the terms of the 1995 Stock Plan of a share of
Common Stock on the date of grant. The aggregate number of shares of Common
Stock available for awards under the Plan is 2,035,000. The maximum term for
Awards under the 1995 Stock Plan is ten years, and no Awards may be made under
the 1995 Stock Plan after June 25, 2005.
During 1996 employees of The Integrity Group, Inc. were granted options to
purchase 8,254 shares of common stock at a price per share of $049 which was
below the fair market value at the date of the grant. This discount from fair
market value has been recorded as deferred compensation and charged to expense
ratably over the four year vesting period of the options.
1995 Eligible Directors Stock Plan. The Company 1995 Eligible Directors

officer or employee of the Company or any subsidiary of the Company an outside
director will be granted, upon first being elected to the Board of Directors,
an option to purchase 10,000 shares of Common Stock at an exercise price equal
to the fair market value on the date of the grant. In addition, upon
re-election, each outside director will be granted an option on the thirtieth
day following the date of each annual meeting of stockholders to purchase 4,000
shares of Common Stock at an exercise price equal to the fair market value on
the date of grant. A total of 150,000 shares of Common Stock are available for
awards under the Directors Stock Plan, as amended July 22, 1996 and approved by
shareholders on November 1, 1996. The options granted under the Directors Stock

Based Compensation, which is effective for periods beginning after December 15,
1995. SFAS 123 requires that companies either recognize compensation expense for
grants of stock, stock options and other equity instruments based on fair value,
or provide pro forma disclosure of net income and earnings per share in the
notes of the financial statements. The Company adopted the disclosure provisions
of SFAS 123 effective July 1, 1996 and has applied APB Opinion 25 and related
interpretations in accounting for its plans. Accordingly, no compensation cost
has been recognized for stock options issued to employees at fair market value.
Had compensation cost for the Company stock-based compensation plans been
determined based on the fair value at the grant dates as calculated in
accordance with SFAS 123, the Company net income and earnings per share for
the years ended June 30, 1996 and 1997 would have been adjusted to the pro forma
amounts indicated below                     1996                    1997

Net income per share     $029        $028         $044         $041   The fair value of each stock option is estimated on the date of grant using
the Black-Scholes option-pricing model with the following weighted-average
assumptions for the years ended June 30, 1996 and 1997                   1996        1997

likely to be representative of the effects on reported net income for future
years. Additional awards in future years are anticipated. SFAS 123 does not
apply to awards prior to 1995. 10 Employee Benefits
The Health Payment Review, Inc. 401k Plan is a defined contribution plan
available to substantially all of HPR employees. The 401k Plan was
established effective June 1, 1993 under section 401k of the Internal Revenue
Code. Under the Plan, employees may make voluntary contributions based on a
percentage of their pretax earnings. HPR contributions to the Plan are
established each year at the discretion of the Board of Directors. No Company
contributions were made to the Plan in fiscal 1995, 1996, and 1997. The Company
paid administrative costs on behalf of the Plan of $6,500, $12,500, and $15,000
in fiscal 1995, 1996 and 1997, respectively. 11 Legal Proceedings
On January 31, 1994, a suit was filed in the U.S. District Court for the
Eastern District of Pennsylvania by GMIS, Inc. GMIS against the Company,
alleging that the Company patent relating to its CodeReview product was
invalid, not infringed, and unenforceable. GMIS also alleged that the Company
interfered with the business relationships of GMIS and sued for damages of an
unspecified amount.
The Company filed a patent infringement counterclaim on March 25, 1994
alleging, among other things, that GMIS' product, ClaimCheck, infringed upon the
patent.
On January 23, 1995 the Company settled all of its outstanding claims with
GMIS. Pursuant to the settlement, the terms of which were undisclosed, the
Company granted GMIS a nonexclusive license under the patent, and GMIS
acknowledged the validity of the patent and made a one-time payment to the
Company. The payment was recorded by the Company net of legal and other costs.
12   Acquisitions
On April 30, 1996 the Company acquired The Integrity Group, Inc. TIG,
an Alabama corporation, in a transaction accounted for as a pooling of interests
under which all of the capital stock of TIG was exchanged for 260,001 shares of
HPR Inc. common stock. TIG is a vendor of provider credentialing, accreditation
support, Healthcare Employer Data Information Set HEDIS reporting and data
warehousing tools and support for effective provider network management. The
accompanying financial statements for periods prior to 1996 do not include the
amounts for this acquisition as they were deemed to be immaterial. Only 1996
financial information has been restated as if the transaction had occurred as of
July 1, 1995.
TIG was a Subchapter S corporation for income tax purposes and, therefore,
did not pay U.S. federal income taxes. TIG has been included in the Company
U.S. federal income tax return effective April 30, 1996. 12   Recent Accounting Pronouncements
The FASB issued Statement No. 128 SFAS 128, Earnings per Share,
which modifies the way in which earnings per share EPS is calculated
and disclosed. Currently, the Company discloses primary EPS. Upon adoption
of this standard for the fiscal period ending June 30, 1998, the Company
will be required to disclose either basic EPS or both basic and dilutive
EPS. The principal difference being that common stock equivalents would not
be considered in the computation of basic EPS. The impact of adoption of
SFAS 128 has not yet been determined.
The FASB recently issued Statement No. 130 SFAS 130, Reporting
Comprehensive Income. This statement requires changes in comprehensive
income to be shown in a financial statement that is displayed with the same
prominence as other financial statements. While not mandating a specific
financial  statement format,  the Statement requires that an amount
representing total comprehensive income be reported. Comprehensive income
components include: unrealized gains and losses on available-for-sale
investments in debt and equity securities, foreign currency translation
adjustments, and minimum pension liability adjustments. The Statement will
become effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 1997.
Reclassification of financial statements for earlier periods is required
for comparative purposes. The Company does not believe that this will have
a material impact on the results of operations.
In June 1997, the Financial Accounting Standard Board issued Statement
of Financial Accounting No. 131, Disclosures about Segments of an
Enterprise and Related Information SFAS No. 131. SFAS No. 131 specifies
new guidelines for determining a company operating segments and related
requirements for disclosure. The Company does not believe that this
statement will have an impact on the presentation of the financial
statements and the disclosures therein. Item 9.  Changes in and Disagreements with Accountants on Accounting and
