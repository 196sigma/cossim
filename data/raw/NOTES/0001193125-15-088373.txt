Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm 
The Board of Directors and Stockholders Antares Pharma, Inc.:
We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Antares Pharma, Inc. and subsidiaries the Company as of December31, 2014 and
2013, and the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive loss, stockholders equity, and cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended December31, 2014. We also have audited the Companys internal
control over financial reporting as of December31, 2014, based on criteria established in Internal Control Integrated Framework 1992issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission COSO.
The Companys management is responsible for these consolidated financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting,
included in the accompanying Managements Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated financial statements and an opinion on the Companys internal control
over financial reporting based on our audits. We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board
United States. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was
maintained in all material respects. Our audits of the consolidated financial statements included examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and
significant estimates made by management, and evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing
the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the
circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions. A companys internal control over financial reporting is a
process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A companys
internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that 1pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the
company; 2provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company
are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and 3provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the
companys assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial
reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance
with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material
respects, the financial position of Antares Pharma, Inc. and subsidiaries as of December31, 2014 and 2013, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended December31, 2014, in
conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. Also in our opinion, Antares Pharma, Inc. and subsidiaries maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December31, 2014, based
on criteria established in Internal Control Integrated Framework 1992issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  1.
Description of Business 
Antares Pharma, Inc. Antares or the Company is an emerging, specialty pharmaceutical company that
focuses on developing and commercializing self-administered parenteral pharmaceutical products and technologies. Antares has numerous partnerships with pharmaceutical companies as well as multiple internal product development programs. 
The Company develops and manufactures for itself and with partners, novel, pressure-assisted injectors, with and without needles, which allow
patients to self-inject drugs. Antares has developed variations of the needle-free injector by adding a small shielded needle to a pre-filled, single-use disposable injector, called the Vibex
pressure assisted auto injection system. This system is an alternative to the needle-free system for use with injectable drugs in unit dose containers and is suitable for branded and generic injectables. Antares also developed a disposable
multi-dose pen injector for use with standard cartridges. The Company has entered into multiple licenses for these devices mainly in the United States U.S., Europe and Canada with Teva Pharmaceutical Industries, Ltd.
Teva. The Company has developed the Vibex auto injector for its
product OTREXUP methotrexate injection. In February 2014, Antares launched OTREXUP methotrexate injection, which is the first FDA-approved subcutaneous methotrexate for once weekly self-administration with an easy-to-use, single
dose, disposable auto injector. OTREXUP is indicated for adults with severe active rheumatoid arthritis RA, children with active polyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis pJIA and adults with severe recalcitrant
psoriasis. To date, Antares has received FDA approval for dosage strengths of 75 mg, 10 mg, 15 mg, 20 mg and 25 mg of OTREXUP. The Company has worldwide marketing rights for OTREXUP and commercializes OTREXUP on its own in the
U.S. for the treatment of RA. The Company has provided LEO Pharma, Inc. LEO Pharma an exclusive license to commercialize OTREXUP in the U.S. for the treatment of psoriasis. 
The Company is currently conducting clinical studies of Vibex QS T, for testosterone
replacement therapy. On February25, 2015, Antares announced positive top-line pharmacokinetic results that showed that the primary endpoint was achieved in the Companys ongoing, multi-center, phase 3 clinical study QST-13-003
evaluating the efficacy and safety of testosterone enanthate administered once-weekly by subcutaneous injection using the QuickShot auto injector in testosterone deficient adult males. The
Company also has initiated manufacturing development work for QS M, a combination product for an undisclosed central nervous system CNS indication. 
Antares also is developing VIBEX Sumatriptan for the acute treatment of migraines
which if approved will be sold by Teva. In January 2015, the Company received a complete response letter from FDA regarding its Abbreviated New Drug Application ANDA for VIBEX
Sumatriptan, providing revisions to labelling and citing minor deficiencies, and the Company submitted its response in March 2015. The
Companys development projects in collaboration with Teva include VIBEX epinephrine, an exenatide multi-dose pen, and another undisclosed multi-dose pen. In December 2014, Teva submitted
the final amendment to the VIBEX epinephrine ANDA, and FDA accepted Tevas filing of an ANDA in October 2014 for exenatide, formerly referred to as Teva Pen 2. 
The Company also makes a reusable, needle-free, spring-action injector device known as the
Tjet and Zomajet, which is marketed for use with human growth hormone hGH. Antares has had success in achieving
distribution of our device for use with hGH through licenses to pharmaceutical partners, Ferring Pharmaceuticals BV Ferring and JCR Pharmaceuticals Co., Ltd. JCR, and it has resulted in product sales and royalties.
Ferring commercializes our needle-free injection system with their 4 mg and 10 mg hGH formulations marketed as Zomajet 2 Vision and
Zomajet Vision X worldwide. Ferring purchased the U.S. rights to 5 mg Tev-Tropin from Teva in the fourth quarter of 2014. Tev-Tropin 10 mg is pending FDA approval. Distribution of growth
hormone injectors occurs in the U.S., Europe, Japan and other Asian countries through our pharmaceutical company relationships. The
Company also has a portfolio of gel-based products which are commercialized through various partners. Antares received FDA approval in December 2011 for an oxybutynin gel product, Gelnique 3%, for the treatment of overactive bladder
OAB. The Company has a licensing agreement with Actavis plc Actavis under which Actavis is currently marketing Gelnique 3% in the U.S. Elestrin estradiol
gel is currently marketed by Meda Pharmaceuticals, Inc. Meda in the U.S. for the treatment of moderate-to-severe vasomotor symptoms associated with menopause.

Summary of Significant Accounting Policies 
Basis of Presentation 
The accompanying consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Antares Pharma, Inc. and its three wholly-owned subsidiaries. All
intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. Certain prior year amounts have been reclassified in the
consolidated financial statements to conform to the current year presentation.These reclassifications were made to presentselling, general and administrative expenses in one line in the consolidated statements of operations. In prior
years, sales and marketing expenses and general and administrative expenses were presented in separate lines. These reclassifications had no effect on previously reported net income or total operating expenses. 
Use of Estimates The preparation of
consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets
and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. The Companys significant accounting estimates relate to the revenue recognition periods for license
revenues, OTREXUP revenue recognition based on estimated patient prescriptions dispensed, inventory valuation, valuation of equity instruments used in stock-based compensation, and determination of the fair value and recoverability of goodwill
and patent rights. Actual results could differ from these estimates. Foreign Currency Translation 
The majority of the foreign subsidiaries revenues are denominated in U.S. dollars, and any required funding of the subsidiaries is provided by
the U.S. parent. Nearly all operating expenses of the foreign subsidiaries, including labor, materials, leasing arrangements and other operating costs, are denominated in Swiss Francs. Additionally, bank accounts held by foreign subsidiaries are
denominated in Swiss Francs, there is a low volume of intercompany transactions and there is not an extensive interrelationship between the operations of the subsidiaries and the parent company. As such, the Company has determined that the Swiss
Franc is the functional currency for its foreign subsidiaries. The reporting currency for the Company is the United States Dollar USD. The financial statements of the Companys foreign subsidiaries are translated into USD for
consolidation purposes. All assets and liabilities are translated using period-end exchange rates and statements of operations items are translated using average exchange rates for the period. The resulting translation adjustments are recorded as a
separate component of stockholders equity, comprising all of the accumulated other comprehensive income loss. Sales to certain customers by the U.S. parent are in currencies other than the U.S. dollar and are subject to foreign currency
exchange rate fluctuations. Foreign currency transaction gains and losses are included in foreign exchange gain loss in the consolidated statements of operations. 
Cash Equivalents The Company considers
highly liquid debt instruments with original maturities of 90 days or less to be cash equivalents. Allowance for Doubtful Accounts 
Trade accounts receivable are stated at the amount the Company expects to collect. The Company maintains allowances for doubtful accounts for
estimated losses resulting from the inability of its customers to make required payments. The Company considers the following factors when determining the collectability of specific customer accounts: customer credit-worthiness, past transaction
history with the customer, current economic industry trends, and changes in customer payment terms. At December31, 2014, over 98% of the Companys accounts receivable balance is due from OTREXUP distributors and its large
pharmaceutical partners Teva and Ferring. Each of these companies has historically paid timely and has been financially stable organizations. Due to the nature of the accounts receivable balance, the Company believes the risk of doubtful accounts is
minimal. If the financial 
68 Table of Contents
condition of the Companys customers were to deteriorate, adversely affecting their ability to make payments, additional allowances would be required. The Company provides for estimated
uncollectible amounts through a charge to earnings and a credit to a valuation allowance. Balances that remain outstanding after the Company has used reasonable collection efforts are written off through a charge to the valuation allowance and a
credit to accounts receivable. The Company recorded $37,000 of bad debt expense in 2014 and no bad debt expense in 2013 and 2012. The allowance for doubtful accounts balance was $10,000 at December31, 2014 and 2013. 
Inventories Inventories are stated at
the lower of cost or market. Cost is determined on a first-in, first-out basis. Certain components of the Companys products are provided by a limited number of vendors, and the Companys production and assembly operations are outsourced
to third-party suppliers where substantially all of the Companys inventory is located. Disruption of supply from key vendors or third-party suppliers may have a material adverse impact on the Companys operations. The Company provides
reserves for potentially excess, dated or obsolete inventories based on estimates of forecasted product demand and the likelihood of consumption in the normal course of business, considering the expiration dates of the inventories on hand, planned
production volumes and lead times required for restocking of customer inventories. Although every effort is made to ensure that forecasts and assessments are reasonable, changes to these assumptions are possible. In such cases, estimates may prove
inaccurate and result in an understatement or overstatement of the reserves required to fairly state such inventories. In connection with evaluation of OTREXUP inventory during 2014, the reserve for excess, dated or obsolete inventory was
increased to $3,600,000 at December31, 2014 from $50,000 at December31, 2013. Equipment, Molds, Furniture, and Fixtures 
Equipment, molds, furniture, and fixtures are stated at cost and are depreciated using the straight-line method over their estimated useful
lives ranging from three to ten years. Depreciation expense was $880,400, $359,471 and $145,775 for the years ended December31, 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively. 
Goodwill The Company has $1,095,355 of
goodwill recorded as of December31, 2014 that relates to the Minnesota reporting unit. The Company evaluates the carrying amount of goodwill on December31 of each year and between annual evaluations if events occur or circumstances
change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of the Minnesota reporting unit below its carrying amount. Such circumstances could include, but are not limited to: 1a significant adverse change in legal factors or in business
climate, 2unanticipated competition, 3an adverse action or assessment by a regulator, or 4a sustained significant drop in the Companys stock price. When evaluating whether goodwill is impaired, the Company compares the
fair value of the Minnesota reporting unit to the carrying amount, including goodwill. If the carrying amount of the Minnesota reporting unit exceeded its fair value, then the amount of the impairment loss would be measured. The impairment loss
would be calculated by comparing the implied fair value of goodwill to its carrying amount. In calculating the implied fair value of goodwill, the fair value of the Minnesota reporting unit would be allocated to all of its other assets and
liabilities based on their fair values. The excess of the fair value of the Minnesota reporting unit over the amount assigned to its other assets and liabilities is the implied fair value of goodwill. An impairment loss would be recognized when the
carrying amount of goodwill exceeds its implied fair value. In evaluating whether the fair value of the Minnesota reporting unit was
below its carrying amount, the Company used the market capitalization of the Company at December31, 2014, which was approximately $339 million, to calculate an estimate of fair value of the Minnesota reporting unit. The Company determined that
the percentage of the total market capitalization of the Company at December31, 2014 attributable to the Minnesota reporting unit would have to be unreasonably low before the fair value of the Minnesota reporting unit would be less than its
carrying amount. In making this determination, the Company evaluated the activity at the Minnesota reporting unit compared to the total Company activity, and considered the source and potential value of agreements currently in place, the source of
recent product sales and development revenue growth, the source of total Company revenue and the source of cash generating activities. After performing the market capitalization analysis and concluding that the fair value of the Minnesota reporting
unit was not below its carrying amount, the Company determined that no further detailed determination of fair value was required. The
Companys evaluation of goodwill resulted in no impairment losses in 2014, 2013 and 2012. 
69 Table of Contents
Patent Rights 
The Company capitalizes the costs of obtaining patent rights when there are projected future cash flows for marketed or partnered products
associated with the patent. These capitalized costs are being amortized on a straight-line basis over the shorter of the life of the patent or the estimated useful life of the patent, which typically is over periods ranging from five to fifteen
years beginning on the earlier of the date the patent is issued or the first commercial sale of product utilizing such patent rights. The
Company capitalizes external legal patent defense costs and costs for pursuing patent infringements when it determines that a successful outcome is probable and will lead to an increase in the value of the patent. The capitalized costs are amortized
over the remaining life of the related patent. If changes in the anticipated outcome were to occur that reduce the likelihood of a successful outcome of the entire action to less than probable, the capitalized costs would be charged to expense
inthe period in which the change is determined. As of December31, 2014 and 2013, approximately $1,800,000 and $100,000, respectively, of external legal patent costs were capitalized within patent rights, net. 
Patent amortization expense for the years ended December31, 2014, 2013 and 2012 was $343,817, $133,788 and $85,253, respectively, and is
recorded in general and administrative expenses in the consolidated statements of operations. Impairment of Long-Lived Assets and Long-Lived Assets to
Be Disposed Of Long-lived assets, including patent rights, are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances
indicate that the carrying amount of an asset or asset group may not be recoverable. Recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset to future net cash flows expected to be generated by the
asset or asset group. This analysis can be very subjective as the Company relies upon signed distribution or license agreements with variable cash flows to substantiate the recoverability of long-lived assets. If such assets are considered to be
impaired, the impairment to be recognized is measured by the amount by which the carrying amount of the assets exceeds the fair value of the assets. Assets to be disposed of are reported at the lower of the carrying amount or fair value less costs
to sell. Each year the Company reviews patent costs for impairment and identifies patents related to products for which there are no
signed distribution or license agreements or for which no revenues or cash flows are anticipated. In 2013, the Company recognized expense of $65,022 in connection with the write off of patent costs related to abandoned patents or patents no longer
connected with current products. No impairment charges were recognized in 2014 or 2012. The gross carrying amount and accumulated amortization of patents, which are the only intangible assets of the Company subject to amortization, were $4,468,166
and $1,583,142, respectively, at December31, 2014 and were $2,635,706 and $1,290,529, respectively, at December31, 2013. The Companys estimated aggregate patent amortization expense for the next five years is approximately
$523,000, $539,000, $539,000, $539,000 and $314,000 in 2015, 2016, 2017, 2018 and 2019, respectively. Fair Value of Financial Instruments 
Cash and cash equivalents are stated at cost, which approximates fair value. 
All short-term and long-term investments are U.S. Treasury bills or U.S. Treasury notes that are classified as held-to-maturity because the
Company has the positive intent and ability to hold the securities to maturity. The securities are carried at their amortized cost. The fair value of all securities is determined by quoted market prices, which is a Level 1 fair value measurement.
All long-term investments mature in less than two years. At December31, 2014 the short-term investments had a fair value of $6,005,040 and a carrying value of $6,002,438. At December31, 2013 the short-term investments had a fair value of
$24,021,522 and a carrying value of $24,014,305 and the long-term investments had a fair value of $6,007,851 and a carrying value of $6,008,169. 
Revenue Recognition The Company
recognizes revenue from the sale of products and from license fees, milestones and royalties. Revenue is recognized when ipersuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, iidelivery has occurred and title has passed, iiithe
price is fixed or determinable and ivcollectability is reasonably assured.

Otrexup Revenue Recognition 
In February 2014, the Company began detailing OTREXUP to health care professionals in the U.S. and began shipping to wholesale
pharmaceutical distributors, subject to rights of return within a period beginning six months prior to, and ending 12 months following, product expiration. Given the limited sales history of OTREXUP, the Company currently cannot reliably
estimate expected returns of the product at the time of shipment. Accordingly, recognition of revenue is deferred on product shipments of OTREXUP until the right of return no longer exists, which occurs at the earlier of the time OTREXUP
units are dispensed through patient prescriptions or expiration of the right of return. Units dispensed are generally not subject to return, except in the rare cases where the product malfunctions or the product is damaged in transit. Patient
prescriptions dispensed are estimated using third-party market prescription data. These third-party sources poll pharmacies, hospitals, mail order and other retail outlets for OTREXUP prescriptions and
project this sample on a national level. If patient prescriptions dispensed for a given period are underestimated or overestimated, adjustments to revenue may be necessary in future periods. 
The Company recognized $7,309,603 in OTREXUP product revenue, which is net of estimated wholesaler discounts, prompt pay discounts,
chargebacks, rebates and patient discount programs. A deferred revenue balance of $1,061,947 was recorded at December31, 2014 for OTREXUP product shipments, which is net of estimated wholesaler discounts, prompt pay discounts,
chargebacks, rebates and patient discount programs. The Company will continue to recognize revenue upon the earlier to occur of
prescription units dispensed or expiration of the right of return until there has been sufficient history to estimate product returns. When it becomes possible to reasonably estimate product returns, a one-time increase in net revenue will be
recorded to recognize revenue previously deferred, net of appropriate allowances for estimated wholesaler discounts, prompt pay discounts, chargebacks, rebates and patient discount programs. 
Product Sales Allowances 
The Company recognizes product sales allowances as a reduction of product sales in the same period the related revenue is recognized. Product
sales allowances are based on amounts owed or to be claimed on the related sales. These estimates take into consideration the terms of our agreements with customers and third-party payors and the levels of inventory within the distribution channels
that may result in future rebates or discounts taken. In certain cases, such as patient support programs, the Company recognizes the cost of patient discounts as a reduction of revenue based on estimated utilization. If actual future results vary,
it may be necessary to adjust these estimates, which could have an effect on product revenue in the period of adjustment. Product sales allowances include: 
Wholesaler Distribution Fees. Distribution fees are paid to certain wholesale distributors based on contractually determined rates. The
Company accrues the fee on shipment to the respective wholesale distributors and recognizes the fee as a reduction of revenue in the same period the related revenue is recognized. 
Prompt Pay Discounts. The Company offers cash discounts to its customers, generally 2% of the sales price, as an incentive for prompt
payment. The Company accounts for cash discounts by reducing accounts receivable by the prompt pay discount amount and recognizes the discount as a reduction of revenue in the same period the related revenue is recognized. 
Chargebacks. Through December31, 2014, the Company has been subject to a minimal amount of chargebacks. The Company expects to
provide discounts primarily to authorized users of the Federal Supply Schedule FSS of the General Services Administration under an FSS contract negotiated by the Department of Veterans Affairs and various organizations under Medicaid
contracts and regulations. These entities purchase products from the wholesale distributors at a discounted price, and the wholesale distributors then charge back to the Company the difference between the current wholesale acquisition cost and the
price the entity paid for the product. The Company will estimate and accrue chargebacks based on estimated wholesaler inventory levels, current contract prices and historical chargeback activity. Chargebacks are recognized as a reduction of revenue
in the same period the related revenue is recognized. Rebates. The Company participates in certain rebate programs, which provide
discounted prescriptions to qualified insured patients. As of December31, 2014, rebates have been primarily related to Medicare and Medicaid programs. Under these rebate programs, the Company will pay a rebate to the third-party administrator
of the program, generally two to three months after the quarter in which prescriptions subject to the rebate are filled. The 
71 Table of Contents
Company estimates and accrues for these rebates based on current contract prices, historical and estimated future percentages of product sold to qualified patients. Rebates are recognized as a
reduction of revenue in the same period the related revenue is recognized. Patient Discount Programs. The Company offers discount
card programs to patients for OTREXUP in which patients receive discounts on their prescriptions that are reimbursed by the Company. The Company estimates the total amount that will be redeemed based on historical redemption experience and on
levels of inventory in the distribution and retail channels and recognizes the discount as a reduction of revenue in the same period the related revenue is recognized. 
Other Revenue Recognition 
The Company sells its proprietary reusable needle-free injectors and related disposable products to pharmaceutical partners and through medical
product distributors. The Companys reusable injectors and related disposable products are not interchangeable with any competitive products and must be used together. The Company recognizes revenue upon shipment when title transfers. The
Company offers no price protection or return rights other than for customary warranty claims. Sales terms and pricing are governed by license and distribution agreements. 
Revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables are divided into separate units of accounting if certain criteria are met, including whether
the deliverable has stand-alone value to the customer, the customer has a general right of return relative to the delivered item and delivery or performance of the undelivered item is probable and substantially within the vendors control.
Arrangement consideration is allocated at the inception of the arrangement to all deliverables on the basis of their relative selling price. The selling price for each deliverable is determined using: ivendor-specific objective evidence of
selling price VSOE, if it exists, iithird-party evidence of selling price TPE if VSOE does not exist, and iiithe Companys best estimate of the selling price if neither VSOE nor TPE exists. For
transactions entered into prior to January1, 2011, revenue is recognized for each deliverable based upon the applicable revenue recognition criteria discussed above and upon acceptance of goods or performance of service. Effective
January1, 2011, for new or significantly modified transactions, the Company allocates revenue consideration, excluding contingent consideration, based on the relative selling prices of the separate units of accounting contained within an
arrangement containing multiple deliverables. Royalty revenues are recognized in the quarter earned when the Company has information
available to determine the royalty amount, however, the majority of the Companys royalty revenues are recognized one quarter in arrears as information is typically not available to determine quarterly royalty earnings until royalty statements
are received from partners. At December31, 2014, $10,807,596 of non-refundable cash payments received have been recorded as
deferred revenue in cases where the revenue is not immediately recognized due to the earnings process not yet having been completed. Shipping and
Handling Costs The Company records shipping and handling costs in cost of product sales. 
Share-Based Compensation The Company
utilizes share based compensation in the form of stock options, restricted stock units RSUs and performance-based restricted stock units PSUs. The Company records compensation expense associated with share based awards
granted to employees at the fair value of the award on the date of grant. The Company uses the Black-Scholes option valuation model to determine the fair value of stock options. The fair values of RSU and PSU grants containing service or performance
conditions are based on the market value of the Companys Common Stock on the date of grant. The fair value of PSUs containing a market condition are estimated using a Monte Carlo simulation. Pre-vesting forfeitures are estimated in the
determination of total stock-based compensation cost based on Company experience. The value of the portion of the award that is ultimately expected to vest is expensed ratably over the requisite service period as compensation expense in the
consolidated statement of operations. The determination of fair value of share-based payment awards on the grant date requires significant judgment. Assumptions concerning the Companys stock price volatility and projected employee exercise
behavior over the contractual life of the award can significantly impact the estimated fair value of an award. Given the Companys limited history, such assumptions may not be reflective of the patterns that will ultimately be experienced.

Product Warranty 
The Company provides a warranty on its reusable needle-free injector devices. Warranty terms for these devices sold to end-users by dealers and distributors are included in the device instruction manual included with each device sold. Warranty terms for these devices sold to pharmaceutical partners who provide their own warranty
terms to end-users are included in the contracts with the pharmaceutical partners. The Company is obligated to repair or replace, at the Companys option, a needle-free injector device found to be defective due to use of defective materials or
faulty workmanship. The warranty does not apply to any product that has been used in violation of instructions as to the use of the product or to any product that has been neglected, altered, abused or used for a purpose other than the one for which
it was manufactured. The warranty also does not apply to any damage or defect caused by unauthorized repair or the use of unauthorized parts. The warranty period on a needle-free injector device is typically 24 months from either the date of retail
sale of the device by a dealer or distributor or the date of shipment to a customer if specified by contract. The Company recognizes the estimated cost of warranty obligations at the time the products are shipped based on historical claims incurred
by the Company. Actual warranty claim costs could differ from these estimates. Warranty liability activity is as follows:  Balance atBeginningofYear Provisions Claims Balance atEnd ofYear 2014 100,000 5,100 5,100 100,000 2013 100,000 50,819 50,819 100,000 2012 100,000 72,893 72,893 100,000
Research and Development 
Research and development costs are expensed as incurred. In December 2014, the Company received an invoice from the FDA in the amount of
$970,840 for user fees related to OTREXUP for the twelve month period ending September30, 2014 for which approximately $243,000 should have been recorded for the year ended December31, 2013. The Company had not previously recorded
the expense associated with this invoice and the full amount was recorded in research and development expenses in the fourth quarter of 2014. The Company has evaluated this out of period adjustment and has determined that it is not material to the
Companys financial position or results of operations for 2013 or 2014. Income Taxes 
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement
carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are
expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date. Valuation allowances are established when necessary to reduce
deferred tax assets to the amount expected to be realized. As of December31, 2012, a valuation allowance was established to offset all of the Companys net deferred tax assets, and as of December31, 2013, a valuation allowance was
established to offset all of the U.S. net deferred tax assets. For the year ended December31, 2013, the Company determined it was more likely than not that a portion of the deferred tax assets would be realized and recorded an income tax
benefit of $300,000 after releasing $300,000 of the valuation allowance related to the Switzerland deferred tax assets. For the year ended December31, 2014, the Company recorded income tax expense related to the Swiss operations of $25,000,
reducing deferred tax assets to $275,000 at December31, 2014. Net Loss Per Share 
Basic net loss per share is computed by dividing net income or loss available to common stockholders by the weighted-average number of common
shares outstanding for the period. Diluted net loss per share is computed similar to basic net loss per share except that the weighted average shares outstanding are increased to include additional shares from the assumed exercise of stock options
and warrants, if dilutive. The number of additional 
73 Table of Contents
shares is calculated by assuming that outstanding stock options or warrants were exercised and that the proceeds from such exercise were used to acquire shares of common stock at the average
market price during the reporting period. All potentially dilutive common shares were excluded from the calculation because they were anti-dilutive for all periods presented. Potentially dilutive securities at December31, 2014, 2013 and 2012,
excluded from dilutive loss per share as their effect is anti-dilutive, are as follows: 2014 2013 2012 Stock options and warrants 7,245,485 8,242,992 10,830,530
Recent Accounting Pronouncements 
In July 2013, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update 2013-11, Presentation of an Unrecognized Tax Benefit When a Net Operating Loss
Carryforward, a Similar Tax Loss, or a Tax Credit Carryforward Exists ASU 2013-11. ASU 2013-11 amends accounting guidance on the presentation of an unrecognized tax benefit when a net operating loss carryforward, a similar tax
loss, or tax credit carryforward exists. This new guidance requires entities, if certain criteria are met, to present an unrecognized tax benefit, or portion of an unrecognized tax benefit, in the financial statements as a reduction to a deferred
tax asset for a net operating loss carryforward, a similar tax loss, or a tax credit carryforward when such items exist in the same taxing jurisdiction. The adoption of ASU 2013-11 is expected to reduce diversity in practice by providing guidance on
the presentation of unrecognized tax benefits. The provisions of ASU 2013-11 are effective for fiscal years and interim periods beginning after December15, 2013. The adoption of this update in the first quarter of 2014 did not have a material
effect on the Companys consolidated financial statements.  3.

Leases 
The Company has non-cancelable operating leases for its corporate headquarters facility in Ewing, New Jersey, and its
office, research and development facility in Plymouth, MN, a suburb of Minneapolis, MN. In December 2013, the Company entered into a lease agreement for approximately 18,000 square feet of office, research and development space in a new Plymouth
location, which the Company occupied in April 2014. The leases require payment of all executory costs such as maintenance and property taxes. Rent expense incurred for the years ended December31, 2014, 2013 and 2012 was $611,818, $453,142 and
$325,971, respectively. Future minimum lease payments under operating leases with remaining terms in excess of one year as of December31, 2014 were as follows:  Amount 2015 594,806 2016 599,539 2017 611,067 2018 622,716 2019 565,955 Thereafter 530,993

Income Taxes 
The Company was subject to taxes in both the U.S. and Switzerland in each of the years in the three-year period ended
December31, 2014. In the U.S., the Company incurred losses for both book and tax purposes for the year ended December31, 2014, and, accordingly, no income taxes were provided. In Switzerland, net operating loss carryforwards were used to
fully offset taxable income of approximately $200,000, $500,000 and $5,500,000 in the years ended December31, 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively.

Net deferred tax asset 275,000 300,000 
The valuation allowance for deferred tax assets as of December31, 2014 and 2013 was $51,041,000 and
$37,566,000, respectively. The total valuation allowance increased $13,475,000 for the year ended December31, 2014 and increased $5,076,000 for the year ended December31, 2013. 
In 2013, management determined it was more likely than not that a portion of the deferred tax assets associated with NOL carryforwards in
Switzerland will be realized; therefore, $300,000 of the valuation allowance was released as of December31, 2013. This determination was made after considering that the Switzerland operations had generated taxable income for two consecutive
years, 2013 and 2012, and after determining that it appeared likely that taxable income would continue in future years. In assessing the realizability of deferred tax assets, management considers whether it is more likely than not that some portion
or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. The ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which temporary differences become deductible or in which net
operating loss or tax credit carryforwards can be utilized. Both positive and negative evidence is considered in assessing the realizability of deferred tax assets and determining whether or not to record a valuation allowance. In 2014, the
Switzerland operations generated taxable income of approximately $200,000 and the Company recognized tax expense of $25,000, realizing the benefit of $25,000 of deferred tax assets associated with NOL carryforwards in Switzerland. 
After considering the evidence with respect to the U.S. deferred tax assets, management determined that as of December31, 2014, it
continues to be more likely than not that the U.S. deferred tax assets will not be realized and has recorded a valuation allowance against all U.S. deferred tax assets. 
The Company has a U.S. federal net operating loss carryforward at December31, 2014, of approximately $116,800,000, which, subject to
limitations of Internal Revenue Code IRC Section382, is available to reduce income taxes payable in future years. If not used, this carryforward will expire in years 2018 through 2034. Included in the federal net operating loss
is approximately $5,600,000 of loss generated by deductions related to equity-based compensation, the tax effect of which will be recorded to additional paid in capital when utilized. Additionally, the Company has research credit carryforwards of
approximately $3,600,000. These credits expire in years 2018 through 2034. Utilization of U.S. net operating losses and tax credits of
the Company may be subject to annual limitations under IRC Sections 382 and 383, respectively. The annual limitations, if any, have not yet been determined. When a review is performed and if any annual limitations are determined, then the gross
deferred tax assets for the net operating losses and tax credits would be reduced with a reduction in the valuation allowance of a like amount. 
The Company also has a Swiss net operating loss carryforward at December31, 2014, of approximately $23,200,000, which is available to
reduce income taxes payable in future years. If not used, this carryforward will expire in years 2015 through 2018, with approximately $22,700,000 expiring over the next three years.

As ofDecember 31, 2014 and 2013,there were no unrecognized tax
benefits.Accordingly, a tabular reconciliation from beginning to ending periods is not provided.The Company will classify any future interest and penalties as a component of income tax expense if incurred.To date, there have been
no interest or penalties charged or accruedin relation to unrecognized tax benefits. The Company does not anticipate that the total
amount of unrecognized tax benefits will change significantly in the next twelve months. The Company is subject to federal and state
examinations for the years 2009 and thereafter. There are no tax examinations currently in progress.  6.
Stockholders Equity 
Common Stock In
October 2012, the Company sold 12,500,000 shares of common stock at a price of $400 per share in a public offering, and in November 2012 the Company sold 1,759,868 shares of the Companys common stock at $400 per share as a result of the
partial exercise of the underwriters over-allotment option. The Common Stock sales resulted in net proceeds of $53,328,188 after deducting offering expenses of $3,711,284. 
Stock Options The Companys 2008
Equity Compensation Plan the Plan allows for grants in the form of incentive stock options, nonqualified stock options, stock units, stock awards, stock appreciation rights, and other stock-based awards. All of the Companys
officers, directors, employees, consultants and advisors are eligible to receive grants under the Plan. Under the Plan, the maximum number of shares authorized for issuance is 21,000,000 and the maximum number of shares of stock that may be granted
to any one participant during a calendar year is 1,000,000 shares. Options to purchase shares of common stock are granted at exercise prices not less than 100% of fair market value on the dates of grant. The term of each option is 10 years and the
options typically vest in quarterly installments over a three-year period. As of December31, 2014, the Plan had 4,250,074 shares available for grant. Stock option exercises are satisfied through the issuance of new shares. 
A summary of stock option activity under the Plan as of December31, 2014 and the changes during the three years then ended is as

As of December31, 2014, there was approximately $3,400,000 of total unrecognized
compensation cost related to nonvested outstanding stock options that is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of approximately 22 years. 
Stock option expense recognized in 2014, 2013 and 2012 was approximately $2,060,000, $1,364,000 and $1,164,000, respectively. The per share
weighted average fair value of options granted during 2014, 2013 and 2012 was estimated as $164, $226, $164, respectively, on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option pricing model based on the assumptions noted in the table below.
Expected volatilities are based on the historical volatility of the Companys stock. The weighted average expected life is based on both historical and anticipated employee behavior.

respectively, and in the issuance of shares of common stock of 2,124,123 in 2014, 981,385 in 2013 and 965,597 in 2012. In 2012, 583,344 options were exercised under a cashless provision resulting in the issuance of 384,305 shares of common stock and
no cash proceeds to the Company. Stock Awards 
The employment agreements with certain members of executive management included performance-based incentives under which the executives could
be awarded shares of common stock upon the occurrence of various triggering events. As of December31, 2013, the time period for these potential awards had expired. There were 35,000 shares awarded under these agreements in 2012. 
At times, the Company makes discretionary grants of its common stock to members of management and other employees in lieu of cash bonus awards
or in recognition of special achievements. In 2014, there were 150,000 shares of common stock granted to members of executive management as bonus compensation for achievements in 2013. There were no discretionary grants of common stock in 2013, and
grants in 2012 totaled 60,000. Expense is recognized on a straight line basis over the vesting period and is based on the fair value of
the stock on the grant date. The fair value of each stock award is determined based on the number of shares granted and the market price of the Companys common stock on the date of grant. Expense recognized in connection with performance and
discretionary stock awards was $8,722 and $301,017 in 2013 and 2012, respectively. In addition to the shares granted to members of
management and employees, at times directors receive a portion of their annual compensation in shares of Company common stock. In 2014, no shares were granted to the directors, as all directors compensation was paid in cash and stock options.
Expense is recognized on a straight line basis over the one year period that the compensation is earned. Expense recognized in connection with shares granted to directors was $356,000, $679,500 and $560,000 in 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively. 
Long Term Incentive Program The
Companys Board of Directors has approved a long term incentive program LTIP for the benefit of the Companys senior executives. Pursuant to the LTIP, the Companys senior executives have been awarded stock options and
performance stock units PSU with targeted values based on values granted by the Companys peer group. In 2014, the program was modified such that the value of the annual award for each senior executive was delivered 50% in the
form of PSUs, 25% in the form of shares of restricted stock units RSU and 25% in the form of stock options. In the prior year, 33% of the value for each senior executive was delivered in the form of stock options, 33% of the value was
delivered in the form of PSUs and 33% was delivered in the form of RSUs. The stock options have a ten-year term, have an exercise price equal to the closing price of the Companys common stock on the date of grant, vest in quarterly
installments over three years, were otherwise granted on the same standard terms and conditions as other stock options granted pursuant to the Plan and are included in the stock options table above. The RSUs vest in three equal annual installments.
Expense recognized in 2014 and 2013 in connection with the 
78 Table of Contents
RSUs was approximately $212,000 and $125,000, respectively. The PSU awards made to the senior executives will be vested and convert into actual shares of the Companys common stock based on
the Companys attainment of certain performance goals over a performance period of three years. In connection with PSU awards for defined performance goals considered probable of achievement, a net expense reduction of $3,000 was recognized in
2014. The net expense reduction was primarily the result of the reversal of expense associated with awards previously granted to senior executives who left the Company in 2014 where the awards will not vest. Expense recognized in 2013 in connection
with the PSUs for defined performance goals considered probable of achievement was $259,000. The 2014 awards included PSUs that will be
earned based on the Companys total shareholder return TSR as compared to the Nasdaq Biotechnology Index NBI at the end of the performance period, which performance period is January1, 2014 to December31,
2016.These PSUs were granted with a grant date fair value of $264.The fair value of the target number of shares that can be earned is being recognized as compensation expense over the performance period, and expense of $66,280 was
recognized in connection with this award in 2014. Depending on the outcome of the performance goal, a recipient may ultimately earn a number of shares greater or less than their target number of shares granted, ranging from 0% to 150% of the PSUs
granted. The fair value of the TSR PSUs granted in 2014 was determined using a Monte Carlo simulation and utilized the following inputs
and assumptions:  Closing stock price on grant date 309 Performance period starting price 408 Term of award in years 259 Volatility 5087 Risk-free interest rate 061 Expected dividend yield 00 Fair value per TSR PSU 264
The performance period starting price is measured as the average closing price over the last 20 trading days
prior to the performance period start. The Monte Carlo simulation model also assumed correlations of returns of the prices of the Companys common stock and the common stocks of the NBI companies and stock price volatilities of the NBI
companies. The performance stock unit awards and restricted stock granted under the long term incentive program are summarized in the following table:

A portion of the shares that were granted as discretionary shares or under the LTIP that vested in 2014, 2013
and 2012 were net-share settled such that the Company withheld shares with value equivalent to the employees minimum statutory obligation for the applicable income and other employment taxes, and
remitted the cash to the appropriate taxing authorities. The total shares withheld were 38,768, 30,153 and 11,165 in 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively, and were based on the value of the shares on their vesting date as determined by the

closing stock price. Total payments for the employees tax obligations to the taxing authorities were $154,397, $104,329 and $28,916 in 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively, and are reflected
as a financing activity within the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. These net-share settlements had the effect of share repurchases by the Company as they reduced the number of shares that would have otherwise been issued as a result of the
vesting and did not represent an expense to the Company. Warrants

Employee 401k Savings Plan 
The Company sponsors a 401k defined contribution retirement savings plan that covers all U.S. employees who have met
minimum age and service requirements. Under the plan, eligible employees may contribute up to 50% of their annual compensation into the plan up to the IRS annual limits. At the discretion of the Board of Directors, the Company may contribute
elective amounts to the plan, allocated in proportion to employee contributions to the plan, employees salary, or both. For the years ended December31, 2014, 2013 and 2012, the total number of employees enrolled in the plan has increased
and the Company elected to make contributions to the plan totaling approximately $373,000, $230,000 and $173,000, respectively.  8.
License Agreements 
Development and License Agreement 
In September 2014 the Company entered into a development and license agreement with an undisclosed pharmaceutical partner, under which the
Company will develop and supply an auto injector product for delivery of an undisclosed drug. Under the agreement, an upfront payment, development milestones, and royalties on the partners product sales, as well as a purchase price for each
device sold are to be received by the Company. The Company identified and evaluated a number of deliverables in the agreement and concluded that the manufacturing deliverable has stand-alone value but the license and development work do not have
value on a stand-alone basis. As a result, the license and development deliverables do not qualify for treatment as separate units of accounting. Accordingly, the license and development deliverables will be accounted for as a single unit of
accounting and will be recognized as revenue during the estimated development period. The Company recognized revenue in 2014 of approximately $560,000 and recorded deferred revenue of $115,000 at December31, 2014 in connection with this
agreement. LEO Pharma Promotion and License Agreement 
In November 2013, the Company entered into a promotion and license agreement with LEO Pharma. Under this agreement the Company granted LEO
Pharma the exclusive right to promote OTREXUP to dermatologists for symptomatic control of severe recalcitrant psoriasis in adults in the U.S. LEO Pharma is responsible for promotion and marketing activities in dermatology and the Company is
responsible for the supply of OTREXUP 
80 Table of Contents
product and samples. The Company received from LEO Pharma a non-refundable upfront payment of $50 million, a milestone payment of $50 million and will receive a milestone payment of $100
million upon realizing a defined level of net sales in a calendar year. The Company will pay LEO Pharma a percentage of net sales generated in dermatology and will record the payments to LEO Pharma as sales and marketing expense. 
The Company identified and evaluated a number of deliverables in the agreement and concluded that none of the deliverables have value on a
stand-alone basis. As a result, these deliverables do not qualify for treatment as separate units of accounting. Accordingly, the deliverables have been accounted for as a single unit of accounting and each of the payments will be allocated to these
deliverables and will be recognized as revenue over the 35 month estimated life of the agreement. The Company recognized revenue of $3,429,000 and $571,000 in the years ended December31, 2014 and 2013, respectively, and recorded deferred
revenue of $6,000,000 at December31, 2014. Teva License Development and Supply Agreements 
In November 2012, the Company entered into a license, supply and distribution agreement with Teva for an auto injector product containing
sumatriptan for the treatment of migraines. Teva will manufacture and supply sumatriptan in a prefilled syringe. The Company will manufacture the device, assemble the device and prefilled syringe and supply the final product to Teva for
distribution. Teva will distribute the product in the United States. Teva also received an option for rights in other territories. Under the agreement, the Company received an upfront payment, which was deferred, and will receive a milestone payment
upon commercial launch. In addition, net profits will be split 50/50 between the Company and Teva. The term of the agreement is seven years from commercial launch, with automatic one year renewals. 
In December 2007, the Company entered into a license, development and supply agreement with Teva under which the Company will develop and
supply a disposable pen injector for use with two undisclosed patient-administered pharmaceutical products. Under the agreement, an upfront payment, development milestones, and royalties on Tevas product sales, as well as a purchase price for
each device sold are to be received by the Company under certain circumstances. Based on an analysis under accounting literature applicable at the time of the agreement, the entire arrangement was considered a single unit of accounting. Therefore,
payments received and development costs incurred were deferred and were to be recognized from the start of manufacturing through the end of the initial contract period. In January 2011, this license, development and supply agreement was amended
wherein Teva pays for all development work and tooling associated with device development. Additionally, the Company is now developing two different disposable pens, one for each product. The Company determined that the changes to the agreement as a
result of the amendment was a material modification to the agreement and the accounting for the revenue and costs under this agreement was changed. For the year ended December31, 2012, the accounting change resulting from the material
modification resulted in recognition of licensing revenue previously deferred of $62,225. This agreement will continue until the later of December 2017 or the expiration date of the last to expire patent covering the device or product that is filed
no later than 12 months after FDA approval, and will be automatically renewed for successive periods of two years each. In September
2006, the Company entered into a Supply Agreement with Teva. Pursuant to the agreement, Teva is obligated to purchase all of its needle-free delivery device requirements from Antares for hGH to be marketed in the United States. Antares was entitled
to an upfront cash payment, milestone fees and royalty payments on Tevas net sales, as well as a purchase price for each device sold. The upfront payment was recognized as revenue over the development period. The milestone fees and royalties
will be recognized as revenue when earned. In 2009, Teva launched the Companys Tjet needle-free device with their hGH Tev-Tropin. In 2010, the Company received a milestone payment from
Teva in connection with this agreement. The original term of this agreement extended through September 2013. In May 2013 the agreement was amended to provide for one year automatic renewals unless terminated by either party six months ahead of the
expiring term. In the fourth quarter of 2014, Teva sold the U.S. rights to 5 mg Tev-Tropin to Ferring. Tev-Tropin 10 mg is pending FDA approval. 
In July 2006, the Company entered into an exclusive License Development and Supply Agreement with Teva. Pursuant to the agreement, Teva is
obligated to purchase all of its delivery device requirements from Antares for an auto injector product containing epinephrine to be marketed in the U.S. and Canada. Antares was entitled to an upfront cash payment, milestone fees, a negotiated
purchase price for each device sold, as well as royalties on sales of their product. This agreement will continue until the later of July 2016 or the expiration date of the last to expire patent covering the device or product that is filed no later
than 12 months after FDA approval. 
81 Table of Contents
On April26, 2012, the Company announced that Meridian Medical Technologies, a Pfizer
subsidiary, entered into a settlement agreement with Teva that will resolve pending patent litigation related to its abbreviated new drug application ANDA for a generic epinephrine auto injector. According to the terms of the settlement, Teva may
launch a generic epinephrine auto injector covered by its ANDA on June22, 2015 or earlier under certain circumstances, subject to receipt of approval from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. Additional terms of the agreement are
confidential. Under a separate agreement, Teva has agreed to provide the Company with device orders of an undisclosed amount in the years
2013 and 2014, to make a milestone payment to the Company upon FDA approval of epinephrine auto injector, and to assume all litigation costs related to the patent litigation between Teva and Meridian Medical. 
Ferring Agreements On November6,
2009, the Company entered into an Exclusive License Agreement with Ferring, under which the Company licensed certain of its patents and agreed to transfer know-how for its transdermal gel technology for certain pharmaceutical products. This
agreement had no impact on the Companys existing licenses, the transdermal clinical pipeline, or marketed products, including Gelnique 3%, Nestragel Nestorone, and
Elestrin.Also on November6, 2009, in tandem with the execution of the Exclusive License Agreement, the Company entered into an Asset Purchase Agreement the Purchase
Agreement with Ferring. Pursuant to the terms and conditions of the Purchase Agreement, Ferring purchased from the Company all of the assets, including equipment, fixtures, fittings and inventory, located at the Companys research and
development facility located in Allschwil, Switzerland the Facility. Further pursuant to the terms and conditions of the Purchase Agreement, Ferring assumed the contractual obligations related to the Facility, including the real
property lease for the Facility, and continued to employ the employees working at the Facility. The Company also entered into a Consultancy Services Agreement with Ferring for a period of 12 months, under which the Company provided services in
connection with development of certain pharmaceutical products under the Exclusive License Agreement. Under these agreements the Company received upfront license fees, payments for assets and payments for services rendered under the consultancy
agreement. In addition, the Company will receive milestone payments as certain defined milestones are achieved. The agreement is effective until the last to expire patent applicable under the agreement. 
Although there were three separate agreements with Ferring, they were evaluated as a single arrangement for purposes of applying the
applicable accounting standard. Payments received under the Exclusive License Agreement were recognized over the 12 month period of the Consultancy Services Agreement, as this is the period of time the Company was involved in development. Payments
received in connection with milestones will be recognized when the milestone payment is received. The amount received from Ferring for the assets sold resulted in a gain, which was recorded in other income. 
The Company entered into a License Agreement, dated January22, 2003, with Ferring, under which the Company licensed certain of its
intellectual property and extended the territories available to Ferring for use of certain of the Companys reusable needle-free injector devices. Specifically, the Company granted to Ferring an
exclusive, perpetual, irrevocable, royalty-bearing license, within a prescribed manufacturing territory, to manufacture certain of the Companys reusable needle-free injector devices for the field of human growth hormone. The Company granted to
Ferring similar non-exclusive rights outside of the prescribed manufacturing territory. As consideration for the license grants, Ferring
paid the Company an upfront payment upon execution of the License Agreement, and paid an additional milestone in 2003. Ferring also pays the Company royalties for each device manufactured by or on behalf of Ferring, including devices manufactured by
the Company. These royalty obligations expire, on a country-by-country basis, when the respective patents for the products expire, despite the fact that the License Agreement does not itself expire until the last of such patents expires. The license
fees have been deferred and are being recognized in income over the period from 2003 through expiration of the patents in 2016. In March
2007, the Company amended the agreement increasing the royalty rate and device pricing, included a next generation device and provided for payment principally in U.S. dollars rather than Euros. 
In the fourth quarter of 2014, Ferring purchased the U.S. rights to Tev-Tropin from Teva. Tev-Tropin 10 mg is pending FDA approval.

Actavis License and Commercialization Agreement 
In July 2011, the Company entered into an exclusive licensing agreement with Actavis to commercialize, in the U.S. and Canada, the
Companys topical oxybutynin gel 3% product, which was subsequently approved by the FDA in December 2011. Under this agreement the
Company received payments for certain manufacturing start-up activities and delivery of launch quantities, and has received and is entitled to receive future royalties on both the Companys oxybutynin gel 3% product and Actavis oxybutynin
gel product Gelnique 10%, and will potentially receive sales based milestone payments. The milestone payment based on the achievement of regulatory approval was subject to reimbursement to
Actavis if launch quantities were not delivered within a certain defined time period. Actavis assumed all responsibility for manufacture and supply of the product in 2013. The term of the agreement ends on the later of April 2024 or the expiration
date of the last to expire patent. Arrangement consideration has been allocated to the separate units of accounting based on the relative
selling prices. Selling prices are determined using vendor specific objective evidence VSOE, when available, third-party evidence TPE, when available, or an estimate of selling price when neither of the first two options
is available for a given unit of accounting. Selling prices in this arrangement were determined using estimated selling prices because VSOE and TPE were not available. The primary factors considered in determining selling price estimates in this
arrangement were estimated costs, reasonable margin estimates and historical experience. The Company determined that the license and
development activities, which include the manufacturing start-up activities, do not have value to the customer on a stand-alone basis as proprietary knowledge about the product and technology is required to complete the development activities. As a
result, these deliverables do not qualify for treatment as separate units of accounting. Accordingly, the license and development activities have been accounted for as a single unit of accounting and arrangement consideration allocated to these
deliverables was recognized as revenue over the development period, which ended upon manufacture of launch quantities. The sales based milestone payments will be recognized as revenue when earned, revenue for launch quantities was recognized when
product was delivered to Actavis and royalties will be recognized as revenue when earned. The Company received a milestone payment from Actavis in December 2011 upon FDA approval, which was recorded as deferred revenue. This milestone payment was
recognized as revenue in March of 2012, as launch quantities were delivered within the defined time period and the potential reimbursement liability was eliminated. 
Pfizer License Agreement In December
2011, the Company announced that it licensed to Pfizer, Inc.s Consumer Healthcare Business Unit one of its drug delivery technologies to develop an undisclosed product on an exclusive basis for North America. Pfizer will assume full cost and
responsibility for all clinical development, manufacturing, and commercialization of the product in the licensed territory, which also includes certain non-exclusive territories outside of North America. Antares received an upfront payment, and will
receive development milestones and sales based milestones, as well as royalties on net sales for three years post launch in the U.S. Because the Company has no development responsibilities, the upfront and each milestone payment will be recognized
as revenue when received. Royalties will be recognized as revenue when earned. Daewoong Development and License Agreement 
In January 2012, the Company entered into a licensing agreement with Daewoong Pharmaceuticals under which Daewoong will commercialize the
Companys oxybutynin gel 3% product in South Korea, once approved. This agreement was terminated in 2014.

ANI License Agreement formerly BioSante 
In June 2000, the Company entered into an exclusive agreement to license four applications of its drug-delivery technology to ANI
Pharmaceuticals, formerly BioSante Pharmaceuticals ANI, in the U.S., Canada, China, Australia, New Zealand, South Africa, Israel, Mexico, Malaysia and Indonesia collectively, the ANI Territories. ANI will use the licensed
technology for the development of hormone replacement therapy products. At the signing of the contract, ANI made an upfront payment to the Company, a portion of which, per the terms of the contract, was used to partially offset a later payment made
to the Company as a result of an upfront payment received by ANI under a sublicense agreement. The initial upfront payment received by the Company was for the delivery of intellectual property to ANI. The term of the agreement ends on the later of
the tenth anniversary of the first commercial sale of a product or the expiration date of the last to expire patent. The Company will
receive payments upon the achievement of certain milestones and will receive from ANI a royalty from the sale of licensed products. The Company will also receive a portion of any sublicense fees received by ANI. 
In December 2009, ANI entered into a license agreement with Azur Pharma International II Limited Azur, for Elestrin. ANI has received payments from Azur which triggered sublicense payments to the Company. Because final regulatory approval for this product was obtained by ANI and Antares had no further
obligations in connection with this product, the sublicense payments were recognized as revenue when received. Elestrin is being marketed in the U.S. by Meda Pharma, who acquired the
womens health business from Jazz Pharmaceuticals Jazz, who had previously acquired Azur. The Company has received royalties on sales of Elestrin, which have been
recognized as revenue when received.  9.

Legal Proceedings 
In the first quarter of 2014, Medac Pharma, Inc. Medac Pharma announced that it submitted a New Drug
Application NDA to the FDA for an auto-pen containing methotrexate. On February28, 2014, Antares filed a complaint against Medac Pharma and Medac GmbH, the parent company of Medac Pharma, Medac GmbH, together with
Medac Pharma, Medac in the United States District Court for the District of Delaware, alleging infringement four of the Companys patents. On March14, 2014, Antares filed a motion for preliminary injunction seeking to enjoin
Medac from selling its methotrexate auto-pen product if and when such product is approved for sale in the United States, pending the final resolution of the litigation. Two of Antares asserted patents were at issue in the preliminary
injunction. On July10, 2014, the District Court denied Antares motion for preliminary injunction. Antares has filed an appeal of the denial of the motion for preliminary injunction with the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit
appealing the decision as to only one patent RE44,846, the 846 patent. The 846 patent has 37 claims, and four were the subject of the appeal. On November17, 2014, the Court of Appeals ruled that the District Court
properly denied Antares motion for preliminary injunction because Antares cannot show likelihood of success on the merits, stating that four claims of the one patent on appeal are invalid for failure to satisfy the original patent requirement
of 35 U.S.C. 251. On December17, 2014, Antares filed a petition seeking a rehearing by the Court of Appeals, and on February23, 2015, the Court of Appeals denied the petition for rehearing. During the year ended December31,
2014, a total of approximately $1,700,000 in legal costs in connection with this suit has been capitalized. However, there is no assurance of success with any patent litigation, and it could be costly and time consuming and depending on the ultimate
outcome of the litigation may have an adverse effect on results of operations and OTREXUP market penetration. If the Company determines that the likelihood of a successful outcome of the entire action changes and becomes less than probable,
the capitalized costs would be charged to expense inthe period in which the change is determined. On March7, 2014, Medac
filed suit against Antares, LEO Pharma and its parent company, LEO Pharma A/S LEO Pharma together with LEO Pharma A/S, the LEO Entities in the United States District Court for the District of New Jersey, alleging that Antares and the
LEO Entities infringe Medac Pharmas U.S. Patent 8,664,231 the 231 patent that was issued by the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office on March4, 2014. The complaint states that the 231 patent relates to a concentration of more
than 30mg/mL. Medac alleges that OTREXUP infringes the 231 patent and demands that Antares and the LEO Entities be enjoined from making, using, selling, importing or offering OTREXUP and pay unspecified amounts of compensatory damages,
treble damages and attorneys fees. On November18, 2014, Medac filed a motion for preliminary injunction seeking to enjoin Antares and the LEO Entities from selling OTREXUP in the United States, pending the final resolution of the
litigation. The Company intends to defend itself vigorously. Under the terms of the promotion and license agreement between the Company and the LEO Entities, the Company agreed to indemnify the LEO Entities from claims that OTREXUP infringes
the intellectual property rights of any third party. On July1, 2014, Antares filed a petition with the Patent Trial and 
85 Table of Contents
Appeal Board the PTAB of the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office seeking an inter partes review of Medacs 231 patent challenging the validity of the231
patent. On January6, 2015, the PTAB issued an order instituting an inter partes review of all claims of the 231 patent. Legal costs in connection with these proceedings are expensed as incurred. 11.

In December 2014, the Company received an invoice from the FDA in the amount of $970,840 for user fees related to OTREXUP for the twelve month period ended September30, 2014 for which approximately $243,000

The Companys management evaluated, with the participation of the Companys Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, the
effectiveness of its disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Based on this evaluation, the Companys Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that the

internal control over financial reporting. The Companys management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate
internal control over financial reporting. The Companys management has assessed the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting as of December31, 2014. This assessment was based on criteria set forth by the Committee of
Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission, or COSO, in Internal Control-Integrated Framework 1992. The Companys
internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted
accounting principles. The Companys internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that:  1
pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect transactions and dispositions of the Companys assets; 2
provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that the Companys receipts
and expenditures are being made only in accordance with authorizations of the Companys management and board of directors; and  3
provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of the Companys assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.
Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
Based on the Companys assessment using the COSO 1992criteria, management has concluded that its internal control over
financial reporting was effective as of December31, 2014 to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting
principles. The Companys independent registered public accounting firm, KPMG LLP, has issued an audit report on the Companys internal control over financial reporting. The report on the audit of internal control over financial reporting
appears in Item8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Changes in internal control over financial reporting. 
There was no change in the Companys internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the quarter ended December31,
2014 that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, the Companys internal control over financial reporting.  Item9B.
