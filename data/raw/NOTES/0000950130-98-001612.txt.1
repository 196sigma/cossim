INDEPENDENT AUDITORS' REPORT
To the Stockholders and Board of Directors of
Hearst-Argyle Television, Inc.
We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheet of Hearst-Argyle
Television, Inc. successor to Argyle Television, Inc. the Predecessor
Company collectively referred to as the Company as of December 31, 1997,
and the related consolidated statements of operations, stockholders' equity and
cash flows for the period September 1, 1997 Date of Acquisition to December
31, 1997 and as to the Predecessor Company the related statements of operations,
stockholders' equity and cash flows for the period January 1, 1997 to August 31,
1997. Our audit also included the financial statement schedule listed in Item
14. These consolidated financial statements and financial statement schedule are
the responsibility of the Company management. Our responsibility is to express
an opinion on these consolidated financial statements and financial statement
schedule based on our audit.
We conducted our audit in accordance with generally accepted auditing standards.
Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable
assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material
misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting
the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes
assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by
management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.
We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.
In our opinion, such consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all
material respects, the financial position of the Company at December 31, 1997,
and the results of its operations and its cash flows for the period September 1,
1997 to December 31, 1997 period after the change in control referred to in
Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements, and with respect to the
Predecessor Company for the period January 1, 1997 to August 31, 1997 period up
to the change in control referred to in Note 3 to the consolidated financial
statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles. Also,
in our opinion, such financial statement schedule, when considered in relation
to the basic consolidated financial statements taken as a whole, presents fairly
in all material respects the information set forth therein.
As more fully discussed in Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements, the
Predecessor Company was acquired in a business combination accounted for as a
purchase. As a result of the acquisition, the consolidated financial statements
for the period subsequent to the acquisition are presented on a different basis
of accounting than those for the periods prior to the acquisition and,
therefore, are not directly comparable. Deloitte & Touche LLP New York, New York
