Total Control Products, Inc. We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Total Control 
Products, Inc. an Illinois Corporation and Subsidiaries as of March 31, 
1996 and 1997 and the related consolidated statements of operations, 
shareholders' equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period 
ended March 31, 1997. These financial statements are the responsibility of 
the Company management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on 
these financial statements based on our audits.
We conducted our audits in accordance with generally accepted auditing
standards. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material
misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting
the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes
assessing the accounting principals used and significant estimates made by
management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.
We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present
fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Total Control
Products, Inc. and Subsidiaries as of March 31, 1996 and 1997 and the results of
their operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period
ended March 31, 1997 in conformity with generally accepted accounting

33           TOTAL CONTROL PRODUCTS, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 1. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
a Description of Business
Total Control Products, Inc., an Illinois corporation, together with
its wholly-owned subsidiary, Tara Products, Inc., d/b/a Total Control
- Cincinnati, an Illinois corporation, and its majority-owned
subsidiary, Taylor Industrial Software, Inc., an Alberta corporation
Taylor, collectively the Company, designs, develops and
markets products and technology for the control segment of the
industrial automation marketplace.
b Principles of Consolidation
The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Total
Control Products, Inc. and its wholly-owned subsidiary since its
acquisition on January 29, 1996 and its majority-owned subsidiary
since its acquisition on September 26, 1996. In connection with the
Taylor transaction, the Company sold 39% of the Taylor Class A Shares
to Digital Electronics Corporation Digital Electronics located in
Osaka, Japan, which is the Company largest supplier see Note 10,
for an aggregate purchase price of $40 million. As a result, a
minority interest for 39% of the net income or loss of Taylor is
recorded on the Company statement of operations. The Company
ownership of Taylor Class A Common Shares may increase up to 4% based
on the amount of contingent consideration paid by the Company in
connection with the acquisition. All intercompany items and
transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.
Additionally, the company accounts for its 40% ownership interest in a
foreign joint venture on the equity method.
c Revenue Recognition
Net sales include revenues from operator interface products, software
license fees, software maintenance and services. Revenue from product
sales and software licenses are recognized upon shipment of the
product to customers, provided that there are no significant
obligations remaining and collectibility of the revenue is probable.
The Company provides for estimated product returns upon shipment of
the products. Revenue from software maintenance contracts is
recognized ratably as it is earned over the term of the contract,
generally one year. Unearned software maintenance revenue is included
in deferred revenue. Service revenue is recognized as the service is
provided. The Company recognizes revenue from software license fees,
service and maintenance in accordance with the provisions                    34     of the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants, Statement
of Position No. 91-1 SOP 91-1, Software Revenue Recognition.
d Cash and Cash Equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents include all highly liquid investments with
original maturities of three months or less, principally time
deposits and other short term securities which are stated at cost,
which approximates fair value.

Machinery and equipment          3-10 Years
Furniture and fixtures          5-10 Years
Leasehold improvements       Shorter of asset life or
life of lease
h Intangible Assets
Intangible assets relating to acquired businesses consist primarily of
the cost of purchased businesses in excess of the fair value of net
assets acquired goodwill. Such goodwill is being amortized on a
straight-line basis over a period ranging from seven to fifteen years.
The accumulated amortization of intangible assets amounted to $23,000
and $343,000 as of March 31, 1996 and 1997, respectively.
The Company reviews goodwill for impairment whenever events or changes
in circumstances indicate that its carrying amount may not be
recoverable. To date, no such events or changes in circumstances have
occurred. If such events or changes in circumstances occur, the
Company will recognize an impairment loss if the undiscounted future
cash flows expected to be generated by the acquired business are less
than the carrying value of the related goodwill. The impairment loss
in such circumstances would adjust the goodwill to its fair value.                    36   i Foreign Currency Translation Adjustments
The Company follows the translation principles established by
Statement of Financial Accounting Standards SFAS No. 52, Foreign
Currency Translation. The net assets of the Company majority-owned
subsidiary and the Company investment in its foreign joint venture
are translated at the exchange rate in effect at the end of the
periods presented. The revenues and expenses of the Company
majority-owned subsidiary and the Company ownership percentage of
the foreign joint venture net income are translated at the average
rates in effect during the period. The Company foreign joint venture
had no significant activity for the year ended March 31, 1996.
Included in other income is the Company 40% share of the earnings of
the foreign joint venture for the year ended March 31, 1997 of
$79,425. See Note 6 for a discussion of the Company policy
regarding certain foreign currency hedging transactions.
j Research and Development
The Company records its software development costs in accordance with
SFAS No. 86. Accordingly, these costs are expensed until the
technological feasibility of the software has been established.
Thereafter, all significant software development costs are capitalized
until the product is available for general release to customers.
Subsequently, these costs are reported at the lower of unamortized
cost or net realizable value. As a result of market and other
business conditions, the time between establishment of technological
feasibility and general release has not been significant since April
1, 1993. Accordingly, the Company has not capitalized any software
development costs during this time.
k Income Taxes
The Company accounts for income taxes under the provisions of SFAS
No. 109, Accounting for Income Taxes. Deferred taxes are determined
based on the estimated future tax effects of differences between the
financial statement and tax basis of assets and liabilities under the
provisions of the enacted tax laws.
l Management Use of Estimates
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally
accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates
and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and
liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the
date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of sales and
expenses during the period. Actual results could differ from those
estimates.                    37   m Financial Instruments and Concentration of Credit Risk
Effective April 1, 1995, the Company adopted the provisions of SFAS
No. 115, Accounting for Certain Investments in Debt and Equity
Securities. The adoption of SFAS No. 115 did not have a material
impact on the Company financial statements.
The carrying value for current assets and current liabilities
reasonably approximates fair value due to the short maturity of these
items. Since the Company long-term debt is not publicly quoted,
fair value estimates are based on each obligation characteristics,
including remaining maturities, interest rate, credit rating,
collateral, amortization schedule and liquidity. The carrying amount
for long-term debt approximates fair value.
Financial instruments that potentially subject the Company to
concentration of credit risk consist principally of cash investments
and trade receivables. The Company has cash investment policies that
limit cash investments to short-term low risk investments. With
respect to trade receivables, the Company grants unsecured credit to
its customers. In doing so, the Company performs ongoing credit
evaluations of its customers' financial condition. A substantial
portion of accounts receivable are from customers located throughout
the United States. One customer accounted for approximately 14% and
10% of the Company net sales for the years ended March 31, 1995 and
1996, respectively. No customer accounted for 10% or greater of
Company sales for fiscal 1997. Additionally, the Company establishes
accounts receivable allowances based upon factors relating to the
credit risk of specific customers, historical trends and other
information.
n Accretion to Redemption Value of Common Stock
Accretion to redemption value of redeemable common stock represents
the change in redemption value of outstanding common stock in each
period. The redmemption values for certain common shares are based
upon i fair market values of the class of stock or ii fixed
amounts. Although management did not obtain an appraisal of the fair
market value of the Company, certain equity transactions occurred upon
which management based its estimate of the potential redemption value
of the aforementioned shares. The estimated redemption values per
share for the shares with redemption values equal to fair market
value, were $083/share, $100/share and $233/share at March 31 1994,
1995 and 1996, respectively and $900/share at December 31, 1996. As
the redemption features for these shares of common stock terminated
automatically upon the completion of the Company initial public
offering on March 10, 1997, no further accretion was required after
December 31, 1996. See Note 7.                    38   o Stock Split
In December 1996, the Company Board of Directors declared a
three-for-one split of the Company Common Stock, which has been
retroactively reflected in the accompanying consolidated financial
statements. In December 1996, Taylor Board of Directors declared a
three-for-one split of Taylor Class C Exchangeable Common Stock,
which has been retroactively reflected in the accompanying
consolidated financial statements.
p Net Income Loss Per Share Available to Common Shareholders and Pro
Forma and Supplemental Pro Forma Net Loss Per Share
Net income loss per share available to common shareholders is based
on the weighted average number of shares of common stock and common
stock equivalents outstanding, as adjusted for the stock split
described above for all periods presented. Common stock equivalents
represent options, convertible stock and convertible debt using the
treasury stock method for all periods presented. Any common stock
options and convertible stock issued from one year prior to the
initial public filing with a price below the estimated initial public
offering price have been included as outstanding shares for all
periods presented reduced by the number of shares which could be
purchased with proceeds from the exercise of the options.
Pro forma net loss per share is computed based upon pro forma net loss
as described below and the weighted average number of shares adjusted
for the conversion of $250,000 of convertible debentures into 339,366
shares of Common Stock and the dilutive effect of any common stock
equivalents, as appropriate.
Supplemental pro forma net loss per share for fiscal 1997 of $017
is computed based upon i pro forma net loss adjusted for the
reduction in interest expense net of tax benefit of approximately
$343,000 for fiscal 1997 resulting from the application of net
proceeds of the Company initial public offering to reduce
indebtedness of the Company and ii the pro forma weighted average
number of shares of Common Stock outstanding adjusted to reflect the
sale by the Company of approximately 1,045,000 shares of Common Stock
in the offering resulting in net proceeds sufficient to pay such
indebtedness for fiscal 1997.
In February 1997, the Financial Accounting Standards the FASB
issued Statement No. 128, Earnings Per Share. This statement
simplifies the standards for computing earnings per share EPS, and
makes them comparable to international EPS standards. It also
requires dual presentation of basic and diluted EPS on the face of the
income statement for all entities with complex capital structures and
requires a reconciliation of the numerator and denominator of the
basic EPS computation to the numerator and denominator of the diluted
EPS computation. The Company adopted this statement effective                    39     April 1, 1997, and such adoption did not have a material impact on the
Company results of operations. For fiscal 1997, basic loss per
share was $199. Diluted EPS for fiscal 1997 was anti-dilutive.   q Pro Forma Statement of Operations
Pursuant to the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange
Commission, the accompanying unaudited pro forma consolidated
statement of operations for the year ended March 31, 1997 reflects the
change in net loss available to common shareholders resulting from the
following events which occurred upon the completion of the Company
initial public offering: i the automatic termination of the
redemption provision of redeemable common stock; ii the conversion
of $250,000 of subordinated debentures into 339,366 shares of the
Company Common Stock; and iii the issuance of 27,999 shares of
Common Stock required upon the retirement of the $20 million
shareholder note payable which was repaid with a portion of the
proceeds of the offering.
2. ACQUISITIONS
On January 29, 1996, Total Control Products, Inc. acquired 100% of the
outstanding common stock of Cincinnati Dynacomp, Inc. Cincinnati, a
manufacturer and distributor of text based operator interface products, for
$499,990 and 150,003 shares of the Company Common Stock which was
assigned a fair value of $500,010 and merged Cincinnati into its
wholly-owned subsidiary. Additionally, the former shareholders of
Cincinnati are entitled to contingent cash and Common Stock consideration.
To the extent calendar year 1996 and 1997 sales of Cincinnati and certain
similar Company products exceed its historical sales volume, the contingent
consideration is equal to 10% for the first $10 million of such excess and
4% of any further excess. There was no contigent consideration earned for
calendar 1996. All payments of such contingent consideration for calendar
year 1997 to the former majority shareholder, who will receive 53% of such
consideration, shall be paid in shares of Common Stock valued at their then
fair market value and the remainder to be paid to the other former
shareholders shall be paid in cash. To the extent calendar year 1998, 1999
and 2000 sales of the Company exceed approximately $320 million in any of
those years, the former majority shareholder of Cincinnati receives 125%
of such excess of which 50% shall be paid in cash and 50% shall be paid in
shares of the Company valued at their then fair market value, with the
agreement providing the Company a buy-out option related to this contingent
consideration ranging from $10 million to $20 million depending on the
timing of such prepayment. All contingent consideration is due 90 days
after the respective calendar years on which such consideration was based.
This acquisition was accounted for under the purchase method. Accordingly,
the purchase price was allocated to the net assets acquired based on their
estimated fair values. This treatment resulted in approximately $198
million of cost in excess of net                    40   assets acquired at the date of acquisition. In fiscal 1997, goodwill
increased by approximately $970,000, primarily as a result of the Company
revising its estimate of the costs to exit the Cincinnati facility in
connection with the Company integration plan established at the
acquisition date. Such excess which will increase for any future
contingent consideration paid is being amortized on a straight-line basis
over 15 years. Cincinnati results of operations have been included in
the consolidated results of operations since the date of acquisition.
In fiscal 1996, the Company made an investment in a foreign joint venture,
which distributes industrial automation tools, including the Company
products. The Company owns 40% of this joint venture, which is located in
the Netherlands and sells products throughout Europe, with the remaining
60% owned by the Company largest vendor see Notes 7 and 10 and the
distributor of this vendor product see Note 7. This investment is
accounted for under the equity method.
On September 19, 1996 the Company entered into an agreement to acquire a
controlling interest in Taylor, a developer and marketer of industrial
automation software products located in Edmonton, Alberta. The transaction
was consummated on September 26, 1996 and the results of operations have
been included since that date. In exchange for 100% of the outstanding
voting shares of common stock of Taylor, the Company paid $7,389,817, which
included $22 million in the form of a note payable to the former principal
shareholder and 767,112 shares of Class C Exchangeable common stock of
Taylor convertible into 767,112 shares of the Company Common Stock; see
Note 7 for a description of the features of the stock. In addition, the
agreement provides for the payment of contingent cash consideration based
on future revenues of Taylor. To the extent the revenues of Taylor exceed
$80 million in any of the two 12 month periods following the acquisition,
the Taylor shareholders will receive $10 million due 90 days after that
respective 12 month period. Additionally, the Taylor shareholders will
receive cash consideration in the amount of 50% of the revenue of Taylor in
excess of $92 million and $106 million for the first and second 12 month
period after the acquisition, respectively, with the total consideration
capped at $30 million for any 12 month period related to this provision.
The $465 million value assigned to the 767,112 shares of Class C
Exchangeable common stock was based on management estimate of fair value,
primarily based on the present value of the potential redemption of the
security as well as recent equity transactions. The Company also incurred
approximately $600,000 in direct expenses related to the acquisition. The
acquisition was accounted for using the purchase method. Accordingly, the
purchase price was allocated to assets acquired based on their estimated
fair values.
In connection with the transaction, the Company sold 39% of the Class A
voting shares of Taylor for $40 million to Digital Electronics. To the
extent the contingent consideration described above is earned, the Company
is required to contribute as equity into Taylor a portion of the earnout
payment and receive additional equity interest in                    41   Taylor up to a maximum of 4% based on a formula outlined in a letter of
understanding between the Company and Digital. The $40 million investment
in Taylor by Digital was greater than 39% of the equity of the subsidiary,
and this difference of approximately $600,000 was reflected as a reduction
of goodwill to properly reflect the Company cost of the Taylor
acquisition.
In connection with the acquisition of Taylor, the Company engaged a broker
to commence the sale of one of the developed software product lines
acquired. The purchase price value assigned to these assets held for sale
of approximately $50 million is based on management estimate of the
expected gross proceeds to be received using similar market multiples of
recent sales of comparable product lines less estimated applicable tax and
direct costs of the disposal. The net expenses in excess of revenue,
including the interest expense on related debt that was expected to be
retired from the proceeds from the sale of approximately $197,000 incurred
by the Company since the acquisition has not been reflected in the
statement of operations of the Company. It is management belief that the
sale of this product line will be completed by September 25, 1997.
Purchased research and development expense and other related acquisition
expenses relating to the acquisition of Taylor totaled $49 million and was
charged to expense at the acquisition date in September 1996. Of this
expense, approximately $47 million was allocated to incomplete research
and development that had not yet reached technological feasibility and did
not have a future alternative use, and therefore was charged to expense at
the acquisition date. The amount allocated to the purchased incomplete
research and development projects represents the estimated fair value
related to those projects determined by an independent appraisal. Proven
valuation procedures and techniques were utilized in determining the fair
market value of each intangible asset.  The purchased research and
development projects were individually identified and were valued based on
estimates of discounted future income. Consideration was given to the
stage of development, the time and resources required for completion, as
well as the market potential and associated risks. To bring these projects
to technological feasibility, high-risk developmental and testing issues
needed to be resolved, which required substantial additional effort and
testing.
The remaining excess purchase price over the estimated fair value of
identified net assets which will increase for any future contingent
consideration of approximately $25 million was assigned to goodwill and
is being amortized over 7 years. Estimates related to certain acquisition
costs are preliminary and will be changed based on actual results. The
amount of goodwill recorded will be adjusted for any such changes.
The following unaudited pro forma results of operations data for fiscal
1995, 1996 and 1997 assume the Cincinnati acquisition occurred as of April
1, 1994 and the Taylor acquisition occurred as of April 1, 1995 in

In conjunction with the Company acquisition of Cincinnati, the Company
acquired net deferred tax assets of $795,000. A portion of the acquired
deferred tax assets relates to net operating loss carry forwards NOLs
of approximately $430,000, which begin to expire in 2006. These NOLS will
be limited to approximately $56,000 per year                    43   and, at such level, it is management opinion that these NOLs will not
expire without being fully utilized.
Components of the net deferred income tax assets which are included in
current deferred tax assets and other long term assets on the accompanying
consolidated balance sheets, at March 31, 1996 and 1997 are as follows                               March 31,
1996     1997
Cumulative temporary differences:
Net operating loss carry forward from
acquired entities            $ 180,000   $ 286,510
Accrued expenses               18,639    650,996
Inventory, primarily reserves        314,309    250,939
Allowances for accounts receivable      127,642    133,645
Deferred compensation             35,418     17,186
Depreciation                   18,394    16,682
Basis difference in intangibles         99,863     5,915
Tax credits                      -    104,609
Other temporary differences            265       -
Total deferred income tax asset      $ 794,000   $1,433,118
Generally, undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries will not be
subject to U.S. tax until distributed as dividends. Since the earnings
have been or are intended to be indefinitely reinvested in foreign
operations, no provision has been made for any U.S. taxes on the Company
portion of undistributed earnings. Furthermore, any taxes paid to foreign
governments on those earnings may be used, in whole or in part, as credits
against U.S. tax on any dividends distributed from such earnings. The
Company share of undistributed earnings of its foreign joint venture
recorded as of March 31, 1997 is approximately $79,000. There were no
undistributed earnings from the Company foreign subsidiary.
Because management believes that the deferred tax asset will be fully
realized based on current estimates of future taxable income, future
reversals of existing taxable temporary differences or available tax
planning strategies, no valuation allowance has been recorded against the
deferred tax asset.
4. NOTES PAYABLE
a BANK
At March 31, 1996 the Company had a revolving line-of-credit agreement
with a bank which allowed borrowings up to $55 million $850,000 was

which was also the average borrowing rate on all short term borrowings
as of March 31, 1996. Additionally, the Company had a term loan with
the bank for $10 million due September 30, 1996.                    44   In July 1996, the Company entered into a new revolving line-of-credit
agreement with a bank which allows for borrowings up to $90 million
approximately $703 million was available at March 31, 1997 based on 85%
of eligible accounts receivable and 50% of eligible inventory up to a

credit line expires on July 17, 1998. Interest is at LIBOR plus 2% or
prime 85% at March 31, 1997, at the Company option, and is due
monthly. The Company retired the previously outstanding bank loans
discussed above with the proceeds from this new bank agreement.
Subsequent to year end, the agreement was amended whereby interest is at
LIBOR plus 15% or prime, at the Company option.
All amounts outstanding under this agreement are secured by inventory,
receivables and all other general assets of the Company. Among other
things, the agreement requires compliance with specific financial covenants
related to tangible net worth and debt to tangible net worth ratio. As of
March 31, 1997, the Company was in compliance with these covenants.
Additionally, in November 1996, the Company entered into a line-of-credit
agreement with a bank allowing for borrowing up to $10 million $184,000
available at March 31, 1997 based on 80% of eligible accounts receivable
of its majority-owned subsidiary. This revolving credit line expires
November 25, 1998 and bears interest at prime 85% at March 31, 1997
which is due monthly. All amounts under this line are secured by the
general assets of the Company majority-owned subsidiary. The Company
retired the previously outstanding bank line-of-credit with the proceeds
from this line, which was due on demand.

The Company has an operating lease with a partnership owned by the
principal shareholder and a shareholder/officer. Monthly rental payments
of $12,000 plus property taxes, insurance and utilities are due through
April 2002, with provisions for rent increases tied to increases in the
consumer price index.
The Company leases various other office space and office equipment under
operating leases that expire in various years through 2000. Rent expense
for fiscal 1995, 1996 and 1997 was approximately $164,000, $243,000 and
$588,000, respectively. Included in the table below on a net basis is
sublease income of approximately $54,000 for  fiscal 1998 and $27,000 for
fiscal 1999 for two office locations that were leased by Cincinnati.
Minimum future lease payments under noncancelable operating leases as of
March 31, 1997 are as follows        Fiscal Year               Amount
1998               $ 781,499
1999                752,386

Thereafter               26,268
$2,350,510
Certain officers and employees of the Company have employment contracts
through fiscal 2001. The Company total obligation under these contracts
in the event of termination without cause as of March 31, 1997 was
approximately $22 million.
Under the terms of various agreements, the Company is obliged to pay
royalties on product sales at rates from 30% to 170%. The Company has
made certain advance payments in respect of future royalties. Prepaid
royalties are amortized to earnings based on actual sales realized over the
term of the applicable royalty agreement.
To manage its foreign currency risk related to its purchases of inventory
from a Japanese vendor see Note 10, the Company hedges firm inventory
purchase commitments by entering into forward contracts to purchase
Japanese Yen. This hedging minimizes the impact of foreign exchange rate
movements on the Company operating results. Gains and losses on the
hedge positions are deferred and included as a component of the transaction
when it is completed. At March 31, 1997, the Company had outstanding
forward contracts for the purchase of Japanese Yen through June 6, 1997 of
$2,228,254 to hedge equivalent outstanding commitments transacted in Yen.
The holders of certain shares of common stock have certain rights to cause
the Company to register those shares under the Securities Act of 1933, as
amended the Securities Act. By separate agreements, these registration
rights apply to holders of 1,804,767 shares of
47   Common Stock of the Company and the 737,112 shares issuable to the former
shareholder of Taylor upon the conversion of Taylor Class C Exchangeable
common stock collectively, the Rights Holders. All of such
registration rights agreements provide that the Rights Holders'
registration rights are subject to certain notice requirements and to the
condition that, in the case of any piggyback registration rights, the
underwriters of any offering have the right to limit the number of shares
included in such registration. The Company has agreed to bear the expenses
of all registrations under these registration rights agreements, except for
underwriting discounts, selling commissions and underwriters' expense
allowances, which are to be paid by the respective rights holders.
On February 14, 1997, a former distributor of Cincinnati filed a third
party complaint against the Company wholly owned subsidiary, Tara
Products, Inc. the successor to Cincinnati, alleging a breach of implied
warranties due to alleged defects in products sold by Cincinnati, and
seeking to enforce an alleged agreement to indemnify the former distributor
from damages, if any, that may arise from litigation currently ongoing
between this former distributor and a customer of the former distributor.
Although this action is in the preliminary discovery stage, management
believes that Tara Products, Inc. has meritorious defenses and intends to
vigorously defend this action. Management believes that the ultimate
outcome of this litigation will not have a material adverse effect on the
Company financial condition or results of operations.
7. REDEEMABLE COMMON STOCK ISSUANCES
During December, 1993, the Company sold 1,204,653 shares of Common Stock
for $10 million. Included in the terms of the agreement was the right to
put the shares to the Company at fair market value, as defined in the
agreement, for a two-year period in the event the Company did not complete
an initial public offering of its stock by December 16, 1998. This put
right automatically terminated upon the closing of the Company initial
public offering.
In connnection with the acquisition of Cincinnati see Note 2, the Company
issued 150,003 shares of Common Stock. Between January 29, 1998 and
January 28, 2000, the shareholders had the right to put the shares to the
Company at fair value as defined in this agreement. This redemption right
terminated upon the closing of the Company initial public offering.
During July, 1994, the Company sold an aggregate of 250,002 shares of
Common Stock to Digital Electronics see Note 10 and to a distributor of
Digital Electronics products in exchange for $250,000. The shareholders
had the right to put the shares at any time to the Company at the lesser of
a the original purchase price or b the net book value per share on a
fully diluted basis as reflected on the consolidated balance sheet of the
Company for the fiscal quarter most recently completed. This right
terminated upon the closing of the Company initial public offering.                    48   In connection with the acquisition of Taylor, a portion of the
consideration exchanged by the Company was 767,112 shares of Class C
Exchangeable common stock of Taylor to the former holders of the voting
common stock of Taylor. This common stock is convertible at the holders'
option into shares of the Company Common Stock on a one to one basis.
This Class C Exchangeable common stock has no rights in the assets or
earnings of Taylor, has no voting rights and does not have the right to the
dividends of the Taylor Class A common stock outstanding. As a result,
this stock is not considered minority interest in Taylor; rather the stock
is treated as a redeemable stock of the Company. This stock had certain
redemption provisions which terminated automatically upon completion of the
Company initial public offering. In March 1997, 30,000 shares of Class
C Exchangeable common stock of Taylor was converted into 30,000 shares of
the Company common stock.
8. STOCK OPTION PLANS
The Company has four fixed option plans which reserve shares of common
stock for issuance to management, employees, directors and advisors of the
Company. The Company has adopted the disclosure-only provisions of
statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123, Accounting for
Stock-Based Compensation SFAS NO. 123. Accordingly, no compensation
cost has been recognized for the stock option plans. Consistent with the
provisions of SFAS No. 123, compensation cost for the Company four stock
option plans has been determined based on the fair value at the grant date
for awards. In fiscal 1996 and 1997, the Company net loss and net loss
per share would have been reduced to the pro forma amounts indicated below   
1996       1997
Net loss available to shareholders -
as reported               $ 608,964  $ 10,625,477
Net loss available to shareholders -
pro forma                 612,936   10,759,889
Net loss per share - as reported       011      183
Net loss per share - pro forma        011      186
The fair value of each option grant is estimated on the date of grant using
the Black-Scholes option-pricing model with the following weighted average
assumptions for grants during fiscal 1996 and 1997: dividend yield of 0   expected volatility of 60%; risk-free interest rate of 6%; and expected
lives of 3 years.

in certain cases of the fair market value of the Common Stock on the date
of grant. Options become exerciseable generally over three years or as
determined by the Board. Certain acceleration provisions exist related to
a change in control of the Company. In December 1996, the Board determined
that no additional options will be granted under this plan.
b 1996 STOCK OPTION PLAN
In December 1996, the Company adopted the 1996 Stock Option Plan under
which options may be granted to purchase up to 550,000 shares of Common

provides for the grant of ISOs and non-qualified stock options.
In February 1997, the Company granted to employees options to purchase
297,850 shares of Common Stock under the terms of this plan effective on
the completion of the intial public offering at an exercise price equal to
the intial public offering price of $800.   Subsequent to year-end, the Company granted options under this plan to
certain executives totaling 25,000 shares at a price equal to $800 per
share.

services already performed as of the date of termination. In addition, if the
Company terminates an employee employment under certain circumstances the

benefits for a period of two years. Under the terms of Mr. Taylor employment
agreement, if Mr. Taylor employment is terminated by the Company for any

period to the extent Mr. Wood is not entitled to receive similar benefits from a
subsequent employer. In the event the Company terminates Mr. Marrano
employment for any reason other than cause, including the decision not to renew
the term of his employment agreement, the Company shall pay Mr. Marrano an
amount equal to $150,000 in one lump sum payment.  Finally, if the Company

month period and continue Mr. Nicholson medical insurance benefits during such
six month period to the extent Mr. Nicholson is not entitled to receive similar
benefits from a subsequent employer. In addition to the payment of the amounts
set forth above, if the Company terminates Mr. Nicholson employment within one
year after a change of control other than for cause or Mr. Nicholson
terminates his employment for good reason as defined in such agreement, the
Company is obligated to pay Mr. Nicholson in one lump sum an additional amount
