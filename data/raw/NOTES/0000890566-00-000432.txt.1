BACKGROUND
THIS SECTION CONTAINS STATEMENTS WHICH CONSTITUTE FORWARD-LOOKING
STATEMENTS WITHIN THE MEANING OF THE PRIVATE SECURITIES LITIGATION REFORM ACT
OF 1995. SEE DISCLOSURE PRESENTED ON THE INSIDE OF THE FRONT COVER OF THIS
REPORT FOR CAUTIONARY INFORMATION WITH RESPECT TO SUCH FORWARD-LOOKING
STATEMENTS.
The following discussion should be read in conjunction with Item 6.
Selected Financial Data and the Company Consolidated Financial Statements
and related Notes thereto in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary
Data.
INTRODUCTION
The Company net sales are derived from the processing and distribution of
steel, aluminum and other specialty metals and the use of processed metals to
manufacture high-value end-use products. Most of the metal sold by the Company
is processed in some form. The Company processes various metals to specified
thickness, length, width, shape and surface quality pursuant to specific
customer orders. Additionally, certain of the Acquired Companies manufacture
finished building products for commercial and residential applications and
machine certain specialty metals. See Item 1. Business for further discussion
of the Company organization and business plan.
During the first half of 1997, the Company sold an aggregate of 985,500
shares of Common Stock to management of and consultants to the Company for $001
per share. Accordingly, the Company recorded a compensation charge of $60
million in the first half of 1997, representing the difference between the
amount paid for the shares and the estimated fair value of the shares on the
date of sale, as if the Founding Companies were combined, the Compensation
Charge. The Compensation Charge has not been allocated to the Company
segments.
INTEGRATION CHARGE
On September 8, 1999, the Company announced a comprehensive plan to reduce
operating costs and improve its operational efficiency by fully integrating
certain operations within a geographic area and consolidating certain
administrative and support functions. The Company recorded a charge to
operations of $94 million in respect of this plan the Integration Charge.
The principal components of the Integration Charge are $33 million for
termination of certain employment contracts, $21 million for severance costs
attributable to the consolidation of administrative and support functions and
$40 million for the costs of combining five processing facilities into others
within the same geographic region. These changes will affect less than 5% of the
Company workforce. Through December 31, 1999, the Company has incurred costs
of $19 million pursuant to the integration plan.
The Company expects to incur approximately $10 million to $20 million
during each of the next three quarterly reporting periods with respect to
personnel related costs. Approximately $40 million of facility integration
costs will occur at various times over the next three quarterly reporting
periods of which approximately $30 million, attributable to Heavy Carbon and
Building Products, are expected to occur in the third quarter of 2000. The
Company expects to realize annualized savings of approximately $120 million
upon completion of the integration plan. The majority of these savings are
expected to be realized by the Heavy Carbon and Specialty Metals segments.
Although the foregoing estimates with respect to costs, timing and savings
reflect the best information available to management, there can be no assurance
that such costs will not exceed current expectations, that the timing of the
facility integration activities will not be delayed, or that the savings will
not be realized as anticipated.

RESULTS FOR 1999 COMPARED TO 1998
NET SALES. Net sales increased $2466 million, or 165%, from $1,4988
million in 1998 to $1,7454 million in 1999. The increase in net sales was due
to acquisitions, together with unit volume growth in the other subsidiaries.
Material shipments for steel products increased 311% and average realized
prices decreased in 1999 compared to 1998. Acquisitions accounted for the
substantial portion of the increase in material shipments. See -- Segment
Results for additional information.
COST OF SALES. Cost of sales increased $1542 million, or 136%, from
$1,1351 million in 1998 to $1,2893 million in 1999. The increase in cost of
sales was principally due to the acquisitions described above. As a percentage
of net sales, cost of sales decreased from 757% in 1998 to 739% in 1999. This
percentage decrease was principally due to lower cost of raw materials.
OPERATING AND DELIVERY. Operating and delivery expenses increased $447
million, or 307%, from $1458 million in 1998 to $1905 million in 1999. The
increase in operating and delivery expenses was principally due to the
acquisitions described above. As a percentage of net sales, operating and
delivery expenses increased from 97% in 1998 to 109% in 1999. This percentage
increase was primarily due to lower average realized prices.
SELLING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE. Selling, general and administrative
expenses increased $237 million, or 226%, from $1047 million in 1998 to
$1284 million in 1999. This increase in selling, general and administrative
expenses was primarily attributable to the acquisitions described above. As a
percentage of net sales, selling, general and administrative expenses increased
from 70% in 1998 to 74% in 1999. Excluding the effect of the non-recurring
charge of $26 million attributable to the termination of the ESOP in 1998, as a
percentage of net sales, selling, general and administrative expenses increased
from 68% in 1998 to 74% in 1999. This percentage increase was primarily due to
lower average realized prices.
OPERATING INCOME. Operating income increased $98 million, or 101%, from
$968 million in 1998 to $1066 million in 1999. The increase in operating
income was primarily attributable to the acquisitions described above, offset by
the $94 integration charge. Excluding the effect of the non-recurring charge of
$26 million attributable to the termination of the ESOP in 1998 and the effect
of the integration charge in 1999, as a percentage of net sales, operating
income was unchanged at 66% for both periods.

INTEREST AND SECURITIZATION EXPENSE. Interest and securitization expense
increased $91 million, or 294%, from $309 million in 1998 to $400 million in
1999. The increase was due to increased borrowings in connection with the
acquisitions described above and the Company 8 5/8% $2000 Senior Subordinated
Notes due 2008 the Notes. See --Liquidity and Capital Resources - Financing

RESULTS FOR 1998 COMPARED TO 1997
NET SALES. Net sales increased $9612 million, or 1788%, from $5376 million
in 1997 to $1,4988 million in 1998. The increase in net sales was principally
due to acquisitions. Average realized prices for steel products increased in
1998 compared to 1997. See -- Segment Results for additional information.
COST OF SALES. Cost of sales increased $7202 million, or 1736%, from $4149
million in 1997 to $1,1351 million in 1998. The increase in cost of sales was
principally due to the acquisitions described above. As a percentage of net
sales, cost of sales decreased from 772% in 1997 to 757% in 1998. This
percentage decrease was principally due to lower cost of raw materials.
OPERATING AND DELIVERY. Operating and delivery expenses increased $921
million, or 1715%, from $537 million in 1997 to $1458 million in 1998. The
increase in operating and delivery expenses was principally due to the
acquisitions described above. As a percentage of net sales, operating and
delivery expenses decreased from 100% in 1997 to 97% in 1998. This percentage
decrease was primarily due to the allocation of fixed costs over a higher volume
of net sales.
SELLING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE. Selling, general and administrative
expenses increased $636 million, or 1547%, from $411 million in 1997 to
$1047 million in 1998. This increase in selling, general and administrative

INTEREST AND SECURITIZATION EXPENSE. Interest expense increased $259
million, from $50 million in 1997 to $309 million in 1998. The increase in
interest expense was due to increased borrowings in connection with the
acquisitions described above and the increased interest expense associated with
the Notes.
PROVISION FOR INCOME TAXES. The Company provision for income taxes differs
from the federal statutory rate principally due to state income taxes net of
federal income tax benefit and the non-deductibility of the amortization of

SEGMENT RESULTS -- 1999 COMPARED TO 1998
HEAVY CARBON. Net sales increased $818 million, or 137%, from $5988
million in 1998 to $6806 million in 1999. The increase in net sales is due to
acquisitions together with unit volume growth in the other subsidiaries.
Material shipments increased 254% in 1999 compared to 1998, offset by lower
average realized prices, which decreased approximately 94% in 1999 compared to
1998. Operating costs and expenses increased $769 million, or 139%, from
$5527 million in 1998 to $6296 million in 1999. Operating costs and expenses
as a percentage of net sales increased marginally, from 923% in 1998 to 925%
in 1999. Operating income increased by $49 million, or 106%, from $461
million in 1998 to $510 million in 1999. Operating income as a percentage of
net sales decreased from 77% in 1998 to 75% in 1999, primarily due to lower
average realized prices.
FLAT ROLLED. Net sales increased $1456 million, or 327%, from $4454
million in 1998 to $5910 million in 1999. The increase in net sales is
principally due to acquisitions. Material shipments increased 370% in 1999
compared to 1998, offset by lower average realized prices for steel products
which decreased approximately 32% in 1999 compared to 1998. Operating costs and
expenses increased $1331 million, or 317%, from $4196 million in 1998 to
$5527 million in 1999. Operating costs and expenses as a percentage of net
sales decreased marginally, from 942% in 1998 to 935% in 1999. Operating
income increased by $125 million, or 484%, from $258 million in 1998 to $383
million in 1999. Operating income as a percentage of net sales increased from
58% in 1998 to 65% in 1999, primarily due to lower average cost of raw
materials.
SPECIALTY METALS. Net sales increased $125 million, or 34%, from $3712
million in 1998 to $3837 million in 1999. Operating costs and expenses
increased $222 million, or 65%, from $3439 million in 1998 to $3661 million
in 1999. Operating costs and expenses as a percentage of net sales increased
from 926% in 1998 to 954% in 1999. This percentage increase was primarily due
to lower average realized prices for most products. Operating income decreased
by $97 million, or 355%, from $273 million in 1998 to $176 million in 1999.
This decrease was principally due to

ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS
OF OPERATIONS CONTINUED
the decline in the Company sales to the Aerospace industry. The decline in
sales to the Aerospace industry accounted for $316 million in net sales and
$86 million of operating income. Operating income as a percentage of net sales
decreased from 74% in 1998 to 46% in 1999.
BUILDING PRODUCTS. Net sales increased $333 million, or 357%, from $934
million in 1998 to $1267 million in 1999. The increase in net sales is
attributable to the increased demand for the Company manufactured products and
acquisitions. Operating costs and expenses increased $322 million, or 383 from $841 million in 1998 to $1163 million in 1999. Operating costs and
expenses as a percentage of net sales increased from 900% in 1998 to 918% in
1999. This percentage increase was due to higher cost of raw materials and
expansion of distribution facilities. Operating income increased by $11
million, or 118%, from $93 million in 1998 to $104 million in 1999. This
increase was principally due to 1999 being a full year of operations for the
1998 acquired companies. Operating income as a percentage of net sales decreased
from 100% in 1998 to 82% in 1999.
CORPORATE AND OTHER. This category reflects certain administrative costs and
expenses management has not allocated to its industry segments. The negative net
sales amount represents the elimination of intercompany sales. Operating loss
decreased by $10 million, or 85%, from $117 million in 1998 to $107 million
in 1999. This decrease was principally due to lower incentive compensation
expense.
SEGMENT RESULTS -- 1998 COMPARED TO 1997
HEAVY CARBON. Net sales increased $3646 million, or 1557%, from $2342
million in 1997 to $5988 million in 1998. The net sales attributable to the
1998 acquisitions contributed $1997 million of the increase. Average realized
prices for steel products increased approximately 10% in 1998 compared to 1997.
Material shipments increased 1533% in 1998 compared to 1997. Acquisitions
completed during 1998 accounted for 569% of the increase. Operating costs and
expenses increased $3315 million, or 1499%, from $2212 million in 1997 to
$5527 million in 1998. Operating costs and expenses as a percentage of net
sales decreased from 944% in 1997 to 923% in 1998. This percentage decrease
was primarily the allocation of fixed costs over a higher volume of net sales.
Operating income increased by $331 million, or 2546%, from $130 million in
1997 to $461 million in 1998. Operating income as a percentage of net sales
increased from 56% in 1997 to 77% in 1998. This percentage increase was due to
higher average realized prices and the allocation of fixed costs over a higher
volume of net sales.
FLAT ROLLED. Net sales increased $2076 million, or 873%, from $2378
million in 1997 to $4454 million in 1998. The net sales attributable to the
1998 acquisitions contributed $887 million of the increase. Average realized
prices for steel products increased approximately 26% in 1998 compared to 1997.
Material shipments increased 823% in 1998 compared to 1997. Acquisitions
completed during 1998 accounted for 296% of the increase. Operating costs and
expenses increased $1957 million, or 874%, from $2239 million in 1997 to
$4196 million in 1998. Operating costs and expenses, as a percentage of net
sales, was unchanged at 942% for both periods. Operating income increased by
$119 million, or 856%, from $139 million in 1997 to $258 million in 1998.
Operating income as a percentage of net sales was unchanged at 58% for both
periods.
SPECIALTY METALS. Net sales increased $3297 million, or 7945%, from $415
million in 1997 to $3712 million in 1998. The net sales attributable to the
1998 acquisitions contributed $2029 million of the increase. Operating costs
and expenses increased $3061 million, or 8098%, from $378 million in 1997 to
$3439 million in 1998. Operating costs and expenses as a percentage of net
sales increased from 911% in 1997 to 926% in 1998. This percentage increase
was primarily due to lower realized prices for most products. Operating income
increased by $236 million, or 6378%, from $37 million in 1997 to $273
million in 1998. This increase was principally due to the majority of the 1998
acquisitions having been acquired during the first half of the year. Operating
income as a percentage of net sales decreased from 89% in 1997 to 74% in 1998.
This percentage decrease was due to lower average realized prices for most
products.
BUILDING PRODUCTS. Net sales increased $693 million, or 2876%, from $241
million in 1997 to $934 million in 1998. The increase in net sales is
principally due to the 1998 Acquisitions. Operating costs and expenses increased
$624 million, or 2876%, from $217 million in 1997 to $841 million in 1998.
Operating costs and expenses as a percentage of net sales was unchanged at 900%
for both periods. Operating income increased by $69 million, or

OF OPERATIONS CONTINUED
2875%, from $24 million in 1997 to $93 million in 1998. This increase was
principally due to 1998 Acquisitions and to 1998 being a full year of operations
for the 1997 acquired companies. Operating income as a percentage of net sales
was unchanged at 100% for both periods.
CORPORATE AND OTHER. This category reflects certain administrative costs and
expenses management has not allocated to its industry segments. The negative net
sales amount represents the elimination of intercompany sales. Operating loss
increased by $10 million, from $107 million in 1997 to $117 million in 1998.
This increase was principally due to a full year of costs and the $26 million
non-recurring charge associated with the termination of the Jeffrey Employee
Stock Ownership Plan ESOP in 1998, offset by the $60 million Compensation
Charge the Company incurred in 1997.
LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES
Beginning with the IPO on July 11, 1997, and through January 31, 1999, the
Company completed a number of financing transactions designed to enhance the
Company liquidity, reduce incremental interest expense and extend debt
maturities. The transactions included a public equity offering of Common Stock
which resulted in net proceeds of $583 million, the sale of $2000 million
aggregate principal amount of 8 5/8% Senior Subordinated Notes due 2008 the
Notes, the establishment of a $3500 million revolving credit facility with a
group of commercial banks the Credit Facility and a $1000 million trade
receivable securitization facility, pursuant to a three-year agreement with a
commercial bank the Receivable Securitization Facility. See --Financing
Activities.
At December 31, 1999, the Company had cash of $47 million, working capital
of $3054 million and total debt of $4408 million. At December 31, 1998, the
Company had cash of $93 million, working capital of $4143 million and total
debt of $5066 million. The decrease in working capital and debt at December 31,
1999 compared to December 31, 1998 is primarily attributable to the Company
Receivable Securitization Facility. At December 31, 1999, the proceeds for
receivables sold through the facility was $900 million. As of December 31, 1999
and March 29, 2000, the Company had $1540 million and $735 million,
respectively, of borrowing availability under the Credit Facility. Increased
borrowings during this period were used to fund the Company increased working
capital requirements. The Company anticipates that its cash flow from operations
will be sufficient to meet the Company normal working capital and debt service
requirements for at least the next several years, exclusive of acquisition
requirements. The Company intends to retain the majority of its earnings to
finance the expansion of its business and for general corporate purposes,
including future acquisitions. On February 10, 2000, the Company announced its
first quarterly dividend of $03 per share, payable on April 10, 2000 to
stockholders of record on March 17, 2000.
The Company provided $986 million and used $108 million in net cash from
operating activities for 1999 and 1998, respectively. Net cash used in investing
activities was $156 million and $2112 million for 1999 and 1998, respectively.
The principal use of cash during 1999 and 1998 was to fund the cash portion of
the acquisitions and capital expenditures. Net cash used in financing activities
during 1999 was $876 million which was used primarily to repay borrowings on
the Credit Facility, primarily from the proceeds of the Receivable
Securitization Facility. Net cash provided by financing activities was $2240
million for 1998. The cash provided by financing activities in 1998 consisted
primarily of the net proceeds from the sale of the Notes of $2000 million.
INVESTING ACTIVITIES
During 1999, the Company principal acquisitions were Southwest Steel Supply
Company, Wolf Brothers Steel Service Center and Allmet Building Products.
Additionally, the Company acquired the net assets of certain other businesses.
The aggregate consideration paid in connection with these acquisitions was
approximately $780 million in cash, 317,283 shares of Common Stock, convertible
notes of approximately $40 million and the assumption of indebtedness of
approximately $129 million.
The Company intends to continue to actively pursue acquisition opportunities.
The Company expects to fund future acquisitions through the issuance of
additional Common Stock, borrowings, including use of amounts available under
its Credit Facility and cash flow from operations. Capital expenditures for
equipment and expansion of facilities are expected to be funded from cash flow
from operations and supplemented as necessary by borrowings from the Credit

OF OPERATIONS CONTINUED
Facility or other sources of financing. To the extent the Company funds a
significant portion of the consideration for future acquisitions with cash, it
may have to increase the amount of the Credit Facility or obtain other sources
of financing.
The Company has an effective Shelf Registration Statement relating to the
issuance of up to 10,000,000 shares of common stock to be issued in connection
with future acquisitions. As of December 31, 1999, approximately 6,914,140
shares are available under this registration statement for use in connection
with future acquisitions.
FINANCING ACTIVITIES
On January 21, 1999, the Company established the Receivable Securitization
Facility to sell, on a revolving basis, through its wholly-owned subsidiary,
Metals Receivables Corporation MRC, an undivided interest in a designated
pool of its trade accounts receivable to a commercial bank Purchaser. The
maximum undivided interest in MRC receivable portfolio that may be purchased
pursuant to this agreement is $1000 million. The Company, as agent for
Purchaser, retains collection and administrative responsibilities for the
participating interests sold. As collections reduce the receivables included in
MRC receivable portfolio, the Company may sell additional undivided interests
in new receivables to the Purchaser. The amount of the undivided interest in
MRC receivable portfolio that is sold typically will change monthly depending
upon the level of defined eligible receivables available for sale each month
adjusted by certain defined ratios. The unpurchased portion of the MRC
receivable portfolio is a restricted asset and is effectively collateral for the
benefit of the Purchaser. At December 31, 1999, the unpurchased portion of the
MRC portfolio was $372 million. The Company used the proceeds from the sale of
the receivable portfolio to repay borrowings on the Credit Facility.
On April 22, 1999, the Company announced that the Board of Directors had
approved the use of up to $250 million to repurchase shares of the Company
Common Stock. The shares may be purchased, from time to time, in open market or
in privately negotiated transactions. During the period ended December 31, 1999,
the Company had repurchased 461,450 shares at an average price of $977 per
share, including fees and commissions. During the period from January 1, 2000 to
March 15, 2000, the Company repurchased 1,014,800 shares at an average price of
$749 per share including fees and commissions.
YEAR 2000
The Company did not experience any significant operational difficulties, nor
are we aware of any of our suppliers, customers or service providers
experiencing any significant operational difficulties as a result of Year 2000
issues. The Company will continue to monitor all critical systems for any
incidents of delayed complications or disruptions and problems encountered
through third parties with whom the Company deals, so that they may be timely
addressed. We estimate that our total costs to prevent Year 2000 issues have
been $4 million.
NEW ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS
SFAS No. 133, ACCOUNTING FOR DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS AND HEDGING ACTIVITIES,
was issued in June 1998. It establishes accounting and reporting standards for
derivative instruments, including certain derivative instruments embedded in
other contracts collectively referred to as derivatives, and for hedging
activities. In June 1999, SFAS No. 137, DEFERRAL OF THE EFFECTIVE DATE OF FASB
STATEMENT NO. 133, was issued and defers the adoption date to fiscal years
beginning after June 15, 2000. Management does not believe that the adoption of
this statement will have a material impact on the financial position or results
of operations of the Company.
21
METALS USA, INC.
ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK
In the normal course of business, the Company is exposed to market risk,
primarily from changes in interest rates. The Company continually monitors
exposure to market risk and develops appropriate strategies to manage this risk.
Accordingly, the Company may enter into certain derivative financial instruments
such as interest rate swap agreements. The Company does not use derivative
financial instruments for trading or to speculate on changes in interest rates.
INTEREST RATE EXPOSURE
The Company exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates
primarily to the Company Credit Facility. Approximately 445% $1960 million
and 533% $2700 million of the Credit Facility was subject to variable
interest rates as of December 31, 1999 and 1998, respectively. The Company
entered into two interest rate swap agreements in 1998 to reduce exposure to
interest rate changes. These agreements fixed interest rates for two years on
$1250 million of the variable interest Credit Facility. The detrimental effect
of a hypothetical 100 basis point increase in interest rates would be to reduce
income before taxes by $7 million and $15 million at December 31, 1999 and
1998, respectively. As of December 31, 1999 and 1998, the fair value of the
Company fixed rate debt was approximately $2248 million and $2267 million,
respectively, based upon discounted future cash flows using current market
prices. The fair value of the interest rate swap agreements was $15 million and
$2 million at December 31, 1999 and 1998, respectively.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT PUBLIC ACCOUNTANTS
To Metals USA, Inc. We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Metals USA, Inc.
a Delaware corporation and subsidiaries the Company as of December 31,
1999 and 1998, and the related consolidated statements of operations, cash flows
and stockholders' equity for each of the three years in the period ended
December 31, 1999. These financial statements are the responsibility of the
Company management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these
financial statements based on our audits.
We conducted our audits in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted
in the United States. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit
to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free
of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence
supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit
also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates
made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement
presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our
opinion.
In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present
fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated financial position of Metals
USA, Inc. and subsidiaries as of December 31, 1999 and 1998, and the
consolidated results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the
three years in the period ended December 31, 1999, in conformity with accounting
principles generally accepted in the United States.

1. BASIS OF PRESENTATION AND SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
BASIS OF PRESENTATION
Metals USA, Inc., a Delaware corporation, Metals USA was founded on July
3, 1996 to become a leading national value-added metals processor and
distributor, to manufacture higher-value components from processed metals and to
pursue the consolidation of the highly fragmented metals processing industry.
Prior to its initial public offering IPO, Metals USA had conducted no
operations. Concurrent with the consummation of its IPO on July 11, 1997, Metals
USA acquired, in separate transactions the Mergers eight companies the
Founding Companies engaged in the processing of steel, aluminum and specialty
metals, as well as the manufacture of metal components. Following the IPO and
through December 31, 1999, Metals USA acquired numerous additional metal
processing companies and businesses See Note 2. Certain of the companies
acquired after the IPO were accounted for using the pooling-of-interests
method, resulting in a restatement of the Company financial statements for all
periods presented See Note 2. References herein to the Company include
Metals USA and its subsidiaries.
The Company sells to businesses such as the machining, furniture,
transportation equipment, power and process equipment, industrial/commercial
construction, consumer durables and electrical equipment industries, and
machinery and equipment manufacturers. The Company believes that its broad
customer base and its wide array of metals processing capabilities, products and
services, coupled with its broad geographic coverage of the United States,
reduce the Company susceptibility to economic fluctuations affecting any one
industry or geographical area.
USE OF ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted
accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that
affect i the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, ii the disclosure
of contingent assets and liabilities known to exist as of the date the financial
statements are published and iii the reported amount of revenues and expenses
recognized during the periods presented. The Company reviews all significant
estimates affecting its consolidated financial statements on a recurring basis
and records the effect of any necessary adjustments prior to their publication.
Adjustments made with respect to the use of estimates often relate to improved
information not previously available. Uncertainties with respect to such
estimates and assumptions are inherent in the preparation of financial
statements.
SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
PRINCIPLES OF CONSOLIDATION -- The consolidated financial statements include
the accounts of Metals USA and its subsidiaries. All intercompany accounts and
transactions have been eliminated in the consolidated financial statements.
Certain reclassifications have been made to prior years' financial statements to
be consistent with the current year presentation.
INVENTORIES -- Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market. Certain
of the Company subsidiaries use the last-in, first-out LIFO method of
accounting for inventories and other subsidiaries use a variety of methods
including specific identification, average cost and the first-in first-out
FIFO method of accounting. As of December 31, 1999 and 1998, approximately
201% and 295%, respectively, of the consolidated inventories were accounted
for using the LIFO method of accounting.
PROPERTY AND EQUIPMENT -- Property and equipment is stated at cost, net of
accumulated depreciation. Depreciation is computed using the straight-line
method at rates based upon the estimated useful lives of the various classes of
assets.

METALS USA, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - CONTINUED
IN MILLIONS, EXCEPT SHARE AND PER SHARE AMOUNTS
1. BASIS OF PRESENTATION AND SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
CONTINUED
OTHER LONG-LIVED ASSETS -- Goodwill represents the excess of cost over the
estimated fair value of identifiable assets of the businesses acquired using the
purchase method of accounting. Goodwill is stated at cost, net of accumulated
amortization, and is being amortized over a forty-year life using the
straight-line method. Other long-lived assets include deferred financing costs
and other intangible assets, which are being amortized over the estimated useful
life of the related borrowing or intangible asset. The Company reviews the
recoverability of goodwill and other long-lived assets for impairment whenever
events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the
asset may be impaired. The Company has not recorded any impairment losses with
respect to goodwill or other long-lived assets to date. The accumulated
amortization of goodwill totaled $137 and $68 as of December 31, 1999 and
1998, respectively. Accumulated amortization of other assets totaled $41 and
$24 as of December 31, 1999 and 1998, respectively. Amortization expense for
the years ended December 31, 1999, 1998 and 1997 was $73, $59, and $15,
respectively. Amortization of deferred financing costs for the years ended
December 31, 1999, 1998 and 1997 was $13, $9, and $1, respectively, and is
included in the interest and securitization expense on the accompanying
consolidated statements of operations.
FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS -- The carrying values of cash, accounts
receivable and accounts payable approximate fair value. The fair value of the
long-term debt is estimated based on interest rates for the same or similar debt
offered to the Company having the same or similar remaining maturities and
collateral requirements. At December 31, 1999, the fair value of the Company
fixed rate long-term debt of $2448 was $2248. The carrying amount of the
Company variable rate long-term debt of $1960 approximates fair value.
INTEREST RATE SWAP AGREEMENTS -- The Company has entered into interest rate
swap agreements to fix interest rates on variable rate debt and reduce exposure
to interest rate fluctuations. Such agreements involve the exchange of amounts
based on fixed interest rates for amounts based on variable interest rates over
the life of the agreement without an exchange of the notional amount upon which
payments are based. The differential to be paid or received as interest rates
change is accounted for on the accrual method of accounting. The related amount
payable or receivable from counterparties is included as an adjustment to
accrued interest in other accrued liabilities. In the event of early
extinguishment, any gain or loss would be recognized in income at the time of
extinguishment. At December 31, 1999, the fair value of the interest rate swap
agreements was $15.
CONCENTRATION OF CREDIT RISK -- Financial instruments, which potentially
subject the Company to concentrations of credit risk, consist principally of
cash deposits, trade accounts and notes receivable. Concentrations of credit
risk with respect to trade accounts are within the machining, furniture,
transportation equipment, power and process equipment, industrial/commercial
construction, consumer durables and electrical equipment industries, and
machinery and equipment manufacturers. Generally, credit is extended once
appropriate credit history and references have been obtained. Provisions to the
allowance for doubtful accounts are made monthly and adjustments are made
periodically as circumstances warrant based upon the expected collectibility
of all such accounts. Additionally, the Company periodically reviews the credit
history of its customers and generally does not require collateral for the
extension of credit.
INCOME TAXES -- The Company accounts for income taxes in accordance with
Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 109 SFAS No. 109, ACCOUNTING
FOR INCOME TAXEs. Under SFAS No. 109, deferred income taxes are recognized for
the future tax consequences of differences between the tax bases of assets and
liabilities and their financial reporting amounts based on enacted tax laws and
statutory tax rates applicable to the periods in which the differences are
expected to affect taxable income. Valuation allowances are established when
necessary to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount expected to be realized.
Provision for income taxes represents the amount of taxes payable and the
applicable changes in deferred tax assets and liabilities.

NEW ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS - SFAS No. 133, ACCOUNTING FOR DERIVATIVE
INSTRUMENTS AND HEDGING ACTIVITIES, was issued in June 1998. It establishes
accounting and reporting standards for derivative instruments, including certain
derivative instruments embedded in other contracts collectively referred to as
derivatives, and for hedging activities. In June 1999, SFAS No. 137, DEFERRAL
OF THE EFFECTIVE DATE OF FASB STATEMENT NO. 133, was issued and defers the

2. BUSINESS COMBINATIONS CONTINUED
Prior to the acquisition by Metals USA, the shareholders of Wayne and Krohn
had elected to be taxed as S Corporations; accordingly, any federal income tax
liabilities for the periods prior to the acquisition dates were the
responsibility of the respective stockholders. For the purposes of these
consolidated financial statements, federal income taxes have been provided as if
Wayne and Krohn had filed C Corporation tax returns for the pre-acquisition
periods, with the current income tax provisions reflected in the consolidated
financial statements as increases to additional paid-in capital. Collectively,
Metals USA issued 9,490,458 shares of common stock in exchange for all of the
capital stock of Jeffreys, Wayne and Krohn. The unaudited aggregate
pre-acquisition net sales and net income for Jeffreys, Wayne and Krohn during
1997 were $2399 and $89, respectively. The unaudited aggregate pre-acquisition
net sales and net income for Krohn during 1998 were $135 and $9, respectively.
There were no transactions between Metals USA, Jeffreys, Wayne or Krohn during
periods prior to these business combinations.

BORROWINGS UNDER THE CREDIT FACILITY
Concurrent with the IPO, the Company obtained an initial $1500 unsecured
revolving credit facility the Original Credit Facility which was used to
fund acquisitions, refinance certain indebtedness of the acquired companies and
for general corporate and working capital requirements. In January 1998, the
Company obtained a $500 unsecured revolving credit facility the Interim
Credit Facility to meet its acquisition related cash requirements pending the
completion of an extension and modification of the Original Credit Facility to
provide for up to $3000 of borrowing availability. The closing of the extension
and modification of the $3000 credit facility the Credit Facility on
February 11, 1998 stipulated the termination of the Interim Credit Facility. On
November 25, 1998 the Company further amended the Credit Facility to provide for
borrowings of up to $3500. As of December 31, 1999, the Company had $1540 of
borrowing availability under the Credit Facility.
The Credit Facility matures in February 2003, bears interest at the bank
prime rate or LIBOR, at Metals USA option, plus an applicable margin based on
the ratio of funded debt to cash flows as defined. An annual commitment fee is
payable on any unused portion of the Credit Facility. The commitment fee varies
between 1/2% and 1/4% per annum, based on certain leverage ratios as defined in
the agreement. The Company uses the Credit Facility to fund acquisitions, make
capital expenditures, refinance debt of the companies acquired and for general
working capital requirements. Borrowings under the Credit Facility are
guaranteed by each of the Company material subsidiaries as defined and
secured by the pledge of all of the capital stock of such subsidiaries.

METALS USA, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

6. LONG-TERM DEBT CONTINUED
The Credit Facility requires the Company to comply with various affirmative
and negative covenants including: i the maintenance of certain financial
ratios, ii restrictions on additional indebtedness, iii restrictions on
liens, guarantees and dividends, iv obtaining the lenders' consent with
respect to certain individual acquisitions, and v maintenance of a specified
level of consolidated net worth. At December 31, 1999, the Company had $148
available for the payment of dividends under the terms of the Credit Facility.
The Company has entered into two interest rate swap agreements designed as a
partial hedge to the Company variable rate borrowings under the Credit
Facility. The purpose of these swap agreements is to fix interest rates on a
portion of its borrowings under the Credit Facility, thereby reducing exposure
to interest rate fluctuations. At December 31, 1999, the Company had interest
rate swap agreements with a notional amount of $1250 compared to the total
borrowings under the Credit Facility of $1960. Under these agreements, the
Company will pay the counterparties interest at a weighted average fixed rate of
508% and the counterparties will pay the Company interest at a variable rate
equal to LIBOR. The weighted average LIBOR rate applicable to these agreements
was 611% at December 31, 1999. The notional amounts do not represent amounts
exchanged by the parties, and thus are not a measure of exposure of the Company.
The weighted average variable rates are subject to change over time based on
fluctuations in the 90 day LIBOR rate. Terms for the agreements expire on
November 30, 2000 and December 4, 2000.
Neither the Company nor the counterparties, which are prominent financial
institutions, are required to collateralize their respective obligations under
these agreements. The Company is exposed to loss if one or both of the
counterparties default. At December 31, 1999, the Company had no exposure to
credit loss on the interest rate swaps. The Company does not believe that any
reasonably likely change in interest rates would have a material adverse effect
on the financial position, results of operations or cash flows of the Company.
8 5/8% SENIOR SUBORDINATED NOTES
On February 11, 1998, the Company completed the sale of $2000 aggregate
principal amount of the Company 8 5/8% Senior Subordinated Notes due 2008 the
Notes. The Company received $1945 of net cash proceeds before expenses of
$8 at closing. The Company used $1793 of such proceeds to repay all the
borrowings outstanding under the Original Credit Facility and Interim Credit
Facility on February 11, 1998.
The Notes call for semi-annual interest payments on February 15 and August 15
of each year, beginning August 15, 1998 and mature on February 15, 2008. The
Notes are redeemable at the option of the Company, in whole or in part, at any
time on or after February 15, 2003, at the following redemption prices: 2003 104313%; 2004 -- 102875%; 2005 -- 101438%; thereafter -- 10000%, together
with accrued and unpaid interest to the date of redemption. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, at any time on or prior to February 15, 2001, the Company may redeem
up to 35% of the aggregate principal amount of the Notes originally issued with
the net proceeds of one or more offerings of the common stock of the Company, at
a redemption price equal to 108625% of the principal amount thereof, plus
accrued and unpaid interest to the date of such redemption; provided that at
least 65% of the aggregate principal amount of Notes originally issued remains
outstanding immediately after such redemption. The Notes are guaranteed by
substantially all of the Company current and future subsidiaries.
Additionally, the indenture governing the Notes contains customary restrictions
relating to additional indebtedness, liens, transactions with affiliates, asset
sales, investments, restricted payments and mergers and acquisitions of
subsidiaries. The Notes are subordinate to borrowings under the Credit Facility
and will rank PARI PASSU in right of payment with all other future subordinated
debt of the Company and will rank senior to other indebtedness that expressly
provides that it is subordinated in right of payment to the Notes.
VARIOUS ISSUES OF INDUSTRIAL REVENUE BONDS
The Industrial Revenue Bonds the IRBs are payable in installments ranging
from monthly to annual with variable interest ranging from 550% to 660% per
annum at December 31, 1999 and mature from March 1, 2001 to May 1, 2023. The
IRBs are secured by real estate and equipment acquired with proceeds from these
bonds with a net book value of $285 at December 31, 1999. The IRBs place
various restrictions on certain of the Company subsidiaries, including but not
limited to maintenance of required insurance coverage, maintenance of certain

ratios, limits on capital expenditures and maintenance of tangible net worth and
are supported by letters of credit.
ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE SECURITIZATION FACILITY
In January 1999, the Company entered into a three-year agreement the
Receivable Securitization Facility to sell, on a revolving basis, through its
wholly-owned subsidiary, Metals Receivables Corporation MRC, an undivided
interest in a designated pool of its trade accounts receivable to a commercial
bank Purchaser. The maximum undivided interest in MRC receivable portfolio
that may be purchased pursuant to this agreement is $1000. At December 31,
1999, the Company had received $900 from this facility. The Company, as agent
for Purchaser, retains collection and administrative responsibilities for the
participating interests sold. As collections reduce the receivables included in
MRC receivable portfolio, the Company may sell additional undivided interests
in new receivables to the Purchaser. The amount of the undivided interest in
MRC receivable portfolio that is sold typically will change monthly depending
upon the level of defined eligible receivables available for sale each month
adjusted by certain defined ratios. The unpurchased portion of the MRC
receivable portfolio is a restricted asset and effectively collateral for the
benefit of the Purchaser. At December 31, 1999, the unpurchased portion of the
MRC receivable portfolio was $372 and is included in accounts receivable on the
consolidated balance sheet.
The Company recorded $49 of expense attributable to the Receivable
Securitization Facility for the year ended December 31, 1999, which is included
in interest and securitization expense on the consolidated statements of
operations.

purchase 10,000 shares, ii the automatic grant to each non-employee director
of an option to purchase 10,000 shares upon such person initial election as a
director and iii an automatic annual grant at each annual meeting of
stockholders thereafter of an option to purchase 5,000 shares to each
non-employee director at which meeting such director is re-elected or remains a
director, unless such annual meeting is held within three months of such
person initial election as a director. All options will have an exercise price
per share equal to the fair market value of the Common Stock on the date of
grant and are immediately vested and expire on the earlier of ten years from the
date of grant or one year after termination of service as a director. The
Directors' Plan also permits non-employee directors to elect to receive, in lieu
of cash directors' fees, shares or credits representing deferred shares at
future settlement dates, as selected by the director. The number of shares or
deferred shares received will equal the number of shares of Common Stock which,
at the date the fees would otherwise be payable, will have an aggregate fair
market value equal to the amount of such fees.

At December 31, 1999, exercisable options for shares of Common Stock were
1,550,441 at a weighted average price of $1149 per share.
The Company used the Black-Scholes model to calculate the estimated
fair-value of stock options and similar awards. The model requires the use of
a number of subjective assumptions including: i risk free rate of return, ii
expected price volatility of the Common Stock, iii expected dividend yield and
iv estimated life of the option. Principal assumptions used in estimating the
fair-value of the Company stock options using the Black-Scholes model were
as follows                            DECEMBER 31,
1999   1998
Risk free rate of return..  621%  591%
Expected price volatility..  4806%  4606%
Expected dividend yield..  --          Expected life of the option in years   75   75
The Company applies APB No. 25 and related interpretations in accounting for
its stock option plans. Had compensation cost for the Company stock option
plans been determined based upon the fair value at the grant rate, consistent
with the methodology prescribed under the SFAS No. 123, the Company net income
and earnings per share would have been reduced by the amortization of the
estimated fair value of stock options over the applicable vesting period of such
awards. The following pro forma disclosures may not be representative of similar
future disclosures because: i additional options may be granted in future
years and ii the computations used to estimate the fair value of the stock
options are subject to significant subjective assumptions, any one or all of
which may differ in material respects from actual amounts.

10.  INTEGRATION CHARGE
On September 8, 1999, the Company announced a comprehensive plan to reduce
operating costs and improve its operational efficiency by fully integrating
certain operations within a geographic area and consolidating certain
administrative and support functions. The Company recorded a charge to
operations of $94 in respect of this plan the Integration Charge. The
principal components of the Integration Charge are $33 for termination of
certain employment contracts, $21 for severance costs attributable to the
consolidation of administrative and support functions, and $40 for the costs of
combining five processing facilities into others within the same geographic
region. These changes will affect less than 5% of the Company workforce. The
following schedule sets forth by segment the Integration Charge recorded in the
third quarter and the incurred costs as of December 31,1999.
INTEGRATION  COSTS
CHARGE   INCURRED
Heavy Carbon        $30     $ 4
Flat Rolled         8      Specialty Metals..       30     14
Building Products..       26      1
Total        $94     $19
The Company expects to incur approximately $10 to $20 during each of the
next three quarterly reporting periods with respect to the personnel related
costs. Approximately $40 of facility integration costs will occur at various
times over the next three quarterly reporting periods of which, approximately
$30, attributable to Heavy Carbon and Building Products, are expected to occur
during the third quarter of 2000. Although the foregoing estimates with respect
to both costs and timing reflect the best information available to management,
there can be no assurance that such costs will not exceed current expectations
or that the timing of the facility integration activities will not be delayed.
In aggregate, adjustments for estimates for costs incurred through December 31,
1999 were less than $1. Approximately $10 of the costs incurred result from
negotiated settlements with respect to certain employment contracts that are to
be paid over a three to five year period. These amounts were reclassified from
the Integration Charge to other accrued liabilities at December 31, 1999.
11.  SEGMENT AND RELATED INFORMATION

12.  EMPLOYEE BENEFIT PLANS
PROFIT-SHARING PLANS
The Company established the Metals USA, Inc. 401k Plan on June 1, 1998 to
provide a standardized defined contributions savings plan the Plan for
employees. Participants are eligible for the Plan after completing six full
calendar months of service. Participants' employer contributions vest at varying
rates, ranging from full vesting upon participation to vesting that begins after
one year of service and are fully vested after four years. The Company
contributions consist of a matching contribution of 50%, up to 6% of the
eligible employee contribution. The Plan allows the employee to contribute up
to 15% of their eligible compensation.
The Company established the Metals USA, Inc. Union 401k Plan on October 1,
1998 to provide a standard defined contributions savings plan for all employees
covered under the terms of a collective bargaining agreement the Union Plan.
The employer is not obligated by the Union Plan to make contributions, unless
required by the operative collective bargaining agreement. These contributions
will generally vest from four to seven years, as specified by the terms of the
applicable collective bargaining agreement. The Union Plan allows the employee
to contribute up to 15% of their eligible compensation.
Certain subsidiaries provided various defined contributions plans for their
employees prior to being acquired by Metals USA, Inc. Contributions for the
profit-sharing portion of these plans, prior to the inception of the Plan and
the Union Plan, were at the discretion of the individual subsidiaries' board of
directors. The benefit plans of acquired companies are merged into the Plan as
soon as practicable.
The aggregate contributions to the Plans were $34, $28, and $9 for the
years ended December 31, 1999, 1998 and 1997, respectively.
LEVERAGED ESOP ARRANGEMENT
Under the provisions of an employee stock ownership plan ESOP and its
related trust, Jeffreys made annual contributions to the ESOP which were
invested in stock of Jeffreys and other qualifying securities for the benefit of
Jeffreys' employees. The ESOP provided for Jeffreys' purchases of employee
shares to be paid in cash and with the issuance of a note payable. Effective
September 26, 1997, the participation was frozen. Concurrent with the merger
with Metals USA, ESOP shares were exchanged for shares of Metals USA common
stock. The following reflects the equivalent shares of Metals USA common stock
that were issued in connection with the acquisition of Jeffreys.
Jeffreys' ESOP held 434,616 shares of stock prior to the purchase of 735,384
shares of outstanding stock from a majority stockholder for $531 per share. The
ESOP borrowed the funds to purchase such stock and Jeffreys guaranteed the
repayment of this loan. Jeffreys repaid this loan, plus interest, through
deductible contributions to the plan. As Jeffreys made contributions to the
plan, which reduced the principal on the note, the plan released the
corresponding shares related to the reduction in the note principal. At the
point when these shares were no longer specifically secured by the note payable,
they were allocated to the individual participants of the plan and considered
earned by those employees at that time. Jeffreys accounted for its ESOP in
accordance with Statement of Position 93-6 SOP 93-6, EMPLOYERS' ACCOUNTING
FOR EMPLOYEE STOCK OWNERSHIP PLANS. Accordingly, the debt of the ESOP was
recorded as long-term debt and the shares pledged as collateral were reported as
unearned compensation. As shares were released from collateral, Jeffreys
reported compensation expense equal to estimated market price of the shares at
that time. ESOP share compensation expense was $26 and $4 for the years ended
December 31, 1998 and 1997, respectively.

12.  EMPLOYEE BENEFIT PLANS CONTINUED
Since the obligation was secured by the shares purchased and the note was
guaranteed by Jeffreys, all amounts relating to this transaction were considered
unearned compensation of the employees until such time as the note was repaid
and the corresponding shares are released to the individual participants of the
plan. With the termination of the ESOP in August 1998, subsequent to the payment
of the note to Jeffreys and the distribution of the ESOP shares to the
individual participants, all unearned compensation was charged to expense in
1998.
The activity relating to the ESOP shares was as follows                       YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31,
1998     1997

Total ESOP shares..     --    1,170,000
In accordance with SOP 93-6, additional paid-in capital was adjusted whenever
the market value of the shares released was more or less than the cost of the
shares released. The increase in additional paid-in capital attributable to this
difference in market value and cost was $21 for the year ended December 31,
1998.

CONTINGENCIES
The Company and its subsidiaries are involved in a variety of claims,
lawsuits and other disputes arising in the ordinary course of business. The

related costs and expenses should not have a material adverse effect on the
Company consolidated financial position, results of operations or liquidity.
15.  RELATED-PARTY TRANSACTIONS
Transactions with directors, executive officers, principal shareholders or
affiliates of the Company must be at terms that are no less favorable to the
Company than those available from third parties and must be approved in advance
by a majority of disinterested members of the Board of Directors.
In connection with the Mergers and certain of the subsequent acquisitions,
subsidiaries of the Company have entered into a number of lease arrangements for
facilities and equipment. These lease arrangements are for periods ranging from
10 to 20 years. Payments under these lease arrangements with respect to years
ended December 31, 1999, 1998 and 1997 were $32, $31, and $14, respectively.
Future commitments in respect of these leases are included in the schedule of
minimum lease payments in Note 14.
At December 31, 1999 and 1998 the aggregate principal amount of related-party
notes receivable held by the Company were $6 and $7, respectively. Interest
accrues on the notes at rates ranging from 75% to 80% per annum. The notes
call for regular periodic payments of principal and interest and mature at
varying dates through March 1, 2007. The notes are secured by liens on specific
assets of the affiliates and personal guarantees of the individuals. As of
December 31, 1999, the notes were current as to payment terms.
