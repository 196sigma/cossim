of Operations
The following discussion should be read in conjunction with, and is
qualified in its entirety by, the Consolidated Financial Statements and the
Notes thereto and Selected Financial Data included elsewhere in this Form 10-K.
Historical operating results and percentage relationships among any amounts
included in the Consolidated Financial Statements are not necessarily indicative
of trends in operating results for any future period.
Cautionary Statements for Purposes of the Safe Harbor Provisions of the Private
Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995
The Company wishes to caution readers that this report contains, and
future filings by the Company, press releases and oral statements made by the
Company authorized representatives may contain, forward-looking statements
that involve certain risks and uncertainties. Readers can identify these
forward-looking statements by the use of such verbs as expects, anticipates,
believes or similar verbs or conjugations of such verbs. The Company actual
results could differ materially from those expressed in such forward-looking
statements due to important factors bearing on the Company business, many of
which already have been discussed in this filing and in the Company prior
filings. The differences could be caused by a number of factors or combination
of factors including, but not limited to, the risk factors described below.
You should carefully consider the following risks and uncertainties,
and all other information contained in or incorporated by reference in this
annual report or Form 10-K, before making an investment in our common stock. Any
of the following risks could have a material adverse effect on our business,
financial condition or operating results. In such case, the trading price of our
common stock could decline and you may lose all or part of your investment.
The demand for our products is cyclical, which could adversely impact
our revenues.
The end markets for fully assembled bearings are cyclical and tend to
decline in response to overall declines in industrial production. As a result,
the market for bearing components is also cyclical and impacted by overall
levels of industrial production. Our sales in the past have been negatively
affected, and in the future will be negatively affected, by adverse conditions
in the industrial production sector of the economy or by adverse global or
national economic conditions generally.                    12     We depend on a very limited number of foreign sources for our primary
raw material and are subject to risks of shortages and price fluctuation.
The steel that we use to manufacture precision balls and rollers is of
an extremely high quality and is available from a limited number of producers on
a global basis. Due to quality constraints in the U.S. steel industry, we obtain
substantially all of the steel used in our U.S. ball and roller production from
overseas suppliers. In addition, we obtain substantially all of the steel used
in our European ball production from a single European source. If we had to
obtain steel from sources other than our current suppliers, particularly in the
case of our European operations, we could face higher prices and transportation
costs, increased duties or taxes, and shortages of steel. Problems in obtaining
steel, and particularly 52100 chrome steel, in the quantities that we require
and on commercially reasonable terms, could increase our costs, negatively
impact our ability to operate our business efficiently and have a material
adverse effect on the operating and financial results of our Company.
We operate in and sell products to customers outside the U.S. and are
subject to several related risks.
Because we obtain a majority of our raw materials from overseas
suppliers, actively participate in overseas manufacturing operations and sell to
a large number of international customers, we face risks associated with the
following      o  adverse foreign currency fluctuations      o  changes in trade, monetary and fiscal policies, laws and
regulations, and other activities of governments, agencies and
similar organizations      o  the imposition of trade restrictions or prohibitions      o  high tax rates that discourage the repatriation of funds to the
U.S.      o  the imposition of import or other duties or taxes; and
o  unstable governments or legal systems in countries in which our
suppliers, manufacturing operations, and customers are located.
We do not have a hedging program in place associated with consolidating the
operating results of our foreign businesses into U.S. dollars. An increase in
the value of the U.S. dollar and/or the Euro relative to other currencies may
adversely affect our ability to compete with our foreign-based competitors for
international, as well as domestic, sales. Also, a decline in the value of the
Euro relative to the U.S. dollar will negatively impact our consolidated
financial results, which are denominated in U.S. dollars.
In addition, due to the typical slower summer manufacturing season in
Europe, we expect that revenues in the third fiscal quarter will reflect lower
sales, as our sales to European customers have increased as a percentage of net
sales.
We depend heavily on a relatively limited number of customers, and the
loss of any major customer would have a material adverse effect on our
business.
Sales to various U.S. and foreign divisions of SKF, which is one of the
largest bearing manufacturers in the world, accounted for approximately 33% of
consolidated net sales in 2002, and sales to INA/FAG accounted for approximately
19% of consolidated net sales in 2002. During 2002, our ten largest customers
accounted for approximately 73% of our consolidated net sales. None of our other
customers individually accounted for more than 5% of our consolidated net sales
for 2002. The loss of all or a substantial portion of sales to these customers
would cause us to lose a substantial portion of our revenue and would lower our
profit margin and cash flows from operations.
The costs and difficulties of integrating acquired business could
impede our future growth.
We cannot assure you that any future acquisition will enhance our
financial performance. Our ability to effectively integrate any future
acquisitions will depend on, among other things, the adequacy of our
implementation plans, the ability of our management to oversee and operate
effectively the combined operations and our ability to achieve desired operating
efficiencies and sales goals. The integration of any acquired businesses might
cause us to incur unforeseen costs, which would lower our profit margin and
future earnings and would prevent us from realizing the expected benefits of
these acquisitions.                    13     We may not be able to continue to make the acquisitions necessary for
us to realize our growth strategy.
Acquiring businesses that complement or expand our operations has been
and continues to be an important element of our business strategy. This strategy
calls for growth through acquisitions constituting approximately two-thirds of
our future growth, with the remainder resulting from internal growth and market
penetration. We bought our plastic bearing component business in 1999, formed
Euroball with our two largest bearing customers, SKF and INA/FAG, in 2000 and
acquired our bearing seal operations in 2001. During 2002, we purchased
INA/FAG minority interest in Euroball. See Note 2 of the Notes to Consolidated
Financial Statements. We cannot assure you that we will be successful in
identifying attractive acquisition candidates or completing acquisitions on
favorable terms in the future. In addition, we may borrow funds to acquire other
businesses, increasing our interest expense and debt levels. Our inability to
acquire businesses, or to operate them profitably once acquired, could have a
material adverse effect on our business, financial position, results of
operations and cash flows.
Additionally, SKF, the minority shareholder in Euroball, has the right
to require us to purchase its interest beginning in January 2003. SKF has
informed us that it intends to exercise its right and we expectt to purchase its
interest in the second quarter of 2003. The Company may need to borrow funds to
pay for all or a portion of the purchase of SKF interest or may be required to
make a purchase at a time that is less favorable to the Company.
Our growth strategy depends on outsourcing, and if the industry trend
toward outsourcing does not continue, our business could be adversely
affected.
Our growth strategy depends in significant part on major bearing
manufacturers continuing to outsource components, and expanding the number of
components being outsourced. This requires manufacturers to depart significantly
from their traditional methods of operations. If major bearing manufacturers do
not continue to expand outsourcing efforts or determine to reduce their use of
outsourcing, our ability to grow our business could be materially adversely
affected.
Our market is highly competitive and many of our competitors have
significant advantages that could adversely affect our business.
The global market for bearing components is highly competitive, with a
majority of production represented by the captive production operations of
certain large bearing manufacturers and the balance represented by independent
manufacturers. Captive manufacturers make components for internal use and for
sale to third parties. All of the captive manufacturers, and many independent
manufacturers, are significantly larger and have greater resources than do we.
Our competitors are continuously exploring and implementing improvements in
technology and manufacturing processes in order to improve product quality, and
our ability to remain competitive will depend, among other things, on whether we
are able to keep pace with such quality improvements in a cost effective manner.
The production capacity we have added over the last several years has
at times resulted in our having more capacity than we need, causing
our operating costs to be higher than expected.
We have expanded our ball and roller production facilities and
capacity over the last several years. During 1997, we built an additional
manufacturing plant in Kilkenny, Ireland, and we continued this expansion in
2000 through the formation of Euroball with SKF and INA/FAG. Our ball and roller
facilities have not always operated at full capacity and from time to time our
results of operations have been adversely affected by the under-utilization of
our production facilities, and we face risks of further under-utilization or
inefficient utilization of our production facilities in future years.
The price of our common stock may be volatile.
The market price of our common stock could be subject to significant
fluctuations and may decline. Among the factors that could affect our stock
price are      o  our operating and financial performance and prospects      o  quarterly variations in the rate of growth of our financial
indicators, such as earnings per share, net income and revenues      o  changes in revenue or earnings estimates or publication of
research reports by analysts                    14      o  loss of any member of our senior management team      o  speculation in the press or investment community      o  strategic actions by us or our competitors, such as acquisitions
or restructurings      o  sales of our common stock by stockholders      o  general market conditions; and
o  domestic and international economic, legal and regulatory factors
unrelated to our performance.
The stock markets in general have experienced extreme volatility that
has often been unrelated to the operating performance of particular companies.
These broad market fluctuations may adversely affect the trading price of our
common stock.
Provisions in our charter documents and Delaware law may inhibit a
takeover, which could adversely affect the value of our common stock.
Our certificate of incorporation and bylaws, as well as Delaware
corporate law, contain provisions that could delay or prevent a change of
control or changes in our management that a stockholder might consider favorable
and may prevent you from receiving a takeover premium for your shares. These
provisions include, for example, a classified board of directors and the
authorization of our board of directors to issue up to 5,000,000 preferred
shares without a stockholder vote. In addition, our restated certificate of
incorporation provides that stockholders may not call a special meeting.
We are a Delaware corporation subject to the provisions of Section 203
of the Delaware General Corporation Law, an anti-takeover law. Generally, this
statute prohibits a publicly-held Delaware corporation from engaging in a
business combination with an interested stockholder for a period of three years
after the date of the transaction in which such person became an interested
stockholder, unless the business combination is approved in a prescribed manner.
A business combination includes a merger, asset sale or other transaction
resulting in a financial benefit to the stockholder. We anticipate that the
provisions of Section 203 may encourage parties interested in acquiring us to
negotiate in advance with our board of directors, because the stockholder
approval requirement would be avoided if a majority of the directors then in
office approve either the business combination or the transaction that results
in the stockholder becoming an interested stockholder.
These provisions apply even if the offer may be considered beneficial
by some of our stockholders. If a change of control or change in management is
delayed or prevented, the market price of our common stock could decline.
Overview
The Company core business is the manufacture and sale of high
quality, precision steel balls and rollers. In 2002, sales of balls and rollers
accounted for approximately 74% of the Company total net sales with 71% and 3%
of sales from balls and rollers, respectively. Sales of precision molded plastic
and rubber parts accounted for the remaining 26%. See Note 11 of the Notes to
Consolidated Financial Statements.
Since the Company was formed in 1980 it has grown primarily through the
displacement of captive ball manufacturing operations of domestic and
international bearing manufacturers resulting in increased sales of high
precision balls for quiet bearing applications. Management believes that the
Company core business sales growth since its formation has been due to its
ability to capitalize on opportunities in global markets and provide precision
products at competitive prices, as well as its emphasis on product quality and
customer service.
In 1997, the Company recognized changing dynamics in the marketplace,
and as a result, developed and began implementing an extensive long-term growth
strategy building upon its core business and leveraging its inherent strengths
to better serve its global customer base. As part of this strategy, the Company
sought to augment its intrinsic growth with complementary acquisitions that fit
specific criteria.
On July 4, 1999, the Company acquired substantially all of the assets
of Earsley Capital Corporation, formerly known as Industrial Molding Corporation
IMC. Formed in 1947, IMC provides full-service design and manufacture of
15 plastic injection molded components to the bearing, automotive, electronic,
leisure and consumer markets with an emphasis on value-added products that take
advantage of its capabilities in product development, tool design and tight
tolerance molding processes. IMC operates two manufacturing facilities in
Lubbock, Texas. During 2002, IMC sold its products to more than 60 customers in
12 different countries.
On July 31, 2000, the Company formed a majority owned stand-alone
company in Europe, NN Euroball ApS Euroball, for the manufacture and sale of
chrome steel balls used for ball bearings and other products. As a result of
this transaction, the Company owned 54% of Euroball. AB SKF and FAG Kugelfisher
Georg Shafer AG, the parent companies of SKF and FAG respectively each owned 23%
of Euroball. As part of the transaction, Euroball acquired the ball factories
located in Pinerolo, Italy previously owned by SKF, Eltmann, Germany
previously owned by FAG, and Kilkenny, Ireland previously owned by the
Company. Acquisition financing of approximately 315 million euro
approximately $297 million was drawn at closing, and the credit facility
provides for additional working capital expenditure financing. The Company is
required to consolidate Euroball due to its majority ownership and has accounted
for the acquisitions of the Pinerolo, Italy and Eltmann, Germany ball factories
using the purchase method of accounting. On December 20, 2002 the Company
completed the purchase of the 23% interest held by INA/FAG. The Company paid
approximately 134 million Euros $138 million for INA/FAG interest in
Euroball. The excess of minority interest in consolidated subsidiaries related
to INA/FAG 23% interest over the purchase price has been recorded as a
non-taxable gain in the amount of approximately $59 million. Following the
closing of the transaction, the Company owns 77% of the outstanding shares of
Euroball and SKF owns the remaining 23%. SKF consented to our purchase of
INA/FAG interest pursuant to the terms of the Euroball Shareholder Agreement.
Under the terms of the Shareholder Agreement with SKF, SKF has the right,
beginning January 2003, to exercise its put option regarding its interest in
Euroball to the Company on a formula buy-out. SKF has informed us that it
intends to exercise its right and we expect to purchase its interest during the
second quarter of 2003. However, if exercised at December 31, 2002, the purchase
price would have been approximately $140 million versus minority interest in
consolidated subsidiaries of $197 million.
On August 31, 2000, the Company acquired a 51% ownership interest in
NN Mexico, LLC NN Mexico, a Delaware limited liability company. NN Mexico
holds as its sole investment a 100% ownership interest in NN Arte, a
manufacturer of plastic components located in Guadalajara, Mexico. The Company
is required to consolidate NN Mexico due to its majority ownership and has
accounted for this acquisition using the purchase method of accounting. On
January 24, 2003, we exercised our Call Right to purchase the remaining 49%
interest in NN Mexico, LLC. The transaction, which is expected to close in the
second quarter of 2003, is subject to a number of conditions, including the
approval of NN board of directors. The transaction is not expected to
materially impact our financial condition or results of operations. Based on the
purchase priceformula ontained in the principal agreement between the parties,
the purchase price for such interest is anticipated to be zero.
On February 16, 2001, the Company completed the acquisition of all of
the outstanding stock of The Delta Rubber Company, a Connecticut corporation
Delta for $225 million in cash. Delta provides high quality engineered
bearing seals and other precision-molded rubber products to original equipment
manufacturers. Delta operates two manufacturing facilities in Danielson,
Connecticut. The Company credit facility with AmSouth Bank was renegotiated to
provide financing for the transaction. The Company has accounted for this
acquisition using the purchase method of accounting.
On September 11, 2001, the Company announced the closing of its
Walterboro, South Carolina ball manufacturing facility effective December 2001.
The closing was made as part of the Company strategy to redistribute its
global production in order to better utilize capacity and serve the needs of its
worldwide customers. The precision ball production of the Walterboro facility
has been fully absorbed by the Company remaining U.S. ball roller
manufacturing facilities located in Erwin and Mountain City, Tennessee. In 2002
and 2001 the Company recorded before tax charges associated with the closing of
$13 million and $19 million, respectively. In 2001, this amount includes a
$11 million before-tax charge for the recording of impairment on the Company
manufacturing facility located in Walterboro, South Carolina and $08 million
related to employee severance costs. In 2002, this amount includes a $06
million before-tax charge for the recording of an additional impairment on the
facility, a $06 million before-tax charge for the recording of impairment on
the machinery and equipment and a $01 million charge related to employee
severance costs. These amounts are reflected as restructuring and impairment
costs in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Income. The building along
with certain machinery and equipment are held for sale as of December 31, 2002.
These assets have an aggregate carrying value of $22 million. The financial
results of this operation have been reflected in the Domestic Ball and Roller
Segment. See Note 11 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.
Effective December 21, 2001, the Company sold its minority interest in
Jiangsu General Ball Roller Company, LTD, a Chinese ball and roller
manufacturer located in Rugao City, Jiangsu Province, China. To effect the
transaction, the Company sold its 50% ownership in NN General, LLC, which owns a
60% interest in the Jiangsu joint venture to its partner                    16 General Bearing Corporation for cash of $06 million and notes of $33 million.
In 2001, the Company recorded a non-cash after-tax loss on sale of the
investments in this joint venture of $02 million.
The implementation and successful execution of this acquisition
strategy to date has allowed the Company to expand its global presence and
positions the Company for continued global growth and expansion into core served
markets.
Critical Accounting Policies
Our significant accounting policies, including the assumptions and
judgment underlying them, are disclosed in Note 1 to the Consolidated
Financial Statements. These policies have been consistently applied in all
material respects and address such matters as revenue recognition, inventory
valuation, asset impairment recognition, business combination accounting and
pension and postretirement benefits. Due to the estimation processes involved,
management considers the following summarized accounting policies and their
application to be critical to understanding the Company business operations,
financial condition and results of operations. There can be no assurance that
actual results will not significantly differ from the estimates used in these
critical accounting policies.
Accounts Receivable. Substantially all of the Company accounts receivable are
due primarily from the core served markets: bearing manufacturers, automotive
industry, electronics, industrial, agricultural and aerospace. Due to the
Chapter 7 voluntary bankruptcy of one IMC customer and other write-offs, the
Company experienced $17 million of bad debt expense during 2001 versus $01
million during 2002. In establishing allowances for doubtful accounts, the
Company continuously performs credit evaluations of its customers, considering
numerous inputs when available including the customers' financial position, past
payment history, relevant industry trends, cash flows, management capability,
historical loss experience and economic conditions and prospects. While
management believes that adequate allowances for doubtful accounts have been
provided in the Consolidated Financial Statements, it is possible that the
Company could experience additional unexpected credit losses.
Inventories. Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market. Cost is
determined using the first-in, first-out method. The Company inventories are
not generally subject to obsolescence due to spoilage or expiring product life
cycles. The Company operates generally as a make-to-order business; however, the
Company also stocks products for certain customers in order to meet delivery
schedules. While management believes that adequate write-downs for inventory
obsolescence have been made in the Consolidated Financial Statements, the
Company could experience additional inventory write-downs in the future.
Acquisitions and Acquired Intangibles. For new acquisitions, the Company uses
estimates, assumptions and appraisals to allocate the purchase price to the
assets acquired and to determine the amount of goodwill. These estimates are
based on market analyses and comparisons to similar assets. Annual tests are
required to be performed to assess whether recorded goodwill is impaired. The
annual tests require management to make estimates and assumptions with regard to
the future operations of its reporting units, the expected cash flows that they
will generate, and their market value. These estimates and assumptions therefore
impact the recorded value of assets acquired in a business combination,
including goodwill, and whether or not there is any subsequent impairment of the
recorded goodwill and the amount of such impairment.
Impairment of Long-Lived Assets. The Company long-lived assets include
property, plant and equipment. The recoverability of the long-term assets is
dependent on the performance of the companies which the Company has acquired, as
well as volatility inherent in the external markets for these acquisitions. In
assessing potential impairment for these assets the Company will consider these
factors as well as forecasted financial performance. For assets held for sale,
appraisals are relied upon to assess the fair market value of those assets.
Future adverse changes in market conditions or adverse operating results of the
underlying assets could result in the Company having to record additional
impairment charges not previously recognized.
Pension and Post-Retirement Obligations. The Company uses several assumptions in
determining its periodic pension and post-retirement expense and obligations
which are included in the Consolidated Financial Statements. These assumptions
include determining an appropriate discount rate, rate of compensation increase
as well as the remaining service period of active employees. The Company uses an
independent actuary to calculate the periodic pension and post-retirement
expense and obligations based upon these assumptions and actual employee census
data.                    17 Results of Operations

Year Ended December 31, 2002 Compared to the Year Ended December 31, 2001     Net Sales. The Company net sales increased $127 million or 71% from
$1802 million in 2001 to $1929 million in 2002. The inclusion of a full year
of Delta contributed $25 million of the increase. Increased demand and new
programs within the Plastics Segment contributed $63 million of the increase.
Additionally, currency impacts within the Euroball Segment contributed $45
million of the increase. Offsetting these increases were contractual price
decreases and modest volume improvements in the Euroball Segment resulting in a
net decrease of $06 million.
Gross Profit. Gross profit increased by $57 million or 132% from
$429 million in 2001 to $486 million in 2002. The inclusion of a full year of
Delta contributed $07 million of the increase. Cost reductions in the Domestic
Ball and Roller Segment principally related to the closing of the Company
Walterboro, South Carolina ball production facility contributed $06 million of
the increase. Increased product demand, new sales programs and cost reductions
in the Plastics Segment contributed $18 million of the increase. Additionally,
cost reduction programs and currency impacts contributed $15 million and $10
million, respectively, in the Euroball Segment. As a percentage of net sales,
gross profit increased from 238% in 2001 to 252% in 2002.                    18     Restructuring and Impairment Costs. Restructuring and impairment costs
decreased by $10 million from $23 million in 2001 to $13 million in 2002. The
Company incurred a charge for the recording of impairment on the Company
manufacturing facility and equipment in Walterboro, South Carolina of $12
million and $11 million in 2002 and 2001, respectively. A charge of $01
million and $08 million was recorded in 2002 and 2001, respectively, associated
with employee severance costs related to the closing of the Walterboro, South
Carolina facility. Additionally, charges related to Euroball of $0 million and
$04 million were recorded in 2002 and 2001, respectively. Restructuring and
impairment charges were 07% of sales in 2002 and 13% of sales in 2001.
Selling, General and Administrative Expenses. Selling, general and
administrative costs increased by $04 million, or 23%, from $168 million in
2001 to $171 million in 2002. The inclusion of a full year of Delta contributed
$01 million of the increase. Advisory services principally associated with the
previously announced desire of certain original founders of the Company to
liquidate their holdings in the Company stock contributed $03 million of the
increase. Other increases totaling $05 million are primarily attributable to
incentive based compensation throughout the Company and strategic planning
technology initiatives at Euroball. Offsetting these increases were decreased
spending of approximately $08 million related to bad debt expense primarily
related to the bankruptcy filing of a major Plastics Segment customer in 2001.
As a percentage of net sales, selling, general and administrative expenses
decreased from 93% in 2001 to 89% in 2002.
Depreciation and Amortizaton. Depreciation and amortization expenses
decreased by $20 million from $132 million in 2001 to $112 million in 2002.
The adoption of FASB Statement No. 142 eliminated the amortization of goodwill
and contributed $18 million of the decrease. The assets held for sale as a
result of the closing of the Walterboro, South Carolina ball production
facility, which are no longer depreciated, contributed $09 million of the
decrease. Offsetting these decreases, were a full year of depreciation of Delta
assets contributing $03 million and currency impacts at Euroball contributing
$03 million. As a percentage of sales, depreciation and amortization decreased
from 73% in 2001 to 58% in 2002.
Interest Expense. Interest expense decreased by $17 million from $42
million in 2001 to $25 million in 2002. The decrease is principally attributed
to the decrease in interest rates and decreased average debt levels in 2002. As
a percentage of net sales, interest expense decreased from 23% in 2001 to 13%
in 2002. See Management Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and
Results of Operations - Liquidity and Capital Resources.
Net Gain on Involuntary Conversion. The Company had a gain on
involuntary conversion of $00 million and $39 million in 2002 and 2001,
respectively, related to insurance proceeds as a result of the March 12, 2000
fire at the Erwin production facility.
Gain on Purchase of Minority Interest. The Company had a net
non-taxable gain on purchase of minority interest in 2002 of $59 million
related to purchase of INA/FAG 23% interest in Euroball. See Management
Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations -
Overview.
Minority Interest in Consolidated Subsidiary. Minority interest of
consolidated subsidiary increased $10 million from $18 million in 2001 to $28
million in 2002. This increase is due entirely to the Euroball joint venture
which has been consolidated since its formation, August 1, 2000. The Company is
required to consolidate Euroball in its Consolidated Financial Statements due to
its majority ownership. The Company owns 77% of the shares of the joint venture
with the remaining minority partner owning the remaining 23%. Minority interest
in consolidated subsidiary represents the combined interest in Euroball
earnings of the minority partners and the 49% interest in NN Arte earnings of
the minority partner the 49% interest in NN Arte earning is zero in 2002 and
2001. See Management Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and
Results of Operations - Overview.
Net Income. Net income increased $90 million from $47 in 2001 to
$137 million in 2002. As a percentage of net sales, net income increased from
26% in 2001 to 71% in 2002.
Year Ended December 31, 2001 Compared to the Year Ended December 31, 2000
Net Sales. The Company net sales increased $480 million or
363%, from $1321 million in 2000 to $1802 million in 2001. The inclusion of a
full year of Euroball sales contributed $461 million of the increase, excluding
the performance of the Ireland facility, which was consolidated into the results
of the Company prior to the formation of Euroball. Additionally, the inclusion
of 105 months of Delta net sales in 2001 contributed $140 million.
Offsetting this increase were decreased sales in the Domestic Ball and Roller
and Plastics Segments in the last half of the year due to slowing demand related
to the overall economic environment in the United States. Decreased sales during
the year for the Plastics Segment were due to the economic environment as well
as significantly decreased sales to one customer.
19     Gross Profit. Gross profit increased by $47 million, or 124% from
$382 million in 2000 to $429 million in 2001. Adjusting for the performance of
the Ireland facility, the Euroball joint venture contributed an additional $104
million of gross profit. The inclusion of 105 months of Delta results
contributed an additional $33 million in gross profit, while the sales volume
deterioration in the Domestic Ball and Roller and Plastics Segments decreased
gross profit $90 million. Gross profit decreased from 289% of net sales in
2000 to 238% of net sales in 2001.
Restructuring and Impairment Costs. Restructuring and impairment costs
increased by $23 million from $00 million in 2000 to $23 million in 2001. The
increase includes a $11 million charge for the recording of impairment on the
Company manufacturing facility located in Walterboro, South Carolina, a $08
million charge related to employee severance costs related to the closing of the
Walterboro, South Carolina facility and a $04 million charge related to
Euroball. Restructuring and impairment costs were 13% of net sales during 2001.
Selling, General and Administrative Expenses. Selling, general and
administrative expenses increased by $52 million, or 448% from $116 million
in 2000 to $168 million in 2001. The inclusion of a full year of Euroball
results, adjusting for the Ireland facility, accounted for $35 million of the
increase. The inclusion of 105 months of Delta results accounted for $12
million of the increase. Additionally, bad debt expense related primarily to the
bankruptcy filing of a major Plastics Segment customer contributed $08 million.
Offsetting these increases were decreased spending related to cost reduction and
cost containment efforts throughout the Company. As a percentage of net sales,
selling, general and administrative expenses increased from 88% in 2000 to 93%
in 2001.
Depreciation and Amortization. Depreciation and amortization expenses
increased $40 million, or 435% from $92 million in 2000 to $132 million in
2001. The inclusion of a full year of Euroball results, adjusting for the
Ireland facility, accounted for $28 million of the increase. The inclusion of
105 months of Delta results accounted for $11 million of the increase. As a
percentage of net sales, depreciation and amortization increased from 69% in
2000 to 73% in 2001.
Interest Expense. Interest expense increased by $24 million from $18
million in 2000 to $42 million in 2001. Interest expense related to the
purchase of Delta accounted for $10 million of the increase. Additionally, the
inclusion of a full year of interest expense related to the debt incurred by
Euroball accounted for approximately $12 million of the increase. As a
percentage of net sales, interest expense increased from 13% in 2000 to 23% in
2001. See Management Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition -
Liquidity and Capital Resources.
Equity in Earnings of Unconsolidated Affiliates. Equity in earnings of
unconsolidated affiliates decreased $005 million from $005 million in 2000 to
$0. The decrease is due to the Company share of earnings from the NN General
joint venture with General Bearing Corporation. Effective December 21, 2001, the
Company sold its minority interest in Jiangsu General Ball Roller Company,
LTD, a Chinese ball and roller manufacturer located in Rugao City, Jiangsu
Province, China. To effect the transaction, the Company sold its 50% ownership
in NN General, LLC, which owns a 60% interest in the Jiangsu joint venture to
its partner, General Bearing Corporation for cash of $06 million and notes of
$33 million. In 2001, the Company recorded a non-cash after-tax loss on the
sale of its investment in this joint venture of $144,000. See Note 4 of the
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional financial information.
Net Gain on Involuntary Conversion. The Company had a net gain on
involuntary conversion of $39 million in 2001 related to insurance proceeds as
a result of the March 12, 2000 fire at the Erwin facility.
Minority Interest in Consolidated Subsidiary. Minority interest of
consolidated subsidiary increased $11 million from $07 million in 2000 to $18
million in 2001. This increase is due entirely to the Euroball joint venture
which has been consolidated since its formation, August 1, 2000. The Company is
required to consolidate Euroball in its Consolidated Financial Statements due to
its majority ownership. The Company owns 54% of the shares of the joint venture
with the minority partners owning the remaining 46%. Minority interest in
consolidated subsidiary represents the combined 46% interest in Euroball
earnings of the minority partners and the 49% interest in NN Arte earnings of
the minority partners the 49% interest in NN Arte earning is zero in 2001 and
2000.
Net Income. Net income decreased $52 million, or 523%, from $100
million in 2000 to $47 million in 2001. As a percentage of net sales, net
income decreased from 76% in 2000 to 26% in 2001.                    20 Liquidity and Capital Resources
In July 2000, NN Euroball ApS, and its subsidiaries entered into a loan
agreement with HypoVereinsbank Luxembourg S.A. as agent for Bayerische Hypo-und
Vereinsbank AG of Munich, Germany for a senior secured revolving credit facility
of Euro 50 million, expiring on July 15, 2006 and a senior secured term loan
facility of Euro 360 million, expiring on July 15, 2006. On July 31, 2000, upon
closing of the joint venture, NN Euroball ApS borrowed a total of Euro 315
million against these facilities for acquisition financing. Additional working
capital and capital expenditure financing are provided for under the facility.
Amounts outstanding under the facilities accrue interest at a floating rate
equal to EURIBOR 287% at December 31, 2002 plus an applicable margin of
between 08% to 225% based upon calculated financial ratios. The loan agreement
contains various restrictive financial and non financial covenants. Restrictive
covenants which specify, among other things, restrictions on the incurrence of
indebtedness and the maintenance of certain financial ratios. These facilities
also include certain negative pledges. Amounts outstanding under the Facility
Agreement are secured by the stock, inventory and accounts receivable of
Euroball ApS. Euroball was in compliance with all such covenants at December 31,
2002. At December 31, 2002, Euro 98 million was available to Euroball under
these facilities.
On July 20, 2001, the Company entered into a syndicated loan agreement
with AmSouth Bank AmSouth as the administrative agent for the lenders, for a
senior non-secured revolving credit facility of up to $25 million, expiring on
July 25, 2003 and a senior non-secured term loan for $35 million expiring on
July 1, 2006. On July 12, 2002, the Company amended this credit facility to
convert the term loan portion in to a reducing revolving credit line providing
initial availability equivalent to the balance of the term loan prior to the
amendment. Amounts available for borrowing under this facility will be reduced
by $70 million per annum and the facility will expire on July 1, 2006.
Additionally, on July 31, 2002, the Company amended the credit facility again to
extend the $25 million senior non-secured revolving credit facility to July 25,
2004. Amounts outstanding under the revolving facility and term loan facility
bear interest at a floating rate equal to LIBOR 138% at December 31, 2002
plus an applicable margin of 075% to 200% based upon calculated financial
ratios. The loan agreement contains customary financial and non-financial
covenants. Such covenants specify that the Company must maintain a minimum fixed
charge coverage ratio, a minimum funded indebtedness to EBITDA ratio and a
maximum funded indebtedness to capitalization ratio and limits the amount of
capital expenditures we may make in any fiscal year. The loan agreement also
contains customary restrictions on, among other things, additional indebtedness,
liens on our assets, sales or transfers of assets, investments, restricted
payments including payment of dividends and stock repurchases, issuance of
equity securities, and mergers, acquisitions and other fundamental changes in
our business. The Company ownership in NN Euroball ApS has been pledged as
collateral. The Company was in compliance with all such covenants as of December
31, 2002.
We are in the process of renegotiating our existing credit facilities.
We expect to have the new facilities in place early during the second quarter
of 2003. Prior to entering into the new loan agreements, we expect to obtain
short-term working capital financing from our existing lender of approximately
$35 million.
To date, cash generated by Euroball and its subsidiaries has been used
exclusively for general Euroball-specific purposes including investments in
property, plant and equipment and prepayment of the Euroball senior secured term
loan, which is secured by Euroball and its subsidiaries. Accordingly, no
dividends have been declared or paid that may have been used by the Company to
pay down our domestic credit facilities. While the Company controls the
declaration of such dividends, we would only receive cash distributed in
accordance with our ownership percentage in Euroball.
The Company arrangements with its domestic customers typically
provide that payments are due within 30 days following the date of the Company
shipment of goods, while arrangements with foreign customers other than foreign
customers that have entered into an inventory management program with the
Company generally provide that payments are due within 90 or 120 days following
the date of shipment. Under the Domestic Ball and Roller Segments inventory
management program with certain European customers, payments typically are due
within 30 days after the customer uses the product. The Company sales and
receivables can be influenced by seasonality due to the Company relative
percentage of European business coupled with many foreign customers ceasing
production during the month of August. For information concerning the Company
quarterly results of operations for the years ended December 31, 2002 and 2001,
see Note 15 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.
The Company bills and receives payment from some of its foreign
customers in Euro as well as other currencies. To date, the Company has not been
materially adversely affected by currency fluctuations or foreign exchange
restrictions. Nonetheless, as a result of these sales, the Company foreign
exchange transaction and translation risk has increased. Various strategies to
manage this risk are available to management including producing and selling in
local currencies and hedging programs. As of December 31, 2002, no currency
hedges were in place. In addition, a strengthening of the U.S.                    21 dollar and/or Euro against foreign currencies could impair the ability of the
Company to compete with international competitors for foreign as well as
domestic sales.
Working capital, which consists principally of accounts receivable and
inventories, was $212 million at December 31, 2002 as compared to $231 million
at December 31, 2001. The ratio of current assets to current liabilities
decreased from 171:1 at December 31, 2001 to 153:1 at December 31, 2002. Cash
flow from operations increased to $311 million during 2002 from $246 million
during 2001.
During 2003, the Company plans to spend approximately $94 million on
capital expenditures related primarily to equipment and process upgrades and
replacements. The Company intends to finance these activities with cash
generated from operations and funds available under our credit facilities, which
are in the process of renegotiation. The Company believes that funds generated
from operations and borrowings from the renegotiated credit facilities will be
sufficient to finance the Company working capital needs and projected capital
expenditure requirements through December 2003.
Beginning in January 2003 SKF may exercise its right under the
Shareholders Agreement to cause the Company to purchase its interest in Euroball
based on the Put Formula in the Shareholders Agreement. The Company anticipates
that if such purchase becomes necessary, it may need to borrow additional funds.
Because the purchase price is based on a formula using Euroball historical
earnings and cash flow, the exact amount of the put cannot be determined until
the put right is exercised. SKF has informed us that it intends to exercise its right
and we expect to purchase its interest during the second quarter of 2003.
The table below sets forth certain of the Company contractual
obligations and commercial commitments as of December 31, 2002  
Certain                    Payments Due by Period
Contractual Obligations  
Total    Less than 1   1-3 years    4-5 years   After 5 years

Obligations          Other Long-Term Obligations consist principally of steel purchase
commitments at the Euroball Segment See Note 14 of the Notes to Consolidated
Financial Statements.
The Euro
The Company currently has operations in Ireland, Germany and Italy, all
of which are Euro participating countries, and, each facility sells product to
customers in many of the participating countries. The Euro has been adopted as
the functional currency at all of Euroball locations.
Seasonality and Fluctuation in Quarterly Results
The Company net sales historically have been seasonal in nature, due
to a significant portion of the Company sales being to European customers that
cease or significantly slow production during the month of August. For
information concerning the Company quarterly results of operations for the
years ended December 31, 2002 and 2001, see Note 14 of the Notes to Consolidated
Financial Statements.
Inflation and Changes in Prices
While the Company operations have not been materially affected by
inflation during recent years, prices for 52100 Steel, engineered resins and
other raw materials purchased by the Company are subject to material change. For
example, during 1995, due to an increase in worldwide demand for 52100 Steel and
the decrease in the value of the United States dollar relative to foreign
currencies, the Company experienced an increase in the price of 52100 Steel and
some difficulty in obtaining an adequate supply of 52100 Steel from its existing
suppliers. In the Company U.S. operations our typical pricing arrangements
with steel suppliers are subject to adjustment once every six months. The
Company Euroball
22 Segment has entered into long term agreements with its primary steel supplier
which provide for standard terms and conditions and annual pricing adjustments
to offset material price fluctuations in steel. The Company typically reserves
the right to increase product prices periodically in the event of increases in
its raw material costs. In the past, the Company has been able to minimize the
impact on its operations resulting from the 52100 Steel price fluctuations by
taking such
measures. Certain sales agreements are in effect with SKF and INA/FAG, which
provide for minimum purchase quantities and specified, annual sales price
adjustments that may be modified up or down for changes in material costs. These
agreements expire during 2006.
Recently Issued Accounting Standards
In June 1998, the Financial Accounting Standards Board FASB issued
Statement of Financial Accounting Standards SFAS No. 133, Accounting for
Derivative Instruments and Certain Hedging Activities. In June 2000, the FASB
issued SFAS No. 138, Accounting for Certain Derivative Instruments and Certain
Hedging Activity, an Amendment of SFAS 133. SFAS No. 133 and SFAS No. 138
require that derivative instruments be recorded on the balance sheet at their
respective fair values. SFAS No. 133 and SFAS No. 138 are effective for all
fiscal quarters of all fiscal years beginning after June 30, 2000, which for the
Company was effective January 1, 2001.
In June 2001, the FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting
Standards No. 141, Business Combinations Statement No. 141, and Statement of
Financial Accounting Standards No. 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets
Statement No. 142. Statement No. 141 requires that the purchase method of
accounting be used for all business combinations initiated after June 30, 2001.
Statement No. 141 also specifies criteria that intangible assets acquired in a
purchase method business combination must meet to be recognized and reported
apart from goodwill. Statement No. 142 requires that goodwill and intangible
assets with indefinite useful lives no longer be amortized, but rather,
periodically tested for impairment. The effective date of Statement No. 142 is
January 1, 2002. As of the date of adoption, the Company had unamortized
goodwill of approximately $403 million, which is subject to the provisions of
Statement No. 142.
As a result of adopting these standards in the first quarter of 2002,
the Company no longer amortizes goodwill. The Company estimates that
amortization expense for goodwill would have been approximately $18 million or
$10 million net of tax and minority interest for the twelve-month period ended
December 31, 2002.
In July 2001, the FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting
Standards No. 143, Accounting For Asset Retirement Obligations. This Statement
requires capitalizing any retirement costs as part of the total cost of the
related long-lived asset and subsequently allocating the total expense to future
periods using a systematic and rational method. Adoption of the Statement is
required for fiscal years beginning after June 15, 2002. Management believes
that, as of December 31, 2002, it is not materially affected by SFAS No. 143.
In October 2001, The FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting
Standards No. 144, Accounting For The Impairment or Disposal of Long-lived
Assets. This Statement supercedes Statement No. 121 but retains many of its
fundamental provisions. Additionally, this Statement expands the scope of
discontinued operations to include more disposal transactions. The provisions of
this Statement are effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years
beginning after December 15, 2001. The adoption of SFAS 144 did not have a
material impact on the Company financial condition.
In April 2002, the FASB issued SFAS No. 145, Rescission of FASB
Statements No. 4, 44, and 64, Amendment of FASB Statement No. 13, and Technical
Corrections. SFAS No. 4 had required all gains and losses from extinguishment
of debt to be aggregated and, if material, classified as an extraordinary item,
net of related income tax effect. SFAS No. 145 rescinds SFAS No. 4 and the
related required classifications gains and losses from extinguishment of debt as
extraordinary items. Additionally, the SFAS No. 145 amends SFAS No. 13 to
require that certain lease modifications that have economic effects similar to
sale-leaseback transactions be accounted for in the same manner as
sale-leaseback transactions. SFAS No. 145 is applicable for the Company at the
beginning of fiscal year 2003, with the provisions related to SFAS No. 13 are
effective for transactions occurring after May 15, 2002. Management believes
that, as of December 31, 2002, it is not materially affected by SFAS No. 145.
In July 2002, the FASB issued SFAS No. 146, Accounting for Costs
Associated with Exit or Disposal Activities. SFAS No. 146 requires costs
associated with exit or disposal activities to be recognized when they are
incurred rather than at the date of a commitment to an exit or disposal plan.
SFAS No. 146 is to be applied prospectively to exit or disposal activities
initiated after December 31, 2002.
In December 2002, the FASB issued SFAS No. 148, Accounting for
Stock-Based Compensation - Transition and Disclosure - an amendment of FASB
Statement No. 123. SFAS No. 148 provides alternative methods of transition for
a
23 voluntary change to the fair value based method of accounting for stock-based
employee compensation. In addition, SFAS No. 148 amends the disclosures in both
annual and interim financial statements about the method of accounting for
stock-based employee compensation and the effect of the method used on reported
results. The Company has adopted the
provisions of SFAS 123, which encourages but does not require a fair value based
method of accounting for stock compensation plans. The Company has elected to
continue accounting for its stock compensation plan using the intrinsic value
based method under APB Opinion No. 25. See Note 10 of the Notes to Consolidated
Financial Statements.
In November 2002, the FASB issued FASB Interpretation FIN No. 45,
Guarantor Accounting and Disclosure Requirements for Guarantees, Including
Indirect Guarantees of Indebtedness of Others, an interpretation of FASB
Statements No. 5, 57, and 107 and rescission of FASB Interpretation No. 34. This
interpretation elaborates the disclosures to be made by a guarantor in its
interim and annual financial statements about its obligations under certain
guarantees that it has issued. It also clarifies that a guarantor is required to
recognize, at the inception of a guarantee, a liability for the fair value of
the obligation undertaken in issuing the guarantee. The initial recognition and
initial measurement provisions of this interpretation are applicable on a
prospective basis to guarantees issued or modified after December 31, 2002 and
are not expected to have a material effect on the Company consolidated results
of operations, financial position or cash flows. Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk
The Company is exposed to changes in financial market conditions in the
normal course of its business due to its use of certain financial instruments as
well as transacting in various foreign currencies. To mitigate its exposure to
these market risks, the Company has established policies, procedures and
internal processes governing its management of financial market risks. The
Company is exposed to changes in interest rates primarily as a result of its
borrowing activities. Domestically, these borrowings which include a $25 million
senior, non-secured floating rate revolving credit facility which is used to
maintain liquidity and fund its business operations domestically as well as a
reducing revolving credit line facility. In Europe, Euroball has a 50 million
euro floating rate credit facility, and a 60 million euro floating rate secured
term loan. At December 31, 2002, the Company had $481 million outstanding under
the domestic revolving credit facility and Euroball had 50 million euro
outstanding under the Euroball credit facility. A one-percent increase in the
interest rate charged on the Company outstanding borrowings under both credit
facilities would result in interest expense increasing by approximately $531,000
during 2002 and $547,000 during 2001. In connection with a variable EURIBOR rate
debt financing in July 2000 the Company majority owned subsidiary, NN Euroball
ApS entered into an interest rate swap with a notional amount of Euro 125
million for the purpose of fixing the interest rate on a portion of their debt
financing. The interest rate swap provides for the Company to receive variable
Euribor interest payments and pay 551% fixed interest. The interest rate swap
agreement expires in July 2006 and the notional amount amortizes in relation to
principal payments on the underlying debt over the life of the swap. The nature
and amount of the Company borrowings may vary as a result of future business
requirements, market conditions and other factors.
Translation of the Company operating cash flows denominated in
foreign currencies is impacted by changes in foreign exchange rates. The Company,
mainly at its Euroball Segment, bills and receives payment from some of its
foreign customers in their own currency. To date, the Company has not been
materially adversely affected by currency fluctuations of foreign exchange
restrictions. However, to help reduce exposure to foreign currency fluctuation,
management has incurred debt in Euros and periodically used foreign currency
hedges. These currency hedging programs allow management to hedge currency
exposures when these exposures meet certain discretionary levels. The Company
did not hold a position in any foreign currency hedging instruments as of
December 31, 2002.                    24 Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data

Notes to Consolidated Financial                     25              Independent Auditors' Report
The Board of Directors
NN, Inc. We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of NN, Inc. as of
December 31, 2002 and 2001 and the related consolidated statements of income and
comprehensive income, consolidated statements of changes in stockholders'
equity, and consolidated statements of cash flows for each of the years in the
three year period ended December 31, 2002. These consolidated financial
statements are the responsibility of the Company management. Our
responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated financial
statements based on our audits.
We conducted our audits in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted
in the United States of America. Those standards require that we plan and
perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial
statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a
test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial
statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and
significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall
financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a
reasonable basis for our opinion.
In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present
fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of NN, Inc. as of
December 31, 2002 and 2001 and the results of their operations and their cash
flows for each of the years in the three year period ended December 31, 2002 in
conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of
America.
As discussed in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company
changed its method of accounting for goodwill and other intangible assets in
2002 and changed its method of accounting for derivative instruments and hedging
activities in 2001.                  /s/ KPMG LLP

1  Summary of Significant Accounting Policies and Practices
a  Description of Business
NN, Inc. the Company is a manufacturer of precision balls,
rollers, plastic injection molded products, and precision bearing
seals. The Company balls, rollers, and bearing seals are used
primarily in the domestic and international anti-friction bearing
industry. The Company plastic injection molded products are used
in the bearing, automotive, instrumentation and fiber optic
industries. The Domestic Ball and Roller Segment is comprised of
two manufacturing facilities located in the eastern United States.
The Company Euroball Segment, which was acquired in July 2000,
see Note 2 is comprised of manufacturing facilities located in
Kilkenny, Ireland, Eltmann, Germany, and Pinerolo, Italy. All of
the facilities in the Euroball Segment are engaged in the
production of precision balls. The Plastics Segment consists of
IMC, acquired in July 1999, NN Arte, formed in August 2000 and
Delta Rubber, acquired in February 2001. IMC has two production
facilities in Texas, NN Arte has one production facility in
Guadalajara, Mexico and Delta Rubber has two production facilities
in Connecticut see Note 2. All of the Company segments sell to
foreign and domestic customers.
b  Cash and Cash Equivalents
The Company considers all highly liquid investments with an
original maturity of three months or less as cash equivalents.
c  Inventories
Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market. Cost is
determined using the first-in, first-out method.
d  Property, Plant and Equipment
Property, plant and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated
depreciation. Assets held for sale are stated at lower of cost or
fair market value less selling cost. Expenditures for maintenance
and repairs are charged to expense as incurred. Major renewals and
betterments are capitalized. When a major property item is
retired, its cost and related accumulated depreciation or
amortization are removed from the property accounts and any gain
or loss is recorded in income or expense, respectively. The
Company reviews the carrying values of long-lived assets for
impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate
the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. During the
years ended December 31, 2002 and 2001, the Company incurred an
impairment charge of $1,199 and $1,083 respectively, to write-down
the land, building and equipment at the Walterboro, SC production
facility to its net realizable value, which was principally based
upon fair market value appraisals and valuations. As of December
31, 2002 and 2001, the carrying value of this land, building and
equipment of $2,214 and $4,348, respectively, has been classified
as a component of assets held for sale in the accompanying
financial statements. During the year ended December 31, 2000, the
Company did not incur any impairment charges.
Depreciation is provided principally on the straight-line method
over the estimated useful lives of the depreciable assets for
financial reporting purposes. Accelerated depreciation methods are
used for income tax purposes.
e  Revenue Recognition
The Company generally recognizes a sale when goods are shipped and
ownership is assumed by the customer. The Company has an inventory
management program for certain major ball and roller customers
whereby sales are recognized when products are used by the
customer from consigned stock, rather than at the time of
shipment. Under both circumstances, revenue is recognized when
persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, delivery has
occurred, the sellers' price is determinable and collectibility is
reasonably assured.
f  Income Taxes
Income taxes are accounted for under the asset and liability
method. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the
future tax consequences attributable to differences between the
financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and
liabilities and their respective tax bases and operating loss and
tax credit carryforwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are
measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to

are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred
tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized
in income in the period that includes the enactment date.
g  Net Income Per Common Share
Basic earnings per share reflect reported earnings divided by the
weighted average number of common shares outstanding. Diluted
earnings per share include the effect of dilutive stock options
outstanding during the year.
h  Stock Incentive Plan
The Company applies the intrinsic value-based method of accounting
prescribed by Accounting Principles Board APB Opinion No. 25,
Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees, and related
interpretations including Financial Accounting Standards Board
FASB Interpretation No. 44, Accounting for Certain Transactions
involving Stock Compensation an interpretation of APB Opinion No.
25 issued in March 2000, to account for its fixed plan stock
options. Under this method, compensation expense is recorded on
the date of grant only if the current market price of the
underlying stock exceeds the exercise price. The Company also
applies the provision of APB Opinion No. 25 to its variable stock
options. Statement of Financial Accounting Standards SFAS No.
123, Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation, established
accounting and disclosure requirements using a fair value-based
method of accounting for stock-based employee compensation plans.
As allowed by SFAS No. 123, the Company has elected to continue to
apply the intrinsic value-based method of accounting described
above, and has adopted the disclosure requirements of SFAS No. 123
and SFAS No. 148.
i  Principles of Consolidation
The Company consolidated financial statements include the
accounts of NN, Inc. and subsidiaries in which the Company owns
more than 50% voting interest. Unconsolidated subsidiaries and
investments where ownership is between 20% and 50% are accounted
for under the equity method. All significant intercompany profits,
transactions, and balances have been eliminated in consolidation.
The ownership interests of other shareholders in companies that
are more than 50% owned, but less than 100% owned by the Company,
are reflected as minority interests. Minority interest represents
the minority shareholders interest of NN Euroball ApS and NN Arte.
j  Foreign Currency Translation
Assets and liabilities of the Company foreign subsidiary are
translated at current exchange rates, while revenue and expenses
are translated at average rates prevailing during the year.
Translation adjustments are reported as a component of other
comprehensive income.
k  Goodwill
In June 2001, the FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting
Standards No. 141, Business Combinations Statement No. 141,
and Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 142,
Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets Statement No. 142.
Statement No. 141 requires that the purchase method of accounting
be used for all business combinations initiated after June 30,
2001. Statement No. 141 also specifies criteria that intangible
assets acquired in a purchase method business combination must
meet to be recognized and reported apart from goodwill. Statement
No. 142 requires that goodwill and intangible assets with
indefinite useful lives no longer be amortized, but rather,
periodically tested for impairment. The effective date of
Statement No. 142 is January 1, 2002. As of the date of adoption,
the Company had unamortized goodwill of approximately $403
million, which is subject to the provisions of Statement No. 142.
As a result of adopting these new standards, the Company
accounting policies for goodwill and other intangibles changed on
January 1, 2002, as described below        Goodwill: The Company recognized the excess of the purchase price
of an acquired entity over the fair value of the net identifiable
assets as goodwill. Goodwill is tested for impairment on an annual
basis and between annual tests in certain circumstances.
Impairment losses are recognized whenever the implied fair value

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements
December 31, 2002, 2001 and 2000
In thousands, except per share data        goodwill is less than its carrying value. Prior to January 1,
2002, goodwill was amortized over a twenty-year period using the
straight-line method. Beginning January 1, 2002, goodwill is no
longer amortized.
Other Acquired Intangibles: The Company recognizes an acquired
intangible asset apart from goodwill whenever the asset arises
from contractual or other legal rights, or whenever it is capable
of being divided or separated from the acquired entity or sold,
transferred, licensed, rented, or exchanged, whether individually
or in combination with a related contract, asset or liability. An
intangible asset other than goodwill is amortized over its
estimated useful life unless that life is determined to be
indefinite. The Company will review the lives of intangible assets
each reporting period and, if necessary, recognize impairment
losses if the carrying amount of an intangible asset subject to
amortization is not recoverable from expected future cash flows
and its carrying amount exceeds its fair value.
The Company completed the transitional goodwill impairment reviews
required by the new standards during the first six months of 2002
and the annually required goodwill impairment review during the
fourth quarter of 2002. In performing the impairment reviews, the
Company estimated the fair values of the reporting units using a
method that incorporates valuations derived from EBITDA multiples
based upon market multiples and recent capital market transactions
and also incorporates valuations determined by each segment
discounted future cash flows. As of January 1, 2002, the
transition day and as of October 1, 2002, the annual review date,
there was no impairment to goodwill as the fair values exceeded
the carrying values of the reporting units. As of December 31,
2002, the carrying amounts of goodwill by reporting units are as
follows: $261 million for the Plastics Segment and $161 million
for the Euroball Segment. Since the transition date, January 1,
2002, the increase in goodwill of $19 million is principally due
to foreign currency translation adjustments at the Euroball
Segment.
The table below describes the impact of the amortization of
goodwill for the three month and twelve month period ended
December 31, 2002, 2001 and 2000                            For the Three Months             For the Twelve Months

l  Impairment of Long-Lived Assets and Long-Lived Assets to Be Disposed Of
The Company accounts for long-lived assets in accordance with the
provisions of SFAS No. 144, Accounting for the Impairment of or
Disposal of Long-Lived Assets. This Statement supercedes
Statement No. 121 but retains many of its fundamental provisions.
Additionally, this Statement expands the scope of discontinued
operations to include more disposal transactions. The provisions
of this Statement are effective for financial statements issued
for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2001. The Company
has adopted Statement No. 144 effective January 1, 2002. Assets to
be held and used are tested for recoverability when indications of                                    Continued                    33                   NN, Inc.

In thousands, except per share data        impairment are evident. If the reviewed carrying value of the
asset is not recoverable the asset is written down to the lesser
of recoverable value or carrying value. Assets held for sale are
carried at the lesser of carrying value or fair value less costs
of disposal.
m  Use of Estimates in the Preparation of Financial Statements
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with
generally accepted accounting principles requires management to
make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of
assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and
liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the
reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting
period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.
n  Reclassifications
Certain 2001 and 2000 amounts have been reclassified to conform
with the 2002 presentation.
o  Derivative Financial Instruments
In June 1998, the Financial Accounting Standards Board FASB
issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards SFAS No. 133,
Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Certain Hedging
Activities. In June 2000, the FASB issued SFAS No. 138,
Accounting for Certain Derivative Instruments and Certain Hedging
Activity, an Amendment of SFAS 133. SFAS No. 133 and SFAS No. 138
require that all derivative instruments be recorded on the balance
sheet at their respective fair values. SFAS No. 133 and SFAS No.
138 are effective for all fiscal quarters of all fiscal years
beginning after June 30, 2000, which for the Company was effective
January 1, 2001.
The Company has an interest rate swap accounted for in accordance
with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards SFAS No. 133,
Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities.
The Company adopted SFAS No. 133 on January 1, 2001, which
establishes accounting and reporting standards for derivative
instruments and for hedging activities. The Standard requires the
recognition of all derivative instruments on the balance sheet at
fair value. The Standard allows for hedge accounting if certain
requirements are met including documentation of the hedging
relationship at inception and upon adoption of the Standard.
In connection with a variable EURIBOR rate debt financing in July
2000 the Company majority owned subsidiary, NN Euroball ApS
entered into an interest rate swap with a notional amount of Euro
125 million for the purpose of fixing the interest rate on a
portion of their debt financing. The interest rate swap provides
for the Company to receive variable Euribor interest payments and
pay 551% fixed interest. The interest rate swap agreement expires
in July 2006 and the notional amount amortizes in relation to
principal payments on the underlying debt over the life of the
swap.
The cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle for the
adoption of SFAS No. 133 effective January 1, 2001 resulted in a
transition adjustment net loss of $98 which is net of an income
tax benefit of $112 and the related minority interest impact of
$84. The interest rate swap does not qualify for hedge accounting
under the provisions of SFAS No. 133; therefore, the transition
adjustment for adoption of SFAS No. 133 and any subsequent
periodic changes in fair value of the interest rate swap are
recorded in earnings.
As of December 31, 2002 and 2001, the fair value of the swap is a
before tax loss of approximately $485 and $374, respectively,
which is recorded in other non-current liabilities. The change in
fair value during the years ended December 31, 2002 and 2001 was a
loss of approximately $51 and $80 excluding the impact of foreign
currency, respectively, which has been included as a component of
other income.
p  Recently Issued Accounting Standards
In July 2001, the FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting
Standards No. 143, Accounting For Asset Retirement Obligations.
This Statement requires capitalizing any retirement costs as part
of the total cost of the related long-lived asset and subsequently
allocating the total expense to future periods using a systematic
and rational method. Adoption of the Statement is required for
fiscal years beginning after June 15, 2002. Management believes
that, as of December 31, 2002, it is not materially affected by
SFAS No. 143.                                    Continued                    34                   NN, Inc.
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements
December 31, 2002, 2001 and 2000
In thousands, except per share data        In April 2002, the FASB issued SFAS No. 145, Rescission of FASB
Statements No. 4, 44, and 64, Amendment of FASB Statement No. 13,
and Technical Corrections. SFAS No. 4 had required all gains and
losses from extinguishment of debt to be aggregated and, if
material, classified as an extraordinary item, net of related
income tax effect. SFAS No. 145 rescinds SFAS No. 4 and the
related required classifications gains and losses form
extinguishment of debt as extraordinary items. Additionally, the
SFAS No. 145 amends SFAS No. 13 to require that certain lease
modifications that have economic effects similar to sale-leaseback
transactions be accounted for in the same manner as sale-leaseback
transactions. SFAS No. 145 is applicable for the Company at the
beginning of fiscal year 2003, with the provisions related to SFAS
No. 13 for transactions occurring after May 15, 2002. Management
believes that, as of December 31, 2002, it is not materially
affected by SFAS No. 145.
In July 2002, the FASB issued SFAS No. 146, Accounting for Costs
Associated with Exit or Disposal Activities. SFAS No. 146
requires costs associated with exit or disposal activities to be
recognized when they are incurred rather than at the date of a
commitment to an exit or disposal plan. SFAS No. 146 is to be
applied prospectively to exit or disposal activities initiated
after December 31, 2002.
In December 2002, the FASB issued SFAS No. 148, Accounting for
Stock-Based Compensation - Transition and Disclosure - an
amendment of FASB Statement No. 123. SFAS No. 148 provides
alternative methods of transition for a voluntary change to the
fair value based method of accounting for stock-based employee
compensation. In addition, SFAS No. 148 amends the disclosures in
both annual and interim financial statements about the method of
accounting for stock-based employee compensation and the effect of
the method used on reported results. The Company has adopted the
provisions of SFAS 123, which encourages but does not require a
fair value based method of accounting for stock compensation
plans. The Company has elected to continue accounting for its
stock compensation plan using the intrinsic value based method
under APB Opinion No. 25. See Note 10 of the Notes to Consolidated
Financial Statements.
The Company has elected to continue accounting for its stock
compensation plan using the intrinsic value based method under APB
Opinion No. 25 and, accordingly, has not recorded compensation
expense for each of the three years ended December 31, 2002,
except as discussed above. Had compensation cost for the Company
stock compensation plan been determined based on the fair value at
the option grant dates, the Company net income and earnings per
share would have been reduced to the proforma amounts indicated

Guarantor Accounting and Disclosure Requirements for Guarantees,
Including Indirect Guarantees of Indebtedness of Others, an
interpretation of FASB Statements No. 5, 57, and 107 and rescission of
FASB Interpretation No. 34. This interpretation elaborates the
disclosures to be made by a guarantor in its interim and annual financial
statements about its obligations under certain guarantees that it has
issued. It also clarifies that a guarantor is required to recognize, at
the inception of a guarantee, a liability for the fair value of the
obligation undertaken in issuing the guarantee. The initial recognition
and initial measurement provisions of this interpretation are applicable
on a prospective basis to guarantees issued or modified after December
31, 2002 and are not expected to have a material effect on the Company
consolidated results of operations, financial position or cash flows. 2   Acquisitions and Purchase of Minority Interest
On December 20, 2002 the Company completed the purchase of the 23%
interest in NN Euroball, ApS Euroball held by INA/FAG. Euroball was
formed in 2000 by the Company, FAG Kugelfischer George Schaefer AG, which
was subsequently acquired by INA - Schaeffler KG collectively,
INA/FAG, and AB SKF SKF. INA/FAG is a global bearing manufacturer
and one of our largest customers. The Company paid approximately 13,400
Euro 13,800 million for INA/FAG interest in Euroball. The
excess of minority interest in consolidated subsidiaries related to
INA/FAG 23% interest over the purchase price has been recorded as a
non-taxable gain in the amount of approximately $5,904. Following the
closing of the transaction, the Company owns 77% of the outstanding
shares of Euroball and SKF owns the remaining 23%. SKF consented to our
purchase of INA/FAG interest pursuant to the terms of the Euroball
Shareholder Agreement. SKF has informed us that it intends to exercise its
right and we expect to purchase its interest during the second quarter of 2003.
On February 16, 2001, the Company completed the acquisition of all of the
outstanding stock of The Delta Rubber Company, Delta a Connecticut
corporation for $22,500 in cash, of which $500 was to be held in escrow
for one year from the date of closing. Delta provides high quality
engineered bearing seals and other precision-molded rubber products to
original equipment manufacturers. The Company plans to continue the
operation of the Delta business, which operates a manufacturing facility
in Danielson, Connecticut. The excess of the purchase price over the fair
value of the net identifiable assets acquired of $14,107 has been
recorded as goodwill.
Effective July 31, 2000, the Company completed its Euroball transaction.
Completion of the transaction required the Company to start a majority
owned stand-alone company in Europe, NN Euroball ApS, for the manufacture
and sale of precision steel balls used for ball bearings and other
products. As a result of this transaction the Company owned                                    Continued

54% of the shares of NN Euroball, ApS, AB SKF SKF, a Swedish Company, and
FAG Kugelfischer Georg Schager AG FAG, a German Company, owned 23% each.
NN Euroball ApS subsequently acquired the steel ball manufacturing
facilities located in Pinerolo, Italy previously owned by SKF, Eltmann,
Germany previously owned by FAG and Kilkenny, Ireland previously owned
by the Company. NN Euroball ApS paid approximately $57,788 for the net
assets originally acquired from SKF and FAG. The acquisitions of the
Pinerolo, Italy and Eltmann, Germany ball manufacturing facilities have
been accounted for by the purchase method of accounting and, accordingly,
the results of operations of Euroball have been included in the Company
consolidated financial statements from July 31, 2000. The excess of the
purchase price over the fair value of the net identifiable assets acquired
of $15,507 has been recorded as goodwill.
Under the terms of a Shareholder Agreement between the Company and SKF,
at any time after December 31, 2002, SKF can require the Company to
purchase its shares of NN Euroball ApS. The purchase price of the shares
is to be calculated based on a formula price detailed in the Euroball
Shareholder Agreement.

3  Restructuring and Impairment Charges
In September 2001, the Company announced the closure of its Walterboro,
South Carolina ball manufacturing facility as a part of its ongoing
strategy to locate manufacturing capacity in closer proximity to its
customers. This facility is included in the Company Domestic Ball and
Roller Segment see Note 11. The closure was substantially completed by
December 31, 2001.
Prior to December 31, 2001, production capacity and certain machinery and
equipment was transferred from the Walterboro facility to the Company
two domestic ball facilities in Erwin, Tennessee and Mountain City,
Tennessee. The plant closing resulted in the termination of approximately
80 full time hourly and salaried employees located at the Walterboro
facility. The Company has recorded restructuring costs of $62 and $750
during the years ended December 31, 2002 and 2001, respectively, for the
related severance payments. Additionally, prior to December 31, 2001, the
Company decided to sell the Walterboro land, building and certain
machinery. The Company incurred an impairment charge of $564 and $1,083
during 2002 and 2001, respectively, to write-down the land and building
at the Walterboro facility to its net realizable value of $1,128 at
December 31, 2002 and $1,692 at December 31, 2001, which were based upon
fair market value appraisals. Additionally, the Company incurred an
impairment charge of $635 during 2002 to write down the equipment to its
net realizable value of $1,086. The amounts the Company will ultimately
realize upon disposition of these assets could differ materially from the
amounts assumed in arriving at the 2002 and 2001 impairment losses. The
land, building, and equipment assets with a recorded book value of $2,214
are held for sale. The Company is attempting to sell the land, building
and machinery during 2003. Approximately $522 and $290 of the severance
payments were paid in 2002 and 2001, respectively.
The Company has charged expenses for moving machinery, equipment and
inventory to other production facilities and other costs to close the
facility, which will benefit future operations, in the period they are
incurred.                                    Continued                    37                   NN, Inc.

well as a maximum funded indebtedness to capitalization ratio and limits
the amount of capital expenditures we may make in any fiscal year. The loan
agreement also contains customary restrictions on, among other things,
additional indebtedness, liens on the Company assets, sales or transfers
of assets, investments, restricted payments including payment of dividends
and stock repurchases, issuance of equity securities, and mergers,

date of FASB Interpretation No. 44, are treated under variable accounting.
Accordingly, compensation expense will be recognized, to the extent the
market price of the Company stock exceeds $1050. The Company recognized
a reduction of compensation expense of $108 during 2002 and an increase to
compensation expense of $108 during 2001 related to these options.
On August 4, 1998 the Company Board of Directors authorized the
repurchase of up to 740 shares of its Common Stock, equaling 5% of the
company issued and outstanding shares as of August 4, 1998. The program
may be extended or discontinued at any time, and there is no assurance
that the Company will purchase any or all of the full amount authorized.
The Company has not repurchased any shares under this program through
December 31, 2002.
11  Segment Information
The Company determined its reportable segments under the provisions of
SFAS No. 131, Disclosures about Segments of an Enterprise and Related
Information. The Company reportable segments are based on differences
in product lines and geographic locations and are divided among Domestic
Ball and Roller, Euroball and Plastics. The Domestic Ball and Roller
Segment is comprised of two manufacturing facilities in the eastern
United States. The Euroball Segment acquired in July 2000, is comprised
of manufacturing facilities located in Kilkenny, Ireland, Eltmann,
Germany and Pinerolo, Italy. All of the facilities in the Domestic Ball
and Roller and Euroball Segments are engaged in the production of
precision balls and rollers used primarily in the bearing industry. The
Plastics Segment is comprised of five facilities: two located in Lubbock,
Texas, which represents the IMC business acquired in July 1999; two
facilities located in Danielson, Connecticut, which represents the Delta
business acquired in February 2001, and one facility located in
Guadalajara, Mexico, which represents the NN-Arte business. These
facilities are engaged in the production of plastic injection molded
products for the bearing, automotive, instrumentation and fiber optic
markets and precision rubber bearing seals for the bearing, automotive,
industrial, agricultural and aerospace markets.
The accounting policies of the segments are the same as those described
in the summary of significant accounting policies. The Company evaluates
segment performance based on profit or loss from operations after income
taxes not including nonrecurring gains and losses. The Company accounts
for intersegment sales and transfers at current market prices; however,
the Company did not have any material intersegment transactions during
2002, 2001 or 2000.

Although realization of deferred tax assets is not assured, management
believes that it is more likely than not that all of the deferred tax
assets will be realized. However, the amount of the deferred tax assets
considered realizable could be reduced based on changing conditions.
The Company has not recognized a deferred tax liability for the
undistributed earnings of its non-U.S. subsidiaries and non-U.S.
corporate joint ventures. The Company expects to reinvest these
undistributed earnings indefinitely and does not expect such earnings to
become subject to U.S. taxation in the foreseeable future. A deferred tax
liability will be recognized when the Company expects that it will
recover these undistributed earnings in a taxable manner, such as through
the receipt of dividends or sale of the investments. It is not
practicable to determine the U.S. income tax liability, if any, that
would be payable if such earnings were not reinvested indefinitely.

The Kilkenny operation of the Euroball Segment has received certain
grants from the Ireland government. These grants are based upon the
Kilkenny facility hiring and retaining certain employment levels by the
measurement date. At December 31, 2002, actual employment levels are less
than those required by certain grant covenants. During 2002, the grant
agreement measurement date was amended to extend the measurement date.
The Company anticipates that, if necessary, the grant agreement
measurement date and /or employment level thresholds would again be
adjusted. As of December 31, 2002 and 2001, the grant is recorded as a
component of other non-current liabilities in the amount of $506 and
$497, respectively.
The Euroball Segment has entered into a supply contract with Ascometal
France Ascometal for the purchase of steel for ball production. The
contract terms specify that Ascometal provide Euroball 90%, 90%, 85% and
85% of its steel requirements for the years ending December 31, 2002,
2003, 2004 and 2005, respectively. The contract, among

other things, stipulates that Ascometal achieve certain performance
targets related to quality, reliability and service. The contract
provisions include annual price adjustments based upon published
indexes in addition to annual productivity improvement factor
multiples. In 2002 Euroball purchased approximately $19,600 under the
terms of this contract. Annual purchase commitments for the remaining
term of the contract are approximately $21,600, $19,900 and $20,700
for 2003, 2004 and 2005, respectively. The contract expires December
31, 2005, however, is automatically renewed for one year periods
thereafter unless notice is provided by either Euroball or Ascometal.
Beginning in January 2003, SKF may exercise its right under The
Shareholders Agreement to cause the Company to purchase its interest in
Euroball based on the Put Formula in the Shareholders Agreement. The
Company anticipates that if such purchase becomes necessary, it may need
to borrow additional funds. Because the purchase price is based on a Euro
based formula using Euroball historical cash flow and earnings, the
exact amount of the put cannot be determined until the put right is
exercised. However, if exercised at December 31, 2002, the purchase price
would have been approximately $14,000 versus minority interest in
consolidated subsidiaries of $19,700. 15 Quarterly Results of Operations Unaudited

16 Fair Value of Financial Instruments
Management believes the fair value of financial instruments approximate
their carrying value due to the short maturity of these instruments or in
the case of the Company notes receivable and debt, due to the variable
interest rates. 17 Involuntary Conversion

manufacturing plant in Erwin, Tennessee. The fire was contained to

other facilities as possible as well as the use of other certain
suppliers to protect product supply to customers. Insurance coverage for
the loss provided for reimbursement of the replacement value of property
and equipment damaged in the fire. As of December 31, 2001 the Company
has settled the insurance claim. For the years ended December 31, 2002,
2001 and 2000, the net gain on involuntary conversion of $0, $3,901 and
$728, respectively, represents insurance proceeds received in excess of
costs incurred.
