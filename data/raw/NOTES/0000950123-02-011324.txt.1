See Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. 31 NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS 1.Basis of
Presentation and Accounting Policies Basis
of Presentation Except as indicated, amounts reflected in the
consolidated financial statements or the notes thereto relate to
the continuing operations of Rockwell Automation, Inc. the
Company or Rockwell Automation, formerly named Rockwell
International Corporation. Certain prior year amounts have been
reclassified to conform to the current year presentation. On June29, 2001, the Company completed the
spinoff of its Rockwell Collins avionics and communications
business and certain other assets and liabilities into an
independent, separately traded, publicly held company the
Spinoff. In connection with the Spinoff, all outstanding shares
of Rockwell Collins, Inc. Rockwell Collins were distributed to
Rockwell Automation shareowners on the basis of one Rockwell
Collins share for each outstanding Rockwell Automation share. At
the time of the Spinoff, Rockwell Collins made a special payment
to the Company of $300million. The net assets of Rockwell
Collins as of June29, 2001 of approximately
$12billion including $300 million of debt incurred to
make the special payment to the Company were recorded as a
decrease to shareowners equity. Consolidation The consolidated financial statements of the
Company include the accounts of the Company and all subsidiaries
over which the Company has control. All significant intercompany
accounts and transactions are eliminated in consolidation. Use
of Estimates The consolidated financial statements have been
prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally
accepted in the United States which require management to make
estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of
assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial
statements and revenues and expenses during the periods
reported. Actual results could differ from those estimates.
Estimates are used in accounting for, among other items, sales
rebates and incentives to distributors and commercial customers;
allowance for doubtful accounts; excess and obsolete inventory;
impairment of long-lived assets; product warranty obligations;
retirement benefits; self-insurance liabilities; litigation,
claims and contingencies including environmental matters; and
income taxes. Revenue
Recognition Sales are generally recorded when all of the
following have occurred: an agreement of sale exists, product
delivery and acceptance has occurred or services have been
rendered, pricing is fixed or determinable, and collection is
reasonably assured. Management is required to make judgments
about whether pricing is fixed or determinable and whether or
not collectibility is reasonably assured. The Securities and Exchange Commissions
SECStaff Accounting Bulletin SABNo101,
Revenue Recognition in Financial Statements, provides
guidance on the SEC staffs views on application of
generally accepted accounting principles to selected revenue
recognition issues. The Companys revenue recognition
policy is in accordance with generally accepted accounting
principles and SAB No101. The Company records accruals for sales rebates to
distributors at the time of shipment based upon historical
experience. Changes in such allowances may be required if future
rebates differ from historical experience. In accordance with Emerging Issues Task Force
EITFIssue No00-10, Accounting for Shipping and
Handling Fees and Costs, shipping and handling costs billed
to customers are included in sales and the related costs are
included in cost of sales in the Consolidated Statement of
Operations. 32 NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS Continued   
1.
Basis of Presentation and Accounting
PoliciesContinued Cash
and Cash Equivalents Cash and cash equivalents includes time deposits
and certificates of deposit with original maturities of three
months or less. Receivables Receivables are stated net of allowances for
doubtful accounts of $45 at September30, 2002 and
$43million at September30, 2001. Inventories Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or
market using first-in, first-out FIFOor average methods.
Market is determined on the basis of estimated realizable values. Property Property is stated at cost. Depreciation of
property is provided generally using straight-line and
accelerated methods over 15 to 40years for buildings and
improvements and 3 to 14years for machinery and equipment.
Significant renewals and betterments are capitalized and
replaced units are written off. Maintenance and repairs, as well
as renewals of minor amounts, are charged to expense. Intangible
Assets Goodwill and other intangible assets generally
result from business acquisitions. The Company accounts for
business acquisitions by assigning the purchase price to
tangible and intangible assets and liabilities. Assets acquired
and liabilities assumed are recorded at their fair values, and
the excess of the purchase price over the amounts assigned is
recorded as goodwill. Since October1, 2001 upon adoption of
Statement of Financial Accounting Standard
SFASNo142, Goodwill and Other Intangible
Assets SFAS 142, goodwill and other intangible assets with
indefinite useful lives are no longer systematically amortized
but instead are reviewed for impairment and any excess in
carrying value over the estimated fair value is charged to
results of operations. Distributor networks, developed
technology, patents, and other intangibles with finite useful
lives are amortized on a straight-line basis over their
estimated useful lives, generally ranging from 3 to
40years. Impairment
of Long-Lived Assets The Company evaluates the recoverability of the
carrying amount of long-lived assets whenever events or changes
in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset
may not be fully recoverable. The Company evaluates the
recoverability of goodwill and other intangible assets with
indefinite useful lives annually or more frequently if events or
circumstances indicate that an asset might be impaired. If an
asset is considered to be impaired, the impairment to be
recognized is measured by the amount by which the carrying
amount of the asset exceeds its fair value. Assets to be
disposed of are reported at the lower of the carrying amount or
fair value less cost to sell. Management determines fair value
using discounted future cash flow analysis or other accepted
valuation techniques. Investments Investments in affiliates over which the Company
has the ability to exert significant influence but does not
control, primarily including Rockwell Scientific Company LLC
RSC, are accounted for using the equity method of accounting.
Accordingly, the Companys proportional share of the
respective affiliates earnings or losses are included in
other income expensein the Consolidated Statement of
Operations. These affiliated 33 NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS Continued   
1.
Basis of Presentation and Accounting
PoliciesContinued companies are not material individually or in the
aggregate to Rockwell Automations financial position,
results of operations or cash flows. Derivative
Financial Instruments The Company uses derivative financial instruments
in the form of foreign currency forward exchange contracts and
interest rate swap contracts to manage foreign currency and
interest rate risks. Foreign currency forward exchange contracts
are used to hedge changes in the amount of future cash flows
associated with intercompany transactions generally forecasted
to occur within one year cash flow hedges and changes in the
fair value of certain assets and liabilities resulting from
intercompany loans and other transactions with third parties
denominated in foreign currencies. Interest rate swap contracts
are periodically used to manage the balance of fixed and
floating rate debt. The Companys accounting method for
derivative financial instruments is based upon the designation
of such instruments as hedges under generally accepted
accounting principles. It is the policy of the Company to
execute such instruments with creditworthy banks and not to
enter into derivative financial instruments for speculative
purposes. All foreign currency forward exchange contracts are
denominated in currencies of major industrial countries. Foreign
Currency Translation Assets and liabilities of subsidiaries operating
outside of the United States with a functional currency other
than the U.S. dollar are translated into U.S. dollars using
exchange rates at the end of the respective period. Sales, costs
and expenses are translated at average exchange rates effective
during the respective period. Foreign currency translation gains
and losses are included as a component of accumulated other
comprehensive loss. Currency transaction gains and losses are
included in the results of operations in the period incurred. Earnings
Per Share The Company presents two earnings per share
EPSamounts, basic and diluted. Basic EPS is calculated
by dividing net income by the weighted average number of common
shares outstanding during the year. Diluted EPS amounts are
based upon the weighted average number of common and common
equivalent shares outstanding during the year. Common equivalent
shares are excluded from the computation in periods in which
they have an antidilutive effect. The difference between basic
and diluted EPS is solely attributable to stock options. The
Company uses the treasury stock method to calculate the effect
of outstanding stock options. Stock options for which the
exercise price exceeds the average market price over the period
have an antidilutive effect on EPS, and accordingly, are
excluded from the calculation. For the years ended
September30, 2002, 2001 and 2000, options for
40million, 59million and 48 million,
respectively, were excluded from the diluted EPS calculation
because they were antidilutive. Stock-Based
Compensation The Company accounts for stock-based compensation
in accordance with Accounting Principles Board Opinion
No25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees.
Stock options are granted at prices equal to the fair market
value of the Companys common stock on the grant dates,
therefore no compensation expense is recognized in connection
with stock options granted to employees. Compensation expense
resulting from grants of restricted stock is recognized during
the period the service is performed. Environmental
Matters The Company records accruals for environmental
matters in the accounting period in which its responsibility is
probable and the cost can be reasonably estimated. Revisions to
the accruals are made in the periods in which the estimated
costs of remediation change. At environmental sites in which
more than one 34 NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS Continued   
1.
Basis of Presentation and Accounting
PoliciesContinued potentially responsible party has been
identified, the Company records a liability for its estimated
allocable share of costs related to its involvement with the
site as well as an estimated allocable share of costs related to
the involvement of insolvent or unidentified parties. At
environmental sites in which the Company is the only responsible
party, the Company records a liability for the total estimated
costs of remediation. Future expenditures for environmental
remediation obligations are not discounted to their present
value. If recovery from insurers or other third parties is
determined to be probable, the Company records a receivable for
the estimated recovery. Recently
Adopted Accounting Standards Effective October1, 2001, the Company
adopted SFAS 142. Under SFAS 142, goodwill and certain other
intangible assets are no longer systematically amortized but
instead are reviewed for impairment and any excess in carrying
value over the estimated fair value is charged to results of
operations see Note 3. The Company adopted EITF Issue No01-14,
Income Statement Characterization of Reimbursements Received
for Out of Pocket Expenses Incurred EITF
01-14, on January1, 2002. EITF 01-14 requires companies
to classify as sales certain amounts billed to customers that
have historically been classified as a reduction of cost of
sales. Out of pocket expenses which have been reclassified from
cost of sales to sales were $6million in 2001 and
$5million in 2000. In June 2001, the Financial Accounting Standards
Board issued SFAS No. 141, Business Combinations SFAS
141, which addresses financial accounting and reporting for
business combinations and requires that the purchase method of
accounting be used for all business combinations initiated after
June30, 2001. New
Accounting Standards In June 2001, the Financial Accounting Standards
Board issued SFAS No. 143, Accounting for Asset Retirement
Obligations SFAS 143, which requires entities to recognize
the fair value of a liability for legal obligations associated
with the retirement of tangible long-lived assets in the period
incurred, if a reasonable estimate of the fair value can be made. In August 2001, the Financial Accounting
Standards Board issued SFAS No. 144, Accounting for the
Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets SFAS 144,
which addresses financial accounting and reporting for the
impairment of long-lived assets to be held and used and for
long-lived assets to be disposed of by sale. Under SFAS 144, the
presentation of discontinued operations is broadened to include
a component of an entity rather than being limited to a segment
of a business. Also, accrual of future operating losses of
discontinued businesses will no longer be permitted. In July 2002, the Financial Accounting Standards
Board issued SFAS No. 146, Accounting for Costs Associated
with Exit or Disposal Activities SFAS 146, which addresses
financial accounting and reporting associated with exit or
disposal activities. Under SFAS 146, the Company will measure
costs associated with an exit or disposal activity at fair value
and recognize the costs in the period in which the liability is
incurred rather than at the date of a commitment to an exit or
disposal plan. The Company is required to adopt SFAS 143 and
SFAS 144 at the beginning of fiscal year 2003. Management is
currently evaluating the provisions of SFAS 143 and SFAS 144,
but believes there will be no material effect on the
Companys financial position, results of operations or
shareowners equity at the time of adoption. The Company is
required to adopt SFAS 146 for all exit and disposal activities
initiated after December31, 2002. 35 NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS Continued 2.Acquisitions
of Businesses In September 2002, the Companys Control
Systems segment acquired the engineering services and system
integration assets of SPEL, spol. s.r.o. The acquisition is
expected to accelerate the establishment of the Company as a
complete solution provider in Central Europe and it also
strategically locates the Company in a region with future growth
opportunities. In May 2002, the Companys Control Systems
segment acquired the assets of the controller division of
Samsung Electronics Company Limiteds Mechatronics business
the Controller Division. The Company combined its existing
Korean business with the Controller Division to form a new
business that operates under the name Rockwell Samsung
Automation and creates technologies for the design and
development of automation products. The acquisition is expected
to expand the Companys existing operations in Korea,
further the Companys design and product development
capabilities and support future commercial and operational
expansion in the Asia Pacific region. In March 2002, the Companys Control Systems
segment acquired all of the stock of Propack Data GmbH
Propack, a provider of manufacturing information systems for
the pharmaceutical and other regulated industries. The
acquisition is expected to broaden the Companys position
in the pharmaceuticals market, enhance the Companys
process solutions business and enable the Company to expand its
reach into the manufacturing information markets. In January 2002, the Companys Control
Systems segment acquired all of the stock of Tesch GmbH, an
electronic products and safety relay manufacturer, expanding the
Companys machine safety product and research and
development capabilities. The aggregate cash purchase price of the
businesses acquired in 2002, of which the majority related to
the acquisition of Propack, was approximately $71million.
Assets acquired and liabilities assumed have been recorded at
fair values. The excess of the purchase price over the estimated
fair value of the acquired tangible and intangible assets was
recorded as goodwill. In October 2000, the Control Systems segment
acquired the batch software and services business of Sequencia
Corporation. The purchase price for this acquisition was
$6million which was allocated to intangible assets,
including developed technology and assembled workforce, and the
excess of the purchase price over the amounts assigned to
intangible assets was recorded as goodwill. In March 2000, the Control Systems segment
acquired Entek IRD International Corporation, a provider of
machinery condition monitoring solutions. In April 2000, the
Control Systems segment acquired substantially all the assets
and assumed certain liabilities of Systems Modeling Corporation,
a software developer. The aggregate cash purchase price for
acquisitions in 2000 was $70million, of which
$61million was allocated to intangible assets, including
developed technology, and the excess of the purchase price over
the amounts assigned to tangible and intangible assets was
recorded as goodwill. Developed technology is being amortized on
a straight-line basis over a period of 5years. Amounts recorded for liabilities assumed in
connection with these acquisitions were $6million in 2002 1million in 2001 and $16million in 2000. These acquisitions were accounted for as
purchases and, accordingly, the results of operations of these
businesses have been included in the Consolidated Statement of
Operations since their respective dates of acquisition. Pro
forma financial information and allocation of the purchase price
is not presented as the combined effect of these acquisitions
was not material to the Companys results of operations or
financial position. 36 NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS Continued 3.Goodwill and
Other Intangible Assets In connection with the adoption of SFAS 142,
management determined that the Companys Allen-Bradley,
Reliance and Dodge trademarks have indefinite useful lives.
Accordingly, management performed a transitional intangible
asset impairment test which resulted in an impairment charge of
$56million $35million after tax, or 19 cents per
diluted share related to the Reliance trademark used primarily
by Power Systems. The impairment charge represents the excess of
the carrying amount of the trademark over its estimated fair
value as determined by management, with the assistance of
independent valuation experts, utilizing the relief from royalty
valuation method. This method estimates the benefit to the
Company resulting from owning rather than licensing the
trademark. Also in connection with the adoption of SFAS 142,
the Company completed the transitional goodwill impairment test
during 2002. As a result, an impairment charge of
$73million before and after tax, or 39 cents per diluted
share was recorded related to goodwill at a Power Systems
reporting unit. The fair value of the reporting unit was
estimated using a combination of valuation techniques, including
the present value of expected future cash flows and historical
valuations of comparable businesses. The previous method for determining impairment
prescribed by SFAS No121, Accounting for the
Impairment of Long-Lived Assets and Long-Lived Assets to be
Disposed of, utilized an undiscounted cash flow approach for
the initial impairment assessment, while SFAS 142 utilizes a
fair value approach. The trademark impairment charge and the
goodwill impairment charge discussed above are the result of the
change in the accounting method for determining the impairment
of goodwill and certain intangible assets. These charges have
been recorded as the cumulative effect of accounting change in
the amount of $129million $108million after tax, or
58 cents per diluted share as of October1, 2001 in the
accompanying Condensed Consolidated Statement of Operations. The changes in the carrying amount of goodwill
for the year ended September30, 2002 are as follows in

The weighted average interest rate on short-term bank borrowings
was 28percent at September30, 2002 and
20percent at September30, 2001. At September30, 2002, the Company had
$1billion of unsecured credit facilities with various
banks to support commercial paper borrowings. There were no
significant commitment fees or compensating balance requirements
under these facilities. On October29, 2002, the Company
terminated these credit facilities and entered into new credit
facilities with various banks for $3375million expiring
in October 2003 and $3375million expiring in October
2005. Pursuant to the terms of the new credit facilities, the
Companys debt to capital ratio shall not exceed
60percent. Short-term credit facilities available to
foreign subsidiaries amounted to $108million at
September30, 2002 and consisted of arrangements for which
there are no significant commitment fees. 40 NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL

In September 2002, the Company entered into an
interest rate swap contract the Swap which effectively
converted its $350million aggregate principal amount of
615% notes, payable in 2008, to floating rate debt based on
six-month LIBOR. The floating rate was 421percent at
September30, 2002. At September30, 2002, the fair
value of the Swap, based upon quoted market prices for contracts
with similar maturities, was approximately $6million. As
permitted by SFAS133, the Company has designated the Swap
as a fair value hedge. Accordingly, the fair value of the Swap
was recorded in other assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheet
and the carrying value of the underlying debt was adjusted by an
equal amount in accordance with SFAS133.   
9.
Financial Instruments The Companys financial instruments include
short- and long-term debt and foreign currency forward exchange
contracts. The fair value of short-term debt approximates the
carrying value due to its short-term nature. The carrying value
of long-term debt was $919million at September30,
2002 and $910million at September30, 2001. The fair
value of long-term debt, based upon quoted market prices for the
same or similar issues, was $976million at
September30, 2002 and $898million at
September30, 2001. Foreign currency forward exchange contracts
provide for the purchase or sale of foreign currencies at
specified future dates at specified exchange rates. At
September30, 2002 and 2001, the Company had outstanding
foreign currency forward exchange contracts primarily consisting
of contracts for the euro, pound sterling, Canadian dollar and
Swiss franc. The net carrying value of foreign currency forward
exchange 41 NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS Continued   
9.
Financial Instruments
Continued contracts of $15million at
September30, 2002 and $2million at
September30, 2001 was equal to its fair value based upon
quoted market prices for contracts with similar maturities. The
foreign currency forward exchange contracts are recorded in
other current assets in the amounts of $6million as of
September30, 2002 and $11million as of
September30, 2001 and other current liabilities in the
amounts of $21million as of September30, 2002 and
$9million as of September30, 2001. The Company does
not anticipate any material adverse effect on its results of
operations or financial position relating to these foreign
currency forward exchange contracts. The Company has designated
certain foreign currency forward exchange contracts related to
forecasted intercompany transactions as cash flow hedges. The
amount recognized in earnings as a result of the ineffectiveness
of cash flow hedges was not material. 10.Shareowners

offers to acquire, 20% or more of the common stock, although the
board of directors is authorized to reduce the 20% threshold for
triggering the Rights to not less than 10%. Upon exercise, each
Right entitles the holder to 1/100th of a share of SeriesA

other than Rights held by the acquirer will generally be
exercisable for $500 worth of either common stock of the Company
or common stock of the acquirer for $250. In certain
circumstances, each Right may be exchanged by the Company for
one share of common stock or 1/100th of a share of Junior
Preferred Stock. The Rights will expire on December6,

Approximately $3million of the net unrealized losses on
cash flow hedges as of September30, 2002 will be
reclassified into earnings during 2003. Management expects that
these unrealized losses will be offset when the hedged items are
recognized in earnings. 11.Stock
Options Options to purchase common stock of the Company
have been granted under various incentive plans and by board
action to directors, officers and other key employees at prices
equal to or above the fair market value of the stock on the
dates the options were granted. The plans provide that the
option price for certain options granted under the plans may be
paid in cash, shares of common stock or a combination thereof. Under the 2000 Long-Term Incentives Plan, the
Company may grant up to 16million shares of Company common
stock as non-qualified options, incentive stock options, stock
appreciation rights and restricted stock. Shares available for
future grant or payment under various incentive plans were
76million at September30, 2002. None of the
incentive plans presently permits options to be granted after
November30, 2009. Stock options generally expire ten years
from the date they are granted and vest over three years
time-vesting options with the exception of performance-vesting
options. Performance-vesting options expire ten years from the
date they are granted and vest at the earlier of athe
date the market price of the Companys common stock reaches
a specified level for a pre-determined period of time or certain
other financial performance criteria are met or ba

performance-vesting options were not exercisable at
September30, 2002. In connection with the Spinoff, the number and
exercise prices of certain options were adjusted in order to
preserve the intrinsic value of the options that were
outstanding immediately before and after the Spinoff. For
certain other options, option holders received a combination of
Rockwell Automation and Rockwell Collins options with
adjustments made to the number and exercise prices of those
options to preserve the intrinsic value of the Rockwell
Automation and Rockwell Collins options that were outstanding
immediately before and after the Spinoff. Outstanding Rockwell
Automation options held by Rockwell Collins employees generally
were converted into Rockwell Collins options. None of the

Benefits The Company sponsors pension and other
postretirement benefit plans for its employees. The pension
plans cover most of the Companys employees and provide for
monthly pension payments to eligible employees upon retirement.
Pension benefits for salaried employees generally are based on
years of credited service and average earnings. Pension benefits
for hourly employees generally are based on specified benefit
amounts and years of service. The Companys policy is to
fund its pension obligations in conformity with the funding
requirements of applicable laws and governmental regulations.
Other postretirement benefits are in the form of retirement
medical plans and cover most of the Companys United States
employees and provide for the payment of certain medical costs
of eligible employees and dependents upon retirement. Pension plan obligations attributable to all of
Rockwell Automations domestic active employees and former
employees of the Control Systems, Power Systems and FirstPoint
Contact businesses were retained by Rockwell Automation and a
proportionate share of pension plan assets were transferred from
the former Rockwell International Corporation domestic qualified
plan Rockwell Retirement Plan to a new pension plan
established by Rockwell Automation. In connection with the
Spinoff, Rockwell Collins assumed the Rockwell Retirement Plan.
The Company also retained liabilities for other postretirement
benefits for active and former employees. The tables below

The discount rate, compensation increase rate and
health care cost trend rate assumptions are determined as of the
measurement date. The expected return on plan assets assumption
is determined as of the previous measurement date. Effective October1, 2002, the Company
amended its United States postretirement healthcare benefit
program in order to mitigate the increasing cost of
postretirement healthcare services. This change will be phased
in as follows: effective January1, 2004, the Company, per
an amendment to this program implemented in 1992, will
contribute 50percent of the amount in excess of the 2003
per capita amount. However, the Companys 2004 contribution
shall be limited to a 75percent increase from the 2003
per capita amount. Effective January1, 2005, the Company
will limit its future per capita maximum contribution to its
calendar 2004 per capita contribution. The effect of this change
will be to reduce the benefit obligation by $62million.
Net periodic benefit cost in 2003 will be approximately
$32million, which is approximately 20percent lower
than what the cost would have been without implementing this
change. Pension
Benefits The projected benefit obligation, accumulated
benefit obligation and fair value of plan assets for the pension
plans with accumulated benefit obligations in excess of the fair
value of plan assets underfunded plans were $1,325 million 1,137million and $961million respectively, as of
the 2002 measurement date June30 and $93million 78million and $20million, respectively, as of the
2001 measurement date. Other
Postretirement Benefits Assumed health care cost trend rates have a

plans. A one-percentage point change in assumed health care cost
trend rates would have the following effect in millions

Contribution Savings Plans The Company also sponsors certain defined
contribution savings plans for eligible employees. Expense
related to these plans was $21million for 2002 22million for 2001 and $21million for 2000. 13.Special
Charges In 2001, the Company recorded special charges of
$91million $60million after tax, or 32 cents per
diluted share for costs associated with the consolidation and
closing of facilities, the realignment of administrative
functions, the reduction of workforce, primarily in North
America, by approximately 2,000 employees and asset impairments.
The special charges are reflected in the Consolidated Statement
of Operations for the year ended September30, 2001 in cost
of sales and selling, general and administrative expenses in the
amounts of $50million and $41million, respectively.
The Company had completed these actions at September30,
2002. Total cash expenditures in connection with these
actions are expected to approximate $50million. The
Company spent approximately $43million through
September30, 2002 of which $41million related to
employee severance and separation costs. In connection with the
Spinoff, Rockwell Collins assumed a liability for employee
severance and separation costs resulting from these actions of
approximately $7million. As a result of actions taken
through September30, 2002, all of the workforce reductions
have been completed. The remaining balance at September30,
2002 relates to salary continuation and benefit payments to
terminated employees. The special charges included write-downs to the
carrying amount of goodwill, certain facilities and machinery
and equipment totaling approximately $27million resulting
from the decision to shut down certain facilities and exit
non-strategic operations. The charges represented the difference
between the fair values of the assets and their carrying values.
Fair value was determined by management on the basis of various
customary valuation techniques. Revenues and results of operations of businesses
and product lines which are being exited are not material. The charges and their utilization for the years
ended September30, 2001 and 2002 are summarized as follows

The Company evaluates the adequacy of reserves
recorded in prior years and makes necessary revisions for
changes in estimates in the periods in which they occur. The
remaining balances at September30, 2002 related to charges
taken in previous years were not significant. During 2001, the
Company recorded an adjustment of $8million as a reduction
of cost of sales and $2million as a reduction of selling,
general and administrative expenses primarily as a result of
lower than expected employee separation and lease termination
costs associated with actions taken in prior years. 49 NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL

The results of operations of the Companys
Rockwell Collins avionics and communications business in 2001
include $21million of costs directly related to the
Spinoff. The net benefit of $3million in
discontinued operations in 2002 reflects the resolution of
certain obligations related to two discontinued businesses.
Related payments of approximately $36million were made in
2002, which have been reflected as cash used by discontinued
operations in the accompanying Consolidated Statement of Cash
Flows. 15.Related Party
Transactions Following the Spinoff, the Company and Rockwell
Collins each have owned 50 percent of Rockwell Scientific
Company LLC RSC formerly a wholly-owned subsidiary of the
Company known as Rockwell Science Center. At September30,
2002, the Companys investment in RSC of $50million
is included in other assets. Beginning with the fourth quarter
of 2001, the Companys 50percent ownership interest
in RSC is accounted for using the equity method. The Company has an agreement with RSC pursuant to
which RSC will perform research and development services for the
Company through 2004. The Company is obligated to pay RSC a
minimum of $3million for such services in 2003 and
$4million for such services in 2004. The Company incurred
approximately $3million for research and development
services performed by RSC for the year ended September30,
2002. At September30, 2002, the amount due to RSC for
research and development services was not significant. The Company shares equally with Rockwell Collins
in providing a $4million line of credit to RSC which bears
interest at the greater of the Companys or Rockwell
Collins commercial paper borrowing rate. At
September30, 2002, there were no outstanding borrowings on
the line of credit. At September30, 2002, the Company was
the sole guarantor of the performance of RSC under a lease
agreement for one of RSCs facilities. The total future
minimum lease payments under the lease are approximately
$7million. The lease agreement has a term which ends in
2011. Effective October 2002, the Company and Rockwell Collins
each guarantees one-half of the lease obligation of RSC. The Company owns 25 percent of CoLinx, LLC
CoLinx, a company that provides logistics and e-commerce
services. The Company paid CoLinx approximately $15million
in 2002 and $6million in 2001 primarily for logistics
services. In addition, CoLinx paid the Company approximately
$3million in 2002 and $2million in 2001 for the use
of facilities owned by the Company and other services. 50 NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL

During 2002, the Company resolved certain tax
matters for the period of 1995-1999. The resolution resulted in
a $48million reduction of the Companys income tax
provision, of which $11million is reflected in tax refund
claims in the current income tax provision and $37million
is reflected in the United States deferred income tax provision. During 2001, the Company reached agreement with
various taxing authorities on refund claims related to certain
prior years and recorded $22million as a reduction of its
income tax provision. 51 NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL

Management believes it is more likely than not
that current and long-term deferred tax assets will be realized
through the reduction of future taxable income. Significant
factors considered by management in its determination of the
probability of the realization of the deferred tax assets
include: athe historical operating results of the
Company $346million of United States taxable income over
the past three years, bexpectations of future earnings,
and cthe extended period of time over which the
retirement medical liability will be paid. A valuation allowance
is established at September30, 2002 for deferred tax
assets related to non-United States, state and local net
operating loss carryforwards $12million, capital loss
carryforwards $8million and state tax credit
carryforwards $3million for which utilization is
uncertain. The carryforward period for the majority of the
non-United States net operating loss carryforwards is
indefinite. The carryforward period for the state and local net
operating loss carryforwards ends between 2007 and 2022. The
capital loss carryforwards expire in 2007. The carryforward
period for the state tax credit carryforwards ends between 2003

No provision has been made for United States,
state, or additional non-United States income taxes related to
approximately $261million of undistributed earnings of
foreign subsidiaries which have been or are intended to be
permanently reinvested. It is not practical to determine the
United States federal income tax liability, if any, which would
be payable if such earnings were not permanently reinvested. The Company anticipates filing in 2003 a federal
research and experimentation tax credit refund claim of
approximately $100million for the years 1997 through 2001.
The claim will be subject to audit by the Internal Revenue
Service. The ultimate potential tax benefit of this claim, if
any, is not currently known and therefore no benefit has been
recognized for financial reporting purposes. 53 NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL

Income taxes paid and interest payments related

are payable as follows in millions: 2003, $47; 2004, $42;
2005, $35; 2006, $25; 2007, $20; and after 2007, $39.
Commitments from third parties under sublease agreements having
noncancelable lease terms in excess of one year aggregated
$42million as of September30, 2002 and are
receivable through 2008 at approximately $7million per
year. 19.Commitments
and Contingent Liabilities Federal, state and local requirements relating to
the discharge of substances into the environment, the disposal
of hazardous wastes and other activities affecting the
environment have and will continue to have an effect on the
manufacturing operations of the Company. Thus far, compliance
with environmental requirements and resolution of environmental
claims has been accomplished without material effect on the
Companys liquidity and capital resources, competitive
position or financial condition. The Company has been designated as a potentially
responsible party at 15 Superfund sites, excluding sites as to
which the Companys records disclose no involvement or as
to which the Companys potential liability has been finally
determined and assumed by third parties. Management estimates
the total reasonably possible costs the Company could incur for
the remediation of Superfund sites at September30, 2002 to
be about $14million, of which $8 million has been accrued. Various other lawsuits, claims and proceedings
have been asserted against the Company alleging violations of
federal, state and local environmental protection requirements,
or seeking remediation of alleged environmental impairments,
principally at previously owned properties. As of
September30, 2002, management has estimated the highest
total reasonably possible costs the Company could incur from
these matters to be about $51million. The Company has
recorded environmental accruals for these matters of
$19million. In addition to the above matters, the Company
assumed certain other environmental liabilities in connection
with the 1995 acquisition of Reliance Electric Company
Reliance. The Company is indemnified by ExxonMobil Corporation
Exxon for substantially all costs associated with these
Reliance matters. At September30, 2002, the Company has
recorded a liability of approximately $29million and a
receivable of approximately $28million for these Reliance
matters. Management estimates the highest total reasonably
possible costs for these matters to be approximately
$37million for which the Company is substantially
indemnified by Exxon. Based on its assessment, management believes that
the Companys expenditures for environmental capital
investment and remediation necessary to comply with present
regulations governing environmental protection and other
expenditures for the resolution of environmental claims will not
have a material adverse effect on the Companys liquidity
and capital resources, competitive position or financial
condition. Management cannot assess the possible effect of
compliance with future requirements. 54 NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS Continued 19.Commitments
and Contingent Liabilities Continued Various lawsuits, claims and proceedings have
been or may be instituted or asserted against the Company
relating to the conduct of its business, including those
pertaining to product liability, intellectual property, safety
and health, employment and contract matters. In connection with
the divestiture of its former aerospace and defense businesses
the AD Business to The Boeing Company Boeing, Rockwell
Automation agreed to indemnify Boeing for certain matters
related to operations of the AD Business for periods prior
to the divestiture. In connection with the spinoffs of the
Companys former automotive component systems business,
semiconductor systems business and Rockwell Collins avionics and
communications business, the spun-off companies have agreed to
indemnify Rockwell Automation for substantially all contingent
liabilities related to the respective businesses, including
environmental and intellectual property matters. Although the
outcome of litigation cannot be predicted with certainty and
some lawsuits, claims, or proceedings may be disposed of
unfavorably to the Company, management believes the disposition
of matters which are pending or asserted will not have a
material adverse effect on the Companys business or
financial condition. The Company has, from time to time, divested
certain of its businesses. In connection with such divestitures,
there may be lawsuits, claims and proceedings instituted or
asserted against the Company related to the period that the
businesses were owned by the Company. In addition, the Company
has guaranteed performance and payment under certain contracts
of divested businesses, including a $60million lease
obligation of the Companys former semiconductor systems
business. The lease obligation of the Companys former
semiconductor systems business is secured by real property
subject to the lease and is within a range of estimated fair
values of the real property. In consideration for this
guarantee, the Company will receive $250,000 per quarter from
Conexant through December31, 2003. Management expects to
be released from the guarantee by December31, 2003. In
most cases, the Company is indemnified for these obligations by
the divested businesses. Management believes that any judgments
against the Company related to such matters or claims pursuant
to the guarantees would not have a material adverse effect on
the Companys business or financial condition. In connection with the sale of a Power Systems
business in 2000, the Company entered into a supply agreement
with the buyer of the business. The agreement requires minimum
purchases by the Company of approximately $21 million per year
through December31, 2005. In the event that purchases are
less than $21million in a given year, the Company may
incur penalties which are a percentage of the amount by which
the actual purchases were less that the contractual minimum for
the period. Based upon current estimates of future purchases,
management of the Company does not believe that any penalties
payable under the terms of the agreement would be material to
the Companys business or financial condition. 20.Business

earnings of Rockwell Science Center through the third quarter of
2001. Beginning with the fourth quarter of 2001, the
Companys 50percent ownership interest in RSC is
accounted for using the equity method, and the Companys
proportional share of RSCs earnings or losses are included
in general corporate net. Certain amounts in prior periods have been
reclassified to reflect the transfer of management
responsibility of a business from Control Systems to Power
Systems which was effective January1, 2002. In addition,
reclassifications have been made as a result of the adoption of
EITF Issue No01-14 see Note1. Effective October1, 2001, the Company
adopted SFAS142. As a result of adopting SFAS142,
the Company no longer amortizes goodwill and certain other
intangible assets that have been deemed to have an indefinite
useful life. The amortization of goodwill and the intangible
assets that have been deemed to have an indefinite useful life
was $56million in 2001 and $53million in 2000. Among other considerations, the Company evaluates
performance and allocates resources based upon segment operating
earnings before income taxes, interest expense, costs related to
corporate offices, nonrecurring special charges, gains and
losses from the disposition of businesses, earnings and losses
from equity affiliates which are not considered part of the
operations of a particular segment, and incremental acquisition
related expenses resulting from purchase accounting adjustments
such as goodwill and other intangible asset amortization,
depreciation, inventory and purchased research and development
charges. Intersegment sales are made at market prices. The
accounting policies used in preparing the segment information
are consistent with those described in Note1. Special
charges are discussed in Note13. 57 NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL

balance sheet of Rockwell Automation, Inc. and subsidiaries as
of September30, 2002 and 2001, and the related
consolidated statements of operations, shareowners equity,
cash flows, and comprehensive income for each of the three years
in the period ended September30, 2002. Our audits also
included the financial statement schedule listed in the Index at
a2. These financial statements and financial
statement schedule are the responsibility of the Companys
management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these
financial statements and financial statement schedule based on
our audits. We conducted our audits in accordance with
auditing standards generally accepted in the United States of
America. Those standards require that we plan and perform the
audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial
statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes
examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and
disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes
assessing the accounting principles used and significant
estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall
financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits
provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. In our opinion, such consolidated financial
statements present fairly, in all material respects, the
financial position of Rockwell Automation, Inc. and subsidiaries
at September30, 2002 and 2001, and the results of their
operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in
the period ended September30, 2002, in conformity with
accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of
America. Also, in our opinion, such financial statement
schedule, when considered in relation to the basic consolidated
financial statements taken as a whole, presents fairly in all
material respects the information set forth therein. As described in Note3 to the Consolidated
Financial Statements, on October1, 2001, the Company
