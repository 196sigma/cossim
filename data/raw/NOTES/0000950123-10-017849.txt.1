Controls and Procedures Conclusion Regarding the Effectiveness of Disclosure Controls and Procedures Under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our principal
executive officer and principal financial officer, we conducted an evaluation of our disclosure
controls and procedures, as such term is defined under Rule13a-15e and Rule15d-15e
promulgated under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended the Exchange Act, as of the
end of the period covered by this Annual Report. Based on this evaluation, our principal executive
officer and our principal financial officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures
were effective, as of the end of the period covered by this Annual Report. Managements Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over
financial reporting as defined in Rules13a-15f and 15d-15f under the Securities Exchange Act
of 1934. The Companys internal control over financial reporting is designed to provide reasonable
assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial
statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. The
Companys internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that   
pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable
detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and
dispositions of the assets of the Company   
provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded
as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements
in accordance with generally accepted accounting
principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the
Company are being made only in accordance with
authorizations of management and directors of the Company;
and   
provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely
detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition
of the Companys assets that could have a material effect
on the financial statements. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or
detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are
subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that
the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. Management assessed the effectiveness of the Companys internal control over financial reporting as
of December31, 2009. In making this assessment, management used the criteria set forth by the
Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission COSOin Internal Control -
Integrated Framework. Based on managements assessment and those criteria, management believes that, as of December31,
2009, the Companys internal control over financial reporting was effective. The Companys independent registered public accounting firm, Ernst Young LLP, has issued an
attestation report on the Companys internal control over financial reporting. That report begins
on page 58 and is incorporated by reference herein. Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting There have been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during
the quarter ended December31, 2009 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to
materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. 52 Table of Contents
