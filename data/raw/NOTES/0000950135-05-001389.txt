FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA MANAGEMENT REPORT ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL
REPORTING Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining
adequate internal control over financial reporting, as such term
is defined in Exchange Act Rule13a-15f. Because of its
inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting
may not prevent or detect misstatements. Projections of any
evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the
risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in
conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies
or procedures may deteriorate. Our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief
Financial Officer, conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness
of our internal control over financial reporting based on the
framework in Internal Control Integrated
Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring
Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Based on its
evaluation under the framework in Internal
Control Integrated Framework, our management
concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was
effective as of December31, 2004. Our managements
assessment of the effectiveness of our internal control over
financial reporting as of December31, 2004 has been
audited by Deloitte Touche LLP, an independent
registered public accounting firm, as stated in its report which
is included in this Annual Report on Form10-K. 43 Table of Contents REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of RSA Security Inc. and Subsidiaries We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of
RSA Security Inc. and subsidiaries as of December31, 2004
and 2003, and the related consolidated statements of operations,
stockholders equity and comprehensive income loss, and
cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended
December31, 2004. Our audits also included the financial
statement schedule listed in  a2. These
financial statements and financial statement schedule are the
responsibility of the Companys management. Our
responsibility is to express an opinion on the financial
statements and financial statement schedule based on our audits. We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the
Public Company Accounting Oversight Board United States. Those
standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are
free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a
test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in
the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the
accounting principles used and significant estimates made by
management, as well as evaluating the overall financial
statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a
reasonable basis for our opinion. In our opinion, such consolidated financial statements present
fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of RSA
Securities Inc. and subsidiaries at December31, 2004 and
2003, and the results of their operations and their cash flows
for each of the three years in the period ended
December31, 2004, in conformity with accounting principles
generally accepted in the United States of America. Also, in our
opinion, such financial statement schedule, when considered in
relation to the basic consolidated financial statements taken as
a whole, present fairly, in all material respects, the
information set forth therein. We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the
Public Company Accounting Oversight Board United States, the
effectiveness of the Companys internal control over
financial reporting as of December31, 2004, based on the
criteria established in Internal Control
Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring
Organizations of the Treadway Commission, and our report dated
March11, 2005 expressed an unqualified opinion on
managements assessment of the effectiveness of the
Companys internal control over financial reporting and an
unqualified opinion on the effectiveness of the Companys
internal control over financial reporting. s/ Deloitte Touche
LLP Boston, Massachusetts March11, 2005 44 Table of Contents REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of RSA Security Inc. and Subsidiaries We have audited managements assessment, included in the
accompanying Managements Report on Internal Control Over
Financial Reporting that RSA Security Inc. and subsidiaries the
Company maintained effective internal control over
financial reporting as of December31, 2004, based on
criteria established in Internal Control
Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring
Organizations of the Treadway Commission. The Companys
management is responsible for maintaining effective internal
control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the
effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting. Our
responsibility is to express an opinion on managements
assessment and an opinion on the effectiveness of the
Companys internal control over financial reporting based
on our audit. We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the
Public Company Accounting Oversight Board United States. Those
standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control
over financial reporting was maintained in all material
respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of
internal control over financial reporting, evaluating
managements assessment, testing and evaluating the design
and operating effectiveness of internal control, and performing
such other procedures as we considered necessary in the
circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable
basis for our opinions. A companys internal control over financial reporting is a
process designed by, or under the supervision of, the
companys principal executive and principal financial
officers, or persons performing similar functions, and effected
by the companys board of directors, management, and other
personnel to provide reasonable assurance regarding the
reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of
financial statements for external purposes in accordance with
generally accepted accounting principles. A companys
internal control over financial reporting includes those
policies and procedures that 1pertain to the maintenance
of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly
reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the
company; 2provide reasonable assurance that transactions
are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial
statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting
principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company
are being made only in accordance with authorizations of
management and directors of the company; and 3provide
reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of
unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the
companys assets that could have a material effect on the
financial statements. Because of the inherent limitations of internal control over
financial reporting, including the possibility of collusion or
improper management override of controls, material misstatements
due to error or fraud may not be prevented or detected on a
timely basis. Also, projections of any evaluation of the
effectiveness of the internal control over financial reporting
to future periods are subject to the risk that the controls may
become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the
degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may
deteriorate. In our opinion, managements assessment that the Company
maintained effective internal control over financial reporting
as of December31, 2004, is fairly stated, in all material
respects, based on the criteria established in Internal
Control Integrated Framework issued by the
Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway
Commission. Also in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all
material respects, effective internal control over financial
reporting as of December31, 2004, based on the criteria
established in Internal Control Integrated
Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring
Organizations of the Treadway Commission. We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the
Public Company Accounting Oversight Board United States, the
consolidated balance sheets as of December31, 2004 and
2003, and the related consolidated statements of operations,
stockholders equity and comprehensive income loss, and
cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended
December31, 2004 of the Company and our report dated
March11, 2005 expressed an unqualified opinion on those
financial statements and financial statement schedule. s/ Deloitte Touche

Supplemental disclosure of non-cash financing activities In 2004, the holders of our convertible debentures with a
principal amount of $80,000 converted the full amount of the
debentures into shares of our common stock. These conversions
resulted in the issuance of an aggregate of
5,820,297shares of our common stock and the cancellation
of the holders debentures. We made no principal payment in
connection with the conversions. These conversions resulted in
the increase of additional paid in capital of $79,942 and an
increase in the value of our common stock of $58 during the
twelve months ending December31, 2004. See accompanying notes to consolidated financial statements 49 Table of Contents RSA SECURITY INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements In thousands, except share and per share data

Nature of Business and Summary of Significant Accounting
Policies Nature of Business RSA Security Inc. and its
consolidated subsidiaries are focused on helping customers
confidently protect and manage identities and information
access. With approximately 17,000 customers worldwide, RSA
Security has a 20-year track record of award-winning solutions.
Built to work seamlessly in heterogeneous environments, our
portfolio of identity access and management solutions is
designed to inspire customers to confidently exploit the full
power of the Internet as well as secure access to valuable
information assets in their enterprise networks Principles of Consolidation The consolidated
financial statements include our accounts and those of our
wholly owned subsidiaries. All significant intercompany accounts
and transactions have been eliminated. Use of Estimates The preparation of our
consolidated financial statements are in conformity with
accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of
America and require management to make estimates and assumptions
that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and
disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of
the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and
expenses during the reporting periods. On an ongoing basis, we
evaluate our estimates. We base our estimates on historical
experience and on various other assumptions that we believe are
reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results could differ
from those estimates. Revenue Recognition Revenue is recognized
when earned. We recognize revenue from the sale of products when
persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, delivery has
occurred, the fee is fixed or determinable, and collection is
considered probable. We recognize revenue from licensing other
intellectual property when evidence of an arrangement exists,
the fee is fixed or determinable and collection is considered
probable. We reduce revenue by provisions for estimated returns.
When arrangements contain multiple elements and vendor specific
objective evidence of fair value exists for all undelivered
elements, we recognize revenue for the delivered elements using
the residual method. For arrangements containing multiple
elements where vendor specific objective evidence of fair value
does not exist for all undelivered elements, we defer revenue
for the delivered and undelivered elements until vendor specific
objective evidence of fair value exists or all elements have
been delivered. We recognize revenue upon shipment of product to
its stocking distributors, net of estimated returns. We defer
maintenance services revenue, whether sold separately or as part
of a multiple element arrangement, and recognize it ratably over
the term of the maintenance contract, generally twelve months. Some of our arrangements contain bundled products which include
a term software license, an RSA SecurID authenticator and
support for the term of the license. As these arrangements
contain multiple elements where vendor specific objective
evidence of fair value does not exist for all undelivered
elements, we record these arrangements as deferred revenue and
recognize revenue ratably on a monthly basis over the term of
the license agreement. For arrangements which contain an initial prepaid license fee
with the payment of ongoing royalties, we recognize revenue on
the initial prepaid license fee when persuasive evidence of an
arrangement exists, delivery has occurred, the fee is fixed or
determinable and collection is considered probable. The ongoing
royalties are recognized at the time a reliable estimate can be
made of the actual usage that has occurred, provided collection
is probable. Annual license fees or onetime license fee
arrangements typically contain non-refundable terms, therefore
we recognize revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement
exists, delivery has occurred, the fee is fixed or determinable
and collection is considered probable. We recognize revenue allocated to professional service elements
as the services are performed. When the customization is
essential to the functionality of the licensed software, then
both the software license and professional services revenue are
recognized under the percentage of completion method, which
requires 50 Table of Contents RSA SECURITY INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES Notes to Consolidated Financial
StatementsContinued revenue to be recognized as a percentage of the project
completed. We recognize revenue and gross profit using labor
hours as an input measure of progress to completion on these
arrangements. Allowance for Sales Returns Allowances for
estimated sales returns and allowances on products and
maintenance and professional service revenue are recorded in the
same period as the related revenue is recorded. We base these
estimates on historical sales returns, analysis of credit memo
data, current economic trends, product line and customer
industry and other known factors. Allowance for Doubtful Accounts We maintain
allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting
from the inability of our customers to make required payments.
We analyze accounts receivable and the composition of the
accounts receivable aging, historical bad debts, customer
creditworthiness, current economic trends, and changes in
customer payment terms when evaluating the adequacy of the
allowance for doubtful accounts. Bad debt expense is included in
marketing and selling expenses in the consolidated statements of
operations. The following table presents changes in the allowance for
doubtful accounts

Allowance for Warranty Obligations Our
standard practice is to provide a warranty on all RSA
SecurID hardware authenticators for the customer selected
programmed life of the authenticator generally two to five
years and to replace any defective authenticators other than
authenticators damaged by a users abuse or alteration
free of charge. We sell our other products to customers with a
warranty for product defects for a specified period, generally
ninety days. We provide reserves for warranty obligations based
on historical failure and defective return rates and include
these costs as a component of product cost of revenue. We
reevaluate the estimate of warranty and defective return
obligations, including the assumptions about estimated failure
and return rates, each quarter. During 2002 and 2003, our quarterly analysis of historical
failure and defective return rates indicated that certain
authenticators produced between 2000 and 2002 were subject to
higher defect and failure rates. We have increased our
provisions for warranty expense accordingly. We continue to
monitor warranty claims and reevaluate its estimate of warranty
and defective return obligations in future periods, which may
result in recording additional warranty expense. We monitor warranty claims and address defects through our
quality and design processes, which are managed by our product
engineering, quality control and technical support
organizations. During the last several years, we have increased
resources and initiated new programs to build an expanded family
of high performance authentication solutions. These programs
have resulted in the redesign and re-engineering of
authenticator products to improve performance and reliability by
incorporating new microprocessors, electronics, firmware and
batteries with longer lives. 51 Table of Contents RSA SECURITY INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES Notes to Consolidated Financial
StatementsContinued Accrued warranty reserve is included in accrued expenses and
other liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets. The

Cash Equivalents All highly liquid
investments purchased with a remaining maturity of three months
or less at the date of purchase are considered cash equivalents. Marketable Securities Marketable securities
are classified as available for sale and recorded at
market value using the specific identification method.
Unrealized gains and losses are included in accumulated other
comprehensive income, net of tax effects. Realized gains or
losses are determined based on the specific identified cost of
the securities. Any unrealized losses that are considered to be
other than temporary are charged immediately to the
income statement. Inventory Inventory consists primarily of RSA
SecurID authenticators and is stated at the lower of cost
first-in, first-out method or market. Property and Equipment Property and equipment
are stated at cost and revalued for effects of foreign currency
translation. Furniture and equipment are depreciated by the
straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the
assets, generally two to ten years. Leasehold improvements are
depreciated by the straight-line method over the lease term or
estimated useful live of the related asset, whichever is
shorter. Buildings are depreciated over fifty years, the
estimated useful life. Property and equipment sold or retired is
eliminated from the accounts in the year of disposition and the
resulting gain or loss is reflected in earnings. Goodwill and Intangible Assets Goodwill and
other acquisition related identifiable intangible assets are
stated at fair value as of the date acquired in a business
acquisition accounted for as a purchase, net of accumulated
amortization. Effective January1, 2002 the adoption of
SFASNo142, Goodwill and Other Intangible
Assets, required that the amortization of goodwill and
indefinite lived intangible assets be discontinued, and instead
be evaluated at least annually for impairment. Accordingly, we
discontinued amortizing goodwill and indefinite lived intangible
assets as of January1, 2002. We evaluate goodwill for
impairment on November30 of each year and at an interim
date if events or circumstances occur that would more likely
than not reduce the fair value of the goodwill below its
carrying amount. We evaluate the carrying value of goodwill and
other intangible assets against the estimated fair value of its
assets and will record an impairment charge in the amount by
which the carrying value of the assets exceed their estimated
fair value. Estimated fair value is determined based on
estimated discounted future cash flows or a market multiple
valuation method. There were no impairments recorded in 2004 and
2003. The following table presents changes in goodwill for 2004 and

52 Table of Contents RSA SECURITY INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES Notes to Consolidated Financial
StatementsContinued We utilized approximately $35,937 of acquisition related net
operating loss carryforwards in 2004. The applicable $12,578 tax
benefit reduced goodwill in 2004. The tax benefit from any
future utilization of the remaining acquisition related net
operating loss carryforwards will also reduce the carrying value
of goodwill and other intangible assets which arose from the
acquisitions that we completed in 2001. We had recorded a deferred tax liability for merger expenses of
$3,946 at December31, 2003. This represents the tax
benefit of an amount that was deducted for tax purposes in 2001
but was not deducted for financial statement purposes. The
deferred tax liability was eliminated in 2004 and the applicable
tax benefit reduced goodwill. We received $3,369 from escrow funds of prior acquisitions
during the year ended December31, 2003 in final settlement
of outstanding escrow fund claims, which resulted in a decrease
to goodwill of $3,369. Impairment of Long-Lived Assets Other Than
Goodwill We test long-lived assets for
recoverability whenever events or changes in circumstances
indicate that their carrying amount may not be recoverable. The
recoverability of long-lived assets is assessed by comparing the
undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated to the carrying
value of the assets. If the sum of the undiscounted cash flows
is less than the carrying value of the assets, an impairment
charge is recognized. The amount of an impairment charge is
determined by comparing the carrying amount of the long-lived
asset to its fair value. Fair value is determined based on
estimated discounted cash flows. Deferred Financing Costs Deferred financing
costs include investment bank fees, legal fees and other
financing costs paid in connection with the issuance of
convertible debentures and are included on the consolidated
balance sheets in other assets. Deferred financing costs were
amortized over the period the convertible debentures were
outstanding using the straight line method, which was not
materially different from the effective interest rate method.
All deferred financing costs were fully amortized as of
December31, 2004. Financial Instruments The carrying amounts of
cash and cash equivalents, marketable securities, accounts
receivable and accounts payable approximate fair value due to
the short-term nature of these instruments. Investments where our ownership is less than 20% and we do not
have significant influence on the operating or financial
decisions of the investee are accounted for using the cost
method. The carrying value of these investments is equal to cost
less investment valuation impairment charges. We regularly
consider available evidence in evaluating its investments for
potential impairment. Certain events, such as an initial public
offering, could result in the reclassification of an investment
to an available for sale marketable security. Research and Development Research and
development costs are expensed as incurred. Advertising Advertising costs are expensed as
incurred and were approximately $2,416, $869 and $2,950 in 2004,
2003 and 2002, respectively. Income Taxes Deferred income taxes are
recognized based on temporary differences between the financial
statement and tax bases of assets and liabilities. Deferred tax
assets and liabilities are measured using the statutory tax
rates and laws expected to apply to taxable income in the years
in which the temporary differences are expected to reverse.
Valuation allowances are provided against net deferred tax
assets if, based upon the available evidence, it is more likely
than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will not be
realized. The ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is
dependent upon the generation of future taxable income and the
timing of the temporary differences becoming deductible.
Management considers, among other available information,
scheduled reversals of deferred tax liabilities, projected
future taxable income, and other matters in making this
assessment. 53 Table of Contents RSA SECURITY INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES Notes to Consolidated Financial
StatementsContinued Income taxes are provided on undistributed earnings of foreign
subsidiaries where such earnings are expected to be remitted to
the U.S.parent company. We determine annually the amount
of unremitted earnings of foreign subsidiaries to invest
indefinitely in non-U.S.operations. Unrecognized
provisions for taxes on undistributed earnings of foreign
subsidiaries, which are considered permanently invested, are not
material to our consolidated financial position or results of
operations. Foreign Currency The financial statements of
our foreign subsidiary in Ireland are measured using the
U.S.dollar as its functional currency. The financial
statements of all other of our foreign branches and subsidiaries
are measured using the local currencies as the functional
currencies. In circumstances where the functional currency is
the local currency, assets and liabilities are translated to
their U.S.dollar equivalents at balance sheet date
exchange rates and revenue and expenses are translated from
functional currencies to U.S.dollar equivalents at average
exchange rates in effect during the year. Any gain or loss from
these translations are included in accumulated other
comprehensive income. Foreign currency transaction gains and
losses and transaction gains or losses arising from Ireland are
included in interest expense, income and other in the
consolidated statements of operations. Earnings Loss Per Share We compute basic
earnings loss per share using the weighted average number of
common shares outstanding. We compute diluted earnings per share
using the weighted average number of shares outstanding plus the
effect of potential outstanding shares, including options and
warrants, using the treasury stock method. Diluted
loss per share excludes the effect of equity instruments
including convertible debentures, options and warrants, as such
instruments are antidilutive. Common Stock Warrants Warrants to purchase
shares of our common stock are recorded at fair value. We
estimate the fair value of warrants using the Black-Scholes
model at the time of issuance. The fair value of the warrants
was amortized to expense over the expected life of the related
7%convertible debentures using the straight-line method,
which was not materially different than the effective interest
rate method. Treasury Stock Shares of our common stock
that are repurchased are recorded in treasury stock at cost and
included as a component of stockholders equity. We relieve
the costs associated with the reissuance of shares of common
stock out of treasury using the first-in, first-out method. Concentration of Credit Risk We provide
e-security solutions to various customers in diverse industries.
We perform ongoing credit evaluations of our customers and
maintain allowances for potential credit losses. We had two
significant customers who are distributors, whose aggregate
balances accounted for approximately 19% and 20% of total
accounts receivable as of December31, 2004 and
December31, 2003, respectively. Stock-Based Compensation Plans Stock-based
compensation cost is accounted for using the intrinsic value
method. Under this intrinsic value method, compensation expense,
if any, is recognized based on the difference between the fair
value of the underlying stock and the price of the option at the
measurement date. Measurement date is defined as that time when
both the number of shares and the exercise price become known.
The measurement date is generally the date the award is made. 54 Table of Contents RSA SECURITY INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES Notes to Consolidated Financial

We have determined that the gross unrealized losses on our
investment securities at December31, 2004 are temporary in
nature. We review our investments to identify and evaluate
investments that have indications of possible impairment.
Factors considered in determining whether a loss is temporary
include the length of time and extent to which fair value has
been less than the cost basis, the financial condition and
near-term prospects of the investee, and our intent and ability
to hold the investment for a period of time sufficient to allow
for any anticipated recovery in market value. All of our fixed
income securities are rated investment grade or better. As of
December31, 2004, 48 marketable securities held were in
gross unrealized loss positions. Our investments were as follows at

During 2002, we recognized investment impairment charges
totaling $21,866 related to its investments in privately held
companies. Included in total investment impairment charges in
2002 and as a result of our initiation of a process to sell our
equity investments we recorded an impairment charge of $11,966
to reflect the investments at their estimated realizable value,
less costs of disposal. Also during 2002, and included in total
investment impairment charges, we recorded an impairment charge
of $9,900 to reduce the carrying amount of three investments to
their estimated fair values. We considered offers to buy, recent
valuations and current financial positions of the investments in
estimating realizable value. Estimated realizable value of these
investments less costs of disposal was $1,400 and was included
in investments on the consolidated balance sheet at
December31, 2002. We completed the sale of these
investments during 2003 and recognized income of $1,542 from the
sale of investments. In November 2000, we transferred 2,636,916shares of
VeriSign, Inc. VeriSign common stock, which was
covered by three forward contracts Forwards and
one variable delivery forward VDF, to Crosby
Finance, LLC, of which we were, until December 2004, a 99%
member. Crosby was a bankruptcy-remote qualified special purpose
entity, established specifically to securitize the shares of
VeriSign common stock. We accounted for the contribution and the
transfer as a sale under SFASNo125,
Accounting for Transfers and Servicing of Financial Assets
and Extinguishments of Liabilities. Accordingly, we did
not consolidate Crosby for accounting purposes. Until December
2004, the counterparty to the VDF contract held the remaining 1%
interest in Crosby. At December31, 2003, Crosby held 2,027,325shares of
VeriSign common stock and the VDF contract. The VDF contract
entitled Crosby to receive cash proceeds of up to $35,336
depending on the market price of VeriSign common stock on
January3, 2006. The closing price of VeriSigns
common stock on The NASDAQ National Market on December31,
2003 was $1630per share. Unless the value of the VeriSign
stock were to appreciate to at least $8716per share in
January 2006, Crosby would not be entitled to any cash proceeds.
Crosby had no liability or obligation to its members or to the
counterparty to the VDF contract other than to deliver the
shares of VeriSign common stock to the counterparty upon
maturity of the VDF contract and to distribute the cash
proceeds, if any, to its members. After settlement of the VDF in
January 2006, Crosby would dissolve. The carrying amount of our 99% interest in Crosby was $208 at
December31, 2003, and was included in other assets on the
consolidated balance sheets. We accounted for our investment in
Crosby under the guidelines of EITF No96-12,
Recognition of Interest Income and Balance Sheet
Classification of Structured Notes. On December30, 2004, we sold our 99% interest in Crosby
Finance to Deutsche Bank AG for a purchase price of $20. 57 Table of Contents RSA SECURITY INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES Notes to Consolidated Financial

Convertible Debentures During October and November 2001, we issued 7%convertible
debentures with an aggregate principal amount of $80,000. In June 2004, a holder of a debenture with a principal amount of
$10,000 converted the full amount of this debenture into shares
of our common stock. These conversions resulted in the issuance
of an aggregate of 727,537shares of our common stock and
the cancellation of the holders debenture. We made no
principal payment in connection with the conversions. After
these conversions the remaining aggregate principal amount of
the 7%convertible debentures was $70,000. The remaining debentures were scheduled to mature on
October17, 2004, unless redeemed earlier by us or
converted into shares of our common stock at the holders
option. In October 2004, the remaining holders of our
outstanding 7%convertible debentures converted the full
amount of the debentures in several tranches over the course of
two weeks: $750 of the debentures were converted on
October5, 2004; $50,500 of the debentures were converted
on October13, 2004; and the remaining $18,750 of the
debentures were converted on October15, 2004. These
conversions resulted in the issuance of an aggregate of
5,092,760shares of our common stock and the cancellation
of all of our outstanding 7%convertible subordinated
debentures. We made no principal payment in connection with any
of the conversion. 58 Table of Contents RSA SECURITY INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES Notes to Consolidated Financial
StatementsContinued

Stockholders Equity Common Stock Warrants In connection with the
issuance of our 7%convertible debentures in October and
November 2001, we issued warrants to the convertible debenture
holders to purchase shares of our common stock. The holders may
exercise the warrants for an aggregate of 873,045shares of
our common stock at an exercise price of $13745per share.
The exercise price of the warrants may be adjusted under certain
circumstances, such as events that would cause dilution of the
holders interest. The warrants were immediately
exercisable upon issuance and expire on October17, 2006.
We recorded the fair market value of the warrants as additional
paid-in capital. As of December31, 2004, none of the
warrants have been exercised. Stockholder Rights Plan On July20,
1999, our Board of Directors adopted a Stockholder Rights Plan,
and a Rights Agreement to govern the Plan, under which common
stock purchase rights each, a Right were
distributed to our stockholders at the rate of one Right for
each share of our common stock. Each Right entitles the
stockholder that owns the Right to purchase one share of our
common stock at a purchase price of $8333per share,
subject to adjustment the Purchase Price. Our
stockholders may exercise the Rights 1if another party
acquires, or obtains the right to acquire, beneficial ownership
of 15% or more of our common stock, or 2upon the
commencement of a tender or exchange offer that, if consummated,
would result in another party acquiring 15% or more of our
common stock. In the event of such an acquisition or similar
event, each Right, other than those owned by the acquiring
party, will enable the stockholder that owns the Right to
purchase the number of shares of our common stock that equals
the Purchase Price divided by one-half of the current market
price as defined in the Rights Agreement of the common stock. In addition, if we are involved in a merger or other transaction
with another company in which we are not the surviving
corporation, or if we sell or transfer 50% or more of our assets
or earning power to another company, each Right will entitle the
stockholder that owns it to purchase the number of shares of
common stock of the acquiring company that equals the Purchase
Price divided by one-half of the current market price of the
acquiring companys common stock. We are generally entitled
to redeem the Rights at $0001per Right at any time until
the tenth business day after the later of 1a public
announcement that an acquiring party has acquired, or obtained
the right to acquire, 15% or more of our common stock or
2the actual knowledge by any of our executive officers
of such an acquisition. Unless the Rights are redeemed or
exchanged earlier, they will expire on July20, 2009. Share Repurchase Program We have maintained a
common stock repurchase program since September 2004. Under the
current program, we are authorized to repurchase up to
6,700,000shares of our common stock through
December31, 2005. We may make repurchases in the open
market or through negotiated transactions from time to time
depending on market conditions. We use repurchased shares for
stock option and employee stock purchase plans, and for general
corporate purposes. Since the repurchase program was authorized,
we have repurchased an aggregate of 50,000shares for $911.

Stock Option and Purchase Plans Our 1994 Stock Option Plan, as amended 1998
Restatement, as amended 1994 Plan, allowed us to
grant to our employees, officers, directors and consultants
options to purchase common stock intended to qualify as
incentive stock options, options that do not qualify as
incentive stock options non-statutory options, restricted
stock awards and other stock-based awards. In 2004, the 1994
Plan expired in accordance with its terms, except with respect
to awards already granted, and we no longer grant awards under
this plan. Our Amended and Restated 1998 Non-Officer Employee Stock
Incentive Plan, as amended 1998 Plan, allows us to
grant non-statutory stock options, restricted stock awards, and
other stock-based awards to our employees, consultants and
advisors, other than those who are also officers within the
meaning of Section16 of the Securities Exchange Act of
1934, as amended. In general, stock options granted under the
1998 Plan become exercisable as to 25% of the shares subject to
each option on the first anniversary of the 59 Table of Contents RSA SECURITY INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES Notes to Consolidated Financial
StatementsContinued grant date and in equal quarterly installments thereafter for
three years. In general, no installment is exercisable after the
fourth anniversary of the date on which such installment first
becomes exercisable, and options generally expire eight years
from the grant date. At December31, 2004, there were
21,062,764shares authorized and 5,417,618shares
available for grant under the 1998 Plan. A summary of stock option activity under all plans follows

Tax benefits arising from the exercise of stock options were
$9,552, $5,485 and $328 in 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively.
The tax benefits are allocated directly to additional paid-in
capital in stockholders equity when realized. Cash payments for income taxes were approximately $3,238, $1,749
and $1,791 in 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively. As of December31, 2004, we have net operating loss
carryforwards for federal tax purposes of approximately $54,784.
If not utilized, these carryforwards will expire in calendar
years 2017 through 2023. Approximately $36,720 of these
carryforwards relates to acquisitions that we completed during
2001. We generated the remainder of the net operating loss
carryforwards in 2003. These carryforwards include amounts
attributable to the exercise of employee stock options which
were deducted for tax purposes. The loss carryforwards from
acquired companies can be utilized to offset future taxable
income, but are subject to 62 Table of Contents RSA SECURITY INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES Notes to Consolidated Financial
StatementsContinued certain annual limitations under Section382 of the
Internal Revenue Code. Furthermore, pre- acquisition net
operating losses may not be utilizable in future years in the
event of a substantial discontinuation of the acquired business. We perform an annual assessment of the realization of our
deferred tax assets considering all of the available evidence,
both positive and negative. We then record a valuation allowance
against the deferred tax assets which we believe, based on the
weight of available evidence, will more than likely not be
realized. We assessed the realization of our deferred tax assets
at the end of 2004. We concluded that due to historical and
forecasted tax losses, which are primarily attributable to tax
deductions for employee stock options and to restructuring costs
accrued in prior years, we could not meet the more likely than
not standard required by SFASNo109. Accordingly, we
recorded a valuation allowance of $10,813 against our deferred
tax assets in 2004. Approximately $5,688 of the valuation
allowances are allocable to continuing operations and impacted
our effective tax rate for the year. The remaining $5,125 of
valuation allowances reflect the impact of employee stock
options and are allocable directly to shareholders equity. In total, the valuation allowance on deferred tax assets
decreased by $1,765 in 2004. The net decrease is attributable to
ian increase of $10,813 recorded against deferred tax
assets that we believe will more than likely not be realized,
and iia decrease of $12,578 which represents the tax
benefit of the utilization of approximately $35,937 of
acquisition net operating loss carryforwards in 2004. The
$12,578 tax benefit reduced goodwill in 2004. The tax benefit
from any future utilization of the remaining acquisition net
operating loss carryforwards will also reduce the carrying value
of the goodwill and other intangible assets which arose from the
acquisitions that we completed in 2001. We are currently under audit by the United States Internal
Revenue Service the IRS for the years 1996 through 2002. The
audit was substantially complete at December31, 2004. We
expect to receive a cash refund within the next fifteen months
as a result of the IRS audit. The impact of this refund has not
been reflected in the financial statements as, although
substantially complete, the IRS has not yet issued a final audit
report. The impact of the refund will be reflected in the
financial statements in the quarter in which the final audit
report is issued. We are required to reserve for certain loss contingencies
relating to, among other things, income taxes. We reserve for
these items in accordance with SFASNo5,
Accounting for Contingencies. In the ordinary course
of global business there are many transactions and calculations
where the ultimate tax outcome is uncertain. As a result we are,
from time to time, subjected to various US, international and
state tax audits. Accordingly, we reserve for potential tax
liabilities due in these various jurisdictions. We review these
tax reserves annually. In connection with our review of the tax
reserves for 2004, we determined that the amount of reserves
required for tax exposures was less than the amount recorded in
the financial statements. As a result, we reduced the tax
reserves by $7,400 in 2004. 63 Table of Contents RSA SECURITY INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES Notes to Consolidated Financial

During the year ended December31, 2002, we recorded total
restructuring charges of $56,036, consisting of facility exit
costs, costs associated with the liquidation of our Swedish
development operations and the sale of certain Swedish assets
and the business related to the asset to TFS Technology AB
TFS, and severance and other costs associated with
the reduction of employee headcount. The 2002 restructuring
charges include costs of $37,656 incurred due to the revision of
previously recorded restructuring charges. Included in the 2002 restructuring charges were new charges of
$8,296 consisting of facility exit costs and related impairment
of leasehold improvements and furniture and fixtures. Facility
exit costs consist of estimated shortfalls of sublease rental
income compared to obligations due under certain exited
facilities leases which are payable through 2009. Impairment of leasehold improvements and furniture and fixtures
included in facility exit costs are for unamortized leasehold
improvements and furniture and fixtures that we believe will not
be recoverable upon sublease of exited facilities. Total
facility exit costs for 2002 include costs of $35,718 that we
incurred when it revised estimates used in previously recorded
restructuring charges. We revised the estimates included in
facility exit costs due to the extension of the period of time
estimated to obtain sublease tenants for certain exited
facilities, based on the terms of finalized subleases obtained
during 2002, due to higher than anticipated 64 Table of Contents RSA SECURITY INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES Notes to Consolidated Financial
StatementsContinued operating costs associated with certain exited facilities, and
due to the continued uncertainty and deterioration in the
commercial real estate and sublet markets in the Boston
metropolitan area. We recorded total restructuring charges of $6,318 during 2002
associated with the liquidation of our Swedish development
operations and the sale of certain Swedish assets and the
business related to the assets to TFS. We sold these assets and
related business to TFS in exchange in part for TFSs
assumption of the liabilities related to the assets and
associated business, including the related support obligations
and certain employees. The total number of employees included in
this transaction was 76, of which 67 were employed in research
and development and 9 were employed in general and
administrative functions. The total Sweden liquidation costs
include costs of $1,938 we incurred upon revision of estimates
used in previously recorded restructuring charges. Also included in restructuring charges for 2002 are severance
and other costs associated with the reduction of employee
headcount of $5,704 for 121 employees, of which 15 were employed
in manufacturing, customer operations and technical services, 37
were employed in research and development, 48 were employed in
sales and marketing, and 21 employed in general and
administrative functions. During 2003 we revised estimates used in previously recorded
restructuring charges. These revisions resulted in no net change
to our restructuring liability at December31, 2003. We
revised estimates of facility exit costs based upon the terms of
finalized subleases obtained during 2003. These revised
estimates of facility exit costs resulted in a net increase to
facility exit costs of $774 at December31, 2003. In
addition, we reduced our severance restructuring reserve by $566
at December31, 2003 when we determined our remaining
severance and other outplacement costs were lower than
originally estimated. We also reduced our restructuring reserve
of costs associated with the liquidation of our Swedish
development operations and the sale of certain Swedish assets by
$208 at December31, 2003 when we determined we had no
legal and consulting costs remaining in connection with this
transaction. In 1999, we commenced and substantially completed consolidation
of certain operations in order to enhance operational
efficiency. We recorded facility exit costs consisting primarily
of estimated shortfalls of sublease rental income compared to
minimum lease payments due under a lease agreement. During the
year ended December31, 2003 we revised our estimates of
these facility exit costs and reduced the reserve for these
facility exit costs to zero. We continue to monitor and assess our facility obligations, real
estate markets and our operating expenses, including those
recorded prior to 2002. As a result of these ongoing
assessments, during 2004 we recorded a charge of $1,601 related
to revised estimates of facility exit costs. We revised this
estimate of facility exit costs based upon the terms of
finalized subleases and associated costs obtained during the
second quarter of 2004. We also reduced our restructuring
reserve by $819 at December31, 2004 when we determined our
remaining severance and operating costs were lower than
originally estimated. We expect to pay the remaining restructuring costs accrued at
December31, 2004 as follows

authenticators, RSA Authentication Manager software, RSA
Certificate Manager software, RSA ClearTrust software, and
maintenance and professional services associated with these
products. Developer solutions include sales of RSA BSAFE
encryption software and protocol products, RSA Certificate
Manager components, and maintenance and professional services
associated with these products. The segment was determined
primarily based on how management views and evaluates our
operations. Our operations are conducted throughout the world. Operations in
the United States represent more than 56% of total revenue. Our
operations in other countries have been grouped by regional area

for the years ended 2004 and 2003. Revenue from Tech Data
Corporation accounted for 11% of our total revenue for the year
ended December31, 2004. During 2003, Tech Data Corporation
merged with Azlan Group Plc also a distributor. Had this
merger been completed as of January1, 2003, revenue from
the combined entity, on a pro forma basis, would have accounted

Retirement and Savings Plan We have a 401k retirement and savings plan that allows each
participant to defer up to 20% of the participants annual
earnings up to an annual statutory maximum amount. We may make,
at our discretion, matching and profit-sharing contributions to
the plan. Generally, matching and profit-sharing contributions
that we make vest annually over four years. Matching
contributions are paid in cash and were $1,602, $1,412, and
$1,360 in 2004, 2003, and 2002, respectively. No profit sharing
contributions were made for 2004, 2003 and 2002. We also have a non-qualified deferred compensation program that
permits key employees to annually elect to defer, for their
personal income tax purposes, a portion of their compensation
for not less than three years or until their retirement,
termination, death or disability. To assist in the financing of
the funding of the deferred compensation program, we invest the
compensation that is withheld and deferred in Company-owned life
insurance policies. Amounts withheld and deferred for key
employees under our deferred compensation program were $1,085 545, and $868 in 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively, and are
included in operating expenses. A non recurring expense of
$1,190 for fees and losses on investment income related to a
deferred compensation plan is included in our general and
administrative expenses in 2004. The plan which was implemented
in 2000 has been significantly restructured to reduce the
investment management fees.

Litigation On or about February2, 2001, Leon Stambler filed a
complaint for patent infringement in U.S.District Court
for the District of Delaware against RSA Security, VeriSign,
Inc., First Data Corporation, Openwave Systems Inc., and Omnisky
Corporation, Case Number 01-0065. In his complaint,
Mr.Stambler alleged that certain products marketed by each
of the defendants infringed various patents that he owns, and he
sought unspecified damages as well as a preliminary and
permanent injunction enjoining the defendants from infringing
the claims asserted. The trial took place in March 2003, and the
jury determined that our products did not infringe
Mr.Stamblers patents. On April17, 2003,
the court entered final judgment in our favor on all claims of
non-infringement. On or about December8, 2003,
Mr.Stambler filed a notice of appeal to the United States
Court of Appeals. On December7, 2004, we and
Mr.Stambler presented our arguments to the Court of
Appeals, and on or about February11, 2005, the court
issued a ruling affirming the lower courts ruling in our
favor. On or about April15, 2004, Ursus, Inc., a former reseller
of our products, filed a complaint against us in
U.S.District Court for the Eastern District of
Pennsylvania, alleging that we had violated the
U.S.Clayton Act, tortiously interfered with Ursus
contractual relationships and disseminated false and defamatory
statements about Ursus. In November 2004, we signed a settlement
agreement with Ursus, pursuant to which Ursus agreed to dismiss
its complaint with prejudice. From time to time, we have been named as a defendant in other
legal actions arising from our normal business activities, which
we believe will not have a material adverse effect on us or our
business. 68 Table of Contents

CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES Disclosure Controls and Procedures. Our management, with
the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief
Financial Officer, evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure
controls and procedures as defined in the SEC rules promulgated
under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended as of
December31, 2004. Based on this evaluation, our CEO and
CFO concluded that, as of December31, 2004, our disclosure
controls and procedures were 1designed to ensure that
material information relating to RSA Security, including its
consolidated subsidiaries, is made known to our CEO and CFO by
others within RSA Security, particularly during the period in
which this Report was being prepared, and 2effective, in
that they provide reasonable assurance that information that we
are required to disclose in the reports we file under the
Securities Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and
reported within the time periods specified in the SECs
rules and forms. Managements Report on Internal Control Over Financial
Reporting and Attestation of Registered Public Accounting
Firm. The report of our management regarding internal
control over financial reporting and the attestation report of
our registered public accounting firm are included in
Item8 of this Annual Report on Form10-K starting on
page43. Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. No
change in our internal control over financial reporting as
defined in the SEC rules promulgated under the Securities
Exchange Act occurred during the quarter ended
December31, 2004 that has materially affected, or is
reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control
over financial reporting. PARTIII
