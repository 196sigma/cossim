Our audits also included the financial statement schedule listed in the Index at . These financial statements and the financial statement schedule are the responsibility of the Company management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the financial statements and the financial statement schedule based on our audits.We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board United States. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.In our opinion, such consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Century Aluminum Company and subsidiaries as of December 31, 2014 and 2013, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2014, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Also, in our opinion, such financial statement schedule, when considered in relation to the basic consolidated financial statements taken as a whole, presents fairly, in all material respects, the information set forth therein.We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board United States, the Company internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2014, based on the criteria established in Internal Control -Integrated Framework 2013 issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission and our report dated March2, 2015expressed an unqualified opinion on the Company internal control over financial reporting. /s/ Deloitte Touche LLPPittsburgh, PennsylvaniaMarch2, 201545REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRMTo the Board of Directors and Shareholders of Century Aluminum Company:We have audited the internal control over financial reporting of Century Aluminum Company and subsidiaries the Company as of December 31, 2014, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework 2013issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. As described in Item 9A, Internal Control over Financial Reporting, management excluded from its assessment the internal control over financial reporting at the Mt. Holly aluminum smelter, which was acquired on December 1, 2014, and whose financial statements constitute 104% of total assets and 13% of revenues of the consolidated financial statement amounts as of and for the year ended December 31, 2014. Accordingly, our audit did not include the internal control over financial reporting at the Mt. Holly aluminum smelter. The Company management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Item 9A, Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Companys internal control over financial reporting based on our audit.We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board United States. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.A companys internal control over financial reporting is a process designed by, or under the supervision of, the companys principal executive and principal financial officers, or persons performing similar functions, and effected by the companys board of directors, management, and other personnel to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A companys internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that 1 pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; 2 provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and 3 provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the companys assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.Because of the inherent limitations of internal control over financial reporting, including the possibility of collusion or improper management override of controls, material misstatements due to error or fraud may not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. Also, projections of any evaluation of the effectiveness of the internal control over financial reporting to future periods are subject to the risk that the controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.In our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2014, based on the criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework 2013 issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission.We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board United States, the consolidated financial statements and the financial statement schedule as of and for the year ended December 31, 2014 of the Company and our reportdatedMarch2, 2015expressed an unqualified opinion on those financial statements and the financial statement schedule. /s/ Deloitte Touche LLPPittsburgh, PennsylvaniaMarch2, 201546CENTURY ALUMINUM COMPANYCONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF OPERATIONSin thousands, except per share amountsYear Ended December 31,201420132012NET SALES:Third-party   of goods   operating expense net12,4818,60218,253Selling, general and administrative  income   income 301728554Net gain loss on forward and derivative contracts17916,5984,150Gain on bargain purchase5,253Gain on fair value of contingent consideration7,943Gain on remeasurement of equity investment1,318Loss on early extinguishment of debt3,272Other income net9914965,576Income loss before income taxes and equity in earnings of joint  tax  loss before equity in earnings of joint  in earnings of joint ventures1,3052,6622,623Net income  LOSS PER COMMON  notes to consolidated financial statements47CENTURY ALUMINUM COMPANYCONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF COMPREHENSIVE INCOME LOSSin thousandsYear Ended December 31,201420132012Comprehensive income loss:Net income  comprehensive income loss before income tax effect:Net unrealized loss on financial instruments218Net loss reclassified to income on financial instruments567Net gain on foreign currency cash flow hedges reclassified as income186186186Defined benefit plans and other postretirement benefits:Net gain loss arising during the  service cost arising during the period1,299Amortization of prior service benefit during the  of net loss during the period10,3128,1749,837Change in equity in investee other comprehensive income614,236Other comprehensive income loss before income tax  tax  comprehensive income  comprehensive income  notes to consolidated financial statements48CENTURY ALUMINUM COMPANYCONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETSin thousands, except share amountsDecember 31,20142013ASSETSCash and cash  cash8011,697Accounts receivable net76,16556,184Due from  and other current assets29,76832,276Deferred taxes14,28113,614Total current assets599,240471,061Property, plant and equipment net1,291,2181,247,661Other  AND SHAREHOLDERS EQUITYLIABILITIES:Accounts payable, trade$151,443$108,490Due to affiliates22,26153,582Accrued and other current  employee benefits costs10,1598,410Industrial revenue bonds7,8157,815Total current  notes payable246,888246,528Accrued pension benefits costs less current portion59,90639,848Accrued postretirement benefits costs less current portion152,894129,284Other  taxes113,604106,218Total noncurrent  AND CONTINGENCIES NOTE 15SHAREHOLDERS EQUITY:Series A Preferred stock one cent par value, 5,000,000 shares authorized;

Summary of significant accounting policiesOrganization and Basis of Presentation Century Aluminum Company Century Aluminum, Century, the Company, we, us, our or ours is a holding company, whose principal subsidiaries are Century Kentucky, Inc. together with its subsidiaries, CAKY, Nordural ehf Nordural, Century Aluminum Sebree LLC Century Sebree, Century Aluminum of South Carolina CASC, and Century Aluminum of West Virginia, Inc. Century of West Virginia.Century Kentucky, Inc. operates a primary aluminum reduction facility in Hawesville, Kentucky Hawesville.Nordural Grundartangi ehf, a subsidiary of Nordural, operates a primary aluminum reduction facility in Grundartangi, Iceland Grundartangi.Century Sebree operates a primary aluminum reduction facility in Robards, Kentucky Sebree. Century of West Virginia owns a primary aluminum reduction facility in Ravenswood, West Virginia Ravenswood.CASC operates a primary aluminum reduction facility in Mt. Holly, South Carolina Mt. Holly. We are constructing a primary aluminum facility in Helguvik, Iceland Helguvik or the Helguvik project which is owned and would be operated through Nordural Helguvik ehf, a subsidiary of Nordural. Mt. Holly was operated as a joint venture between us and Alumax of South Carolina Inc. Alumax of SC until our wholly-owned subsidiary, Berkeley Aluminum, Inc. Berkeley, acquired Alumax of SC in December 2014. See Note 2 Business acquisitionsfor additional information about the Acquisition. Prior to the acquisition, Berkeley held a 497%interest in the partnership which operated Mt. Holly and a 497%undivided interest in the property, plant, and equipment comprising Mt. Holly.The remaining interest in the partnership and the remaining undivided interest in Mt. Holly property, plant and equipment were owned by Alumax of SC.Alcoa managed and operated Mt. Holly pursuant to an Owners Agreement. Pursuant to the Owners Agreement, each owner furnished their own alumina, for conversion to aluminum, and was responsible for their pro rata share of the operating and conversion costs. In 2013, Century Sebree, acquired Sebree from a subsidiary of Rio Tinto Alcan, Inc. RTA.In 2012, our wholly owned subsidiary, Century Aluminum Vlissingen B.V. Century Vlissingen purchased a carbon anode production facility located in Vlissingen, the Netherlands Vlissingen. Vlissingen restarted operations in late 2013 and supplies carbon anodes to Grundartangi.We also own a 40%stake in Baise Haohai Carbon Co., Ltd. BHH, a joint venture that owns and operates a carbon anode and cathode facility located in the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region of south China.BHH supplies anodes to Grundartangi.Prior to our initial public offering, we were an indirect, wholly-owned subsidiary of Glencore plc together with its subsidiaries, Glencore.At December 31, 2014, based on their filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, Glencore owned 418%of Centurys outstanding common stock and all of our outstanding Series A Convertible Preferred stock. Through its ownership of our common and preferred stock, Glencore has an overall 465%economic ownership of Century.Century and Glencore enter into various transactions such as the purchase and sale of primary aluminum, purchase and sale of alumina, tolling agreements and certain forward financial contracts.Principles of Consolidation The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Century Aluminum Company and our subsidiaries, after elimination of all intercompany transactions and accounts. Our interest in the BHH joint venture are accounted for under the equity method. For BHH, we report our investment in its results of operations on a one-quarter lag. Reclassification Certain immaterial amounts reported in previous years have been reclassified to conform to the current period presentation.Revenue recognition Revenue is recognized when title and risk of loss pass to customers in accordance with contract terms.In some instances, we invoice our customers prior to physical shipment of goods.In such instances, revenue is recognized only when the customer has specifically requested such treatment and has made a commitment to purchase the product.The goods must be complete, ready for shipment and physically separated from other inventory with risk of ownership passing to the customer.We must retain no performance obligations53CENTURY ALUMINUM COMPANYNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS ContinuedCash and Cash Equivalents Cash and cash equivalents are comprised of cash, money market funds and short-term investments having original maturities of three months or less. The carrying amount of cash equivalents approximates fair value.Accounts Receivable The accounts receivable are net of an allowance for uncollectible accounts of $1,000and $734at December 31, 2014and 2013, respectively.Inventories Our inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market LCM, using the first-in, first-out FIFO method. Property, Plant and Equipment Property, plant and equipment is stated at cost.Additions, renewals and improvements are capitalized.Asset and accumulated depreciation accounts are relieved for dispositions with resulting gains or losses included in other income net.Maintenance and repairs are expensed as incurred.We capitalize interest for the construction of qualifying assets.Depreciation of plant and equipment is provided for by the straight-line method over the following estimated useful lives:Building and improvements10to 45yearsMachinery and equipment 5to 35yearsImpairment of long-lived assets We review our property, plant and equipment for potential impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of these assets asset group may not be recoverable.The carrying amount of the assets asset group is not recoverable if it exceeds the sum of the undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual disposition of the assets asset group. In that case, an impairment loss would be recognized for the amount in which the carrying amount exceeds the fair value of the assets asset group, with the fair value determined using the anticipated cash flows discounted at a rate commensurate with the risk involved. We estimate the future cash flows using managements assumptions about the expected future use of the assets asset group, the remaining useful life, expenditures to maintain the service potential, market and other cost assumptions.Determination as to whether and how much an asset is impaired involves significant management judgment involving highly uncertain matters, including estimating the future sales volumes, future selling prices and cost, alternative uses for the asset, and estimated proceeds from the disposal of the asset.However, the impairment reviews and calculations are based on estimates and assumptions that take into account our business plans and long-term investment decisions at the time of such impairment reviews. We did not recognize any impairment losses on our long-lived fixed assets during 2014, 2013or 2012.Business Acquisitions We account for business acquisitions by applying the acquisition method in accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board FASB Accounting Standards Codification ASC 805 Business Combinations. We allocate the purchase price to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair values on the date of the acquisition. The difference between the fair value of the net assets acquired and the purchase price is recorded as either goodwill or a bargain purchase gain. We record the operating results of our acquired businesses in our consolidated statements of operations from the date of acquisition.  Other Assets Other assets consist primarily of Centurys investments in joint ventures, deferred financing costs, assets held in a Rabbi trust to fund the non-qualified supplemental executive retirement benefits SERB pension benefit obligation, prepaid power costs, internal use software and operating maintenance supplies not expected to be consumed within the year. Our equity share of the undistributed earnings loss increases decreases the investment in the joint ventures.Deferred financing costs are amortized on a straight-line basis over the life of the related financial instrument.Prior to the Acquisition, we accounted for our interest in the Mt. Holly partnership using the equity method of accounting.Additionally, our undivided interest in certain property, plant and equipment of Mt. Holly was held outside of the partnership and the undivided interest in these assets of the facility was accounted for in accordance with the ASC 810-10-45-14 Investor Balance Sheet and Income Statement Display under the Equity Method for Investments in Certain Partnerships and Other Ventures.Accordingly, prior to the Acquisition, the undivided interest in these assets and the related depreciation were accounted for on a proportionate gross basis.Income Taxes We account for income taxes using the asset and liability method, whereby deferred income taxes reflect the net tax effect of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for income tax purposes.In evaluating our ability to realize deferred tax assets, we use judgment in considering the relative impact of negative and positive evidence. The weight given to the potential effect of negative and positive evidence is commensurate with the extent to which it can be objectively verified.Based on the weight of 54CENTURY ALUMINUM COMPANYNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Continuedevidence, both negative and positive, if it is more likely than not that some portion or all of a deferred tax asset will not be realized, a valuation allowance is established.Accordingly, we have a valuation allowance against all of our net federal and state deferred tax assets.We have a valuation allowance against a portion of our Icelandic and all of our Hong Kong and the Netherlands net operating loss NOL deferred tax assets due to our belief that it is more likely than not that these assets will not be realized.During 2012, we removed our election to permanently reinvest foreign earnings. See Note 14 Income taxesfor additional information.Defined Benefit Pension and Other Postretirement Benefits We sponsor defined benefit pension and other postretirement benefit OPEB plans for certain of our domestic hourly and salaried employees. We recognize expenses, assets and liabilities based on actuarial assumptions. We contribute to our defined benefit pension plans based upon actuarial and economic assumptions designed to achieve adequate funding of the projected benefit obligations and to meet the minimum funding requirements. In addition, we maintain the SERB plan for certain current and former executive officers.We account for these plans in accordance with ASC 715 Compensation Retirement Benefits. We use a measurement date of December 31stto determine the pension and OPEB liabilities.Postemployment Benefits We provide certain postemployment benefits to certain former and inactive employees and their dependents during the period following employment, but before retirement. These benefits include salary continuance, supplemental unemployment and disability healthcare.We recognize the estimated future cost of providing postemployment benefits on an accrual basis over the active service life of the employee.Derivatives and hedging We enter into fixed and market priced contracts for the sale of primary aluminum and the purchase of raw materials in future periods.We also enter into fixed price financial sales contracts and put option contracts to manage our exposure to changing primary aluminum prices.Certain physical delivery and financial sales contracts for primary aluminum that are not designated cash flow hedges or do not qualify for cash flow hedge treatment are marked-to-market quarterly.Fluctuations in the London Metal Exchange LME price of primary aluminum may have a significant impact on gains and losses included in our financial statements from period to period.We recognize the unrealized and realized gains and losses associated with these contracts in net gain loss on forward and derivative contracts.See Note 4 Fair value measurementsand Note 5 Derivatives and hedging instrumentsfor additional information about these contracts.Foreign Currency We are exposed to foreign currency risk due to fluctuations in the value of the U.S. dollar as compared to the euro, the Icelandic krona ISK and the Chinese yuan.Grundartangi and Vlissingen use the U.S. dollar as their functional currency, however a portion of the operating expenses of their respective facilities are denominated and payable in currencies other than the U.S. dollar.Grundartangis labor costs, part of its maintenance costs and other local services are denominated in ISK and a portion of its anode costs are denominated in euros.Labor costs, maintenance costs and other local services at Vlissingen are denominated in euros. Transactions denominated in currencies other than the functional currency are recorded based on exchange rates at the time such transactions arise and any transaction gains and losses are reflected in other income netin the consolidated statements of operations. As a result, an increase or decrease in the value of those currencies relative to the U.S. dollar would affect Grundartangis and Vlissingen operating margins.In addition, our joint venture investment in BHH uses the Chinese yuan as its functional currency.For our joint venture investments, we record gains and losses associated with foreign currency exchange rates in equity in earnings of joint ventures.Financial Instruments Our receivables, certain life insurance policies, payables, borrowings under our revolving credit facilities and debt related to industrial revenue bonds IRBs are carried at amounts that approximate fair value.The following table provides the carrying amounts and approximate fair values based on the last available trading data of our 75%senior secured notes due 2021 the 75%Notes due 2021 and our 75%senior unsecured notes due 2014 the 75%Notes due 2014. See Note 4 Fair value measurementsfor additional information about these financial instruments.December31, 2014December31, 2013Carrying amountFair valueCarrying amountFair value75% Notes due  Notes due 20142,6032,48755CENTURY ALUMINUM COMPANYNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS ContinuedEarnings per share Basic earnings loss per share EPS amounts are calculated by dividing earnings loss available to common stockholders by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding.Diluted EPS amounts assume the issuance of common stock for all potentially dilutive common shares outstanding.Our Series A Convertible Preferred Stock has similar characteristics to a participating security as described by ASC 260 Earnings per Share and we calculate the amount of net income loss allocated to common stockholders and basic EPS using the Two-Class Method earnings allocation formula, allocating undistributed income to our preferred shareholder consistent with their participation rights, and diluted EPS using the If-Converted Method when applicable.Our Series A Convertible Preferred Stock is a non-cumulative perpetual participating convertible preferred stock with no set dividend preferences. The holders of our convertible preferred stock do not have a contractual obligation to share in our losses. In periods where we report net losses, we do not allocate these losses to the convertible preferred stock for the computation of basic or diluted EPS.Asset Retirement Obligations We are subject to environmental regulations which create certain legal obligations related to the normal operations of our domestic primary aluminum smelter operations. Our asset retirement obligations AROs consist primarily of costs associated with the disposal of spent pot liner used in the reduction cells of our domestic facilities. AROs are recorded on a discounted basis, at the time the obligation is incurred when the pot liner is put in service and accreted over time for the change in the present value of the liability. We capitalize the asset retirement costs by increasing the carrying amount of the related long-lived assets and depreciating these assets over their remaining useful lives. Certain conditional asset retirement obligations CAROs related to the disposal costs of fixed assets at our primary aluminum facilities have not been recorded because they have an indeterminate settlement date.CAROs are a legal obligation to perform an asset retirement activity in which the timing and or method of settlement are conditional on a future event that may or may not be within our control. We would recognize a CARO in the period in which sufficient information exists to reasonably estimate the fair value of the liability. These CAROs relate to the remediation of our primary aluminum facilities for certain regulated assets and hazardous material, such as landfills and asbestos and various other materials.Concentrations of Credit Risk Financial instruments, which potentially expose us to concentrations of credit risk, consist principally of trade receivables.Our limited customer base increases our concentrations of credit risk with respect to trade receivables. We routinely assess the financial strength of our customers and collectability of our trade receivables.Use of Estimates The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.Share-Based Compensation We measure the cost of employee services received in exchange for an award of equity instruments based on the grant-date fair value of the award. We recognize the cost over the period during which an employee is required to provide service in exchange for the awardthe requisite service period usually the vesting period. No compensation cost is recognized for equity instruments for which employees do not render the requisite service.The grant-date fair value of service-based share awards is equal to the closing stock price on the date of the grant. Stock option grant-date fair value is estimated using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model adjusted for the unique characteristics of those instruments. We have not issued any stock options since 2009. If an equity award is modified after the grant date, incremental compensation cost will be recognized in an amount equal to the excess of the fair value of the modified award over the fair value of the original award immediately before the modification. We issue shares to satisfy the requirements of our share-based compensation plans. At this time, we do not plan to issue treasury shares to support our share-based compensation plans, but we may in the future.We award performance units to certain officers and employees. The performance units may be settled in cash or common stock at the discretion of the Board. These awards have historically been settled in cash, and we expect that to continue.Recently Issued Accounting Standards We evaluate the impact of FASB Accounting Standards Updates ASUs issued.When the adoption or planned adoption of recently issued ASUs will potentially have a material impact on our consolidated financial position, results of operations and cash flows, we disclose the quantitative and qualitative effects of the adoption in our consolidated financial statements. 56CENTURY ALUMINUM COMPANYNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS ContinuedIn May 2014, the FASB and International Accounting Standards Board IASB issued their final standard on revenue from contracts with customers. The standard, issued as ASU 2014-09 Revenue From Contracts with Customers by the FASB, outlines a single comprehensive model for entities to use in accounting for revenue arising from contracts with customers and supersedes most current revenue recognition guidance, including industry-specific guidance. Compared with current GAAP, the ASU requires significantly expanded disclosures about revenue recognition. The ASU is effective for Century for our fiscal year 2017 and thereafter. Early adoption is not permitted. We are currently evaluating the impact of adoption on our consolidated financial position, results of operations and cash flows. 2. Business acquisitionsAcquisition of Mt. Holly aluminum smelterOn October 23, 2014, Berkeley entered into a stock purchase agreement the Stock Purchase Agreement with Alumax Inc. Alumax, a wholly owned subsidiary of Alcoa, to acquire Alcoas 503%stake in Mt. Holly. Upon closing of the transaction on December 1, 2014, Century owns 100%of Mt. Holly. Mt. Holly, located in Goose Creek, South Carolina, employs approximately 600people and has an annual production capacity of 231,000tonnes of primary aluminum. Pursuant to the terms of the Stock Purchase Agreement, Berkeley agreed to acquire all of the issued and outstanding shares of capital stock of Alumax of SC for $67,500in cash less certain amounts owed by Alumax to Mt. Holly and subject to working capital and other similar adjustments, of which we have paid approximately $53,831as of December 31, 2014. The acquisition was funded with available cash on hand. We incurred $1,087of acquisition-related costs during 2014. All acquisition-related costs were expensed to selling, general and administrative expenses during 2014. Pension funding obligationsAlcoa spun-off the pension plan assets for the Mt. Holly employees and former employees into a qualified defined benefit pension plan established by Century. The new Mt. Holly pension plan benefit obligations were measured based on termination basis under IRS Code Section 414l. The Mt. Holly pension plan was fully funded using the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation PBGC assumptions, which are more conservative than the assumptions we use to measure our defined benefit obligations, and resulted in the recognition of a pension asset at closing. Contingent Consideration - Earn-out provisionThe Stock Purchase Agreement provides for a post-closing cash payment to be made following December 31, 2015 based on i changes in the Midwest Transaction Price for aluminum between July 2, 2014 and December 31, 2015 and ii the aggregate cast house production of Mt. Holly from October 1, 2014 through December 31, 2015. The maximum amount of this post-closing cash payment by i CASC to Alumax is $22,500and ii Alumax to CASC is $12,500. We measured the fair value of the contingent consideration and recognized a $13,780liability at December 1, 2014. Each period, until the end of the measurement period on December 31, 2015, we will remeasure the fair value of the contingent consideration. Any changes in the fair value will be recognized in earnings. In December 2014, we recognized $7,943in gain on fair value of contingent consideration, primarily related to decreases in the forward curve of the LME price of primary aluminum.Step AcquisitionIn accordance with ASC 805, we accounted for this transaction as a step acquisition which required that we remeasure our existing 497%ownership interest previously accounted for as an equity method investment to fair value.

Holly acquisitionAs part of the acquisition, we recognized two transactions as separate and apart from the business combination with Mt. Holly. The Mt. Holly smelter tolled alumina for its partners and so had no alumina supply of its own. Upon the purchase, we negotiated with Alcoa to purchase alumina under two separate alumina supply agreements. We believe the price paid under these agreements was equivalent to a market rate that would be paid by a market participant. Contract prices were based on published alumina price indexes. In addition, we had a pre-existing relationship with Alcoa prior to the acquisition of Mt. Holly. Mt. Holly had receivables due from Alcoa subsidiary, Alumax, that were part of the normal operations of the business. We assessed that these receivables were effectively settled as a result of the acquisition and were accounted for separately from the business combination. The receivables will be settled at an amount calculated consistent with the practices of Mt. Holly. The amounts due from Alumax are identified in the table above and recorded in the consolidated financial statements in accrued and other current liabilities as an offset against amounts due to Alcoa. Amounts Recognized Separately from the Acquisition:Line itemAmount recognizedAmounts Due from AlumaxAccrued and other current liabilities$20,786Alumina Supply  of Sebree aluminum smelterOn June 1, 2013, Century Sebree acquired the Sebree aluminum smelter from a subsidiary of RTA. Sebree, located in Robards, Kentucky, had an annual hot metal production capacity of 205,000tonnes of primary aluminum and employed approximately 500people as of the acquisition date. The purchase price for the acquisition was $61,000subject to customary working capital adjustments. As part of the transaction, RTA retained all historical environmental liabilities of the Sebree smelter and funded the pension plan assumed by Century in accordance with the purchase agreement. Working Capital AdjustmentIn July 2014, we reached the final determination of the working capital adjustments for the Sebree acquisition, resulting in a final purchase price of $49,035. As the final determination was subsequent to the expiration of measurement period defined under ASC 805, we recognized a gain of approximately $965in the second quarter of 2014 these adjustments were not included as part of the gain on bargain purchase recorded in 2013. The gain was recorded in other income net, from the release of accrued amounts related to the acquisition.Purchase Price AllocationAllocating the purchase price to the acquired assets and liabilities involves management judgment. We allocated the purchase price in accordance with ASC 805 using the estimated fair values at the date of acquisition. Based on the final purchase price allocation, we recorded a gain on bargain purchase of $5,253in 2013. 59CENTURY ALUMINUM COMPANYNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS ContinuedThe following table summarizes the fair value of the assets acquired and the liabilities assumed as of the acquisition date:Acquisition Date Fair  purchase price1,910Assets  and other current assets2,273Property, plant and equipment net55,520Total assets acquired$116,811Liabilities Assumed:Accrued and other current liabilities$43,316Accrued pension benefit costs996Accrued postretirement benefit costs6,544Other liabilities7,476Deferred taxes3,233Total liabilities assumed$61,565Gain on bargain purchase:$5,253From the acquisition date of June 1, 2013 through December 31, 2013, the revenue and earnings that were attributable to Sebree included in the consolidated statement of operations is as follows:Year ended December 31, 2013Sebree revenue$247,178Sebree income from continuing operations 18,7051Our net income for the years ended December 31, 2014and 2013, includes a non-recurring credit for the amortization of the deferred power contract liability of $5,534and $31,031, respectively, related to the amortization of an unfavorable power contract assumed as part of the Sebree acquisition resulting in a credit to our depreciation and amortization expense within cost of goods sold on the consolidated statement of operations for the first quarter of 2014.

Asset purchaseIn June2012, Century Vlissingen purchased substantially all of the assets of a carbon anode production facility located in Vlissingen, the Netherlands for approximately $12,500. In connection with the purchase, we entered into a ground lease with respect to the facility that is renewable at our option. Century Vlissingen did not assume, and is indemnified by the seller against, historical liabilities of the facility. Following the acquisition, we have undertaken a significant capital investment to modernize the facility, comply with environmental regulations and optimize anode production for our smelter in Grundartangi. Vlissingen restarted production in late 2013 with an initial annual carbon anode production capacity of75,000tonnes.In the third quarter of 2014, we began a project to restart the second baking furnace, which is expected to increase total annual production capacity to150,000tonnes.The project is currently expected to be completed by the end of 20154. Fair value measurementsASC 820 defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value and expands disclosures about fair value measurements.This pronouncement applies to a broad range of other existing accounting pronouncements that require or permit fair value measurements.ASC 820 defines fair value as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date.Fair value is an exit price and that exit price should reflect all the assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability.ASC 820 recognizes three valuation techniques: the market approach, income approach, and cost approach.Valuation techniques used for fair value measurements are based upon observable and unobservable inputs.Observable inputs reflect market data obtained from independent sources, while unobservable inputs reflect our internal market assumptions.These two types of inputs create the following fair value hierarchy:Level 1 Valuations are based on quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities in an active market.Level 2 Valuations are based on quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets; quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not active; and model-derived valuations for which all significant inputs are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data.Level 3 Assets or liabilities whose significant inputs are unobservable.Valuations are determined using pricing models and discounted cash flow models and include management judgment and estimation which may be significant.The following section describes the valuation methodology used to measure our financial assets and liabilities that were accounted for at fair value.Overview of Centurys valuation methodologyLevelSignificant inputsCash equivalents1Quoted market pricesTrust assets 11Quoted market pricesSurety bonds1Quoted market pricesE.ON contingent obligation3Quoted LME forward market, managements estimates of the LME forward market prices for periods beyond the quoted periods and managements estimate of future level of operations at CAKYPrimary aluminum sales contract3Managements estimates of future U.S. Midwest premium and risk-adjusted discount ratesMidwest premium contracts3Managements estimates of future U.S. Midwest premium1Trust assets are currently invested in money market funds. These trust assets are held to fund the non-qualified supplemental executive pension benefit obligations for certain of our officers.The trust has sole authority to invest the funds in secure interest producing investments consisting of short-term securities issued or guaranteed by the United States government or cash and cash equivalents61CENTURY ALUMINUM COMPANYNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS ContinuedFair value measurementsOur fair value measurements include the consideration of market risks that other market participants might consider in pricing the particular asset or liability, specifically non-performance risk and counterparty credit risk.Considerations of the non-performance risk and counterparty credit risk are used to establish the appropriate risk-adjusted discount rates used in our fair value measurements.The following table sets forth our financial assets and liabilities that were accounted for at fair value on a recurring basis by the level of input within the ASC 820 fair value hierarchy.As required by GAAP for fair value measurements and disclosures, financial assets and liabilities are classified in their entirety based on the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement.Our assessment of the significance of a particular input to the fair value measurement requires judgment, and may affect the valuation of fair value assets and liabilities and the placement within the fair value hierarchy levels. There were no transfers between Level 1 and 2 during the periods presented. There were no transfers into or out of Level 3 during the periods presented. It is our policy to recognize transfers into and transfers out of Level 3 as of the actual date of the event or change in circumstances that caused the transfer.Recurring Fair Value MeasurementsAs of December 31, 2014Level 1Level 2Level 3TotalASSETS:Cash  assets8,0678,067Surety  contingent obligation net 1 TOTAL Recurring Fair Value MeasurementsAs of December 31, 2013Level 1Level 2Level 3TotalASSETS:Cash  assets11,15111,151Surety bonds2,0022,002Midwest premium  contingent obligation net 1 Primary aluminum sales  Note 6 Debtfor additional information about the E.ON contingent obligation62CENTURY ALUMINUM COMPANYNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS ContinuedChange in Level 3 Fair Value Measurements during the years ended December 31,Derivative liabilities - net20142013Beginning balance, January 1 16,539Total gain loss included in  balance, December 31 Amount of gain included in earnings attributable to the change in unrealized losses relating to assets and liabilities held at December 31 16,539The net gain loss on our derivative assets and liabilities is recorded in our consolidated statements of operations under net gain loss on forward and derivative contracts.See Note 5 Derivative and hedging instrumentsfor the location of our Level 3 derivative assets and liabilities within our consolidated balance sheets.Certain Financial Instruments Certain of our financial instruments are reported at their carrying amount.

Investors electing to participate in the Tender Offer consented to certain amendments and modifications to the indenture governing the 80% Notes to remove, among other things, most of the restrictive covenants, in exchange for which we paid these investors consent fees. We received tenders and consents from holders of a majority of the outstanding principal amount of the 80% Notes. The remaining 80% Notes outstanding that had not participated in the Tender Offer were redeemed at a redemption price of 100%of the principal amount thereof, plus accrued and unpaid interest the Redemption.

E.ON contingent obligationGeneral.The E.ON contingent obligation consists of the aggregate E.ON payments made to Big Rivers Electric Corporation Big Rivers on CAKYs behalf in excess of the agreed upon base amount under the long-term cost-based power contract with Kenergy, a member cooperative of Big Rivers the Big Rivers Agreement.Our obligation to make repayments is contingent upon certain operating criteria for Hawesville and the LME price of primary aluminum. When the conditions for repayment are met, and for so long as those conditions continue to be met, we will be obligated to make principal and interest payments, in up to 72 monthly payments.Based on the LME forward market prices for primary aluminum at December 31, 2014and management estimate of the LME forward market for periods beyond the quoted periods, we recognized a derivative asset which offsets our contingent obligation. As a result, our net liability decreased and we recorded a gain of $1,412and $16,781in net gain loss on forward and derivative contractsfor the years ended December 31, 2014and 2013. In addition, we believe that we will not have any payment obligations for the E.ON contingent obligation through the term of the agreement, which expires in 2028.

assets as though the holders of SeriesA Convertible Preferred Stock were holders of that number of shares of common stock into which their shares of SeriesA Convertible Preferred Stock are convertible.However, the amount of any such distribution will be reduced by the amount of the preferential distribution received by the holders of the SeriesA Convertible Preferred Stock.Transfer Restrictions.Glencore is prohibited from transferring shares of SeriesA Convertible Preferred Stock to any party other than an affiliate who agrees to become bound by certain agreements associated with these shares70CENTURY ALUMINUM COMPANYNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS ContinuedAutomatic Conversion.The SeriesA Convertible Preferred Stock automatically converts, without any further act of Century or any holders of SeriesA Convertible Preferred Stock, into shares of common stock, at a conversion ratio of 100shares of common stock for each share of SeriesA Convertible Preferred Stock, upon the occurrence of any of the following automatic conversion events:If we sell or issue shares of common stock or any other stock that votes generally with our common stock, or the occurrence of any other event, including a sale, transfer or other disposition of common stock by Glencore, as a result of which the percentage of voting stock held by Glencore decreases, an amount of SeriesA Convertible Preferred Stock will convert to common stock to restore Glencore to its previous ownership percentage;If shares of SeriesA Convertible Preferred Stock are transferred to an entity that is not an affiliate of Glencore, such shares of SeriesA Convertible Preferred Stock will convert to shares of our common stock, provided that such transfers may only be made pursuant to an effective registration statement;Upon a sale of SeriesA Convertible Preferred Stock by Glencore in a Rule 144 transaction in which the shares of SeriesA Convertible Preferred Stock and our common stock issuable upon the conversion thereof are not directed to any purchaser, such shares of Series A Convertible Preferred Stock sold will convert to shares of our common stock;andImmediately prior to and conditioned upon the consummation of a merger, reorganization or consolidation to which we are a party or a sale, abandonment, transfer, lease, license, mortgage, exchange or other disposition of all or substantially all of our property or assets, in one or a series of transactions where, in any such case, all of our common stock would be converted into the right to receive, or exchanged for, cash and/or securities, other than any transaction in which the SeriesA Convertible Preferred Stock will be redeemed.Optional Conversion.Glencore has the option to convert the SeriesA Convertible Preferred Stock in a tender offer or exchange offer, at the same conversion ratio as above, in which a majority of the outstanding shares of our common stock have been tendered by the holders thereof and not duly withdrawn at the expiration time of such tender or exchange offer, so long as the SeriesA Convertible Preferred Stock is tendered or exchanged in such offer.Stock Combinations Adjustments.If, at any time while the SeriesA Convertible Preferred Stock is outstanding, Century combines outstanding common stock into a smaller number of shares, then the number of shares of common stock issuable on conversion of each share of SeriesA Convertible Preferred Stock will be decreased in proportion to such decrease in the aggregate number of shares of common stock outstanding.Redemptions or Repurchases of Common Stock.We may not redeem or repurchase our common stock unless we redeem or repurchase, or otherwise make a payment on, a pro rata number of shares of the SeriesA Convertible Preferred Stock.These restrictions do not apply to our open market repurchases or our repurchases pursuant to our employee benefit plans.Right of Redemption.The SeriesA Convertible Preferred Stock will be redeemed by Century if any of the following events occur at a redemption price based on the trading price of our common stock prior to the announcement of such event and Glencore votes its shares of our common stock in opposition to such events:We propose a merger, reorganization or consolidation, sale, abandonment, transfer, lease, license, mortgage, exchange or other disposition of all or substantially all of our property or assets where any of our common stock would be converted into the right to receive, or exchanged for, assets other than cash and/or securities traded on a national stock exchange or that are otherwise readily marketable,orWe propose to dissolve and wind up operations and any assets, other than cash and/or securities traded on a national stock exchange or that are otherwise readily marketable, are to be distributed to the holders of our common stock.Stock Repurchase ProgramIn August 2011, our Board of Directors approved a stock repurchase program.Under the program,we may repurchase up to $60,000of our outstanding shares of common stock from time to time on the open market at prevailing market prices, in block trades or otherwise. The timing and amount of any shares repurchased is determined by our management based on its evaluation of market conditions, the trading price of the stock and other factors. The repurchase program may be expanded, suspended or discontinued at any time.Shares of common stock repurchased are recorded at cost as treasury stock and result in a reduction of shareholders equity in the consolidated balance sheets. From time to time, treasury shares may be reissued as contributions to our employee benefit plans and for the conversion of convertible preferred stock. When shares are reissued, we use an average cost method 71CENTURY ALUMINUM COMPANYNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Continuedfor determining cost. The difference between the cost of the shares and the reissuance price is added to or deducted from additional paid-in capital.From August 11, 2011 through December31, 2014, we repurchased 4,786,521shares of common stock for an aggregate purchase price of $49,924. We have made no repurchases since March 2012 and had approximately $10,076remaining under the repurchase program authorization as of December31, 2014.

Pension and other postretirement benefitsPension BenefitsWe maintain noncontributory defined benefit pension plans for all of our domestic hourly and salaried employees.For the domestic salaried employees, plan benefits are based primarily on years of service and average compensation during the later years of employment. For hourly employees, plan benefits are based primarily on a formula that provides a specific benefit for each year of service.Our funding policy is to contribute amounts based upon actuarial and economic assumptions designed to achieve adequate funding of the projected benefit obligations and to meet the minimum funding requirements of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act 1974 ERISA. Plan assets consist principally of U.S. and international equities and fixed income securities.In addition, we maintain the SERB plan for certain current and former executive officers.We account for these plans in accordance with ASC 715. We use a measurement date of December 31stto determine the pension and OPEB liabilities.Partial FreezeIn the fourth quarter of 2014, we amended our Salaried Pension Plan to eliminate future accruals for participants who are under age 50 as of January 1, 2015.  The plan was also closed to new entrants. The amendment lowered the plans' projected benefit obligations by approximately $6,600and resulted in a $263curtailment charge for 2014. Pension Settlement - Lump Sum PayoutIn the fourth quarter of 2014, we offered certain former employees with vested pension benefits a lump sum payout in an effort to reduce our long-term pension obligations. As a result, net periodic benefit cost for our pension plans increased by a settlement charge of $4,701for 2014 and the projected benefit obligation decreased by $19,573. Employer contributionsDuring the year ended December 31, 2014, we made contributions of approximately $5,584to the qualified defined benefit and SERB plans we sponsor75CENTURY ALUMINUM COMPANYNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS ContinuedPBGC settlementIn April 2013, we entered into a settlement agreement with the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation PBGC regarding an alleged cessation of operations at our Ravenswood facility as a result of the curtailment of operations at the facility. While we do not believe that a cessation of operations has occurred, we reached an agreement with the PBGC to resolve the matter. Pursuant to the terms of the agreement, we will make additional contributions above any minimum required contributions to our defined benefit pension plans totaling approximately $17,400over the term of the agreement, which runs through 2016. In 2013, we made the contributions pursuant to this agreement of approximately $6,700.  The remaining contributions under this agreement are approximately $10,700, of which approximately $3,700was scheduled to be made in 2014. Under certain circumstances, in periods of lower primary aluminum prices relative to our cost of operations, we may defer one or more of these payments, but we would be required to provide the PBGC with acceptable security for any deferred payments. In the first quarter of 2014, we elected to defer contributions for 2014 under the PBGC agreement and have provided the PBGC with the appropriate security.Other Postretirement Benefits OPEBIn addition to providing pension benefits, we provide certain healthcare and life insurance benefits for certain domestic retired employees. We account for these plans in accordance with ASC 715-60.ASC 715-60 requires companies to accrue the estimated cost of providing postretirement benefits during the working careers of those employees who could become eligible for such benefits when they retire. We fund these benefits as the retirees submit claims.Retiree medical benefits changesIn 2012, Century Aluminum of West Virginia CAWV amended its postretirement medical benefit plan for all current and former salaried employees, their dependents and all bargaining unit employees who retired before October 1, 2012, and their dependents.Effective January 1, 2013, CAWV no longer provided retiree medical benefits to active salaried CAWV personnel or any other personnel who retired prior to October 1, 2012. CAWV has made no commitments as to the future status of retiree medical benefits for hourly personnel who are currently covered by an active medical program.For those retirees impacted by the changes and who have elected COBRA coverage, CAWV waived COBRA premiums through June 30, 2013.The 2012 plan amendment resulted in the immediate recognition of any unamortized prior service cost benefits that were accrued in accumulated other comprehensive loss as of the date of the amendments.Under the current Hawesville labor agreement, employees who retire during the term of the labor agreement have been divided into sub-groups based on attributes such as Medicare eligibility, hire date, age and years of service. Levels of benefits are defined for the sub-groups and range from no substantive change from the benefits provided under the previous labor agreement to replacement of the defined retiree medical benefit program with individual health reimbursement accounts for each eligible participant. The health reimbursement accounts will be funded by CAKY based on established rates per hour worked by each eligible participant. Eligible participants will be able to withdraw from their health reimbursement accounts to fund their own retiree medical coverage76CENTURY ALUMINUM COMPANYNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS ContinuedObligations and Funded StatusThe change in benefit obligations and change in plan assets as of December 31 are as  in benefit obligation:Benefit obligation at beginning of   cost11,6298,9086,4205,681Plan amendments5,308Medicare Part D273Actuarial loss   obligation at end of  in plan assets:Fair value of plan assets at beginning of year$199,304$96,234$$Actual return on plan    value of assets at end of  status of plans:Funded  recognized in the Consolidated Balance Sheets:Non-current assets$30,842$2,547$$Current   amount  recognized in accumulated other comprehensive loss pre-tax:Net  service cost  ALUMINUM COMPANYNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS ContinuedOur pension plans projected benefit obligation, accumulated benefit obligation, and fair value of plan assets as of December 31 are as follows:Projected Benefit ObligationAccumulated Benefit ObligationFair Value of Plan  hourly pension  hourly pension  pension  pension plan85,60582,556116,448SERB  assets held in the Rabbi trust are restricted to funding the SERB plan.However, the Rabbi trust is classified as a general asset of the company not plan assets and therefore, the SERB plan is considered unfunded.Components of net periodic benefit cost and other amounts recognized in other comprehensive loss:Net Periodic Benefit Cost:Year Ended December    return on plan  of prior service  of net  periodic benefit  cost2631820Total net periodic benefit  changes in Plan Assets and Benefit Obligations Recognized in Other Comprehensive Loss pre-tax:Year Ended December  loss  service cost benefit1,299Amortization of net loss, including recognition due to  of prior service benefit cost, including recognition due to  amount recognized in other comprehensive  periodic benefit cost9,4886,2987,8719,215Total recognized in net periodic benefit cost and other comprehensive  ALUMINUM COMPANYNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS ContinuedAmounts in accumulated other comprehensive loss expected to be recognized as components of net periodic benefit cost during 2015:PensionOPEBAmortization of net loss$3,601$4,712Amortization of prior service cost benefit993,845Weighted average assumptions used to determine benefit obligations at December  rate405%489%400%499%Rate of compensation increase   rate of compensation increase is 3% per year for first four years and 4% per year for year five and thereafter. Discount rate change in estimateIn 2012, we changed the approach that we use to determine the yield from the Citigroup Pension Liability Index to the Ryan Discount Rate Curve the Ryan Curve. This change in the approach for determining our discount rate is considered a change in accounting estimate under ASC 250 Accounting Changes and Error Corrections. In 2012, the discount rates determined using the Ryan Curve were approximately 25basis points higher than those determined using the Citigroup Pension Liability Index, which lowered the plan projected benefit obligations for our pension and OPEB plans by approximately $10,000as a result.Weighted average assumptions used to determine net periodic benefit cost for the years ended December   year   of compensation increase  return on plan assets725%725%800%1For 2014, the rate of compensation increase is 3% per year for first four years and 4% per year for year five and thereafter.

For measurement purposes, medical cost inflation is initially estimated to be 8%, declining to 5%over seven years and thereafter.Assumed health care cost trend rates have a significant effect on the amounts reported for the health care benefit obligations.

Other objectives are to:Provide a total return that, over the long term, provides sufficient assets to fund the pension plan liabilities subject to a level of risk, contributions and pension expense deemed appropriate by the company.Minimize, where possible, pension expense volatility, and inclusion of liability driven investing as an investment strategy when appropriate. As the funding ratio improves, the objectives will evolve to minimize the funded status volatility.Diversify investments within asset classes to reduce the impact of losses in single investments.The assets of the Pension Plans are invested in compliance with ERISA, as amended, and any subsequent applicable regulations and laws.PerformanceOur performance objective is to outperform the return of weighing passive investment alternatives by the policy target allocations after fees at a comparable level of risk. This investment objective is expected to be achieved over the long term and is measured over rolling multi-year periods. Peer-relative performance comparisons will also be considered especially when performance deviates meaningfully from market indexes. Investment objectives for each asset class are included below.Policy PortfolioAsset allocation policy is the principal method for achieving the Pension Plans' investment objectives stated above.

Fair Value Measurements of Pension Plan assetsWe measured the fair value of our Pension Plans assets in accordance with ASC 820.For additional information about fair value measurements, see Note 4 Fair value measurements.The following table sets forth by level within the ASC 820 fair value hierarchy our Pension Plans' assets.As required by GAAP for fair value measurements and disclosures, these assets are classified in their entirety based on the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement.Our assessment of the significance of a particular input to the fair value measurement requires judgment, and may affect the valuation of fair value assets and liabilities and the placement within the fair value hierarchy levels.Fair Value of Pension Plans assets included under the fair value hierarchy:As of December 31, 2014 Level 1Level 2Level 3TotalEquities:U.S.  equities33,72033,720Fixed income76,20476,204Plan receivable  of December 31, 2013Equities:U.S.  equities40,09340,093Fixed  the receivable to the Century Aluminum of South Carolina defined benefit plan related to pension funding obligations under the Stock Purchase Agreement.

The value of the underlying securities within the mutual funds are determined as follows:U.S. listed equities; equity and fixed income options: Last sale price; last bid price if no last sale price;U.S. over-the-counter equities: Official closing price; last bid price if no closing price;Foreign equities: Official closing price, where available, or last sale price; last bid price if no official closing price; andMunicipal bonds, US bonds, Eurobonds/foreign bonds: Evaluated bid price; broker quote if no evaluated bid price.In December 2014, we entered into the Stock Purchase Agreement to acquire Alcoas 503%stake in Mt. Holly. As part of the transaction, Alcoa and Century agreed to spinoff and fully fund a defined benefit pension plan for eligible current and former Mt. Holly employees. We established a pension plan for the Mt. Holly plan participants with a receivable for the estimated amount required to meet the benefit obligations required under the Stock Purchase Agreement. See Note 2 Business acquisitionsfor additional information about the pension funding requirements. The plan receivable is considered a Level 3 asset because determining the fair value requires significant unobservable inputs, including census data and various actuarial assumptions. Our other postretirement benefit plans are unfunded. We fund these benefits as the retirees submit claims.Pension and OPEB Cash FlowsContributionsWe expect to make the following contributions for 2015:2015Expected pension plan contributions$5,306Expected OPEB benefits payments6,118Estimated Future Benefit PaymentsThe following table provides the estimated future benefit payments for the pension and other postretirement benefit plans:Pension BenefitsOPEB  202497,24743,35782CENTURY ALUMINUM COMPANYNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS ContinuedParticipation in Multiemployer Pension PlansWe contribute to one multiemployer defined benefit pension plan under the terms of a collective-bargaining agreement that covers our union-represented employees at Hawesville.Currently, we do not have any plans to withdraw from or curtail participation in this plan.The risks of participating in a multiemployer plan are different from single-employer plans in the following aspects:Assets contributed to the multiemployer plan by one employer may be used to provide benefits to employees of other participating employers.If a participating employer stops contributing to the plan, the unfunded obligations of the plan may be borne by the remaining participating employers.If a participating employer chooses to stop participating in a multiemployer plan, the employer may be required to pay the plan an amount based on the underfunded status of the plan, referred to as a withdrawal liability.The union-represented employees at Hawesville are part of a United Steel, Paper and Forestry, Rubber, Manufacturing, Energy, Allied Industrial and Service Workers International Union USWA sponsored multiemployer plan.Our contributions to the plan are determined at a fixed rate per hour worked.Centurys participation in the plan for the year ended December 31, 2014, is outlined in the table below.FundSteelworkers Pension TrustEIN / PN23-6648508/499Pension Protection Act Zone Status 2014 1 GreenPension Protection Act Zone Status 2013 1 GreenSubject to Financial Improvement/Rehabilitation PlanNoContributions of Century Aluminum 2014$2,164Contributions of Century Aluminum 2013$2,171Contributions of Century Aluminum 2012$2,282Withdrawal from Plan ProbableNoSurcharge ImposedNoExpiration Date of Collective Bargaining AgreementApril1, 20151The most recent Pension Protection Act zone status available in 2014and 2013is for the plan year-end December 31, 2013and December 31, 2012, respectively.The zone status is based on information that Century received from the plan as well as publicly available information per the Department of Labor and is certified by the plans actuary.

Our independent non-employee directors receive annual grants of service-based share awards that vest following 12months of service.In the past, we have granted stock options that have a term of 10years and typically vest one-thirdon the grant date and an additional one-thirdon the first and second anniversary dates of the grant. Our most recent grant of stock options was in 2009.As of December31, 2014, options to purchase 544,171shares of common stock and 464,485service-based share awards were outstanding83CENTURY ALUMINUM COMPANYNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS ContinuedWe also grant annual long-term incentive awards under our Amended and Restated Long-Term Incentive Plan the LTIP. The LTIP is designed to align compensation with the interests of our stockholders by linking compensation to share price appreciation and total stockholder return over a multi-year period. We provide two types of LTIP awards: time-vested performance share units and performance units.Time-vested performance share units are stock-settled awards which do not contain any performance-based vesting requirements that are granted at the beginning of the performance period.Performance units are generally cash-settled awards although the Board of Directors retains the discretion to settle these awards in stock and vest based on the achievement of pre-determined performance metrics, subject to the discretion of the Board. As of December 31, 2014, we recorded a performance unit liability for approximately $6,251. Both the performance units and time-vested performance share units vest, in their entirety, after threeyears.A summary of activity under our Stock Incentive Plan during the year ended December31, 2014is presented below:OptionsNumberWeighted Average Exercise PriceWeighted Average Remaining Contractual Term yearsAggregate Intrinsic ValueOutstanding at January 1,  fully vested and exercisable at December 31, 2014  the result of actions in 2011 that were determined to be a change of control under the Stock Incentive Plan, all options will remain exercisable for their respective remaining term, regardless of whether the awardees remain employees of Century.Service-based share awardsOutstanding at January 1,  at December 31, 2014464,485Year ended December 31,201420132012Weighted average per share fair value of service-based share grants$1531$819$814Total intrinsic value of option exercises1,01113Fair Value Measurement of Share-Based Compensation Awards We estimate the fair value of each stock option award using the Black-Scholes model on the date of grant.We have not granted any stock options since 2009. For our service-based awards, the fair value of our service-based awards is equal to the closing stock price on the date of grant. Other assumptions to estimate the fair value have no impact on the fair value of the service-based award. If we grant stock options in future periods, we will disclose the relevant assumptions used in the Black-Scholes model to estimate their fair value. The following table summarizes the compensation cost recognized for the years ended December 31, 2014, 2013and 2012for all options, service-based share and performance-based share awards.No share-based compensation cost was capitalized during these periods and there were no significant modifications other than the accelerated vesting in 2011 described above of any share-based awards in 2014, 2013and 201284CENTURY ALUMINUM COMPANYNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS ContinuedYear ended December 31,201420132012Share-based compensation expense reported:Performance-based share  share expense244603586Stock option expenseTotal share-based compensation expense before income tax1,3341,078613Income taxTotal share-based compensation expense, net of income tax$1,334$1,078$613As of December 31, 2014, we had unrecognized compensation expense of $1,826before taxes.This expense will be recognized over a weighted average period of 100years13. Earnings loss per shareBasic earnings loss per share EPS amounts are calculated by dividing net income loss allocated to common stockholders by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding.Diluted EPS amounts assume the issuance of common stock for all potentially dilutive common shares outstanding.The following table shows the basic and diluted earnings loss per share for 2014, 2013, and 2012:For the year ended December 31, 2014Net incomeShares 000Per-ShareNet income$112,494Amount allocated to common stockholders9181%Basic EPS:Net income allocated to common  of Dilutive Securities:Share-based compensation plans605Diluted EPS:Net income allocated to common stockholders with assumed  the year ended December 31, 2013Net lossShares 000Per-ShareNet loss$40,313Amount allocated to common stockholders 110000%Basic and Diluted EPS:Net loss allocated to common  the year ended December 31, 2012Net lossShares 000Per-ShareNet loss$35,610Amount allocated to common stockholders 110000%Basic and Diluted EPS:Net loss allocated to common  have not allocated net losses between common and preferred stockholders, as the holders of our preferred shares do not have a contractual obligation to share in the loss85CENTURY ALUMINUM COMPANYNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS ContinuedSecurities excluded from the calculation of diluted EPS:201420132012Stock options  share awards 1442,737396,1331In periods when we report a net loss, all share awards are excluded from the calculation of diluted weighted average shares outstanding because of their antidilutive effect on earnings loss per share14.

This Joint Committee is a special nonpartisan Congressional committee involved with the analysis and drafting of federal tax legislation and, as part of its mandate, reviews all federal tax refund claims over a certain amount. As a result of this determination, we have reduced the reserve for the unrecognized tax benefits related to prior years by approximately $14,300. The reduction did not result in an impact to the effective tax rate since the reduction was offset by an increase in our valuation allowance. During the second quarter of 2013, we received refunds from the IRS of $5,009following the Joint Committee review88CENTURY ALUMINUM COMPANYNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS ContinuedOur federal income tax returns have been reviewed by the IRS through 2010. However, we have NOL beginning in 2008 that are available for carryforward to future years. Under US tax law, NOL may be adjusted by the IRS until the statute of limitations expires for the year in which the NOL is used. Accordingly, our 2008 and later NOL may be reviewed until they are used or expire. Material state and local income tax matters have been concluded for years through 2007.The majority of our state returns beginning in 2008 are subject to examination. As of December 31, 2014, we had federal net operating loss carryforwards of $1,306,482, after adjusting for losses carried back to previous tax years, which could offset future taxable income.Our ability to utilize our deferred tax assets to offset future federal taxable income may be significantly limited if we experience an ownership change as defined in Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended the Code. In general, an ownership change would occur if our five-percent shareholders, as defined under the Code, collectively increase their ownership in us by more than 50 percentage points over a rolling three-year period. Future transactions in our stock that may not be in our control may cause us to experience such an ownership change and thus limit our ability to utilize net operating losses, tax credits and other tax assets to offset future taxable income.Our Icelandic tax returns are subject to examination beginning with the 2009 tax year. A review of our 2010 through 2012 tax years was recently completed by the Directorate of Internal Revenue of Iceland and no further action is expected for this matter.We do not expect a significant change in the balance of unrecognized tax benefits within the next twelve months15. Commitments and contingenciesEnvironmental ContingenciesBased upon all available information, we believe our current environmental liabilities do not have, and are not likely to have, a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations or liquidity. Because of the issues and uncertainties described below and the inability to predict the requirements of future environmental laws, there can be no assurance that future capital expenditures and costs for environmental compliance at currently or formerly owned or operated properties will not result in liabilities that may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations or liquidity. It is our policy to accrue for costs associated with environmental assessments and remedial efforts when it becomes probable that a liability has been incurred and the costs can be reasonably estimated. The aggregate environmental-related accrued liabilities were $1,101and $999at December 31, 2014and 2013, respectively. All accrued amounts have been recorded without giving effect to any possible future recoveries. With respect to costs for ongoing environmental compliance, including maintenance and monitoring, such costs are expensed as incurred.In July 2006, we were named as a defendant, together with certain affiliates of Alcan Inc., in a lawsuit brought by Alcoa Inc. seeking to determine responsibility for certain environmental indemnity obligations related to the sale of a cast aluminum plate manufacturing facility located in Vernon, California, which we purchased from Alcoa Inc. in December 1998, and sold to Alcan Rolled Products-Ravenswood LLC in July 1999. The complaint also seeks costs and attorney fees. The matter is in a preliminary stage in the U.S. District Court for the District of Delaware, and we cannot predict the ultimate outcome of this action or estimate a range of possible losses related to this matter at this time. 89CENTURY ALUMINUM COMPANYNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS ContinuedMatters relating to the St. Croix Alumina Refining FacilityWe are a party to a United States Environmental Protection Agency Administrative Order on Consent the Order pursuant to which certain past and present owners of an alumina refining facility at St. Croix, Virgin Islands the St. Croix Alumina Refinery have agreed to carry out a Hydrocarbon Recovery Plan to remove and manage hydrocarbons floating on groundwater underlying the facility.Pursuant to the Hydrocarbon Recovery Plan, recovered hydrocarbons and groundwater are delivered to the adjacent petroleum refinery where they are received and managed. In connection with the sale of the facility by Lockheed Martin Corporation Lockheed to one of our affiliates, Virgin Islands Alumina Corporation Vialco, in 1989, Lockheed, Vialco and Century entered into the Lockheed-Vialco Asset Purchase Agreement. The indemnity provisions contained in the Lockheed-Vialco Asset Purchase Agreement allocate responsibility for certain environmental matters. Lockheed has tendered indemnity to Vialco. We have likewise tendered indemnity to Lockheed. Through December 31, 2014, we have expended approximately $1,033on the Hydrocarbon Recovery Plan.At this time, we are not able to estimate the amount of any future potential payments under this indemnification to comply with the Order, but we do not anticipate that any such amounts will have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations or liquidity, regardless of the final outcome. Vialco sold the St. Croix Alumina Refinery to St. Croix Alumina, LLC, a subsidiary of Alcoa in 1995.In December 2010, Century was among several defendants named in a lawsuit filed by plaintiffs who either worked, resided or owned property in the area downwind from the St. Croix Alumina Refinery. In March 2011, Century was also named a defendant in a nearly identical suit brought by certain additional plaintiffs. The plaintiffs in both suits allege damages caused by the presence of red mud and other particulates coming from the alumina facility and are seeking unspecified monetary damages, costs and attorney fees as well as certain injunctive relief. We have tendered indemnity and defense to St. Croix Alumina LLC and Alcoa Alumina Chemical LLC under the terms of an acquisition agreement relating to the facility and have filed motions to dismiss plaintiffs claims, but the Superior Court of the Virgin Islands, Division of St. Croix has not yet ruled on the motions. At this time, it is not practicable to predict the ultimate outcome of or to estimate a range of possible losses for any of the foregoing actions relating to the St. Croix Alumina Refinery.Legal ContingenciesIn addition to the foregoing matters, we have pending against us or may be subject to various lawsuits, claims and proceedings related primarily to employment, commercial, stockholder, safety and health matters. In evaluating whether to accrue for losses associated with legal contingencies, it is our policy to take into consideration factors such as the facts and circumstances asserted, our historical experience with contingencies of a similar nature, the likelihood of our prevailing and the severity of any potential loss.For some matters, no accrual is established because we have assessed our risk of loss to be remote.Where the risk of loss is probable and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated, we record an accrual, either on an individual basis or with respect to a group of matters involving similar claims, based on the factors set forth above. When we have assessed that a loss associated with legal contingencies is reasonably possible, we determine if estimates of possible losses or ranges of possible losses are in excess of related accrued liabilities, if any. Based on current knowledge, management has ascertained estimates for losses that are reasonably possible and management does not believe that any reasonably possible outcomes in excess of our accruals, if any, either individually or in aggregate, would be material to our financial condition, results of operations, or liquidity. We reevaluate and update our assessments and accruals as matters progress over time.In June 2014, we reached a settlement with OR pursuant to the terms of which, among other things, Nordural Grundartangi ehf agreed to pay$3,600to OR and OR withdrew and released each of Nordural Grundartangi ehf and Nordural Helguvik ehf from and against all claims related to the reduction in the power purchased under the existing power contracts. This settlement amount was paid in July 2014. As part of the settlement, Nordural Helguvik ehf and OR also entered into a Supplemental Power Contract pursuant to which OR agreed to provide supplemental power to Grundartangi or Helguvik from time to time during the remaining term of the existing Nordural Helguvik ehf power contract with OR90CENTURY ALUMINUM COMPANYNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS ContinuedRavenswood Retiree Medical Benefits changesIn November 2009, CAWV filed a class action complaint for declaratory judgment against the USWA, the USWAs local and certain CAWV retirees, individually and as class representatives, seeking a declaration of CAWVs rights to modify/terminate retiree medical benefits. Later in November 2009, the USWA and representatives of a retiree class filed a separate suit against CAWV, Century Aluminum Company, Century Aluminum Master Welfare Benefit Plan, and various John Does with respect to the foregoing. These actions, entitled Dewhurst, et al. v. Century Aluminum Co., et al., and Century Aluminum of West Virginia, Inc. v. United Steel, Paper and Forestry, Rubber, Manufacturing, Energy, Allied Industrial and Service Workers International Union, AFL-CIO/CLC, et al., have been consolidated and venue has been set in the District Court for the Southern District of West Virginia. In January 2010, the USWA filed a motion for preliminary injunction to prevent us from implementing any modifications to the retiree medical benefits while these lawsuits are pending, which was dismissed by the trial court, and affirmed upon appeal. CAWV has filed a motion for summary judgment of these actions. The case in chief is currently proceeding in the trial court, subject to the courts ruling on the motion for summary judgment. PBGC SettlementIn June 2011, the PBGC informed us that it believed a cessation of operations under ERISA had occurred at our Ravenswood facility as a result of the curtailment of operations at the facility. Although we disagree that a cessation of operations occurred, we entered into a settlement agreement with the PBGC in April 2013 to resolve the matter. Pursuant to the terms of the agreement, we will make additional contributions above any minimum required contributions to our defined benefit pension plans totaling approximately $17,400over the term of the agreement. During 2013, we made contributions pursuant to this agreement of approximately $6,700. Under certain circumstances, in periods of lower primary aluminum prices relative to our cost of operations, we may defer one or more of these payments, but we would be required to provide the PBGC with acceptable security for any deferred payments. In the first quarter of 2014, we elected to defer contributions for 2014 under the PBGC agreement and have provided the PBGC with the appropriate security.Power Commitments and  August 2013, we entered into a power supply arrangement with Kenergy and Big Rivers which provides market-based power to the Hawesville smelter. The power supply arrangement has an effective term through December 2023. Under this arrangement, the power companies purchase power on the open market and pass it through to Hawesville at Midcontinent Independent System Operator MISO pricing plus transmission and other costs incurred by Kenergy.In connection with this power arrangement, CAKY has received approval from applicable regional transmission organizations and regulatory bodies regarding grid stability and energy import capability.Effective January 1, 2015, new agreements were approved by the Kentucky Public Service Commission pursuant to which EDF Trading North America, LLC EDF replaced Big Rivers as our market participant with MISO under this arrangement.SebreeEffective February 2014, we entered into a power supply arrangement with Kenergy and Big Rivers which provides market based power to the Sebree smelter. The power supply arrangement has an effective term through December 2023. Similar to the arrangement at Hawesville, the power companies purchase power on the open market and pass it through to Sebree at MISO pricing plus transmission and other costs incurred by Kenergy.Effective January 1, 2015, new agreements were approved by the Kentucky Public Service Commission pursuant to which EDF replaced Big Rivers as our market participant with MISO under this arrangement.  Mt. Holly Mt. Holly has a power purchase agreement the Santee Cooper Agreement with the South Carolina Public Service Authority Santee Cooper with an effective term through December 2015. The Santee Cooper Agreement provides power for Mt. Hollys full production capacity requirements at prices based on published rate schedules which are subject to change, with adjustments for fuel prices and other items. The Santee Cooper Agreement restricts Mt. Hollys ability to reduce its power consumption or the associated payment obligations below contracted levels and to terminate the agreement, unless, in each case, the LME falls below certain negotiated levels. 91CENTURY ALUMINUM COMPANYNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS ContinuedOn June 30, 2014, Mt. Holly gave notice to Santee Cooper under the Santee Cooper Agreement to reduce the contract demand to zero effective December 31, 2015.We are continuing discussions with Santee Cooper and other parties regarding power arrangements for Mt. Holly following December 31, 2015.RavenswoodCAWV has a power purchase agreement the APCo Agreement with the Appalachian Power Company APCo. CAWV currently purchases a limited amount of power from APCo as necessary to maintain its curtailed smelter. Power is supplied under the APCo Agreement at prices set forth in published tariffs which are subject to change, with certain adjustments. GrundartangiNordural Grundartangi ehf has power purchase agreements with HS Orka hf HS, Landsvirkjun and Orkuveita Reykjavikur OR to provide power to its Grundartangi smelter. These power purchase agreements, which will expire on various dates from 2019 through 2036 subject to extension, provide power at LME-based variable rates. Each power purchase agreement contains take-or-pay obligations with respect to a significant percentage of the total committed and available power under such agreement.In the fourth quarter of 2011, an additional 475MW of power became available under a power purchase agreement with OR. This power can be used at either Grundartangi or Helguvik and a portion is currently being utilized at Grundartangi. In June 2012, Nordural Grundartangi ehf entered into a supplemental power contract with Landsvirkjun. The supplemental power contract, which will expire in October 2029 or upon the occurrence of certain earlier events, will provide Nordural Grundartangi ehf with supplemental power, as Nordural Grundartangi ehf may request from time to time, at LME-based variable rates. Nordural Grundartangi ehf has agreed to make certain prepayments to Landsvirkjun for power expected to be used at a later date in connection with the contract, which will reduce the price paid for power at the time of consumption. As of December 31, 2014, these power prepayments totaled approximately $2,062. Helguvik Nordural Helguvik ehf has power purchase agreements with HS and OR to provide power to the Helguvik project. These power purchase agreements provide power at LME-based variable rates and contain take-or-pay obligations with respect to a significant percentage of the total committed and available power under such agreements. The power purchase agreements with HS and OR to provide power to Helguvik contain certain conditions to HSs and ORs obligations. HS with respect to all phases and OR with respect to all phases other than the first phase have alleged that certain of these conditions have not been satisfied. The first stage of power under the OR power purchase agreement approximately 475MW became available in the fourth quarter of 2011 and is currently being utilized at Grundartangi. In July 2014, HS commenced arbitration proceedings against Nordural Helguvik ehf seeking, among other things, an order declaring, i that the conditions to the power contract have not been fulfilled and, ii that the power contract is therefore no longer valid. Nordural Helguvik ehf believes HS' renewed claims are without merit and intends to defend itself against them. Nordural Helguvik ehf is in discussions with both HS and OR with respect to such conditions and other matters pertaining to these agreements. In June 2014, Nordural Helguvik ehf entered into a supplemental power contract with OR. The supplemental power contract will expire in October 2036 or upon the occurrence of certain earlier events and will provide Grundartangi or Helguvik with supplemental power at LME-based rates, as may be requested from Grundartangi or Helguvik from time to time.Other Commitments and ContingenciesLabor CommitmentsThe bargaining unit employees at our Grundartangi, Vlissingen, Hawesville, Sebree and Ravenswood facilities are represented by labor unions, representing 59%of our total workforce81%of Grundartangis work force is represented byfivelabor unions, governed by a labor agreement that establishes wages and work rules for covered employees.

Business segmentsCentury Aluminum is a producer of primary aluminum, which trades as a global commodity. We are organized as a holding company with each of our operating primary aluminum smelters managed and operated as a separate facility reporting to our corporate headquarters. Each of our operating primary aluminum smelters meets the definition of an operating segment based on factors delineated in ASC 280 Segment Reporting. We evaluated the similar economic and other characteristics, including nearly identical products, production processes, customers and distribution and have aggregated our fouroperating segments into onereportable segment, primary aluminum, based on these factors. In addition, all of our primary aluminum smelters share several key economic factors inherent in their common products and production processes. For example, all of our facilities' revenue is based on the LME price for primary aluminum. A reconciliation of our consolidated assets to the total of primary aluminum segment assets is provided below.Segment assets    assets include accounts receivable, due from affiliates, prepaid and other current assets, inventory, intangible assets and property, plant and equipment net; the remaining assets are unallocated corporate assets.Geographic informationIncluded in the consolidated financial statements are the following amounts related to geographic locations:201420132012Net sales:United  assets: 1United  long-lived assets other than financial instruments.Major customer informationThe following table shows our major customers whose sales revenue exceeded 10%of our net sales.A loss of any of these customers could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.Thenet sales revenue for these customers is as follows:Year Ended December   ALUMINUM COMPANYNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Continued21. Related party transactionsThe significant related party transactions occurring during the years ended December 31, 2014, 2013and 2012are described below.Sales to GlencoreWe sold primary aluminum under spot and long-term sales contracts with Glencore at prices based on the LME price for primary aluminum, as adjusted to reflect the Midwest premium a premium typically added for deliveries of aluminum within the U.S. and product premiums. In addition, we received tolling fees from Glencore under tolling agreements that provide for delivery of primary aluminum produced at Grundartangi. The fee paid by Glencore under these tolling agreements is based on the LME price for primary aluminum, as adjusted to reflect the exemption from the European Duty Paid premium for Icelandic primary aluminum. We believe that all of the transactions with Glencore were at prices that approximate market. See Note 16 Forward contracts and financial instrumentsfor additional information about our forward physical delivery contracts and tolling agreements with Glencore.We had a long-term contract to sell Glencore primary aluminum, at a variable price based on the LME, adjusted by a negotiated U.S.Midwest market premium with a cap and floor as applied to the current U.S.Midwest premium, which expired at the end of 2013.In addition, we had a contract to sell Glencore all U.S. produced primary aluminum, less existing sales agreements and high-purity metal sales, which expired at the end of 2013.
