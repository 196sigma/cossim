18 REPORT
OF INDEPENDENT PUBLIC ACCOUNTANTS To the Shareholders of
Consolidated Graphics, Inc. We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance
sheets of Consolidated Graphics, Inc. a Texas corporation and subsidiaries as
of March 31, 2002 and 2001, and the related consolidated statements of income shareholders equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period
ended March 31, 2002. These financial statements are the responsibility of the
Companys management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these
financial statements based on our audits. We conducted our audits in accordance with auditing
standards generally accepted in the United States. Those standards require that
we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the
financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes
examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in
the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting
principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating
the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits
provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. In our opinion, the financial statements referred to
above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of
Consolidated Graphics, Inc. and subsidiaries as of March 31, 2002 and 2001, and
the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three
years in the period ended March 31, 2002, in conformity with accounting
principles generally accepted in the United States. ARTHUR ANDERSEN LLP

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS
In thousands, except share and per share data and percentages 1. BUSINESS Consolidated Graphics Inc. collectively with its subsidiaries referred to as the Company is the
largest sheet-fed and half-web commercial printing company in the United States
with 65 printing facilities in 25 states. The Company is focused on adding
value to its operating companies by providing the financial and operational
strengths, management support and technological advantages associated with a
national organization. The majority of the
Companys sales are derived from commercial printing services, which include
electronic prepress, printing, finishing, storage and delivery of high quality custom-designed products. Examples of such products include multicolor product
and capability brochures, shareholder communications, catalogs, training
manuals, point-of-purchase marketing materials and direct mail pieces. The Company also provides a variety of
complementary services, including fulfillment and mailing services and
print-related e-commerce software solutions and electronic media services that
are developed and marketed using the CGXmedia brand. 2. SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND OTHER
INFORMATION Accounting
Policies The accounting policies
of the Company reflect industry practices and conform to accounting principles
generally accepted in the United States. The more significant of such
accounting policies are described below. Principles of Consolidation The
accompanying consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the
Company and its wholly owned subsidiaries.
All intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated. Under Statement of Financial Accounting
Standards SFAS No. 131, Disclosures About Segments of an Enterprise and
Related Information, the Companys operations constitute one
reportable operating segment. Use of Estimates The preparation
of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting
principles requires the use of certain estimates and assumptions by management
in determining the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of
contingent liabilities as of the date of the financial statements and the
reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. We
evaluate our estimates and assumptions on an ongoing basis and rely on
historical experience and various other factors that we believe to be
reasonable under the circumstances to determine such estimates. Because
uncertainties with respect to estimates and assumptions are inherent in the
preparation of financial statements, actual results could differ from these
estimates. The most significant
estimates used in the Companys consolidated financial statements relate to the
allowance for doubtful accounts, useful lives and realization of long-lived
assets, determination and allocation of the purchase price for acquisitions accruals for self-insurance claims, and accruals for current and deferred
income taxes and other liabilities. Cash and Cash Equivalents The Company
considers all highly liquid investments purchased with original maturities of
three months or less to be cash equivalents. Revenue Recognition and Accounts Receivable
The Company recognizes revenue upon delivery of each job. Losses, if
any, on jobs are recognized at the earliest date such amount is determinable.
The Company derives the majority of its revenues from sales and services to a
broad and diverse group of customers with no individual customer accounting for
more than 10% of the Companys revenues during the years ended March 31, 2002 2001 and 2000. The Company maintains an allowance for doubtful accounts based
upon the expected collectibility of accounts receivable. Accounts receivable in
the accompanying consolidated balance sheets are reflected net of allowance for
doubtful accounts of $1,847 and $2,698 at March 31, 2002 and 2001. 24 Inventories Inventories
are valued at the lower of cost or market utilizing the first-in, first-out
method for raw materials and the specific identification method for work in
progress and finished goods. The carrying values of inventories are set forth
below

Goodwill - Goodwill represents the excess of cost
over the fair value of identifiable assets of businesses acquired. Goodwill is
stated at cost, net of accumulated amortization, and is being amortized over 40
years using the straight-line method. At March 31, 2002 and 2001, accumulated
amortization of goodwill was $17,232 and $11,859. See also Recent Accounting Pronouncements below. Impairment of Long-Lived Assets
In accordance with SFAS No121, Accounting for the Impairment of
Long-Lived Assets and for Long-Lived Assets to be Disposed of, the
Company periodically evaluates whether the remaining balances of property and
equipment, goodwill or other long-lived assets are recoverable by assessing
current and future levels of income and cash flows on an undiscounted basis, as
well as other factors, such as business trends and general market conditions.
The Company recorded an impairment loss totaling $3,346 related to the
consolidation of three facilities and exiting a portion of its business at a
fourth location during fiscal 2001. See also Significant Accounting Policies
and Other Information Special Charge below. Recent Accounting Pronouncements
SFAS No. 141, Business Combinations, and SFAS No. 142, Goodwill and
Other Intangible Assets, were issued in July 2001. SFAS No. 141 requires that all acquisitions
completed after June 30, 2001, be accounted for using the purchase method of
accounting. SFAS No. 142 requires that
companies discontinue amortizing goodwill and perform annual impairment tests
to determine if the remaining balance of goodwill or other intangible assets
should be reduced to their estimated fair values. SFAS No. 141 also requires
companies to separately report more specifically identifiable intangible assets
and SFAS No. 142 requires the amortization of such intangible assets over their
useful life, if determinable. SFAS No. 141 was
effective immediately upon its issuance and SFAS No. 142 is effective for
fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2001. We will adopt SFAS No. 142 during our fiscal 2003 first quarter which ends June 30, 2002. We will show
any impairment loss recognized in accordance with SFAS No. 142 as the
cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle in our consolidated
income statement. At March31, 2002, the Companys net goodwill was 199,331 and pre-tax amortization expense for the year ended March 31, 2002 totaled $5,373 under the prior accounting standards. We are currently reviewing
the impact of SFAS No. 142 on our financial position and results of operation.
On the basis of our preliminary review and currently available information, we
believe that we will record a non-cash, after-tax goodwill impairment charge reflected as the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle, of up
to $75,000 unaudited during our fiscal 2003 first quarter. We have obtained an amendment to our Bank
Credit Facility, which specifically provides that this impairment charge will
have no impact on our compliance with the financial covenants of that facility. 25 SFAS No. 143, Accounting
for Asset Retirement Obligations and SFAS No. 144, Accounting
for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets were issued in
August 2001. SFAS No. 143 requires that
a liability for an asset retirement obligation be recognized in the period in
which the obligation arises if a reasonable estimate of fair value can be
made. The associated asset retirement
costs are capitalized as part of the carrying amount of the asset. SFAS No. 143 is effective for fiscal years
beginning after June 15, 2002. SFAS No.
144 addresses
the financial accounting and reporting for the impairment or disposal of
long-lived assets and supersedes SFAS No. 121.
SFAS No. 144 is effective for fiscal years beginning after
December 15, 2001. Management does not
believe that the adoption of SFAS Nos. 143 and 144 will have a material impact
on its financial position or results of operations. Other
Information Supplemental Cash Flow Information
The consolidated statements of cash flows provide information about the
Companys sources and uses of cash and exclude the effects of non-cash
transactions. Significant non-cash transactions primarily include the issuance
of common stock, the assumption of debt related to the acquisition of certain
printing businesses see Note 3. Acquisitions and the issuance of term
equipment notes payable related to the purchase of printing equipment see Note
5. Long-Term Debt. The Company issued term equipment notes payable to purchase
printing equipment totaling $5,855, $31,540 and $26,907 during the years ended
March 31, 2002, 2001 and 2000. The following is a

Earnings Per Share
Basic earnings per share are calculated by dividing net income by the
weighted average number of common shares outstanding. Diluted earnings per
share reflect net income divided by the weighted average number of common
shares outstanding and include the effect of dilutive stock options
outstanding. Related Party Transactions In the
normal course of business, the Company leases, under terms it believes are
comparable to market rates, certain real estate from individuals who formerly
owned an acquired business and are now employed by the Company. 26 Special Charge The Company recorded a one-time special charge of 6,440 $4,117 after tax during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2001 related to
direct and incremental costs primarily associated with combining the operations
at three small, under-performing locations into nearby facilities and exiting a
portion of its business at a fourth location. The components of the special
charge are impairment of property and equipment values totaling $2,272 impairment of goodwill totaling $1,074, facility exit costs totaling $1,504 and
other direct costs totaling $1,590. Impairment losses were
calculated based on the excess of the recorded value of property and equipment
over each assets respective fair value using recent comparable market data.
Other direct costs included primarily payroll-related expenses, incremental
costs necessary to maintain buildings and equipment after the shutdown of each
facility, costs incurred for work-in-process unable to be completed and billed
due to the closings, and professional service fees. Additionally, costs totaling $235 and $1,048 related to items
incurred but not yet paid were reflected in accrued liabilities as of March 31 2002 and 2001. Fair Value of Financial Instruments
The Companys financial instruments consist of cash, trade
receivables, trade payables and debt obligations. The Company does not
currently hold or issue derivative financial instruments. The Company believes
that the fair value of its variable rate debt obligations, which totaled 159,552 and $188,852 at March 31, 2002 and 2001, approximated their recorded
values. The Company estimates that the fair value of its fixed rate debt
obligations totaling $74,185 at March 31, 2002 was $74,998. The Company
estimates that the fair value of its fixed rate debt obligations totaling 76,588 at March 31, 2001 was $76,043.
Estimates of fair value are based on interest rates for the same or
similar debt offered to the Company having the same or similar maturities and
collateral requirements. Concentrations of Credit Risk Financial
instruments that potentially subject the Company to concentrations of credit
risk are primarily cash deposits and trade accounts receivable. The Companys
cash deposits are held in large, national financial institutions.
Concentrations of credit risk with respect to trade accounts receivable are
limited because the Companys printing businesses provide services to a large diverse group of customers in various geographical regions. Management performs
ongoing credit evaluations of its customers and generally does not require collateral
for the extension of credit. 3. ACQUISITIONS All acquisitions have
been accounted for using the purchase method of accounting. Revenues and
expenses of the acquired businesses have been included in the accompanying
consolidated financial statements from their respective dates of acquisition.
The allocation of purchase price to the acquired assets and liabilities is
based on estimates of fair market value.
The allocation of purchase price in connection with certain acquisitions
in fiscal 2002 may be prospectively revised if and when additional information
the Company is awaiting concerning certain asset and liability valuations other than contingent transaction consideration, is obtained, provided that
such information is received no later than one year after the date of
acquisition. The Company does not
expect that such additional information will result in a material adjustment to
the preliminary purchase price allocations.
Contingent transaction consideration is accrued as an additional cost of
the transaction when payment thereof is deemed to be probable by the Company. During fiscal 2002, the
Company acquired the assets of three printing businesses American
Lithographers Hayward and Sacramento, California; Carqueville Graphics 
Chicago, Illinois; and Regent Printing and Imaging Tulsa, Oklahoma. To complete these acquisitions, in the
aggregate, the Company paid cash totaling $11,231 and issued debt totaling 5,129. The allocation of the purchase price of the businesses acquired in fiscal
2002 included current assets of $11,704 and property and equipment of $9,990 less current liabilities of $5,334. 27 During fiscal 2000, the
Company acquired 13 printing businesses. To complete these acquisitions, in the
aggregate, the Company paid cash of $42,044, issued 1,032,407 shares
of its common stock and discharged debt and paid other liabilities of the
acquired businesses totaling $24,477. Additionally, debt of the acquired
businesses totaling $10,706 remained outstanding following the acquisitions. The following table sets
forth unaudited pro forma information and assumes that each of the acquisitions
in fiscal 2002 occurred at the beginning April 1 of the fiscal years ended
March 31, 2002 and 2001.

The preceding pro
forma financial information does not purport to be indicative of the Companys
financial position or results of operations that would have occurred had the
transactions been completed at the beginning of the period presented, nor does
such pro forma information purport to indicate the Companys results of
operations at any future date or for any future period. Certain acquisitions
involve contingent consideration typically payable only in the event that the
financial results of an acquired business improve by an equal amount or more
after the acquisition; accordingly, such contingent consideration has been
excluded from the preceding pro forma financial information. Additionally, to satisfy
certain liabilities of acquired businesses or pursuant to earnout agreements the Company paid cash of $3,414, $4,782 and $3,484 during fiscal 2002, 2001 and
2000, respectively, and issued 13,332 shares of its common stock in fiscal
2000. 4. PROPERTY AND EQUIPMENT Property and equipment
are stated at cost, net of accumulated depreciation. The costs of major
renewals and betterments are capitalized; repairs and maintenance costs are
expensed when incurred. Depreciation of property and equipment is computed
using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the various
classes of assets. The following is a

lives

The Company
entered into a five-year $225,000 senior secured credit facility the Bank
Credit Facility with eleven banks in December 2000. The Bank Credit Facility is composed of a $50,000 five-year term
loan the Term Loan, of which $35,000 was outstanding at March 31, 2002, and
a $175,000 five-year revolving credit line the Revolving Line, of which 111,000 was outstanding at March 31, 2002.
The Term Loan requires quarterly payments of $2,500 each through
September 30, 2005. Borrowings outstanding
under the Bank Credit Facility are secured by substantially all of the
Companys assets other than real estate and certain equipment subject to term
equipment notes and other financings.
Borrowings under the Bank Credit Facility accrue interest, at the
Companys option, at either 1 the London Interbank Offered Rate LIBOR plus
a margin of 125% to 225%, or 2 an alternate base rate based upon the
greater of the agent banks prime lending rate or the Federal Funds effective
rate plus 50% plus a margin of up to 100%.
The Company is also required to pay a commitment fee on available but
unused amounts ranging from 275% to 375% annually. The interest rate margin and the commitment fee are based upon
the Companys ratio of Funded Debt to Pro Forma Consolidated EBITDA, as
defined, redetermined quarterly. On
March 31, 2002 borrowings outstanding under the Term Loan and the Revolving
Line accrued interest at a weighted average rate of 426%. The proceeds of the Bank
Credit Facility can be used to repay certain indebtedness, finance certain
acquisitions, provide for working capital and general corporate purposes, and
subject to certain restrictions, repurchase its common stock. The covenants contained
in the Agreement, among other things, limit the Companys ability to i incur
secured and unsecured debt beyond specific amounts or based upon financial
ratios, ii pledge its assets beyond specific amounts, iii merge consolidate with or acquire other companies where the total consideration paid
is above certain levels, iv change its primary business, v pay cash
dividends, vi make capital expenditures and dispose of assets beyond certain
levels. The Company must also meet certain financial tests relating to its
leverage ratio, interest coverage ratio, fixed charge coverage ratio and
consolidated net worth. In addition, the Company
entered into an auxiliary revolving credit facility the Auxiliary Bank
Facility with a commercial bank expiring in February 2003. This Auxiliary
Bank Facility is unsecured and has a maximum borrowing capacity of $5,000. At
March 31, 2002, borrowings outstanding under the Auxiliary Bank Facility totaled 3,281 and accrued interest at a rate of
387%. 29 The term equipment notes
consist primarily of term notes payable pursuant to printing equipment purchase
and financing agreements between the Company and two printing equipment
manufacturers. The agreements provide for fixed monthly payments over periods
of either five or ten years and are secured by the purchased equipment. At
March 31, 2002, outstanding borrowings under these agreements totaled $68,830
and were subject to a weighted average interest rate of 776%. The remaining
balance of term equipment notes totaling $4,878 primarily consists of various
secured debt obligations assumed by the Company in connection with certain
prior year acquisitions. The Company is not subject to any significant
financial covenants in connection with any of these equipment notes; however the Bank Credit Facility places certain limitations on the amount of additional
term note obligations the Company may incur in the future. The Companys remaining
debt obligations consist of a promissory note totaling $5,129, industrial
revenue bonds totaling $4,885 and various other debt obligations totaling 734. The Company does not have any
significant financial covenants or restrictions associated with these debt
obligations. The principal payment
requirements by fiscal year under the Companys debt obligations are as
follows: 2003 $19,877; 2004 20,290; 2005 $21,463; 2006 $129,850; 2007 $11,103; thereafter $31,154. 6. INCOME TAXES The provision for income

In connection with
our assumption of obligations under outstanding industrial revenue bonds
related to the acquisition of two printing businesses, which are reflected as
debt in the accompanying consolidated financial statements, the Company had two
letters of credit outstanding for a combined total of $5,488 as of March 31 2002. These letters of credit were issued pursuant to the terms of our Bank
Credit Facility, which expires in 2005, and we may be required to obtain
replacement letters of credit at that time. The Company has entered
into earnout agreements in connection with certain prior year
acquisitions. If the acquired printing
businesses generate operating profits in excess of pre-determined targets, the
Company may be obligated to issue additional shares of its common stock or make
additional cash payments. As of March 31, 2002, the Company was contingently
obligated through fiscal 2005 to issue up to 58,291 shares of its common stock
and make additional cash payments of up to $10,887 for all periods in the
aggregate. From time to time, the
Company is subject to legal proceedings and claims that arise in the ordinary
course of its business. Currently, there are no legal proceedings or claims
pending against the Company that management believes will have a material
adverse effect upon the Companys financial position or results of operations. 31 8. STOCK OPTIONS Employees of the Company
and certain nonemployee members of the Companys Board of Directors have been
or may be granted rights to purchase shares of the Companys common stock
pursuant to the Consolidated Graphics, Inc. Long-Term Incentive Plan the
Plan. Options granted pursuant to the Plan may either be incentive stock
options within the meaning of Section 422 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 as amended, or non-qualified stock options. Options granted under the Plan are
at a price not less than the market price of the stock at the date of grant and
periodically vest over a fixed period of up to ten years. Unvested options
expire upon termination of employment and vested options expire six months
after termination of employment.
Otherwise, options expire after final vesting at the end of a fixed
period not in excess of five years. At
March 31, 2002, a total of 2,404,895 shares were reserved for issuance pursuant
to the Plan, of which 444,094 shares were reserved for options which had not
been granted. The Company accounts for
the Plan under the provisions and related interpretations of Accounting
Principles Board No. 25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees. No
compensation expense or liability is recognized for such options in the
accompanying consolidated financial statements since all options were granted at
the fair market value of the stock at the date of grant. The following table sets
forth option transactions under the Plan

Had the Company
used the fair-value-based method of accounting for the Plan prescribed by SFAS
No. 123, Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation, and charged compensation
expense against income over the vesting period based on the fair value of
options at the date of grant, net income and earnings per share would have been
reduced to the following pro forma amounts

The pro forma
compensation expense may not be representative of future amounts because
options vest over several years and additional options may be granted in future
years. 32 The weighted-average
grant date fair value of options granted during fiscal 2002, 2001 and 2000 was 1096, $750 and $1596. The weighted-average grant date fair value of options
was determined by utilizing the Black-Scholes option-pricing model with the
following key assumptions

The Black-Scholes
model used by the Company to calculate the fair value of options granted, as
well as other currently accepted option valuation models, were developed to
estimate the fair value of freely tradable, fully transferable options without
vesting and/or trading restrictions, which significantly differ from the
provisions associated with the Companys stock option awards. These models also
require highly subjective assumptions, including future stock price volatility
and expected time until exercise, which greatly affect the calculated values.
Accordingly, management does not believe this model provides a reliable single
measure of the fair value of the Companys stock option awards. 9. UNAUDITED QUARTERLY FINANCIAL DATA The following table
