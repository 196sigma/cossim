The Board of Directors and Stockholders
Somnus Medical Technologies, Inc.
We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Somnus

consolidated statements of operations, stockholders' equity, and cash flows
for the year ended December 31, 1997 and for the period from inception
January 19, 1996 to December 31, 1996. These financial statements are the
responsibility of the Company management. Our responsibility is to express
an opinion on these financial statements based on our audit.
We conducted our audit in accordance with generally accepted auditing
standards. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to
obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of
material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence
supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit
also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant
estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial
statement presentation. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis
for our opinion.
In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly,
in all material respects, the consolidated financial position of Somnus
Medical Technologies, Inc. at December 31, 1997 and 1996, and the consolidated
results of its operations and its cash flows for the year ended December 31,
1997 and for the period from inception January 19, 1996 to December 31,
1996, in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
1. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
Organization, Ownership and Business
Somnus Medical Technologies, Inc. the Company, originally Sleep
Technologies, Inc., was incorporated in Delaware on January 19, 1996. The
Company designs, develops, manufactures and markets medical devices that
utilize proprietary radio frequency technology for the treatment of upper
airway disorders. The Company Somnoplasty System is intended to offer
minimally invasive, curative treatment alternatives for disorders of the upper
airway, including snoring, obstructive sleep apnea, enlarged turbinates and
enlarged tonsils. In 1996, the Company established Somnus Medical Technologies
Pty. Ltd. in Australia for purposes of conducting clinical research studies on
behalf of the Company. Collectively, the entities are referred to as the
Company.
On November 6, 1997, the Company completed an initial public offering of its
shares pursuant to which it issued 4,600,000 common shares for net proceeds of
approximately $43,800,000. Upon the closing of the initial public offering,
each outstanding share of preferred stock was converted to common stock on a
share for share basis.
From inception through mid 1997, the Company principal activities had been
recruiting personnel, raising capital and performing research and development.
Subsequent to December 31, 1996, the Company received approval for the sale of
its first products which generated $2,573,648 of revenue for the year ended
December 31, 1997. Accordingly, the Company is no longer considered to be in
the development stage.
Basis of Presentation
The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Somnus Medical
Technologies, Inc. and Somnus Medical Technologies Pty. Ltd. All significant
intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated.
Revenue Recognition
The Company generally recognizes revenue at the time products are shipped.
To date, no customers have been given contractual right of return or stock
rotation privileges. Product returns and sales allowances are estimated and
provided for at the time of sale. The Company fiscal 1997 revenues include
approximately $824,000 in sales to its sole distributor see Dependence on
Sole Distributor and Suppliers below.
Dependence on Sole Distributor and Suppliers
The Company entered into a Distribution Agreement with Medtronic Inc.
Medtronic on April 21, 1997 for a period of three years with defined
minimum annual purchase requirements. The Agreement grants Medtronic exclusive
distribution rights of certain of the Company products in the European
Union, Australia, Southeast Asia and certain other areas until April 21, 2000.
Net sales of approximately $824,000 were made to Medtronic European
operations and approximately $1,750,000 directly to customers primarily in the
United States.
The Company purchases what is currently its only commercially available
radio frequency RF generator from a single-source supplier. Establishing
additional or replacement suppliers for such generator or certain of the
components used in the Company products, if required, may not be
accomplished quickly and could involve significant additional costs. Any
supply interruption from suppliers or failure of the Company to obtain
alternative suppliers for the generator or such components would limit the
Company ability to manufacture and sell its products and would have a
material adverse effect on the Company business, financial condition and
results of operations.

SOMNUS MEDICAL TECHNOLOGIES, INC.
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS--CONTINUED
Net Loss Per Share
In 1997, the FASB issued Statement No. 128, Earnings per Share. Statement
128 replaced the calculation of primary and fully diluted earnings per share
with basic and diluted earnings per share. Unlike primary earnings per share,
basic earnings per share excludes any dilutive effects of options, warrants
and convertible securities. Diluted earnings per share is very similar to the
previously reported fully diluted earnings per share. All earnings per share
amounts for all periods have been presented, and where appropriate, restated
to conform to the Statement 128 requirements.
The Company has adopted SAB98, Earnings per Share which was issued on
February 3, 1998. In accordance with SAB98, common and common equivalent
shares stock options, warrants and convertible preferred stock issued during
the 12-month period prior to the initial filing of the registration statement
relating to the Company initial public offering price are excluded from the
calculation of basic and diluted earnings per share.
The Company has securities outstanding that could dilute basic earnings per
share in the future that were not included in the computation of net loss per
share in the periods presented as their effect is antidilutive. For additional
disclosures regarding potentially dilutive stock options, warrants, and
convertible preferred stock, see Note 6.
Employee Stock Plans
The Company accounts for its stock option plans and its employee stock
purchase plan in accordance with the provisions of the Accounting Principles
Board Opinion No. 25 APB 25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees
and has adopted the disclosure-only alternative of Statement of Financial
Accounting Standards No. 123 FAS 123, Accounting for Stock Based
Compensation.
Accounting Estimates
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally
accepted accounting principles requires management to make certain estimates
and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and
disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial
statements and the reported results of operations during the reporting period.
Actual results could differ from these estimates.
Research and Development
Research and development costs, which include clinical and regulatory costs,
are charged to expense as incurred.
Inventory
Inventories are stated at the lower of cost, determined on an average cost
basis, and market value. During the twelve months ended December 31, 1997, the
Company acquired inventory for the first time. Inventory at December 31, 1997
is stated net of reserves of $598,000.
Property and Equipment
Property and equipment are stated at cost, net of accumulated amortization
and depreciation. Property and equipment are depreciated on a straight-line
basis over the estimated useful lives of the assets, typically 1-5 years.
Leasehold improvements are amortized using the straight line method over the
shorter of the estimated life of the asset or the remaining term of the lease.
35
SOMNUS MEDICAL TECHNOLOGIES, INC.
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS--CONTINUED
The Company adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standard No. 121,
Accounting for the Impairment of Long-Lived Assets to Be Disposed of,
effective January 19, 1996. The adoption did not have a material impact on the
Company financial statements.
Cash and Cash Equivalents
The Company considers all highly liquid investments with a maturity from
date of purchase of three months or less to be cash equivalents. The Company
maintains deposits with a financial institution in the United States and
invests its excess cash in U.S. government obligations and securities which
bear minimal risk. The Company had no short-term investments at December 31,
1996 or December 31, 1997.
Management determines the appropriate classification of debt securities in
accordance with Statement No. 115, Accounting for Certain Investments in
Debt and Equity Securities at the time of purchase and reevaluates such
designation as of each balance sheet date. At December 31, 1996 and December
31, 1997, all debt securities are designated as available-for-sale. Available-
for-sale securities are carried at fair value, with the unrealized gains and
losses reported in stockholders' equity. At December 31, 1996 and December 31,
1997, the fair value of investments approximates cost. The amortized cost of
debt securities in this category is adjusted for amortization of premiums and
accretion of discounts to maturity. Such amortization is included in interest
income. Realized gains and losses and declines in value judged to be other-
than-temporary on available-for-sale securities are included in interest
income and have been immaterial in all periods presented. The cost of
securities sold is based on the specific identification method. Interest and
dividends on securities classified as available-for-sale are included in
interest income.
Concentration of Credit Risk
The Company invests cash which is not required for immediate operating needs
principally in a diversified portfolio of financial instruments issued by
institutions with strong credit ratings. By policy, the amount of credit
exposure to any one institution, with the exception of U.S. government-backed
securities, is limited. These investments are not collateralized and mature
within two years. The Company has not experienced significant losses on these
investments.
An allowance for doubtful accounts of approximately $70,000 was charged to
expense in fiscal 1997.
A significant portion of the Company revenues and trade accounts
receivable consist of shipments to one large, multinational distributor. The
Company has not incurred any credit losses to date.
Advertising Expenses
The Company expenses the costs of advertising as incurred. Advertising
expense was approximately $890,000 and $89,000 for the fiscal years ended
December 31, 1997 and 1996, respectively.
New Accounting Pronouncements
In June 1997, the FASB issued Statement No. 130, Reporting Comprehensive
Income SFAS No. 130 and Statement No. 131, Disclosures About Segments of
An Enterprise and Related Information SFAS No. 131. SFAS No. 130
establishes rules for reporting and displaying comprehensive income. SFAS No.
131 will require the Company to use the management approach in disclosing
segment information. Both statements are effective for the Company during
1998. The Company does not believe that the adoption of either SFAS No. 130 or
SFAS No. 131 will have a material impact on the Company results of
operations, cash flows, or financial position.

an interest rate of Prime plus 15% to 2% 975% to 1025% at December 31,
1996 and were secured by substantially all of the assets of the Company.
Included in computer equipment and office equipment, furniture and fixtures as

Series A preferred stock in May 1996 and $150,000 was repaid in cash in April
1996. The Series A preferred stock converted to common stock in conjunction

Series B preferred stock. The agreement included a provision which allowed the
entity to receive not less than 25% of the fee owed by the Company in equity
or debt instruments in the Company. Pursuant to this clause, the total
finder fee owed of $710,233 was paid with 60,000 shares of Series B

parties directly affiliated with the investors placed by the entity in the
Series B preferred stock financing, the entity will be granted options or
warrants to purchase 1,000 shares of common stock at a price equivalent to the
initial public offering price. Such options or warrants will have a five-year
term and be entitled to anti-dilution and piggyback registration rights. A
total of 5,000 warrants were issued in January 1998 in consideration of this
provision.

Pro Forma Disclosures
The Company has elected to follow Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 25
APB No. 25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees and related
interpretations, in accounting for its employee stock options because, as
discussed below, the alternative fair value accounting provided for under FASB
Statement No. 123 SFAS No. 123 Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation,
requires use of option valuation models that were not developed for use in
valuing employee stock options. The Company, under APB No. 25, generally does
not recognize compensation expense as the exercise price of the Company
employee stock options equals the market price of the underlying stock on the
date of grant.
Pro forma information regarding net loss and loss per share is required by
SFAS No. 123, which also requires that the information be determined as if the
Company has accounted for its employee stock options granted subsequent to
December 31, 1995 under the fair value method of this statement.
40
SOMNUS MEDICAL TECHNOLOGIES, INC.
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS--CONTINUED
The fair value for options granted prior to the Company initial public
offering in November 1997 were estimated at the date of grant using the
minimum value method, assuming no dividends, an expected life of between two
and three years, nominal volatility and a risk free interest rate of 53%. No
stock options were granted in 1997 after the initial public offering.
Had compensation cost for the Company stock-based compensation plans been
determined based on the fair value at the grant dates for awards under those
plans consistent with the method of SFAS No. 123, the Company net loss and
loss per share would have been increased to the pro forma amounts indicated
below.
For purposes of pro forma disclosures, the estimated fair value of the
options is amortized to expense over the options' vesting period for stock
options and the six month purchase period for stock purchases under the Stock
Purchase Plan. The Company pro forma information is as follows:
PERIOD FROM
INCEPTION
JANUARY 19,
1996 TO
YEAR ENDED   DECEMBER 31,
DECEMBER 31, 1997   1996
Pro forma net loss.  $ 12,868,456 $ 3,101,908
Pro forma basic and diluted loss per
$    305 $   161
Because FAS 123 is applicable only to options granted subsequent to December
31, 1995, its pro forma effect will not be fully reflected until subsequent
years. The effects on pro forma disclosures of applying FAS 123 are not likely
to be representative of the effects on pro forma disclosures in future years.
Warrants
In connection with equipment term loans in 1996, the Company issued warrants
to purchase 37,500 shares of Series A preferred stock at $100 per share and
25,000 shares of Series B preferred stock at $300 per share which were
converted to common stock warrants in conjunction with the IPO. These warrants
may be exercised at any time prior to June 24, 2006 and October 1, 2001,
respectively. The values of these warrants were determined by the Company to
be immaterial for financial statement purposes. Warrants outstanding at
December 31, 1997 were 62,500.
Stock Compensation
The Company recorded deferred compensation of approximately $546,000 and
$4,049,000 during the period from inception January 19, 1996 to December 31,
1996 and the year ended December 31, 1997, respectively. These amounts
represent the difference between the exercise price and the deemed fair value
of certain of the Company stock options granted in these periods. The
Company recorded amortization expense of approximately $22,000 and $1,253,000,
respectively, during these periods.
At December 31, 1997, the Company had a total of $3,321,000 remaining to be
amortized over the corresponding vesting period of each respective option,
generally four years.
7. EMPLOYEE BENEFIT PLANS
The Company has a 401k Plan which stipulates that all full-time employees
with at least 60 days of employment can elect to contribute to the 401k
Plan, subject to certain limitations, up to 15% of salary on a pretax basis.
The Company has the option to provide matching contributions but has not done
so to date.

8. INCOME TAXES
As of December 31, 1997, the Company had federal and state net operating
loss carryforwards of approximately $13,900,000 and $4,100,000 respectively.
The Company also had federal and California research and development tax
credit carryforwards of approximately $200,000 and $200,000 respectively. The
federal net operating loss and credit carryforwards will expire at various
dates beginning in the year 2011 through 2012, if not utilized. The State of
California net operating losses will expire at various dates beginning in 2001
through 2002, if not utilized.
Utilization of the Company net operating loss carryforwards and credits
may be subject to an annual limitation due to the change in ownership
provisions of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 and similar state provisions.
The annual limitation may result in the expiration of net operating losses and
credits before utilization.
Deferred income taxes reflect the net tax effects of temporary differences
between the carrying amounts of assets for financial reporting and the amount
used for income tax purposes. Significant components of the Company deferred
tax assets for federal and state income taxes are as follows:
DECEMBER 31, DECEMBER 31,
1997     1996
Net Operating Loss Carryforwards. $ 5,000,000  $ 1,100,000
Research Credits    400,000         Capitalized Research and Development.   400,000    100,000
Total Deferred Tax Assets. $ 5,800,000  $ 1,200,000
Valuation  5,800,000  1,200,000
Net Deferred Tax      --                                    
Because of the Company lack of earnings history, the deferred tax assets
have been fully offset by a valuation allowance. The valuation allowance
increased by $1,200,000 and $4,600,000 during the year ended December 31, 1996
and 1997 respectively.
