CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES The Companys management, including the
Companys principal executive officer and principal
financial officer, has evaluated the effectiveness of the
Companys disclosure controls and procedures as defined in
Rules13a-15e and 15d-15e under the Securities Exchange
Act of 1934 as of the end of the period covered by this Annual
Report on Form10-K. Based upon that evaluation, the
Companys principal executive officer and principal
financial officer have concluded that the disclosure controls
and procedures were effective as of the end of the period
covered by this Annual Report on Form10-K. There were no changes in the Companys
internal control over financial reporting that occurred during
the Companys last fiscal quarter that has materially
affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, the
Companys internal control over financial reporting. 29 Table of Contents PARTIII
