Based on this evaluation, DTE Energys CEO and CFO have concluded that such disclosure controls and procedures are effective in providing reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed by DTE Energy in reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act iis recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission rules and forms and iiis accumulated and communicated to DTE Energys management, including its CEO and CFO, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Due to the inherent limitations in the effectiveness of any disclosure controls and procedures, management cannot provide absolute assurance that the objectives of its disclosure controls and procedures will be attained.bManagements report on internal control over financial reportingManagement of DTE Energy is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as such term is defined in Exchange Act Rules13a-15f and 15d-15f. Internal control over financial reporting is a process designed by, or under the supervision of, DTE Energy CEO and CFO, to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.Management of DTE Energy has assessed the effectiveness of DTE Energys internal control over financial reporting as of December31, 2015. In making this assessment, management used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission 2013 COSO in Internal Control - Integrated Framework. Based on this assessment, management concluded that, as of December31, 2015, DTE Energys internal control over financial reporting was effective based on those criteria.The effectiveness of DTE Energys internal control over financial reporting as of December31, 2015has been audited by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm who also audited DTE Energys financial statements, as stated in their report which appears herein.cChanges in internal control over financial reportingThere have been no changes in DTE Energys internal control over financial reporting during the quarter ended December31, 2015that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, DTE Energys internal control over financial reporting51REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRMTo the Board of Directors and Shareholders ofDTE Energy CompanyIn our opinion, the consolidated financial statements listed in the accompanying index present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of DTE Energy Company and its subsidiaries at December 31, 2015 and 2014, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2015in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. In addition, in our opinion, the financial statement schedule listed in the accompanying index presents fairly, in all material respects, the information set forth therein when read in conjunction with the related consolidatedfinancial statements. Also in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2015, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework 2013issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission COSO. The Company management is responsible for these financial statements and financial statement schedule, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Managements report on internal control over financial reporting. Our responsibility is to express opinions on these financial statements, on the financial statement schedule, and on the Company internal control over financial reporting based on our integrated audits. We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board United States. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audits of the financial statements included examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, and evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.A companys internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A companys internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that ipertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; iiprovide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and iiiprovide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the companys assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate./s/ PricewaterhouseCoopers LLPDetroit, MichiganFebruary10, 201652DTE Energy CompanyConsolidated Statements of OperationsYear Ended December 31,

Certain activities of DTE Electric and DTE Gas, as well as various other aspects of businesses under DTE Energy are regulated by the FERC. In addition, the Registrants are regulated by other federal and state regulatory agencies including the NRC, the EPA, the MDEQ, and the CFTC67DTE Energy Company DTE Electric CompanyCombined Notes to Consolidated Financial StatementsContinuedBasis of PresentationThe accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements of the Registrants are prepared using accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. These accounting principles require management to use estimates and assumptions that impact reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. Actual results may differ from the Registrants' estimates.The information in these combined notes relates to each of the Registrants as noted in the Index of Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. However, DTE Electric does not make any representation as to information related solely to DTE Energy or the subsidiaries of DTE Energy other than itself.Certain prior year balances for the Registrants were reclassified to match the current year Consolidated Financial Statements presentation. Such revisions include amounts reclassified to separate Operating Revenues and Fuel, purchased power, and gas between Utility operations and Non-utility operations and from Operations and maintenance to Fuel, purchased power, and gas non-utility related to the Power and Industrial Projects segment. The reclassifications did not affect DTE Energy Net Income for the prior periods, as such, they are not deemed material to the previously issued Consolidated Financial Statements. For reclassifications of deferred tax assets and liabilities arising from ASU 2015-17 see Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, New Accounting Pronouncements.Principles of ConsolidationThe Registrants consolidate all majority-owned subsidiaries and investments in entities in which they have controlling influence. Non-majority owned investments are accounted for using the equity method when the Registrants are able to significantly influence the operating policies of the investee. When the Registrants do not influence the operating policies of an investee, the cost method is used. These Consolidated Financial Statements also reflect the Registrants' proportionate interests in certain jointly-owned utility plants. The Registrants eliminate all intercompany balances and transactions.The Registrants evaluate whether an entity is a VIE whenever reconsideration events occur. The Registrants consolidate VIEs for which they are the primary beneficiary. If a Registrant is not the primary beneficiary and an ownership interest is held, the VIE is accounted for under the equity method of accounting. When assessing the determination of the primary beneficiary, a Registrant considers all relevant facts and circumstances, including: the power, through voting or similar rights, to direct the activities of the VIE that most significantly impact the VIE economic performance and the obligation to absorb the expected losses and/or the right to receive the expected returns of the VIE. The Registrants perform ongoing reassessments of all VIEs to determine if the primary beneficiary status has changed.Legal entities within DTE Energy Power and Industrial Projects segment enter into long-term contractual arrangements with customers to supply energy-related products or services. The entities are generally designed to pass-through the commodity risk associated with these contracts to the customers, with DTE Energy retaining operational and customer default risk. These entities generally are VIEs and consolidated when DTE Energy is the primary beneficiary. In addition, DTE Energy has interests in certain VIEs through which control of all significant activities is shared with partners, and therefore are accounted for under the equity method.DTE Energy has variable interests in VIEs through certain of its long-term purchase and sale contracts. DTE Electric has variable interests in VIEs through certain of its long-term purchase contracts. As of December31, 2015, the carrying amount of assets and liabilities in DTE Energy Consolidated Statements of Financial Position that relate to its variable interests under long-term purchase and sale contracts are predominantly related to working capital accounts and generally represent the amounts owed by or to DTE Energy for the deliveries associated with the current billing cycle under the contracts. As of December31, 2015, the carrying amount of assets and liabilities in DTE Electric Consolidated Statements of Financial Position that relate to its variable interests under long-term purchase contracts are predominantly related to working capital accounts and generally represent the amounts owed by DTE Electric for the deliveries associated with the current billing cycle under the contracts. The Registrants have not provided any significant form of financial support associated with these long-term contracts. There is nosignificant potential exposure to loss as a result of DTE Energy variable interests through these long-term purchase and sale contracts. In addition, there is nosignificant potential exposure to loss as a result of DTE Electric variable interests through these long-term purchase contracts68DTE Energy Company DTE Electric CompanyCombined Notes to Consolidated Financial StatementsContinuedIn 2001, DTE Electric financed a regulatory asset related to Fermi 2 and certain other regulatory assets through the sale of rate reduction bonds by a wholly-owned special purpose entity, Securitization. DTE Electric performed servicing activities including billing and collecting surcharge revenue for Securitization. The remaining amounts due on the rate reduction bonds were paid in March 2015. The associated regulatory assets were fully amortized by March 31, 2015. Subsequent to the pay-down of the bonds, Securitization is no longer a VIE but continues to be consolidated by the Registrants as a voting interest entity.The maximum risk exposure for consolidated VIEs is reflected on the Registrants' Consolidated Statements of Financial Position. For non-consolidated VIEs, the maximum risk exposure is generally limited to its investment and amounts which it has guaranteed.The following table summarizes the major Consolidated Statements of Financial Position items for consolidated VIEs as of December31, 2015and 2014. All assets and liabilities of a consolidated VIE are presented where it has been determined that a consolidated VIE has either 1assets that can be used only to settle obligations of the VIE or 2liabilities for which creditors do not have recourse to the general credit of the primary beneficiary. Securitization, included in the DTE Energy table below for December 31, 2014, also relates to DTE Electric. VIEs, in which DTE Energy holds a majority voting interest and is the primary beneficiary, that meet the definition of a business and whose assets can be used for purposes other than the settlement of the VIE obligations have been excluded from the table below.December31, 2015December31,  millionsASSETSCash and cash equivalents$14$$7$7Restricted cash8968104Accounts  plant, and equipment, net668181Securitized regulatory assets3434Other current and long-term  payable and accrued current liabilities$13$3$8$11Current portion long-term debt, including capital leases810510115Current regulatory liabilities3232Mortgage bonds, notes, and other101515Capital lease obligations33Other current and long-term  for DTE Energy non-consolidated VIEs as of December31, 2015and 2014are as follows:December 31, 2015December 31, 2014In millionsInvestment in equity method investees$136$134Notes receivable$15$15Equity Method InvestmentsInvestments in non-consolidated affiliates that are not controlled by the Registrants, but over which they have significant influence, are accounted for using the equity method.

DTE Electric and DTE Gas record revenues for electricity and gas provided but unbilled at the end of each month. Rates for DTE Electric and DTE Gas include provisions to adjust billings for fluctuations in fuel and purchased power costs, cost of natural gas, and certain other costs. Revenues are adjusted for differences between actual costs subject to reconciliation and the amounts billed in current rates. Under or over recovered revenues related to these cost recovery mechanisms are included in Regulatory assets or liabilities on the Registrants' Consolidated Statements of Financial Position and are recovered or returned to customers through adjustments to the billing factors.For further discussion of recovery mechanisms authorized by the MPSC, see Note 8to the Consolidated Financial Statements, Regulatory Matters.DTE Energy non-utility businesses recognize revenues as services are provided and products are delivered. For discussion of derivative contracts, see Note 12to the Consolidated Financial Statements, Financial and Other Derivative Instruments70DTE Energy Company DTE Electric CompanyCombined Notes to Consolidated Financial StatementsContinuedOther IncomeOther income for the Registrants is recognized for non-operating income such as equity earnings, allowance for equity funds used during construction, and contract services. DTE Energy Power and Industrial Projects segment also recognizes Other income in connection with the sale of membership interests in reduced emissions fuel facilities to investors. In exchange for the cash received, the investors will receive a portion of the economic attributes of the facilities, including income tax attributes. The transactions are not treated as a sale of membership interests for financial reporting purposes. Other income is considered earned when refined coal is produced and tax credits are generated. Power and Industrial Projects recognized approximately $83 million, $78 million, and $81 millionof Other income for the years ended December31, 2015, 2014, and 2013, respectively.For information on equity earnings by segment, see Note 20to the Consolidated Financial Statements, Segment and Related Information. Accounting for ISO TransactionsDTE Electric participates in the energy market through MISO. MISO requires that DTE Electric submit hourly day-ahead, real-time, and FTR bids and offers for energy at locations across the MISO region. DTE Electric accounts for MISO transactions on a net hourly basis in each of the day-ahead, real-time, and FTR markets and net transactions across all MISO energy market locations. In any single hour DTE Electric records net purchases in Fuel, purchased power, and gas utility and net sales in Operating Revenues Utility operations on the Registrants' Consolidated Statements of Operations.The Energy Trading segment participates in the energy markets through various independent system operators and regional transmission organizations ISOs and RTOs. These markets require that Energy Trading submits hourly day-ahead, real-time bids and offers for energy at locations across each region. Energy Trading submits bids in the annual and monthly auction revenue rights and FTR auctions to the regional transmission organizations. Energy Trading accounts for these transactions on a net hourly basis for the day-ahead, real-time, and FTR markets. These transactions are related to trading contracts which, if derivatives, are presented on a net basis in Operating Revenues Non-utility operations, and if non-derivatives, the realized gains and losses for sales are recorded in Operating Revenues Non-utility operations and purchases are recorded in Fuel, purchased power, and gas non-utility in the DTE Energy Consolidated Statements of Operations.DTE Electric and Energy Trading record accruals for future net purchases adjustments based on historical experience, and reconcile accruals to actual costs when invoices are received from MISO and other ISOs and RTOs.Changes in Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income LossComprehensive income loss is the change in common shareholders equity during a period from transactions and events from non-owner sources, including Net Income. The amounts recorded to Accumulated other comprehensive income loss for the Registrants include unrealized gains and losses on available-for-sale securities and changes in benefit obligations, consisting of deferred actuarial losses and prior service costs. The amounts recorded to Accumulated other comprehensive income loss relating solely to DTE Energy also include unrealized gains and losses from derivatives accounted for as cash flow hedges, DTE Energy interest in other comprehensive income of equity investees which comprise the net unrealized gains and losses on investments, and foreign currency translation adjustments.

Restricted cash consists of funds held to satisfy requirements of certain debt and DTE Energy partnership operating agreements. Restricted cash designated for interest and principal payments within one year is classified as a Current Asset72DTE Energy Company DTE Electric CompanyCombined Notes to Consolidated Financial  receivable are primarily composed of trade receivables and unbilled revenue. The Registrants' Accounts receivable are stated at net realizable value.The allowance for doubtful accounts for DTE Electric and DTE Gas is generally calculated using the aging approach that utilizes rates developed in reserve studies. DTE Electric and DTE Gas establish an allowance for uncollectible accounts based on historical losses and managements assessment of existing economic conditions, customer trends, and other factors. Customer accounts are generally considered delinquent if the amount billed is not received by the due date, which is typically in 21days, however, factors such as assistance programs may delay aggressive action. DTE Electric and DTE Gas assess late payment fees on trade receivables based on past-due terms with customers. Customer accounts are written off when collection efforts have been exhausted. The time period for write-off is 150days after service has been terminated.The customer allowance for doubtful accounts for DTE Energy other businesses is calculated based on specific review of probable future collections based on receivable balances in excess of 30days.DTE Energy unbilled revenues of $620 millionand $773 million, including $237 millionand $250 millionof DTE Electric unbilled revenues, are included in Customer Accounts receivable at December31, 2015and 2014, respectively.Notes ReceivableNotes receivable, or financing receivables, for DTE Energy are primarily comprised of capital lease receivables and loans and are included in Notes receivable and Other current assets on DTE Energys Consolidated Statements of Financial Position. Notes receivable, or financing receivables, for DTE Electric are primarily comprised of loans.Notes receivable are typically considered delinquent when payment is not received for periods ranging from 60to 120days. The Registrants cease accruing interest nonaccrual status, consider a note receivable impaired, and establish an allowance for credit loss when it is probable that all principal and interest amounts due will not be collected in accordance with the contractual terms of the note receivable. Cash payments received on nonaccrual status notes receivable, that do not bring the account contractually current, are first applied to contractually owed past due interest, with any remainder applied to principal. Accrual of interest is generally resumed when the note receivable becomes contractually current.In determining the allowance for credit losses for notes receivable, the Registrants consider the historical payment experience and other factors that are expected to have a specific impact on the counterpartys ability to pay. In addition, the Registrants monitor the credit ratings of the counterparties from which they have Notes  related to utility operations is generally valued at average cost. Inventory related to non-utility operations is valued at the lower of cost or market.DTE Gas' natural gas inventory of $65 millionand $43 millionas of December31, 2015and 2014, respectively, is determined using the last-in, first-out LIFO method. The replacement cost of gas remaining in storage exceeded the LIFO cost by $60 millionand $110 millionat December31, 2015and 2014, respectively.Property, Retirement and Maintenance, and Depreciation and AmortizationProperty is stated at cost and includes construction-related labor, materials, overheads, and AFUDC for utility property. The cost of utility properties retired is charged to accumulated depreciation. Expenditures for maintenance and repairs are charged to expense when incurred, except for Fermi 2.Utility property at DTE Electric and DTE Gas is depreciated over its estimated useful life using straight-line rates approved by the MPSC.DTE Energy non-utility property is depreciated over its estimated useful life using the straight-line method.Depreciation and amortization expense also includes the amortization of certain regulatory assets for the Registrants73DTE Energy Company DTE Electric CompanyCombined Notes to Consolidated Financial  $4 millionand $16 millionof expenses related to Fermi 2 refueling outages were accrued at December31, 2015and 2014, respectively. Amounts are accrued on a pro-rata basis, generally over an 18-month period, that coincides with scheduled refueling outages at Fermi 2. This accrual of outage costs matches the regulatory recovery of these costs in rates set by the MPSC. See Note 8to the Consolidated Financial Statements, Regulatory Matters.The cost of nuclear fuel is capitalized. The amortization of nuclear fuel is included within Fuel, purchased power, and gas utility in the DTE Energy Consolidated Statements of Operations, and Fuel and purchased power in the DTE Electric Consolidated Statements of Operations, and is recorded using the units-of-production method.Long-Lived AssetsLong-lived assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. If the carrying amount of the asset exceeds the expected discounted future cash flows generated by the asset, an impairment loss is recognized resulting in the asset being written down to its estimated fair value. Assets to be disposed of are reported at the lower of the carrying amount or fair value, less costs to sell.Intangible AssetsDTE Energy has certain Intangible assets as shown below:December 31,20152014In millionsEmission allowances$1$1Renewable energy credits3845Contract intangible assets117122156168Less accumulated amortization6257Intangible assets, net94111Less current intangible assets59$89$102DTE Electric has certain Intangible assets as shown below:December 31,20152014In millionsEmission allowances$1$1Renewable energy credits38453946Less current intangible assets59$34$37Emission allowances and renewable energy credits are charged to expense, using average cost, as the allowances and credits are consumed in the operation of the businesses by the Registrants. DTE Energy amortizes contract Intangible assets on a straight-line basis over the expected period of benefit, ranging from 1to 26years. DTE Energy Intangible assets amortization expense was $11 millionin 2015, $12 millionin 2014, and $14 millionin 201374DTE Energy Company DTE Electric CompanyCombined Notes to Consolidated Financial StatementsContinuedThe following table summarizes DTE Energy estimated contract intangible amortization expense expected to be recognized during each year through 2020:Estimated amortization expenseIn  and Sales TaxesThe Registrants record the billing of excise and sales taxes as a receivable with an offsetting payable to the applicable taxing authority, with nonet impact on the Registrants' Consolidated Statements of Operations.Deferred Debt CostsThe costs related to the issuance of long-term debt are deferred and amortized over the life of each debt issue. The deferred amounts are included in Other long-term assets on the Registrant Consolidated Statements of Financial Position. In accordance with MPSC regulations applicable to DTE Energys electric and gas utilities the unamortized discount, premium, and expense related to utility debt redeemed with a refinancing are amortized over the life of the replacement issue. Discount, premium, and expense on early redemptions of debt associated with DTE Energy non-utility operations are charged to earnings.Investments in Debt and Equity SecuritiesThe Registrants generally classify investments in debt and equity securities as either trading or available-for-sale and have recorded such investments at market value with unrealized gains or losses included in earnings or in Other comprehensive income or loss, respectively. Changes in the fair value of Fermi 2 nuclear decommissioning investments are recorded as adjustments to Regulatory assets or liabilities, due to a recovery mechanism from customers. The Registrants' equity investments are reviewed for impairment each reporting period. If the assessment indicates that the impairment is other than temporary, a loss is recognized resulting in the equity investment being written down to its estimated fair value. See Note 11of the Consolidated Financial Statements, Fair Value.Government GrantsGrants are recognized when there is reasonable assurance that the grant will be received and that any conditions associated with the grant will be met. When grants are received related to Property, plant, and equipment, the Registrants reduce the cost of the assets on their Consolidated Statements of Financial Position, resulting in lower depreciation expense over the life of the associated asset. Grants received related to expenses are reflected as a reduction of the associated expense in the period in which the expense is incurred.DTE Energy FoundationDTE Energy charitable contributions to the DTE Energy Foundation were $12 million, $25 million, and $18 millionfor the years ended December31, 2015, 2014, and 2013, respectively. The DTE Energy Foundation is a non-consolidated not-for-profit private foundation, the purpose of which is to contribute to and assist charitable organizations75DTE Energy Company DTE Electric CompanyCombined Notes to Consolidated Financial StatementsContinuedOther Accounting PoliciesSee the following notes for other accounting policies impacting the Registrants Consolidated Financial Statements:NoteTitle7Asset Retirement Obligations8Regulatory Matters9Income Taxes11Fair Value12Financial and Other Derivative Instruments19Stock-Based CompensationNOTE 3 NEW ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTSIn May 2014, the FASB issued ASU No. 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers.The objectives of this ASU are to improve upon revenue recognition requirements by providing a single comprehensive model to determine the measurement of revenue and timing of recognition. The core principle is that an entity will recognize revenue to depict the transfer of goods or services to customers at an amount that the entity expects to be entitled to in exchange for those goods or services. This ASU also requires expanded qualitative and quantitative disclosures regarding the nature, amount, timing, and uncertainty of revenues and cash flows arising from contracts with customers. In July 2015, the FASB deferred implementation of the revenue standard to be effective for the first interim period within annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017. The standard is to be applied retrospectively and early adoption is permitted in the preceding year. The Registrants are currently assessing the impact of this ASU on their Consolidated Financial Statements.In February 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-02, Amendments to the Consolidation Analysis, which changes the analysis that a reporting entity must perform to determine whether it should consolidate certain types of legal entities. The ASU affects 1 limited partnerships and similar legal entities, 2 evaluating fees paid to a decision maker or a service provider as a variable interest, 3 the effect of fee arrangements on the primary beneficiary determination, 4 the effect of related parties on the primary beneficiary determination, and 5 certain investment funds. It is effective for the Registrants for the first interim period within annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2015 and early adoption is permitted. The Registrants are currently assessing the impact of this ASU on their Consolidated Financial Statements.In April 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-03, Simplifying the Presentation of Debt Issuance Costs. This ASU requires that debt issuance costs related to a recognized debt liability be presented in the balance sheet as a direct deduction from the carrying amount of that debt liability, consistent with debt discounts. This ASU is effective for reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2015 and interim periods therein. It is to be applied retrospectively and early adoption is permitted. Had the Registrants early adopted this ASU it would have decreased assets and liabilities on DTE Energys and DTE Electrics Consolidated Statements of Financial Position by $74 millionand $36 million, respectively, at December 31, 2015, and $73 millionand $35 million, respectively, at December 31, 2014.In July 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-11,Inventory Topic 330, Simplifying the Measurement of Inventory. The ASU replaces the current lower of cost or market test with a lower of cost or net realizable value test when cost is determined on a first-in, first-out or average cost basis. The standard is effective for public entities for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016, and interim periods therein. It is to be applied prospectively and early adoption is permitted. The ASU will not have a significant impact on the Registrants' Consolidated Financial Statements.In November 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-17, Balance Sheet Classification of Deferred Taxes. This ASU requires that all deferred tax assets and liabilities, along with any related valuation allowance, be classified as noncurrent on the balance sheet. This ASU is effective for reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016, including interim periods therein. It may be applied either prospectively or retrospectively, and early adoption is permitted. The Registrants adopted this ASU at December 31, 2015. The adoption of this ASU impacted DTE Energys and DTE Electrics Consolidated Statements of Financial Position by decreasing assets and liabilities for 2014 by $75 millionand $2 million, respectively76DTE Energy Company DTE Electric CompanyCombined Notes to Consolidated Financial StatementsContinuedNOTE 4 ACQUISITIONS AND EXIT ACTIVITIESAcquisitionsOn January 21, 2015, DTE Electric closed on an acquisition of a 732MW simple-cycle natural gas facility in Carson City, Michigan from The LS Power Group.The facility will serve to meet customer needs during periods of peak demand. DTE Electric has completed its valuation analysis to arrive at the fair value of the assets acquired. The cash consideration and total purchase price of approximately $241 millionwas allocated based on the underlying fair value of the assets acquired, which was primarily Property, plant, and equipment. The pro forma results of operations have not been presented for DTE Electric as the effects of the acquisition were not material to either Registrant Consolidated Statements of Operations.On October 1, 2015, DTE Electric closed on an acquisition of a 350MW simple-cycle natural gas facility in East China Township, Michigan from a non-utility affiliate of DTE Energy. The facility will serve to meet customer needs during periods of peak demand. DTE Electric has completed its purchase accounting. The cash consideration and total purchase price of approximately $69 millionwas based on the net book value of the assets acquired, which was primarily Property, plant, and equipment. The pro forma results of operations have not been presented for DTE Electric as the effects of the acquisition were not material to its Consolidated Statements of Operations.Exit ActivitiesOn December 17, 2015, DTE Energy announced the closure of the Shenango coke battery plant in response to a sharp downturn in the North American steel industry. The plant, which is included in the Power and Industrial Projects segment, is located in Pittsburgh, PA. As a result of the closure, DTE Energy recorded a one-time pre-tax non-cash impairment charge of $111 million. The charge included $96 millionto fully impair the long-lived assets, employee severance expenses related to the workforce reduction of approximately 170employees for $3 million, and other expenses, including write downs of inventory, of $12 million. DTE Energy coke production has been shifted to a larger, more efficient coke battery plant in the Power and Industrial Projects segment. Production of coke from the Shenango coke battery plant ceased in January 2016.A summary of the charges in the Consolidated Statements of Operations resulting from DTE Energy exit activities is shown below:2015In millionsFuel, purchased power, and gas non-utility$5Operation and maintenance10Asset gains losses and impairments, net96Total Exit Activity Charges$111For amounts accrued at December31, 2015related to these exit activities, DTE Energy expects future cash payments of approximately $7 millionto be made in 2016.

Consumers Energy is entitled to 51%of the total capacity and energy of the plant and is responsible for the same percentage of the plants operation, maintenance, and capital improvement costs.NOTE 7 ASSET RETIREMENT OBLIGATIONSDTE Electric has a legal retirement obligation for the decommissioning costs for its Fermi 1 and Fermi 2 nuclear plants, dismantlement of facilities located on leased property, and various other operations. DTE Electric has conditional retirement obligations for asbestos and PCB removal at certain of its power plants and various distribution equipment. DTE Gas has conditional retirement obligations for gas pipelines, certain service centers, compressor and gate stations. The Registrants recognize such obligations as liabilities at fair market value when they are incurred, which generally is at the time the associated assets are placed in service. Fair value is measured using expected future cash outflows discounted at the Registrants' credit-adjusted risk-free rate. For its utility operations, the Registrants recognize in the Consolidated Statements of Operations removal costs in accordance with regulatory treatment. Any differences between costs recognized related to asset retirement and those reflected in rates are recognized as either a Regulatory asset or liability on the Consolidated Statements of Financial Position.If a reasonable estimate of fair value cannot be made in the period in which the retirement obligation is incurred, such as for assets with indeterminate lives, the liability is recognized when a reasonable estimate of fair value can be made. Natural gas storage system and certain other distribution assets for DTE Gas and substations, manholes, and certain other distribution assets for DTE Electric have an indeterminate life. Therefore, no liability has been recorded for these assets80DTE Energy Company DTE Electric CompanyCombined Notes to Consolidated Financial StatementsContinuedA reconciliation of the asset retirement obligations for 2015follows:DTE EnergyDTE ElectricIn millionsAsset retirement obligations at December 31,  incurred3333Revision in estimated cash flows8080Asset retirement obligations at December 31, 2015$2,194$2,020The Revision in estimated cash flows was principally attributed to the impact of the Coal Combustion Residuals on DTE Electric coal ash storage facility AROs. Refer to Note 17to the Consolidated Financial Statements, Commitments and Contingencies, for discussion of the implications of the Coal Combustion Residuals.Approximately $18 billionof the asset retirement obligations represent nuclear decommissioning liabilities that are funded through a surcharge to electric customers over the life of the Fermi 2 nuclear plant. The NRC has jurisdiction over the decommissioning of nuclear power plants and requires minimum decommissioning funding based upon a formula. The MPSC and FERC regulate the recovery of costs of decommissioning nuclear power plants and both require the use of external trust funds to finance the decommissioning of Fermi 2. Rates approved by the MPSC provide for the recovery of decommissioning costs of Fermi 2 and the disposal of low-level radioactive waste. DTE Electric is continuing to fundFERC jurisdictional amounts for decommissioning even though explicit provisions are not included in FERC rates. DTE Electric believes the MPSC and FERC collections will be adequate to fund the estimated cost of decommissioning. The decommissioning assets, anticipated earnings thereon, and future revenues from decommissioning collections will be used to decommission Fermi 2. DTE Electric expects the liabilities to be reduced to zeroat the conclusion of the decommissioning activities. If amounts remain in the trust funds for Fermi 2 following the completion of the decommissioning activities, those amounts will be disbursed based on rulings by the MPSC and FERC.A portion of the funds recovered through the Fermi 2 decommissioning surcharge and deposited in external trust accounts is designated for the removal of non-radioactive assets and returning the site to greenfield. This removal and greenfielding is not considered a legal liability. Therefore, it is not included in the asset retirement obligation, but is reflected as the Nuclear decommissioning liability. The decommissioning of Fermi 1 is funded by DTE Electric. Contributions to the Fermi 1 trust are discretionary.

DTE Electric is also regulated by the FERC with respect to financing authorization and wholesale electric activities. Regulation results in differences in the application of generally accepted accounting principles between regulated and non-regulated businesses.The Registrants are unable to predict the outcome of the unresolved regulatory matters discussed herein. Resolution of these matters is dependent upon future MPSC orders and appeals, which may materially impact the Consolidated Financial Statements of the Registrants81DTE Energy Company DTE Electric CompanyCombined Notes to Consolidated Financial  Assets and LiabilitiesDTE Electric and DTE Gas are required to record Regulatory assets and liabilities for certain transactions that would have been treated as revenue or expense in non-regulated businesses. Continued applicability of regulatory accounting treatment requires that rates be designed to recover specific costs of providing regulated services and be charged to and collected from customers. Future regulatory changes or changes in the competitive environment could result in the discontinuance of this accounting treatment for Regulatory assets and liabilities for some or all of the Registrants' businesses and may require the write-off of the portion of any Regulatory asset or liability that was no longer probable of recovery through regulated rates. Management believes that currently available facts support the continued use of Regulatory assets and liabilities and that all Regulatory assets and liabilities are recoverable or refundable in the current regulatory environment.The following are balances and a brief description of the Registrants' Regulatory assets and liabilities at December 31:DTE EnergyDTE  millionsRecoverable pension and other postretirement  postretirement costs256234198191Asset retirement  Michigan income taxes248267203220Removal costs asset1181511815Unamortized loss on reacquired debt63674144Other recoverable income taxes61666166Deferred environmental costs5459Transitional Reconciliation Mechanism43144314Cost to achieve Performance Excellence Process33542846Accrued PSCR/GCR revenue126134Recoverable income taxes related to Securitized regulatory  amount included in Current  regulatory assets$$34$$34DTE EnergyDTE  millionsRemoval costs liability$291$308$$Renewable energy197227197227Negative pension offset4667Accrued PSCR/GCR refund3715Refundable income taxes2333Energy optimization102414Fermi 2 refueling outage416416Securitization over recovery7171Refundable revenue decoupling/deferred  amount included in Current  Energy Company DTE Electric CompanyCombined Notes to Consolidated Financial StatementsContinuedAs noted below, certain Regulatory assets for which costs have been incurred have been included or are expected to be included, for costs incurred subsequent to the most recently approved rate case in DTE Electric or DTE Gas' rate base, thereby providing a return on invested costs except as noted. Certain other regulatory assets are not included in rate base but accrue recoverable carrying charges until surcharges to collect the assets are billed. Certain Regulatory assets do not result from cash expenditures and therefore do not represent investments included in rate base or have offsetting liabilities that reduce rate base.ASSETSRecoverable pension and other postretirement costsAccounting rules for pension and other postretirement benefit costs require, among other things, the recognition in Other comprehensive income of the actuarial gains or losses and the prior service costs that arise during the period but that are not immediately recognized as components of net periodic benefit costs. DTE Electric and DTE Gas record the impact of actuarial gains or losses and prior service costs as a Regulatory asset since the traditional rate setting process allows for the recovery of pension and other postretirement costs. The asset will reverse as the deferred items are amortized and recognized as components of net periodic benefit costs. aAsset retirement obligationThis obligation is for Fermi 2 decommissioning costs. The asset captures the timing differences between expense recognition and current recovery in rates and will reverse over the remaining life of the related plant. aRecoverable Michigan income taxes In July 2007, the MBT was enacted by the State of Michigan. State deferred tax liabilities were established for DTE Energys utilities and offsetting Regulatory assets were recorded as the impacts of the deferred tax liabilities will be reflected in rates as the related taxable temporary differences reverse and flow through current income tax expense. In May 2011, the MBT was repealed and the MCIT was enacted. The Regulatory asset was remeasured to reflect the impact of the MCIT tax rate. aRemoval costs asset Receivable for the recovery of asset removal expenditures in excess of amounts collected from customers.Unamortized loss on reacquired debtThe unamortized discount, premium, and expense related to debt redeemed with a refinancing are deferred, amortized, and recovered over the life of the replacement issue.Other recoverable income taxesIncome taxes receivable from DTE Electrics customers representing the difference in property-related deferred income taxes and amounts previously reflected in DTE Electrics rates. This asset will reverse over the remaining life of the related plant. aDeferred environmental costsThe MPSC approved the deferral of investigation and remediation costs associated with DTE Gas' former MGP sites. Amortization of deferred costs is over a ten-year period beginning in the year after costs were incurred, with recovery net of any insurance proceeds through base rate filings. aTransitional Reconciliation Mechanism TRM The MPSC approved the recovery of the deferred net incremental revenue requirement associated with the transition of PLD customers to DTE Electric distribution system, effective July 1, 2014. Annual reconciliations will be filed and surcharges will be implemented to recover approved amounts.Cost to achieve Performance Excellence Process PEPThe MPSC authorized the deferral of costs to implement the PEP. These costs consist of employee severance, project management, and consultant support. These costs are amortized over a ten-year period beginning with the year subsequent to the year the costs were deferred.Accrued PSCR/GCR revenueReceivable for the temporary under-recovery of and carrying costs on fuel and purchased power costs incurred by DTE Electric which are recoverable through the PSCR mechanism and temporary under-recovery of and carrying costs on gas costs incurred by DTE Gas which are recoverable through the GCR mechanism.Recoverable income taxes related to Securitized regulatory assetsReceivable for the recovery of income taxes to be paid on the non-bypassable securitization bond surcharge. A non-bypassable securitization tax surcharge, which ended in December 2014, was in place to recover the income tax over a 14-year period. a83DTE Energy Company DTE Electric CompanyCombined Notes to Consolidated Financial  regulatory assetsThe net book balance of the Fermi 2 nuclear plant was written off in 1998 and an equivalent regulatory asset was established. In 2001, the Fermi 2 regulatory asset and certain other regulatory assets were securitized pursuant to PA 142 and an MPSC order. A non-bypassable securitization bond surcharge, which ended in December 2014, was in place to recover the Securitized regulatory asset over a 14-year  assets not earning a return or accruing carrying charges.LIABILITIESRemoval costs liabilityThe amount collected from customers for the funding of future asset removal activities.Renewable energyAmounts collected in rates in excess of renewable energy expenditures.Negative pension offsetDTE Gas' negative pension costs are not included as a reduction to its authorized rates; therefore, DTE Gas is accruing a Regulatory liability to eliminate the impact on earnings of the negative pension expense accrued. This Regulatory liability will reverse to the extent DTE Gas' pension expense is positive in future years.Accrued PSCR/GCR refundLiability for the temporary over-recovery of and a return on power supply costs and transmission costs incurred by DTE Electric which are recoverable through the PSCR mechanism and temporary over-recovery of and a return on gas costs incurred by DTE Gas which are recoverable through the GCR mechanism.Refundable income taxesIncome taxes refundable to DTE Gas' customers representing the difference in property-related deferred income taxes payable and amounts recognized pursuant to MPSC authorization.Energy optimization EO  Amounts collected in rates in excess of energy optimization expenditures.Fermi 2 refueling outageAccrued liability for refueling outage at Fermi 2 pursuant to MPSC authorization.Securitization over recovery Over recovery of securitization bond expenses.Refundable revenue decoupling/deferred gainAmounts were originally accrued as refundable to DTE Electric customers for the change in revenue resulting from the difference between actual average sales per customer compared to the base level of average sales per customer established by the MPSC. In 2012, the MCOA issued a decision reversing the MPSC decision to authorize a RDM for DTE Electric. The revenue decoupling liability was reversed and, after receiving an order from the MPSC to defer the resulting gain for future amortization, DTE Electric created a regulatory liability representing its obligation to refund the gain. The deferred gain was amortized into earnings in 2014 and 20152014 Electric Rate Case FilingDTE Electric filed a rate case with the MPSC on December 19, 2014 requesting an increase in base rates of $370 millionbased on a projected twelve-month period ending June 30, 2016. The requested increase in base rates was due primarily to an increase in net plant resulting from infrastructure investments, plant acquisitions, environmental compliance, and reliability improvement projects. The rate filing also included projected changes in sales, working capital, operation and maintenance expenses, return on equity, and capital structure. On July 1, 2015, DTE Electric realized an annual revenue increase of $230 millionconsisting of $190 millionof self-implemented base rate increase related to the December 19, 2014 rate request and $40 millionassociated with the required elimination of a credit surcharge. On December 11, 2015, the MPSC issued an order approving an annual revenue increase of $238 millionfor service rendered on or after December 17, 2015. The rate order also provided for a reduction of the return on equity from 105%to 103%on a capital structure of 50%debt and 50%equity. On December 22, 2015, DTE Electric petitioned the MPSC for a rehearing and clarification of several issues related to the December 11, 2015 MPSC rate order. The three main issues addressed in the rehearing request were related to the recovery of the cost of the operating license for Fermi 3, the capitalization of the cost of tree trimming, and costs related to certain land and a building located near DTE Electric Detroit headquarters. On January 19, 2016, the MPSC issued an order authorizing DTE Electric to begin amortization of the cost of the Fermi 3 operating license over a 20-year period without a return on the unamortized balance. The MPSC denied the capitalization of the tree trimming costs and the cost related to the land and building. DTE Electric recorded a disallowance of $10 millionrelated to tree trim costs in the fourth quarter of 2015 which was previously capitalized as of September 30, 2015. The land and building have economic value independent of recovery through rates and therefore no impairment charge was recorded for these assets. The MPSC order also stated that any changes to the revenue deficiency will be addressed in a final rehearing order in this case84DTE Energy Company DTE Electric CompanyCombined Notes to Consolidated Financial StatementsContinued2016 Electric Rate Case FilingDTE Electric filed a rate case with the MPSC on February 1, 2016 requesting an increase in base rates of $344 millionbased on a projected twelve-month period ending July 31, 2017. The requested increase in base rates is due primarily to an increase in net plant resulting from infrastructure investments, environmental compliance, and reliability improvement projects. The rate filing also includes projected changes in sales, operation and maintenance expenses, and working capital. The rate filing also requests an increase in return on equity from 103%to 105%on a capital structure of 50%equity and 50%debt. DTE Electric anticipates self-implementing a rate increase in August 2016 with an MPSC order expected by February 2017.PSCR ProceedingsThe PSCR process is designed to allow DTE Electric to recover all of its power supply costs if incurred under reasonable and prudent policies and practices. DTE Electric power supply costs include fuel and related transportation costs, purchased and net interchange power costs, nitrogen oxide and sulfur dioxide emission allowances costs, urea costs, transmission costs, and MISO costs. The MPSC reviews these costs, policies, and practices for prudence in annual plan and reconciliation filings2012 PSCR Year In March 2013, DTE Electric filed its 2012 PSCR reconciliation that included purchased power costs related to the manual shutdown of the Fermi 2 nuclear power plant in June 2012 caused by the failure of oneof the plant twonon-safety related feed-water pumps. The plant was restarted on July 30, 2012, which restored production to approximately 68%of full capacity. In September 2013, the repair to the plant was completed and production was returned to full capacity. DTE Electric was able to purchase sufficient power from MISO to continue to provide uninterrupted service to customers. On June 30, 2015, the MPSC issued an order that disallowed approximately $19 millionof Fermi 2 related purchased power costs. DTE Electric recorded the impact of this disallowance in the second quarter of 2015.Customer SettlementIn July 2014, an industrial customer of DTE Electric filed a complaint with the MPSC alleging they had been overcharged for the period of February 2008 through March 2014, and sought payment from DTE Electric of $22 million, plus interest. In July 2015, the MPSC issued an order that found the customer is entitled to a refund in the amount of $20 million, plus interest calculated at 7%per annum. In July 2015, DTE Electric issued a customer refund of $25 million, inclusive of interest. Approximately $16 millionof the refund obligation is expected to be recovered through the PSCR and other regulatory mechanisms. DTE Electric does not expect this order to have a material impact to its Consolidated Statements of Operations2015 DTE Gas Rate Case FilingDTE Gas filed a rate case with the MPSC on December 18, 2015 requesting an increase in base rates of $183 millionbased on a projected twelve-month period ending October 31, 2017. The requested increase in base rates is due primarily to an increase in net plant of $800 million, inclusive of IRM capital investments being recovered through approved IRM surcharge filings. The rate filing also includes projected changes in sales, operation and maintenance expenses, and working capital. The rate filing also requests an increase in return on equity from 105%to 1075%on a capital structure of 52%equity and 48%debt. DTE Gas anticipates self-implementing a rate increase in November 2016 with an MPSC order expected by December 2016. Concurrent with the MPSC order in this rate case, the existing IRM surcharge will be terminated. However, in this rate case filing, DTE Gas requested to implement a new IRM surcharge to become effective in January 2017.DTE Gas IRMIn November 2014, DTE Gas filed an application with the MPSC for approval of an increased IRM surcharge to recover an additional $47 millionof annual capital expenditures in 2016 and 2017 for its gas main renewal program. In November 2015, the MPSC issued an order authorizing an expansion of its gas main renewal program and an increase in the IRM surcharge of $16 millionfor 2016 and $31 millionfor 2017. The 2017 increase is subject to a reduction to the 2016 level if the 2016 target is not met. The IRM surcharge authorized by the order in this filing will become effective in July 2016 and will be terminated upon the implementation of base rates requested in the December 18, 2015 rate case filing85DTE Energy Company DTE Electric CompanyCombined Notes to Consolidated Financial StatementsContinuedNOTE 9 INCOME TAXESIncome Tax SummaryDTE Energy files a consolidated federal income tax return. DTE Electric is a part of the consolidated federal income tax return of DTE Energy. DTE Energy and its subsidiaries file consolidated and/or separate company income tax returns in various states and localities, including a consolidated return in the State of Michigan. DTE Electric is part of the Michigan consolidated income tax return of DTE Energy. The federal, state and local income tax expense for DTE Electric is determined on an individual company basis with no allocation of tax expenses or benefits from other affiliates of DTE Energy. DTE Electric had an income tax receivable from DTE Energy of $6 millionand $29 millionat December31, 2015and 2014, respectively.The Registrants' total Income Tax Expense varied from the statutory federal income tax rate for the following reasons:201520142013DTE EnergyIn millionsIncome Before Income Taxes$950$1,275$922Income tax expense at 35% statutory rate$333$446$323Production tax  tax  - Equity875Employee Stock Ownership Plan dividends544Domestic production activities deduction14State and local income taxes, net of federal benefit355137Enactment of New York Corporate Income Tax Legislation, net of federal benefit8Other, net815Income Tax Expense$230$364$254Effective income tax  ElectricIn millionsIncome Before Income Taxes$836$830$741Income tax expense at 35% statutory rate$293$291$260Production tax credits312215Investment tax  - Equity775Employee Stock Ownership Plan dividends332Domestic production activities deduction218State and local income taxes, net of federal benefit434341Other, net15Income Tax Expense$292$298$254Effective income tax rate349%359%343%86DTE Energy Company DTE Electric CompanyCombined Notes to Consolidated Financial  of the Registrants' Income Tax Expense were as follows:201520142013DTE EnergyIn millionsCurrent income tax expense  and other income tax42416Total current income taxes7890Deferred income tax expenseFederal178289122State and other income tax596742Total deferred income  ElectricIn millionsCurrent income tax expense  and other income tax22023Total current income taxes281146Deferred income tax expenseFederal25225168State and other income tax684640Total deferred income  tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the estimated future tax effect of temporary differences between the tax basis of assets or liabilities and the reported amounts in the Consolidated Financial Statements. Consistent with rate making treatment, deferred taxes are offset in the tables below for temporary differences which have related Regulatory assets and liabilities.The Registrants' deferred tax assets liabilities were comprised of the following at December 31:DTE EnergyDTE Electric2015201420152014In millionsProperty, plant, and  regulatory assets5253Tax credit carry-forwards46529653Pension and  net operating loss carry-forward177142State and local net operating loss  in equity method  valuation allowance3531Long-term deferred income tax  income tax  income tax  Energy Company DTE Electric CompanyCombined Notes to Consolidated Financial StatementsContinuedTax credit carry forwards for DTE Energy include $181 millionof general business credits that expire from 2034through 2035and $284 millionof alternative minimum tax credits that may be carried forward indefinitely. The alternative minimum tax credits are production tax credits earned prior to 2006 but not utilized. The majority of these alternative minimum tax credits were generated from projects that had received a private letter ruling PLR from the IRS. These PLRs provide assurance as to the appropriateness of using these credits to offset taxable income, however, these tax credits are subject to IRS audit and adjustment.DTE Energy has a federal net operating loss carry-forward available for use on the tax return of $517 millionas of December31, 2015, which includes approximately $9 millionrelated to windfall tax benefits attributable to stock-based compensation for which a benefit will be recorded in additional paid-in capital if and when realized. The federal net operating loss carry-forward expires in 2035. No valuation allowance is required for the federal net operating loss deferred tax asset. The above tables exclude unamortized investment tax credits that are shown separately on the Registrants' Consolidated Statements of Financial Position. Investment tax credits are deferred and amortized to income over the average life of the related property.DTE Energy has state and local deferred tax assets related to net operating loss carry-forwards of $63 millionand $39 millionat December31, 2015and 2014, respectively. The state and local net operating loss carry-forwards expire from 2016through 2035. DTE Energy has recorded valuation allowances at December31, 2015and 2014of approximately $35 millionand $31 million, respectively, with respect to these deferred tax assets. In assessing the realizability of deferred tax assets, DTE Energy considers whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. The ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which those temporary differences become deductible.DTE Electric has state and local deferred tax assets related to net operating loss carry-forwards of $16 millionat December31, 2015, while there was nostate and local deferred tax asset related to net operating loss carry-forwards at December31, 2014. No valuation allowance is required for DTE Electric state and local net operating loss carry-forwards.Uncertain Tax PositionsA reconciliation of the beginning and ending amount of unrecognized tax benefits for the Registrants is as follows:201520142013DTE EnergyIn millionsBalance at January 1$9$10$11Lapse of statute of limitations611Balance at December 31$3$9$10201520142013DTE ElectricIn millionsBalance at January 1$4$4$4Balance at December 31$4$4$4DTE Energy had $2 millionof unrecognized tax benefits at December31, 2015and 2014, that, if recognized, would favorably impact its effective tax rate.

DTE Electric does not anticipate any material decrease in unrecognized tax benefits in the next twelve months.The Registrants recognize interest and penalties pertaining to income taxes in Interest expense and Other expenses, respectively, on their Consolidated Statements of Operations. Accrued interest pertaining to income taxes for both DTE Energy and DTE Electric totaled $1 millionat December31, 2015and 2014. The Registrants had noaccrued penalties pertaining to income taxes. The Registrants recognized interest expense income related to income taxes of a nominal amount in 2015, 2014, and 201388DTE Energy Company DTE Electric CompanyCombined Notes to Consolidated Financial StatementsContinuedIn 2015, DTE Energy, including DTE Electric, settled a federal tax audit for the 2013tax year. DTE Energy federal income tax returns for 2014and subsequent years remain subject to examination by the IRS. DTE Energy MBT and MCIT returns for the year 2008 and subsequent years remain subject to examination by the State of Michigan. DTE Energy also files tax returns in numerous state and local jurisdictions with varying statutes of limitation.NOTE 10 EARNINGS PER SHAREDTE Energy reports both basic and diluted earnings per share. The calculation of diluted earnings per share assumes the issuance of potentially dilutive common shares outstanding during the period from the exercise of stock options.

Fair value is a market-based measurement that is determined based on inputs, which refer broadly to assumptions that market participants use in pricing assets or liabilities. These inputs can be readily observable, market corroborated, or generally unobservable inputs. The Registrants make certain assumptions they believe that market participants would use in pricing assets or liabilities, including assumptions about risk, and the risks inherent in the inputs to valuation techniques. Credit risk of the Registrants and their counterparties is incorporated in the valuation of assets and liabilities through the use of credit reserves, the impact of which was immaterial at December31, 2015and 2014. The Registrants believe they use valuation techniques that maximize the use of observable market-based inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs89DTE Energy Company DTE Electric CompanyCombined Notes to Consolidated Financial StatementsContinuedA fair value hierarchy has been established that prioritizes the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value in three broad levels. The fair value hierarchy gives the highest priority to quoted prices unadjusted in active markets for identical assets or liabilities Level1and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs Level3. In some cases, the inputs used to measure fair value might fall in different levels of the fair value hierarchy. All assets and liabilities are required to be classified in their entirety based on the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement in its entirety. Assessing the significance of a particular input may require judgment considering factors specific to the asset or liability, and may affect the valuation of the asset or liability and its placement within the fair value hierarchy. The Registrants classify fair value balances based on the fair value hierarchy defined as follows:Level1Consists of unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that the Registrants have the ability to access as of the reporting date.Level2Consists of inputs other than quoted prices included within Level1 that are directly observable for the asset or liability or indirectly observable through corroboration with observable market data.Level3Consists of unobservable inputs for assets or liabilities whose fair value is estimated based on internally developed models or methodologies using inputs that are generally less readily observable and supported by little, if any, market activity at the measurement date. Unobservable inputs are developed based on the best available information and subject to cost-benefit constraints90DTE Energy Company DTE Electric CompanyCombined Notes to Consolidated Financial StatementsContinuedThe following table presents assets and liabilities for DTE Energy measured and recorded at fair value on a recurring basis as of December31, 2015and 2014:December 31, 2015December 31, 2014Level 1Level 2Level 3Netting aNet BalanceLevel 1Level 2Level 3Netting aNet BalanceIn millionsAssets:Cash equivalents  decommissioning  investments c14914910050150Derivative assets:Commodity Contracts:Natural  derivative contracts d1293431Total derivative  liabilities:Commodity Contracts:Natural  derivative contracts d77532Total derivative  Assets Liabilities at the end of the     Assets Liabilities at the end of the  represent the impact of master netting agreements that allow DTE Energy to net gain and loss positions and cash collateral held or placed with the same counterparties.bAt December31, 2015, available-for-sale securities of $16 millionincluded $8 millionand $8 millionof cash equivalents included in Restricted cash and Other investments on DTE Energy Consolidated Statements of Financial Position, respectively.

The cash equivalents shown in the fair value table are comprised of short-term investments and money market funds.Nuclear Decommissioning Trusts and Other InvestmentsThe nuclear decommissioning trusts and other investments hold debt and equity securities directly and indirectly through institutional mutual funds. Exchange-traded debt and equity securities held directly are valued using quoted market prices in actively traded markets. The institutional mutual funds hold exchange-traded equity or debt securities and are valued based on stated NAVs. Non-exchange-traded fixed income securities are valued based upon quotations available from brokers or pricing services. A primary price source is identified by asset type, class, or issue for each security. The trustee monitors prices supplied by pricing services and may use a supplemental price source or change the primary price source of a given security if the trustee determines that another price source is considered to be preferable. The Registrants have obtained an understanding of how these prices are derived, including the nature and observability of the inputs used in deriving such prices. Additionally, the Registrants selectively corroborate the fair value of securities by comparison of market-based price sources. Investment policies and procedures are determined by DTE Energy Trust Investments Department which reports to DTE Energy Vice President and Treasurer92DTE Energy Company DTE Electric CompanyCombined Notes to Consolidated Financial  Assets and LiabilitiesDerivative assets and liabilities are comprised of physical and financial derivative contracts, including futures, forwards, options, and swaps that are both exchange-traded and over-the-counter traded contracts. Various inputs are used to value derivatives depending on the type of contract and availability of market data. Exchange-traded derivative contracts are valued using quoted prices in active markets. The Registrants consider the following criteria in determining whether a market is considered active: frequency in which pricing information is updated, variability in pricing between sources or over time, and the availability of public information. Other derivative contracts are valued based upon a variety of inputs including commodity market prices, broker quotes, interest rates, credit ratings, default rates, market-based seasonality, and basis differential factors. The Registrants monitor the prices that are supplied by brokers and pricing services and may use a supplemental price source or change the primary price source of an index if prices become unavailable or another price source is determined to be more representative of fair value. The Registrants have obtained an understanding of how these prices are derived. Additionally, the Registrants selectively corroborate the fair value of their transactions by comparison of market-based price sources. Mathematical valuation models are used for derivatives for which external market data is not readily observable, such as contracts which extend beyond the actively traded reporting period. The Registrants have established a Risk Management Committee whose responsibilities include directly or indirectly ensuring all valuation methods are applied in accordance with predefined policies. The development and maintenance of the Registrants' forward price curves has been assigned to DTE Energy Risk Management Department, which is separate and distinct from the trading functions within DTE Energy.The following table presents the fair value reconciliation of Level3 assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis for DTE Energy for the years ended December31, 2015and 2014:Year Ended December 31, 2015Year Ended December 31, 2014Natural  GasElectricityOtherTotalIn millionsNet Assets Liabilities as of  into Level 3 from Level 2Transfers from Level 3 into Level 222Total gains losses:Included in  in Regulatory  issuances, and  Assets Liabilities as of  amount of total gains losses included in Net Income attributed to the change in unrealized gains losses related to assets and liabilities held at December 31, 2015 and 2014 and reflected in Operating Revenues Non-utility operations and Fuel, purchased power, and gas non-utility in DTE Energy Consolidated Statements of  Energy Company DTE Electric CompanyCombined Notes to Consolidated Financial StatementsContinuedThe following table presents the fair value reconciliation of Level3 assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis for DTE Electric for the years ended December31, 2015and 2014:Year Ended December 31,20152014In millionsNet Assets as of December 31$3$3Change in fair value recorded in Regulatory  issuances, and  Assets as of December 31$3$3The amount of total gains losses included in Regulatory assets and liabilities attributed to the change in unrealized gains losses related to assets and liabilities held at December 31, 2015 and 2014 and reflected in DTE Electric Consolidated Statements of Financial Position$3$3Derivatives are transferred between levels primarily due to changes in the source data used to construct price curves as a result of changes in market liquidity.

Certain basis prices i.e., the difference in pricing between two locations included in the valuation of natural gas and electricity contracts were deemed unobservable.The inputs listed above would have a direct impact on the fair values of the above security types if they were adjusted. A significant increase decrease in the basis price would result in a higher lower fair value for long positions, with offsetting impacts to short positions94DTE Energy Company DTE Electric CompanyCombined Notes to Consolidated Financial StatementsContinuedFair Value of Financial InstrumentsThe fair value of financial instruments included in the table below is determined by using quoted market prices when available. When quoted prices are not available, pricing services may be used to determine the fair value with reference to observable interest rate indexes. The Registrants have obtained an understanding of how the fair values are derived. The Registrants also selectively corroborate the fair value of their transactions by comparison of market-based price sources. Discounted cash flow analyses based upon estimated current borrowing rates are also used to determine fair value when quoted market prices are not available. The fair values of notes receivable, excluding capital leases, are generally estimated using discounted cash flow techniques that incorporate market interest rates as well as assumptions about the remaining life of the loans and credit risk. Depending on the information available, other valuation techniques may be used that rely on internal assumptions and models. Valuation policies and procedures for the Registrants are determined by DTE Energy Treasury Department which reports to DTE Energy Vice President and Treasurer.The following table presents the carrying amount and fair value of financial instruments for DTE Energy as of December31, 2015and 2014:December31, 2015December31, 2014CarryingFair ValueCarryingFair ValueAmountLevel 1Level 2Level 3AmountLevel 1Level 2Level 3In millionsNotes receivable, excluding capital    debt, excluding capital  following table presents the carrying amount and fair value of financial instruments for DTE Electric as of December31, 2015and 2014:December31, 2015December31, 2014CarryingFair ValueCarryingFair ValueAmountLevel 1Level 2Level 3AmountLevel 1Level 2Level 3In millionsNotes receivable, excluding capital leases$5 5$12 12Notes receivable  borrowings  borrowings  debt, excluding capital  further fair value information on financial and derivative instruments see Note 12to the Consolidated Financial Statements, Financial and Other Derivative Instruments.Nuclear Decommissioning TrustFundsDTE Electric has a legal obligation to decommission its nuclear power plants following the expiration of its operating licenses. This obligation is reflected as an ARO on DTE Electric Consolidated Statements of Financial Position. Rates approved by the MPSC provide for the recovery of decommissioning costs of Fermi 2 and the disposal of low-level radioactive waste. DTE Electric is continuing to fund FERC jurisdictional amounts for decommissioning even though explicit provisions are not included in FERC rates. See Note 7to the Consolidated Financial Statements, Asset Retirement Obligations95DTE Energy Company DTE Electric CompanyCombined Notes to Consolidated Financial StatementsContinuedThe following table summarizes DTE Electric fair value of the nuclear decommissioning trust fund assets:December 31, 2015December 31, 2014In millionsFermi 2$1,211$1,221Fermi 133Low-level radioactive waste2217Total$1,236$1,241The costs of securities sold are determined on the basis of specific identification.

Securities held in the Nuclear decommissioning trust funds are classified as available-for-sale. As DTE Electric does not have the ability to hold impaired investments for a period of time sufficient to allow for the anticipated recovery of market value, all unrealized losses are considered to be other-than-temporary impairments.Unrealized losses incurred by the Fermi 2 trust are recognized as a Regulatory asset.Other SecuritiesAt December31, 2015and 2014, the Registrants' securities were comprised primarily of money market and equity securities. There were nounrealized losses on available-for-sale securities which were reclassified out of Other comprehensive income loss and realized into Net Income for DTE Energy or DTE Electric during the years ended December31, 2015and 2014. Gains related to trading securities held at December31, 2015, 2014, and 2013were $1 million, $14 million, and $22 million, respectively, for DTE Energy, including $1 million, $12 million, and $19 million, respectively, relating to DTE Electric. The trading gains or losses related to the Rabbi Trust assets are allocated from DTE Energy to DTE Electric96DTE Energy Company DTE Electric CompanyCombined Notes to Consolidated Financial StatementsContinuedNOTE 12 FINANCIAL AND OTHER DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTSThe Registrants recognize all derivatives at their fair value as Derivative assets or liabilities on their respective Consolidated Statements of Financial Position unless they qualify for certain scope exceptions, including the normal purchases and normal sales exception. Further, derivatives that qualify and are designated for hedge accounting are classified as either hedges of a forecasted transaction or the variability of cash flows to be received or paid related to a recognized asset or liability cash flow hedge; or as hedges of the fair value of a recognized asset or liability or of an unrecognized firm commitment fair value hedge. For cash flow hedges, the portion of the derivative gain or loss that is effective in offsetting the change in the value of the underlying exposure is deferred in Accumulated other comprehensive income loss and later reclassified into earnings when the underlying transaction occurs. Gains or losses from the ineffective portion of cash flow hedges are recognized in earnings immediately. For fair value hedges, changes in fair values for the derivative and hedged item are recognized in earnings each period. For derivatives that do not qualify or are not designated for hedge accounting, changes in fair value are recognized in earnings each period.The Registrants' primary market risk exposure is associated with commodity prices, credit, and interest rates. The Registrants have risk management policies to monitor and manage market risks. The Registrants use derivative instruments to manage some of the exposure. DTE Energy uses derivative instruments for trading purposes in its Energy Trading segment. Contracts classified as derivative instruments include electricity, natural gas, oil, certain coal forwards, futures, options, swaps, and foreign currency exchange contracts. Items not classified as derivatives include natural gas inventory, pipeline transportation contracts, renewable energy credits, and natural gas storage assets.DTE Electric DTE Electric generates, purchases, distributes, and sells electricity. DTE Electric uses forward energy contracts to manage changes in the price of electricity and fuel. Substantially all of these contracts meet the normal purchases and normal sales exception and are therefore accounted for under the accrual method. Other derivative contracts are MTM and recoverable through the PSCR mechanism when settled. This results in the deferral of unrealized gains and losses as Regulatory assets or liabilities until realized.DTE Gas DTE Gas purchases, stores, transports, distributes and sells natural gas, and sells storage and transportation capacity. DTE Gas has fixed-priced contracts for portions of its expected natural gas supply requirements through March 2018. Substantially all of these contracts meet the normal purchases and normal sales exception and are therefore accounted for under the accrual method. DTE Gas may also sell forward transportation and storage capacity contracts. Forward transportation and storage contracts are generally not derivatives and are therefore accounted for under the accrual method.Gas Storage and PipelinesThis segment is primarily engaged in services related to the transportation and storage of natural gas. Primarily fixed-priced contracts are used in the marketing and management of transportation and storage services. Generally these contracts are not derivatives and are therefore accounted for under the accrual method.Power and Industrial Projects This segment manages and operates energy and pulverized coal projects, a coke battery, reduced emissions fuel projects, landfill gas recovery, and power generation assets. Primarily fixed-price contracts are used in the marketing and management of the segment assets. These contracts are generally not derivatives and are therefore accounted for under the accrual method.Energy Trading Commodity Price RiskEnergy Trading markets and trades electricity, natural gas physical products, and energy financial instruments, and provides energy and asset management services utilizing energy commodity derivative instruments. Forwards, futures, options, and swap agreements are used to manage exposure to the risk of market price and volume fluctuations in its operations. These derivatives are accounted for by recording changes in fair value to earnings unless hedge accounting criteria are met.Energy Trading Foreign Currency Exchange RiskEnergy Trading has foreign currency exchange forward contracts to economically hedge fixed Canadian dollar commitments existing under natural gas and power purchase and sale contracts and natural gas transportation contracts. DTE Energy enters into these contracts to mitigate price volatility with respect to fluctuations of the Canadian dollar relative to the U.S.dollar. These derivatives are accounted for by recording changes in fair value to earnings unless hedge accounting criteria are met.Corporate and Other Interest Rate RiskDTE Energy may use interest rate swaps, treasury locks, and other derivatives to hedge the risk associated with interest rate market volatility97DTE Energy Company DTE Electric CompanyCombined Notes to Consolidated Financial StatementsContinuedCredit RiskDTE Energy maintains credit policies that significantly minimize overall credit risk. These policies include an evaluation of potential customers and counterparties financial condition, including the viability of underlying productive assets, credit rating, collateral requirements, or other credit enhancements such as letters of credit or guarantees. DTE Energy generally uses standardized agreements that allow the netting of positive and negative transactions associated with a single counterparty. DTE Energy maintains a provision for credit losses based on factors surrounding the credit risk of its customers, historical trends, and other information. Based on DTE Energys credit policies and its December31, 2015provision for credit losses, DTE Energys exposure to counterparty nonperformance is not expected to have a material adverse effect on DTE Energy Consolidated Financial Statements.Derivative ActivitiesDTE Energy manages its MTM risk on a portfolio basis based upon the delivery period of its contracts and the individual components of the risks within each contract. Accordingly, it records and manages the energy purchase and sale obligations under its contracts in separate components based on the commodity e.g. electricity or natural gas, the product e.g. electricity for delivery during peak or off-peak hours, the delivery location e.g. by region, the risk profile e.g. forward or option, and the delivery period e.g. by month and year. The following describes the categories of activities represented by their operating characteristics and key risks:Asset Optimization Represents derivative activity associated with assets owned and contracted by DTE Energy, including forward natural gas purchases and sales, natural gas transportation, and storage capacity. Changes in the value of derivatives in this category typically economically offset changes in the value of underlying non-derivative positions, which do not qualify for fair value accounting. The difference in accounting treatment of derivatives in this category and the underlying non-derivative positions can result in significant earnings volatility.Marketing and OriginationRepresents derivative activity transacted by originating substantially hedged positions with wholesale energy marketers, producers, end-users, utilities, retail aggregators, and alternative energy suppliers.Fundamentals Based TradingRepresents derivative activity transacted with the intent of taking a view, capturing market price changes, or putting capital at risk. This activity is speculative in nature as opposed to hedging an existing exposure.OtherIncludes derivative activity at DTE Electric related to FTRs. Changes in the value of derivative contracts at DTE Electric are recorded as Derivative assets or liabilities, with an offset to Regulatory assets or liabilities as the settlement value of these contracts will be included in the PSCR mechanism when realized.The following table presents the fair value of derivative instruments as of December31, 2015and 2014for DTE Energy:December31, 2015December31,  millionsDerivatives not designated as hedging instruments:Foreign currency exchange  Contracts:Natural  derivatives not designated as hedging   Energy Company DTE Electric CompanyCombined Notes to Consolidated Financial StatementsContinuedThe following table presents the fair value of derivative instruments as of December31, 2015and 2014for DTE Electric:December 31,20152014In millionsFTRs Other current assets$3$3Total derivatives not designated as hedging instrument$3$3Certain of DTE Energy derivative positions are subject to netting arrangements which provide for offsetting of asset and liability positions as well as related cash collateral. Such netting arrangements generally do not have restrictions. Under such netting arrangements, DTE Energy offsets the fair value of derivative instruments with cash collateral received or paid for those contracts executed with the same counterparty, which reduces DTE Energy Total Assets and Liabilities. Cash collateral is allocated between the fair value of derivative instruments and customer accounts receivable and payable with the same counterparty on a pro rata basis to the extent there is exposure. Any cash collateral remaining, after the exposure is netted to zero, is reflected in Accounts receivable and Accounts payable as collateral paid or received, respectively.DTE Energy also provides and receives collateral in the form of letters of credit which can be offset against net Derivative assets and liabilities as well as Accounts receivable and payable. DTE Energy had issued letters of credit of approximately $7 millionat December31, 2015and 2014, which could be used to offset net Derivative liabilities. Letters of credit received from third parties which could be used to offset net Derivative assets were $2 millionand $5 millionat December31, 2015and 2014, respectively. Such balances of letters of credit are excluded from the tables below and are not netted with the recognized assets and liabilities in DTE Energy Consolidated Statements of Financial Position.For contracts with certain clearing agents the fair value of derivative instruments is netted against realized positions with the net balance reflected as either 1 a Derivative asset or liability or 2 an Account receivable or payable. Other than certain clearing agents, Accounts receivable and Accounts payable that are subject to netting arrangements have not been offset against the fair value of Derivative assets and liabilities. Certain contracts that have netting arrangements have not been offset in DTE Energy Consolidated Statements of Financial Position. The impact of netting these derivative instruments and cash collateral related to such contracts is not material. Only the gross amounts for these derivative instruments are included in the table below.For DTE Energy, the total cash collateral posted, net of cash collateral received, was $37 millionand $61 millionas of December31, 2015and 2014, respectively.

These contracts contain provisions which allow the counterparties to require that DTE Energy post cash or letters of credit as collateral in the event that DTE Energys credit rating is downgraded below investment grade. Certain of these provisions known as hard triggers state specific circumstances under which DTE Energy can be required to post collateral upon the occurrence of a credit downgrade, while other provisions known as soft triggers are not as specific. For contracts with soft triggers, it is difficult to estimate the amount of collateral which may be requested by counterparties and/or which DTE Energy may ultimately be required to post. The amount of such collateral which could be requested fluctuates based on commodity prices primarily natural gas, power, and coal and the provisions and maturities of the underlying transactions. As of December31, 2015, DTE Energy contractual obligation to post collateral in the form of cash or letters of credit in the event of a downgrade to below investment grade, under both hard trigger and soft trigger provisions, was approximately $412 million.As of December31, 2015, DTE Energy had approximately $592 millionof derivatives in net liability positions, for which hard triggers exist. Collateral of approximately $5 millionhas been posted against such liabilities, including cash and letters of credit. Associated derivative net asset positions for which contractual offset exists were approximately $500 million.

Borrowings under the facilities are available at prevailing short-term interest rates. Additionally, DTE Energy has other facilities to support letter of credit issuance.The agreements require DTE Energy, DTE Electric, and DTE Gas to maintain a total funded debt to capitalization ratio of no more than 065to 1. In the agreements, total funded debt means all indebtedness of each respective company and their consolidated subsidiaries, including capital lease obligations, hedge agreements, and guarantees of third parties debt, but excluding contingent obligations, nonrecourse and junior subordinated debt, and certain equity-linked securities and, except for calculations at the end of the second quarter, certain DTE Gas short-term debt. Capitalization means the sum of atotal funded debt plus bconsolidated net worth, which is equal to consolidated total equity of each respective company and their consolidated subsidiaries excluding pension effects under certain FASB statements, as determined in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. At December31, 2015, the total funded debt to total capitalization ratios for DTE Energy, DTE Electric, and DTE Gas were 051to 1, 051to 1, and 048to 1, respectively, and are in compliance with this financial covenant.The availability under the facilities in place at December31, 2015is shown in the following table:DTE EnergyDTE ElectricDTE GasTotalIn millionsUnsecured letter of credit facility, expiring in February 2017$100 100Unsecured letter of credit facility, expiring in September 20177070Unsecured revolving credit facility, expiring April  outstanding at December31, 2015Commercial paper issuances33272194499Letters of credit130130163272194629Net availability at December31, 2015$1,207$128$106$1,441DTE Energy has other outstanding letters of credit which are not included in the above described facilities totaling approximately $17 millionwhich are used for various corporate purposes.The weighted average interest rate for short-term borrowings was 06%and 04%at December31, 2015and 2014, respectively, for DTE Energy.

DTE Energy has a demand financing agreement for up to $100 millionwith its clearing agent. The agreement, as amended, also allows for up to $50 millionof additional margin financing provided that DTE Energy posts a letter of credit for the incremental amount and allows the right of setoff with posted collateral. At December31, 2015, a $25 millionletter of credit was in place, raising the capacity under this facility to $125 million. The $25 millionletter of credit is included in the table above. The amount outstanding under this agreement was $103 millionand $37 millionat December31, 2015and 2014, respectively and was fully offset by the posted collateral.Dividend RestrictionsCertain of DTE Energys credit facilities contain a provision requiring DTE Energy to maintain a total funded debt to capitalization ratio, as defined in the agreements, of no more than 065to 1, which has the effect of limiting the amount of dividends DTE Energy can pay in order to maintain compliance with this provision. At December31, 2015, the effect of this provision was to restrict the payment of approximately $920 millionof Retained earnings totaling $48 billion. There are noother effective limitations with respect to DTE Energys ability to pay dividends.NOTE 16 CAPITAL AND OPERATING LEASESLessee- Operating Lease The Registrants lease various assets under operating leases, including coal railcars, office buildings, a warehouse, computers, vehicles, and other equipment.

The EPA and the State of Michigan have issued emission reduction regulations relating to ozone, fine particulate, regional haze, mercury, and other air pollution. These rules have led to controls on fossil-fueled power plants to reduce nitrogen oxide, sulfur dioxide, mercury and other emissions. Additional rulemakings are expected over the next few years which could require additional controls for sulfur dioxide, nitrogen oxides, and hazardous air pollutants.The Cross State Air Pollution Rule CSAPR, required further reductions of sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxides emissions beginning in January 2015. DTE Electric expects to meet its obligations under CSAPR. In November 2015, the EPA proposed an update to the CSAPR ozone season program by issuing the CSAPR Update Rule. The proposed rule was subsequently published in the Federal Register in December 2015. Beginning in 2017, this proposal would reduce summertime May - September emissions of oxides of nitrogen NOX from power plants in 23states in the eastern half of the U.S., including DTE Energy facilities. The CSAPR Update Rule is intended to reduce air quality impacts of the interstate transport of air pollution on downwind areas' ability to meet the 2008 ozone standard and to respond to the July 2015 remand of certain CSAPR budgets by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit. EPA expects to promulgate the final rule in the summer of 2016. It is not possible to quantify the impact of this rulemaking at this time106DTE Energy Company DTE Electric CompanyCombined Notes to Consolidated Financial StatementsContinuedThe Mercury and Air Toxics Standards MATS rule, formerly known as the Electric Generating Unit Maximum Achievable Control Technology EGU MACT Rule was finalized in December 2011. The MATS rule required reductions of mercury and other hazardous air pollutants beginning in April 2015. DTE Electric requested and was granted compliance date extensions for all relevant units to April 2016. DTE Electric has tested several technologies as MATS compliance alternatives to Flue Gas Desulfurization FGD systems to determine technological and economic feasibility. Dry Sorbent Injection DSI and Activated Carbon Injection ACI technologies were deemed feasible and their implementation will allow units that would not have been economical for FGD installations to continue operation in compliance with MATS. In November 2014, the U.S. Supreme Court agreed to review a challenge to the MATS rule based on a narrowly focused question of how the EPA considered costs in regulating air pollutants emitted by electric utilities. In June 2015, the U.S. Supreme Court reversed the decision of the Court of Appeals for the D.C. District and remanded the MATS rule to the Court of Appeals for further consideration based on their decision that the EPA must consider costs prior to deciding to regulate under the provisions of the Clean Air Act. Subsequently, in December 2015, the Court of Appeals ordered a remand of the MATS rule back to the EPA without staying the rule. DTE Electric does not expect this decision to have a material effect on its compliance plans at this time.The EPA proposed revised air quality standards for ground level ozone in November 2014 and specifically requested comments on the form and level of the ozone standards. The standards were finalized in October 2015. The State of Michigan will recommend designations by October 2016 and the EPA will finalize designations by October 2017. DTE Electric cannot predict the financial impact of the revised ozone standards at this time.In July 2009, DTE Energy received a NOV/FOV from the EPA alleging, among other things, that fiveDTE Electric power plants violated New Source Performance standards, Prevention of Significant Deterioration requirements, and operating permit requirements under the Clean Air Act. In June 2010, the EPA issued a NOV/FOV making similar allegations related to a project and outage at Unit 2 of the Monroe Power Plant. In March 2013, DTE Energy received a supplemental NOV from the EPA relating to the July 2009 NOV/FOV. The supplemental NOV alleged additional violations relating to the New Source Review provisions under the Clean Air Act, among other things.In August 2010, the U.S. Department of Justice, at the request of the EPA, brought a civil suit in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Michigan against DTE Energy and DTE Electric, related to the June 2010 NOV/FOV and the outage work performed at Unit 2 of the Monroe Power Plant, but not relating to the July 2009 NOV/FOV. Among other relief, the EPA requested the court to require DTE Electric to install and operate the best available control technology at Unit 2 of the Monroe Power Plant. Further, the EPA requested the court to issue a preliminary injunction to require DTE Electric to i begin the process of obtaining the necessary permits for the Monroe Unit 2 modification and ii offset the pollution from Monroe Unit 2 through emissions reductions from DTE Electric fleet of coal-fired power plants until the new control equipment is operating. In August 2011, the U.S. District Court judge granted DTE Energy motion for summary judgment in the civil case, dismissing the case and entering judgment in favor of DTE Energy and DTE Electric. In October 2011, the EPA caused to be filed a Notice of Appeal to the Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit. In March 2013, the Court of Appeals remanded the case to the U.S. District Court for review of the procedural component of the New Source Review notification requirements. In September 2013, the EPA caused to be filed a motion seeking leave to amend their complaint regarding the June 2010 NOV/FOV adding additional claims related to outage work performed at the Trenton Channel and Belle River power plants as well as additional claims related to work performed at the Monroe Power Plant. In addition, the Sierra Club caused to be filed a motion to add a claim regarding the River Rouge Power Plant. In March 2014, the U.S. District Court judge granted again DTE Energy motion for summary judgment dismissing the civil case related to Monroe Unit 2. In April 2014, the U.S. District Court judge granted motions filed by the EPA and the Sierra Club to amend their New Source Review complaint adding additional claims for Monroe Units 1, 2 and 3, Belle River Units 1 and 2, Trenton Channel Unit 9 and denied the claims related to River Rouge Power Plant that were brought by the Sierra Club. In June 2014, the EPA filed a motion requesting certification for appeal of the March 2014 summary judgment decision. In October 2014, the EPA and the U.S. Department of Justice filed the anticipated notice of appeal of the U.S. District Court judge dismissal of the Monroe Unit 2 case. The amended New Source Review claims are all stayed until the appeal is resolved by the Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit. Oral arguments for the appeal occurred in December 2015.The Registrants believe that the plants and generating units identified by the EPA and the Sierra Club have complied with all applicable federal environmental regulations. Depending upon the outcome of discussions with the EPA regarding the twoNOVs/FOVs, DTE Electric could be required to install additional pollution control equipment at some or all of the power plants in question, implement early retirement of facilities where control equipment is not economical, engage in supplemental environmental programs, and/or pay fines. The Registrants cannot predict the financial impact or outcome of this matter, or the timing of its resolution107DTE Energy Company DTE Electric CompanyCombined Notes to Consolidated Financial StatementsContinuedThe EPA is implementing regulatory actions under the Clean Air Act to address emissions of GHGs from the utility sector and other sectors of the economy. Among these actions, the EPA has finalized performance standards for emissions of carbon dioxide from new and existing electric generating units EGUs. The carbon standards for new sources are not expected to have a material impact on DTE Electric, since DTE Electric has no plans to build new coal-fired generation and any potential new gas generation will be able to comply with the standards. It is not possible to determine the potential impact of the final carbon standards also known as the EPA Clean Power Plan on existing sources at this time. Pending or future legislation or other regulatory actions could have a material impact on DTE Electric operations and financial position and the rates charged to its customers. Impacts include expenditures for environmental equipment beyond what is currently planned, financing costs related to additional capital expenditures, the purchase of emission credits from market sources, higher costs of purchased power, and the retirement of facilities where control equipment is not economical. DTE Electric would seek to recover these incremental costs through increased rates charged to its utility customers, as authorized by the MPSC.To comply with air pollution requirements, DTE Electric spent approximately $23 billionthrough 2015. DTE Electric estimates making capital expenditures of approximately $40 millionin 2016.Water In response to an EPA regulation, DTE Electric would be required to examine alternatives for reducing the environmental impacts of the cooling water intake structures at several of its facilities. Based on the results of completed studies and expected future studies, DTE Electric may be required to install technologies to reduce the impacts of the water intake structures. A final rule became effective in October 2015. The final rule requires studies to be completed by April 2018 to determine the type of technology needed to reduce impacts to fish. DTE Electric has initiated the process of completing the required studies. Final compliance for the installation of any required technology will be determined by each state on a case by case, site specific basis. DTE Electric is currently evaluating the compliance options and working with the State of Michigan on evaluating whether any controls are needed. These evaluations/studies may require modifications to some existing intake structures. It is not possible to quantify the impact of this rulemaking at this time.Contaminated and Other Sites Prior to the construction of major interstate natural gas pipelines, gas for heating and other uses was manufactured locally from processes involving coal, coke, or oil. The facilities, which produced gas, have been designated as MGP sites. DTE Electric conducted remedial investigations at contaminated sites, including threeformer MGP sites. The investigations have revealed contamination related to the by-products of gas manufacturing at each MGP site. In addition to the MGP sites, DTE Electric is also in the process of cleaning up other contaminated sites, including the area surrounding an ash landfill, electrical distribution substations, electric generating power plants, and underground and aboveground storage tank locations. The findings of these investigations indicated that the estimated cost to remediate these sites is expected to be incurred over the next several years. At December31, 2015and 2014, DTE Electric had $8 millionand $10 millionaccrued for remediation, respectively. Any change in assumptions, such as remediation techniques, nature and extent of contamination, and regulatory requirements, could impact the estimate of remedial action costs for the sites and affect DTE Electrics financial position and cash flows. DTE Electric believes the likelihood of a material change to the accrued amount is remote based on current knowledge of the conditions at each site.Coal Combustion Residuals and Effluent Limitations Guidelines A final EPA rule for the disposal of coal combustion residuals, commonly known as coal ash became effective in October 2015. The rule is based on the continued listing of coal ash as a non-hazardous waste and relies on various self-implementation design and performance standards. DTE Electric owns and operates threepermitted engineered coal ash storage facilities to dispose of coal ash from coal-fired power plants and operates a number of smaller impoundments at its power plants. At certain facilities, the rule requires the installation of monitoring wells, compliance with groundwater standards, and the closure of basins at the end of the useful life of the associated power plant. At other facilities, the rule requires ash laden waters be moved from earthen basins to steel and concrete tanks.In November 2015, the EPA finalized effluent limitations guidelines for the steam electric power generating industry which may require additional controls to be installed between 2018 and 2023. Certain effluent limitations guidelines requirements will be required to be performed in conjunction with the coal combustion residuals requirements. Costs associated with the building of new facilities over the next sevenyears to comply with coal combustion residuals requirements and effluent limitations guidelines are estimated to be approximately $290 million. See Note 7to the Consolidated Financial Statements, Asset Retirement Obligations, for estimated costs of closure of old facilities108DTE Energy Company DTE Electric CompanyCombined Notes to Consolidated Financial StatementsContinuedDTE GasContaminated and Other Sites DTE Gas owns or previously owned, 14former MGP sites. Investigations have revealed contamination related to the by-products of gas manufacturing at each site. Cleanup of fiveof the MGP sites is complete and the sites are closed. DTE Gas has also completed partial closure of twoadditional sites. Cleanup activities associated with the remaining sites will continue over the next several years. The MPSC has established a cost deferral and rate recovery mechanism for investigation and remediation costs incurred at former MGP sites. In addition to the MGP sites, DTE Gas is also in the process of cleaning up other contaminated sites, including gate stations, gas pipeline releases, and underground storage tank locations. As of December31, 2015and 2014, DTE Gas had $22 millionand $24 millionaccrued for remediation, respectively. Any change in assumptions, such as remediation techniques, nature and extent of contamination, and regulatory requirements, could impact the estimate of remedial action costs for the sites and affect DTE Gas' financial position and cash flows. DTE Gas anticipates the cost amortization methodology approved by the MPSC, which allows for amortization of the MGP costs over a ten-year period beginning with the year subsequent to the year the MGP costs were incurred, will prevent environmental costs from having a material adverse impact on DTE Gas' results of operations.Non-utilityDTE Energys non-utility businesses are subject to a number of environmental laws and regulations dealing with the protection of the environment from various pollutants.The Michigan coke battery facility received and responded to information requests from the EPA that resulted in the issuance of a NOV in June 2007 alleging potential maximum achievable control technologies and new source review violations. The EPA is in the process of reviewing DTE Energys position of demonstrated compliance and has not initiated escalated enforcement. At this time, DTE Energy cannot predict the impact of this issue but expects no further action. Furthermore, the Michigan coke battery facility is the subject of an investigation by the MDEQ concerning visible emissions readings that resulted from DTE Energy self reporting to MDEQ questionable activities by an employee of a contractor hired by DTE Energy to perform the visible emissions readings. At this time, DTE Energy cannot predict the impact of this investigation.The Shenango coke battery received twoNOVs from the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection PADEP in 2010 alleging violations of the permit for the Pennsylvania coke battery facility in connection with coal pile storm water runoff. DTE Energy settled the alleged violations by implementing best management practices to address the issues and repair/upgrade its wastewater treatment plant. DTE Energy received a construction permit to upgrade its existing waste water treatment system. Due to the December 2015 decision to close the Shenango coke battery in January 2016, DTE Energy will not proceed with the upgrade to its wastewater treatment system.The Shenango coke battery received an NOV from the Allegheny County, PA Health Department pertaining to excessive opacity readings from fugitive sources in excess of its standards for the Pennsylvania coke battery facility. Fugitive sources at the plant are in full compliance with the applicable Federal Opacity Standards. DTE Energy agreed to a Consent Order and Agreement with Allegheny County pursuant to which DTE Energy paid a fine of $300,000and spent $300,000for a supplemental environmental project. In May 2014, the Group Against Smog Pollution GASP filed a complaint alleging that DTE Energy coke battery facility in Pennsylvania was in violation of visible emissions limits under the Federal Clean Air Act and/or Article XXI of the Allegheny County, PA Health Department Rules and Regulations. DTE Energy believed that the GASP suit was without merit and filed a motion to dismiss in July 2014. In March 2015, the U.S. District Court granted DTE Energy motion for dismissal. In April 2015, GASP filed a notice of appeal. In January 2016, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit affirmed the judgment of dismissal.OtherIn 2010, the EPA finalized a new 1-hour sulfur dioxide ambient air quality standard that requires states to submit plans for non-attainment areas to be in compliance by 2018. Michigan non-attainment area includes DTE Energy facilities in southwest Detroit and areas of Wayne County. Modeling runs by the MDEQ suggest that emission reductions may be required by significant sources of sulfur dioxide emissions in these areas, including DTE Electric power plants and DTE Energy Michigan coke battery facility. As part of the state implementation plan process, DTE Energy has worked with MDEQ to develop air permits reflecting significant SO2 emission reductions that, in combination with other non-DTE Energy sources emission reduction strategies, will help the state attain the standard and sustain its attainment. Since several non-DTE Energy sources are also part of the proposed compliance plan, DTE Energy is unable to determine the full impact of the final required emissions reductions at this time109DTE Energy Company DTE Electric CompanyCombined Notes to Consolidated Financial StatementsContinuedNuclear OperationsProperty InsuranceDTE Electric maintains property insurance policies specifically for the Fermi 2 plant. These policies cover such items as replacement power and property damage. NEIL is the primary supplier of the insurance policies.DTE Electric maintains a policy for extra expenses, including replacement power costs necessitated by Fermi 2s unavailability due to an insured event. This policy has a 12-week waiting period and provides an aggregate $490 millionof coverage over a three-year period.DTE Electric has $15 billionin primary coverage and $125 billionof excess coverage for stabilization, decontamination, debris removal, repair and/or replacement of property, and decommissioning. The combined coverage limit for total property damage is $275 billion. The total limit for property damage for non-nuclear events is $2 billionand an aggregate of $328 millionof coverage for extra expenses over a two-year period.On January 13, 2015, the Terrorism Risk Insurance Program Reauthorization Act of 2015 was signed, extending TRIA through December 31, 2020. For multiple terrorism losses caused by acts of terrorism not covered under the TRIA occurring within oneyear after the first loss from terrorism, the NEIL policies would make available to all insured entities up to $32 billion, plus any amounts recovered from reinsurance, government indemnity, or other sources to cover losses.Under NEIL policies, DTE Electric could be liable for maximum assessments of up to approximately $45 millionper event if the loss associated with any one event at any nuclear plant should exceed the accumulated funds available to NEIL.Public Liability InsuranceAs required by federal law, DTE Electric maintains $375 millionof public liability insurance for a nuclear incident. For liabilities arising from a terrorist act outside the scope of TRIA, the policy is subject to one industry aggregate limit of $300 million. Further, under the Price-Anderson Amendments Act of 2005, deferred premium charges up to $127 millioncould be levied against each licensed nuclear facility, but not more than $19 millionper year per facility. Thus, deferred premium charges could be levied against all owners of licensed nuclear facilities in the event of a nuclear incident at any of these facilities.Nuclear Fuel Disposal CostsIn accordance with the Federal Nuclear Waste Policy Act of 1982, DTE Electric has a contract with the DOE for the future storage and disposal of spent nuclear fuel from Fermi 2 that required DTE Electric to pay the DOE a fee of 1mill per kWh of Fermi 2 electricity generated and sold. The fee was a component of nuclear fuel expense. The DOE Yucca Mountain Nuclear Waste Repository program for the acceptance and disposal of spent nuclear fuel was terminated in 2011. DTE Electric is a party in the litigation against the DOE for both past and future costs associated with the DOE failure to accept spent nuclear fuel under the timetable set forth in the Federal Nuclear Waste Policy Act of 1982. In July 2012, DTE Electric executed a settlement agreement with the federal government for costs associated with the DOE delay in acceptance of spent nuclear fuel from Fermi 2 for permanent storage. The settlement agreement, including extensions, provides for a claims process and payment of delay-related costs experienced by DTE Electric through 2016. DTE Electric claims are being settled and paid on a timely basis. The settlement proceeds reduce the cost of the dry cask storage facility assets and provide reimbursement for related operating expenses. The 1mill per kWh DOE fee was reduced to zeroeffective May 16, 2014.DTE Electric currently employs a spent nuclear fuel storage strategy utilizing a fuel pool and a newly completed dry cask storage facility. The dry cask storage facility is expected to provide sufficient spent fuel storage capability for the life of the plant as defined by the original operating license.The federal government continues to maintain its legal obligation to accept spent nuclear fuel from Fermi 2 for permanent storage. Issues relating to long-term waste disposal policy and to the disposition of funds contributed by DTE Electric ratepayers to the federal waste fund await future governmental action110DTE Energy Company DTE Electric CompanyCombined Notes to Consolidated Financial  Fuel GuaranteesDTE Energy discontinued the operations of its synthetic fuel production facilities throughout the United States as of December31, 2007. DTE Energy provided certain guarantees and indemnities in conjunction with the sales of interests in its synfuel facilities. The guarantees cover potential commercial, environmental, oil price, and tax-related obligations that will survive until 90 daysafter expiration of all applicable statutes of limitations. DTE Energy estimates that its maximum potential liability under these guarantees at December31, 2015is approximately $850 million. Payment under these guarantees is considered remote.REF GuaranteesDTE Energy has provided certain guarantees and indemnities in conjunction with the sales of interests in or lease of its REF facilities. The guarantees cover potential commercial, environmental, and tax-related obligations that will survive until 90 daysafter expiration of all applicable statutes of limitations. DTE Energy estimates that its maximum potential liability under these guarantees at December31, 2015is approximately $268 million. Payment under these guarantees is considered remote.Other GuaranteesIn certain limited circumstances, the Registrants enter into contractual guarantees. The Registrants may guarantee another entitys obligation in the event it fails to perform and may provide guarantees in certain indemnification agreements. Finally, the Registrants may provide indirect guarantees for the indebtedness of others. DTE Energys guarantees are not individually material with maximum potential payments totaling $56 millionat December31, 2015. Payment under these guarantees is considered remote.DTE Energy is periodically required to obtain performance surety bonds in support of obligations to various governmental entities and other companies in connection with its operations. As of December31, 2015, DTE Energy had approximately $55 millionof performance bonds outstanding. In the event that such bonds are called for nonperformance, DTE Energy would be obligated to reimburse the issuer of the performance bond. DTE Energy is released from the performance bonds as the contractual performance is completed and does not believe that a material amount of any currently outstanding performance bonds will be called.Labor ContractsThere are several bargaining units for DTE Energy approximately 4,900represented employees, including DTE Electric approximately 2,600represented employees. The majority of the represented employees are under contracts that expire in 2016 and 2017.Purchase CommitmentsAs of December31, 2015, the Registrants were party to numerous long-term purchase commitments relating to a variety of goods and services required for their businesses. These agreements primarily consist of fuel supply commitments and renewable energy contracts for the Registrants, as well as energy trading contracts for DTE Energy. The Registrants estimate the following commitments from 2016through 2051for DTE Energy, and 2016through 2033for DTE Electric, as detailed in the following table:DTE EnergyDTE ElectricIn  and  Energy and DTE Electric expect that 2016annual capital expenditures and contributions to equity method investees will be approximately $27 billionand $16 billion, respectively. The Registrants have made certain commitments in connection with the estimated 2016annual capital expenditures and contributions to equity method investees111DTE Energy Company DTE Electric CompanyCombined Notes to Consolidated Financial  of the Registrants' customers and suppliers have filed for bankruptcy protection under the U.S. Bankruptcy Code. The Registrants regularly review contingent matters relating to these customers and suppliers and their purchase and sale contracts, and record provisions for amounts considered at risk of probable loss in the allowance for doubtful accounts. The Registrants believe their accrued amounts are adequate for probable loss.Michigan Sales and Use Tax LitigationIn 2010, the Michigan Department of Treasury finalized a sales and use tax audit of DTE Electric for the period from January 2003 to September 2006. It determined that DTE Electrics electric distribution equipment was not eligible for an industrial-processing exemption and therefore was subject to the use tax. DTE Electric paid the tax for the period under audit and filed a claim in the Michigan Court of Claims disputing the tax determination. DTE Electric has continued to apply an appropriate industrial-processing exemption percentage, where applicable, for purchases in the years subsequent to 2006.The Michigan Court of Claims found in favor of DTE Electric, and that determination was subsequently appealed to the Michigan Supreme Court. In July2015, the Michigan Supreme Court issued an opinion finding that DTE Electric was eligible for a partial industrial-processing exemption on its electric distribution equipment based on the proportion of exempt use of that equipment. The Supreme Court reversed the lower court decision in part and remanded the case to the Michigan Court of Claims. DTE Electric reached a settlement with the Michigan Department of Treasury in February 2016 and will receive a partial refund of amounts previously paid. Other ContingenciesThe Registrants are involved in certain other legal, regulatory, administrative, and environmental proceedings before various courts, arbitration panels, and governmental agencies concerning claims arising in the ordinary course of business. These proceedings include certain contract disputes, additional environmental reviews and investigations, audits, inquiries from various regulators, and pending judicial matters. The Registrants cannot predict the final disposition of such proceedings. The Registrants regularly review legal matters and record provisions for claims that they can estimate and are considered probable of loss. The resolution of these pending proceedings is not expected to have a material effect on the Registrants' Consolidated Financial Statements in the periods they are resolved.For a discussion of contingencies related to regulatory matters and derivatives see Notes 8 and 12to the Consolidated Financial Statements, Regulatory Matters and Financial and Other Derivative Instruments, respectively.NOTE 18 RETIREMENT BENEFITS AND TRUSTEED ASSETSPension Plan BenefitsDTE Energy has qualified defined benefit retirement plans for eligible represented and non-represented employees. The plans are noncontributory and provide traditional retirement benefits based on the employees years of benefit service, average final compensation, and age at retirement. In addition, certain represented and non-represented employees are covered under cash balance provisions that determine benefits on annual employer contributions and interest credits. DTE Energy also maintains supplemental nonqualified, noncontributory, retirement benefit plans for selected management employees. These plans provide for benefits that supplement those provided by DTE Energys other retirement plans.DTE Electric participates in various plans that provide pension and other postretirement benefits for DTE Energy and its affiliates. The plans are sponsored by DTE Energy Corporate Services, LLC LLC, a subsidiary of DTE Energy. DTE Electric is allocated net periodic benefit costs for its share of the amounts of the combined plans.Effective January 1, 2012 for the Registrants' non-represented employees, and in June 2011 for certain DTE Energy represented employees and March 2013 for the majority of DTE Electric represented employees, the Registrants discontinued offering a defined benefit retirement plan to newly hired employees. In its place, the Registrants will annually contribute an amount equivalent to 4%8%for certain DTE Gas represented employees of an employee eligible pay to the employee defined contribution retirement savings plan112DTE Energy Company DTE Electric CompanyCombined Notes to Consolidated Financial StatementsContinuedThe Registrants' policy is to fund pension costs by contributing amounts consistent with the provisions of the Pension Protection Act of 2006 and additional amounts when it deems appropriate. DTE Energy contributed $177 million, including $145 millionof DTE Electric contributions, to the qualified pension plans in 2015. At the discretion of management, and depending upon financial market conditions, DTE Energy anticipates making up to $180 millionin contributions, including $145 millionof DTE Electric contributions, to the pension plans in 2016.Net pension cost for DTE Energy includes the following components:201520142013In millionsService cost$100$83$94Interest cost210212192Expected return on plan  of net actuarial loss205157208Special termination benefits2Net pension cost$221$179$22820152014In millionsOther changes in plan assets and benefit obligations recognized in Regulatory assets and Other comprehensive income lossNet actuarial loss$19$805Amortization of net actuarial loss205157Prior service credit7Total recognized in Regulatory assets and Other comprehensive income loss$186$641Total recognized in net periodic pension cost, Regulatory assets, and Other comprehensive income loss$35$820Estimated amounts to be amortized from Regulatory assets and Accumulated other comprehensive income loss into net periodic benefit cost during next fiscal yearNet actuarial loss$162$206Net pension cost for DTE Electric includes the following components:201520142013In millionsService cost$77$64$73Interest cost160162146Expected return on plan  of:Net actuarial loss147110148Prior service cost121Special termination benefits1Net pension cost$176$144$184113DTE Energy Company DTE Electric CompanyCombined Notes to Consolidated Financial  millionsOther changes in plan assets and benefit obligations recognized in Regulatory assets and Other comprehensive income lossNet actuarial gain loss$13$614Amortization of net actuarial loss147110Prior service credit2Amortization of prior service cost12Total recognized in Regulatory assets and Other comprehensive income loss$161$500Total recognized in net periodic pension cost, Regulatory assets, and Other comprehensive income loss$15$644Estimated amounts to be amortized from Regulatory assets and Accumulated other comprehensive income loss into net periodic benefit cost during next fiscal yearNet actuarial loss$115$149Prior service cost$1$1The following table reconciles the obligations, assets, and funded status of the plans as well as the amounts recognized as prepaid pension cost or pension liability in the Registrants' Consolidated Statements of Financial Position at December 31:DTE EnergyDTE Electric2015201420152014In millionsAccumulated benefit obligation, end of  in projected benefit obligationProjected benefit obligation, beginning of  cost100837564Interest cost210212156162Plan amendments72Actuarial gain loss357836273634Transfer due to plan sponsorship change99Special termination benefits2Benefits  benefit obligation, end of  in plan assetsPlan assets at fair value, beginning of  return on plan assets7930156212Company  paid253235192181Plan assets at fair value, end of  status of the  recorded as:Current   recognized in Accumulated other comprehensive income loss, pre-taxNet actuarial loss$180$194$$44Prior service  recognized in Regulatory assets see Note 8 - Regulatory MattersNet actuarial  service cost  Energy Company DTE Electric CompanyCombined Notes to Consolidated Financial StatementsContinuedAt December31, 2015, the benefits related to the Registrants' qualified and nonqualified pension plans expected to be paid in each of the next five years and in the aggregate for the five fiscal years thereafter are as follows:DTE EnergyDTE ElectricIn  used in determining the projected benefit obligation and net pension costs of the Registrants are:201520142013Projected benefit obligationDiscount rate450%412%495%Rate of compensation increase465%465%420%Net pension costsDiscount rate412%495%415%Rate of compensation  long-term rate of return on plan assets775%775%825%The Registrants employ a formal process in determining the long-term rate of return for various asset classes. Management reviews historic financial market risks and returns and long-term historic relationships between the asset classes of equities, fixed income, and other assets, consistent with the widely accepted capital market principle that asset classes with higher volatility generate a greater return over the long-term. Current market factors such as inflation, interest rates, asset class risks, and asset class returns are evaluated and considered before long-term capital market assumptions are determined. The long-term portfolio return is also established employing a consistent formal process, with due consideration of diversification, active investment management, and rebalancing. Peer data is reviewed to check for reasonableness. As a result of this process, the Registrants have long-term rate of return assumptions for the pension plans of 775%and other postretirement benefit plans of 800%for 2016. The Registrants believe these rates are a reasonable assumption for the long-term rate of return on plan assets for 2016given the current investment strategy.The Registrants employ a total return investment approach whereby a mix of equities, fixed income, and other investments are used to maximize the long-term return on plan assets consistent with prudent levels of risk, with consideration given to the liquidity needs of the plan. Risk tolerance is established through consideration of future plan cash flows, plan funded status, and corporate financial considerations. The investment portfolio contains a diversified blend of equity, fixed income, and other investments. Furthermore, equity investments are diversified across U.S.and non-U.S.stocks, growth and value stocks, and large and small market capitalizations. Fixed income securities generally include market duration bonds of companies from diversified industries, mortgage-backed securities, non-U.S. securities, bank loans, and U.S.Treasuries. Pension assets include long duration U.S. government and diversified corporate bonds intended to partially mitigate liability volatility caused by changes in discount rates.

The program allows the agent to lend certain securities from the Registrants' pension trusts to selected entities against receipt of collateral in the form of cash as provided for and determined in accordance with their securities lending agency agreements117DTE Energy Company DTE Electric CompanyCombined Notes to Consolidated Financial StatementsContinuedThe pension trust holds debt and equity securities directly and indirectly through commingled funds and institutional mutual funds. Exchange-traded debt and equity securities held directly are valued using quoted market prices in actively traded markets. The commingled funds and institutional mutual funds hold exchange-traded equity or debt securities and are valued based on stated NAVs. Non-exchange traded fixed income securities are valued by the trustee based upon quotations available from brokers or pricing services. A primary price source is identified by asset type, class, or issue for each security. The trustee monitors prices supplied by pricing services and may use a supplemental price source or change the primary price source of a given security if the trustee challenges an assigned price and determines that another price source is considered to be preferable. The Registrants have obtained an understanding of how these prices are derived, including the nature and observability of the inputs used in deriving such prices.

The Registrants' policy is to fund certain trusts to meet its other postretirement benefit obligations. Separate qualified VEBA and other benefit trusts exist. DTE Energy contributed $199 millionto these trusts, including $175 millionof DTE Electric contributions, for the defined benefit other postretirement medical and life insurance benefit plans during 2015. At the discretion of management, DTE Energy anticipates making up to $20 millionof contributions, through contributions from DTE Gas, to the trusts in 2016.Starting in 2012, in lieu of offering future employees defined benefit post-employment health care and life insurance benefits, the Registrants allocate a fixed amount per year to an account in a defined contribution VEBA for each employee. These accounts are managed either by the Registrant for non-represented and certain represented groups or by the Utility Workers of America UWUA for Local 223 employees. DTE Energy contributions to the VEBA for these accounts were $5 millionin 2015, $4 millionin 2014, and $2 millionin 2013, including DTE Electric contributions of $3 millionin 2015, $2 millionin 2014, and $1 millionin 2013.Beginning in 2013, the Registrants replaced the defined benefit employer-sponsored retiree medical, prescription drug, and dental coverage with a notional allocation to a Retiree Reimbursement Account. This change applies to both current and future Medicare eligible non-represented and future represented retirees, spouses, surviving spouses, or same sex domestic partners when the youngest of the retiree covered household turns age 65. The amount of the annual allocation to each participant is determined by the employee retirement date, and increases each year for each eligible participant at the lower of the rate of medical inflation or 2%.Net other postretirement credit for DTE Energy includes the following components:201520142013In millionsService cost$34$34$47Interest cost818988Expected return on plan  of:Net actuarial loss432064Prior service credit126144131Net other postretirement  millionsOther changes in plan assets and accumulated postretirement benefit obligation recognized in Regulatory assets and Other comprehensive income lossNet actuarial gain loss$68$192Amortization of net actuarial loss4320Amortization of prior service credit126144Total recognized in Regulatory assets and Other comprehensive income loss$15$316Total recognized in net periodic benefit cost, Regulatory assets, and Other comprehensive income loss$84$193Estimated amounts to be amortized from Regulatory assets and Accumulated other comprehensive income loss into net periodic benefit cost during next fiscal yearNet actuarial loss$32$43Prior service credit$118$126119DTE Energy Company DTE Electric CompanyCombined Notes to Consolidated Financial StatementsContinuedNet other postretirement credit for DTE Electric includes the following components:201520142013In millionsService cost$25$26$35Interest cost626867Expected return on plan  of:Net actuarial loss311447Prior service credit95109100Net other postretirement  millionsOther changes in plan assets and accumulated postretirement benefit obligation recognized in Regulatory assets and Other comprehensive income lossNet actuarial gain loss$57$144Amortization of net actuarial loss3114Amortization of prior service credit95109Total recognized in Regulatory assets and Other comprehensive income loss$7$239Total recognized in net periodic benefit cost, Regulatory assets, and Other comprehensive income loss$60$153Estimated amounts to be amortized from Regulatory assets and Accumulated other comprehensive income loss into net periodic benefit cost during next fiscal year Net actuarial loss$22$31Prior service credit$89$94120DTE Energy Company DTE Electric CompanyCombined Notes to Consolidated Financial StatementsContinuedThe following table reconciles the obligations, assets, and funded status of the plans including amounts recorded as Accrued postretirement liability in the Registrants' Consolidated Statements of Financial Position at December 31:DTE EnergyDTE Electric2015201420152014In millionsChange in accumulated postretirement benefit obligationAccumulated postretirement benefit obligation, beginning of  cost34342526Interest cost81896268Actuarial gain loss224131166100Benefits  postretirement benefit obligation, end of  in plan assetsPlan assets at fair value, beginning of  return on plan assets25621941Company contributions19924175Benefits paid85856364Plan assets at fair value, end of  status, end of  recorded as:Noncurrent assets 24$Current liabilities11Noncurrent  recognized in Accumulated other comprehensive income loss, pre-taxNet actuarial loss$24$34$$Prior service credit25$22$29$$Amounts recognized in Regulatory assets see Note 8 - Regulatory MattersNet actuarial loss$387$488$297$385Prior service  December31, 2015, the benefits expected to be paid, including prescription drug benefits, in each of the next five years and in the aggregate for the five fiscal years thereafter for the Registrants are as follows:DTE EnergyDTE ElectricIn  Energy Company DTE Electric CompanyCombined Notes to Consolidated Financial  used in determining the accumulated postretirement benefit obligation and net other postretirement benefit costs of the Registrants are:201520142013Accumulated postretirement benefit obligationDiscount rate450%410%495%Health care trend rate pre- and post- 65625 / 675%750 / 650%750 / 650%Ultimate health care trend rate450%450%450%Year in which ultimate reached pre- and post- 6520272025 / 20242025 / 2024Other postretirement benefit costsDiscount rate prior to interim  rate post interim  long-term rate of return on plan assets800%800%825%Health care trend rate pre- and post- 65750 / 650%750 / 650%700%Ultimate health care trend rate450%450%500%Year in which ultimate reached pre- and post- 652025 / 20242025 / 20242021A onepercentage point increase in health care cost trend rates would have increased the total service cost and interest cost components of benefit costs for DTE Energy by $6 million, including $4 millionfor DTE Electric, in 2015and would have increased the accumulated benefit obligation for DTE Energy by $100 million, including $74 millionfor DTE Electric, at December31, 2015.

As a term of the agreements, the Registrants replaced the defined benefit employer-sponsored retiree medical, prescription drug, and dental coverage for future Medicare eligible retirees and their covered dependents with an allocation to a Retiree Reimbursement Account, when the youngest of the retiree covered household turns age 65. The initial amount of the allocation of $3,250per year for each eligible participant increases each year at the lower of the rate of medical inflation or 2%. The modification in retiree health coverage will reduce future other postretirement benefit costs.Based on the impact of such benefit cost savings on the Registrants' Consolidated Financial Statements, the Registrants re-measured their retiree health plan as of March 31, 2013. In performing the re-measurement, the Registrants updated their significant actuarial assumptions, including an adjustment to the discount rate from 415%at December 31, 2012 to 430%at March 31, 2013. Plan assets were also updated to reflect fair value as of the re-measurement date. Beginning April 2013, net other postretirement benefit costs were recorded based on the updated actuarial assumptions and benefit changes resulting from the new labor contracts.DTE Energy Common StockDTE Energy contributed the following amounts of DTE Energy common stock to the DTE Energy Company Master VEBA Trust for funding its other postretirement benefit plans:DateNumber of SharesPrice per ShareAmountIn millionsFebruary17,  above contribution was made on behalf of DTE Electric, which paid DTE Energy cash consideration of $117 millionin February 2015.During 2015, DTE Energy also made cash contributions of $82 million, including DTE Electric contributions of $58 million, to the DTE Energy Company Master VEBA Trust for its other postretirement benefit plans.Grantor TrustDTE Gas maintains a Grantor Trust that invests in life insurance contracts and income securities to fund other postretirement benefit obligations. Employees and retirees have no right, title, or interest in the assets of the Grantor Trust, and DTE Gas can revoke the trust subject to providing the MPSC with prior notification.

The Grantor Trust investment is included in Other investments on DTE Energy Consolidated Statements of Financial Position.Defined Contribution PlansThe Registrants also sponsor defined contribution retirement savings plans. Participation in one of these plans is available to substantially all represented and non-represented employees. For substantially all employees, the Registrants match employee contributions up to certain predefined limits based upon eligible compensation and the employees contribution rate. The cost of these plans was $49 million, $48 million, and $41 millionin each of the years 2015, 2014, and 2013, respectively, for DTE Energy, and $23 million, $24 million, and $21 millionin each of the years 2015, 2014, and 2013, respectively, for DTE Electric.Plan ChangesIn 2015, certain executive retirement benefit plans were amended to transfer the obligation for benefits as attributed to the LLC.
