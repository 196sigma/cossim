Item8 Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. AirNet
does not anticipate that adoption of SFAS No123R will have a material impact on its results of
operations or its financial position. However, SFAS No123R also requires that the benefits of
tax deductions in excess of recognized compensation cost be reported as a financing cash flow,
rather than as an operating cash flow. This requirement will reduce net operating cash flows and
increase net financing cash flows in periods after the effective date. While AirNet cannot
estimate what those amounts will be in the future because they depend on, among other things, when
employees exercise stock options, the amount of operating cash flows recognized in prior periods
for such excess tax deductions were not material. Stock options are further detailed in Note 1 
Significant Accounting Policies and Note 5 Incentive Stock Plans of the Notes to Consolidated
Financial Statements included in Item8 Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of this
Annual Report on Form 10-K. 31 Table of Contents Self-Insurance Accruals AirNet is self-insured up to certain limits for costs associated with workers compensation claims
and benefits paid under employee health care programs. At December31, 2005 and 2004, AirNet had
total self-insurance accruals reflected in its Consolidated Balance Sheets of approximately $09
million and $11million, respectively. The measurement of these costs requires the consideration of historical loss experience and
judgments about the present and expected levels of costs. AirNet accounts for these costs
primarily through measurement of claims outstanding and projected payments based on recent claims
experience. AirNet believes its recorded obligations for these expenses are consistently measured
on an appropriate basis; however, changes in health costs, loss development factors, accident
frequency and severity, and other factors can materially affect the estimates for these
liabilities. Incentive Compensation Plans AirNet maintains an incentive compensation plan with payouts tied to the achievement of
company-wide earnings goals and personal/departmental goals. Incentive compensation is calculated
as a percent of base pay, depending on participation levels, which vary among management tiers.
Costs related to the company-wide earnings portion of the plan are accrued based on actual
quarterly results. For the year ended December31, 2005, AirNet recorded approximately $16
million of incentive compensation expense, and for the year ended December31, 2004, no incentive
compensation expense was recorded because the earnings goals were not met. Income Taxes AirNet accounts for income taxes under the liability method pursuant to SFAS No109, Accounting
for Income Taxes. Under the liability method, deferred tax liabilities and assets are determined
based on the differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities
using enacted tax rates and laws that will be in effect when the differences are expected to
reverse. Accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America require AirNet to record a
valuation allowance against future deferred tax assets if it is more likely than not that AirNet
will not be able to utilize such benefits in the future. At December31, 2005 and 2004, AirNet
maintained a valuation allowance of $63million and $57million, respectively, to offset the
deferred tax assets associated with its net operating loss carryforwards NOLand alternative
minimum tax credit carryforwards AMTbecause of the uncertainty surrounding its ability to
realize such assets. Impairment of Assets and Goodwill AirNet recognizes impairment losses on long-lived assets in accordance with SFAS No144,
Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets SFAS No144. AirNet recognizes
impairment losses on long-lived assets when events or changes in circumstances indicate, in
managements judgment, that AirNets assets might be impaired and the undiscounted cash flows estimated to be generated by those assets are less than the carrying
value of those assets. The net carrying value of the assets not recoverable is reduced to fair
market value if lower than carrying value. In determining the fair market value of the assets,
AirNet considers market trends, published market data, recent transactions involving sales of
similar assets and, as discussed below, the letter of intent for the sale of AirNet that was
announced on October26, 2005. On October26, 2005, AirNet announced that it had entered into a letter of intent for its sale in a
going private transaction at $455 per share. Since the price per share in the letter of intent
was less than AirNets net book value per share, AirNet performed the impairment tests required by
SFAS No144 for the quarter ended September30, 2005 and concluded that its long-lived assets used
in its Delivery Services segment were further impaired. Accordingly, a non-cash charge of $161
million $100million net of tax was recorded as of September30, 2005. The impairment charge
was based upon the fair values of the long-lived assets in the Delivery Services segment derived
from published sources, information provided by a third-party valuation firm retained to assist
AirNet in completing its analysis, and the discount inherent in the price per common share set
forth in the letter of intent. AirNets long-lived assets used in its cargo operations, consisting primarily of aircraft and spare
parts, were also determined to be impaired as of September30, 2004. This determination was made
as a result of industry trends in the adoption of electronic payment alternatives and evolving
electronic alternatives to the physical movement of cancelled checks at a more rapid pace than
previously anticipated by the industry. AirNets cargo airline was originally designed, and
continues to operate, primarily to meet the needs of Bank Services customers. AirNet determined
that its airline capacity would exceed future demand, which created an impairment of the aircraft
and related assets. The impairment also reflected the overall decline in the market values of the
aircraft in its cargo fleet which had not recovered as in previous economic cycles. AirNet
determined that the expected future undiscounted cash flows from its assets used in its cargo
operations were less than the
32 Table of Contents carrying value of those assets and were impaired. Accordingly, a non-cash impairment charge of $430million was recorded as of September30, 2004, using estimated
aircraft fair values. The aircraft fair values used for this purpose were based upon published
market sources as of September30, 2004, which were also used under AirNets Amended Credit
Agreement. Under SFAS No142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, AirNet evaluates its goodwill for
impairment annually, or more frequently if changes in circumstances indicate impairment may have
occurred sooner. At September30, 2004, AirNet determined that as a result of the impairment of
its long-lived assets used in its Delivery Services operations, the remaining goodwill assigned to
the cargo operations should be evaluated for potential impairment. AirNet evaluated the fair value
of its goodwill related to its Delivery Services operations based upon a discounted future cash
flow analysis. As a result of the impairment test, AirNet determined that its goodwill was
impaired and, accordingly, a non-cash impairment charge of $40million was recorded at September
30, 2004. Forward-looking statements The information included or incorporated by reference in this Annual Report on Form 10-K contains
various forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section27A of the Securities Act of
1933, as amended, and Section21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, including
those identified by the words believe, anticipate, estimate, expect, intend, may,
plan, project and similar expressions. These forward-looking statements reflect managements
expectations and are based upon currently available data; however, actual results are subject to
future events and uncertainties, which could cause actual results to differ from those projected in
these statements. The following factors, in addition to those included in the disclosure under the
heading Risk Factors in Item1A of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, could cause actual results to
differ materially from those expressed in forward-looking statements   
an acceleration in the migration of AirNets Bank customers to electronic
alternatives to the physical movement of cancelled checks   
potential regulatory changes by the FAA, DOT and TSA which could increase the
regulation of AirNets business, or the Federal Reserve, which could change the
competitive environment of transporting canceled checks   
disruptions to operations due to adverse weather conditions, air traffic
control-related constraints or aircraft accidents   
potential further declines in the value of aircraft in AirNets fleet and any
related asset impairment charges   
the ability to successfully market the Passenger Charter business in light of global
changes in the commercial airline industry   
potential changes in locally and federally mandated security requirements   
increases in aviation fuel costs not fully offset by AirNets fuel surcharge program   
changes in check processing and shipment patterns of bank customers   
acts of war and terrorist activities   
the impact of prolonged weakness in the U. S. economy on time-critical shipment volumes   
the acceptance of AirNets time-critical service offerings within targeted Express markets   
technological advances and increases in the use of electronic funds transfers   
the availability and cost of financing required for operations   
the impact of unusual items resulting from ongoing evaluations of our business strategies   
our substantial indebtedness   
insufficient capital for future expansion; and 33 Table of Contents   
other economic, competitive and domestic and foreign governmental factors affecting
AirNets markets, prices and other facets of its operations. All forward-looking statements are expressly qualified in their entirety by these cautionary
statements. AirNet assumes no obligation or duty to update any of the forward-looking statements
included or incorporated by reference in this Annual Report on Form 10-K except to the extent
required by law. ITEM 7A QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK Inflation and Interest Rates AirNet is exposed to certain market risks from transactions that are entered into during the normal
course of business. AirNets primary market risk exposure relates to interest rate risk. At
December31, 2005, AirNet had a $165million outstanding balance under its Amended Credit
Agreement described above in Item7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition
and Results of Operation subject to market rate changes in interest. The Amended Credit
Agreement bears interest, at AirNets option, at aa fixed rate equal to LIBOR plus a margin
determined by AirNets leverage ratio as defined in the Amended Credit Agreement, or ba floating
rate based on the greater of ithe prime rate established by The Huntington National
Bank from time to time plus a margin determined by AirNets leverage ratio as defined in the
Amended Credit Agreement and iithe sum of 05% plus the federal funds rate in effect from time
to time. Assuming borrowing levels at December31, 2005, a one hundred basis point change in
interest rates would impact net interest expense by approximately $165,000 per year. Following the effectiveness of the Amended Credit Agreement dated May28, 2004, AirNet paid off
three secured term loans which had been secured by aircraft. One of those loans had an interest
rate swap agreement associated with it. This interest rate swap agreement with a notional amount
of $30million and a fixed rate of 425% plus a margin based on AirNets funded debt ratio was
terminated in August2005. Fuel Surcharge AirNet generally assesses its Bank Services customers a fuel surcharge which is based on the Oil
Price Index Summary Columbus, Ohio OPIS-CMH Index. Fuel surcharges are assessed to Delivery
Services customers as a percentage of transportation charges. As index rates increase above
established base rates, AirNet increases the fuel surcharge percentage applied to the
transportation charges. AirNet assesses most of its Express Services customers a fuel surcharge
which is based on the OPIS index, and is adjusted monthly. In addition, Jetride charges its
customers a fuel surcharge stated as an hourly rate based upon current fuel prices which changes
according to prevailing market rates. 34 Table of Contents ITEM 8 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm Shareholders and Board of Directors
AirNet Systems, Inc. We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of AirNet Systems, Inc. as of December
31, 2005 and 2004, and the related consolidated statements of operations, shareholders equity, and
cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December31, 2005. Our audits also
included the financial statement schedule listed in the Index at  a2. These financial
statements and schedule are the responsibility of the management of AirNet Systems, Inc. Our
responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements and schedule based on our
audits. We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight
Board United States. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. We
were not engaged to perform an audit of the Companys internal control over financial reporting.
Our audit included consideration of internal control over financial reporting as a basis for
designing audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of
expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Companys internal control over financial
reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. An audit also includes examining, on a test
basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the
accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, and evaluating the overall
financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our
opinion. In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material
respects, the consolidated financial position of AirNet Systems, Inc. at December31, 2005 and
2004, and the consolidated results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years
in the period ended December31, 2005, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting
principles. Also, in our opinion, the related financial statement schedule, when considered in
relation to the basic financial statements taken as a whole, presents fairly in all material
respects the information set forth therein. Columbus, Ohio

See notes to consolidated financial statements 39 Table of Contents NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 1. Significant Accounting Policies AirNet
Systems, Inc. and its subsidiaries collectively, AirNet operate a
national air transportation network which provides delivery service for time-critical shipments for
customers in the U.S. banking industry and other industries requiring the express delivery of
packages. AirNet also offers Passenger Charter Services and retail aviation fuel sales and related
ground services for customers at its Columbus, Ohio facility. Basis of Presentation The accompanying consolidated financial statements include the accounts of AirNet Systems, Inc. and
its subsidiaries. All significant intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated. Preparation of the consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles
generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and
assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and
accompanying notes. Actual results could differ from those estimates. Certain 2004 and 2003 balances have been reclassified to conform with the 2005 presentation. Revenue Recognition Revenue on Express Services and Bank Services is recognized when the packages are delivered to
their destination. Revenue related to Passenger Charter Services is recognized from both owned and
managed aircraft in the period in which the charter services are completed. Revenue on fixed based
operations within Aviation services is recognized when the maintenance services are complete or
fuel is delivered. Cash and Cash Equivalents Cash and cash equivalents consist of highly liquid investments which are unrestricted as to
withdrawal or use, and which have an original maturity of three months or less. Cash equivalents
are stated at cost, which approximates market value. Accounts Receivable AirNet performs periodic credit evaluations of its customers financial condition and generally
does not require collateral. AirNet establishes an allowance for doubtful accounts based upon
factors surrounding the credit risks of specific customers, historical trends and other
information. Inventory Inventory is valued at the lower of cost weighted average method or market. Property and Equipment Acquisitions
of property and equipment are stated at cost.
Costs of major overhauls and engine work which are expected to extend
the useful life of the related asset are capitalized as incurred and
depreciated based on hours flown. The original costs of airframes, other flight
equipment and other property and equipment primarily furniture and equipment, leasehold
improvements, computer related hardware and software and vehicles are depreciated based on the
straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets as summarized below. Aircraft
maintenance costs not meeting AirNets capitalization requirements are expensed as incurred.   
Airframes
2-15 years   Leasehold improvements
20 years   Other flight equipment
2-5 years   Other property and equipment
3-10 years AirNet evaluates the remaining salvage values and depreciable lives of its property and equipment
as conditions dictate. Approximately 85% of AirNets Learjet 35 aircraft engines and all of AirNets Learjet 60 aircraft
engines are covered under manufacturer engine maintenance plans, under which AirNet prepays certain
repair and overhaul costs. These prepayments, which totaled approximately $200million and $193
million at December31, 2005 and 2004, respectively, are classified in fixed assets on the
Consolidated Balance Sheets. Amortization on these prepaid balances does not begin
until major engine overhaul services have been performed, at which time the prepaid balances are
reclassified into depreciable asset categories and depreciated based on hours flown. 40 Table of Contents Property and equipment consisted of the following at December31

AirNet recognizes impairment losses on long-lived assets used in operations in accordance with
Statement of Financial Accounting Standards SFASNo144, Accounting for the Impairment or
Disposal of Long-Lived Assets SFAS No144. AirNet recognizes impairment losses on long-lived
assets used in operations when events or changes in circumstances indicate, in managements
judgment, that the assets might be impaired and the undiscounted cash flows estimated to be
generated by those assets are less than the carrying value of those assets. The net carrying value
of the assets not recoverable is reduced to fair market value if lower than carrying value. In
determining the fair market value of the assets, AirNet considers market trends, published market
data, and recent transactions involving sales of similar assets. Self-Insurance Accruals AirNet is self-insured up to certain limits for costs associated with workers compensation claims
and benefits paid under employee health care programs. The measurement of these costs requires the
consideration of historical loss experience and judgments about the present and expected levels of
costs. AirNet accounts for these costs primarily through measurement of claims outstanding and
projected payments based on recent claims experience. Incentive Compensation Plans AirNet maintains an incentive compensation plan with payouts tied to the achievement of
company-wide earnings goals and personal/departmental goals. Incentive compensation is calculated
as a percent of base pay, depending on participation levels, which vary among management tiers.
AirNet accrues for costs related to the personal/departmental goals portion of the plan based on
estimated achievement rates of set goals applied to individuals base pay rates. Income Taxes AirNet accounts for income taxes under the liability method pursuant to SFAS No109, Accounting
for Income Taxes. Under the liability method, deferred tax liabilities and assets are determined
based on the differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities
using enacted tax rates and laws that will be in effect when the differences are expected to
reverse. Accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America require AirNet to record a
valuation allowance against future deferred tax assets if it is more likely than not that AirNet
will not be able to utilize such benefits in the future. At December31, 2005 and 2004, AirNet
maintained a valuation allowance of $63million and $57million, respectively, to offset the
deferred tax assets associated with its net operating loss carryforwards NOLand alternative
minimum tax credit carryforwards AMTbecause of the uncertainty surrounding its ability to
realize such assets. Goodwill SFAS No142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets requires that goodwill and indefinite-lived
intangible assets no longer be amortized, but instead be evaluated for impairment on a reporting
unit basis annually, or more frequently if changes in circumstances indicate impairment may have
occurred sooner. A reporting unit is the operating segment unless, for businesses within that
operating segment, discrete financial information is prepared and regularly reviewed by management,
in which case such a component business is the reporting unit. The impairment test is conducted by comparing the fair value of the reporting unit, primarily
determined by computing the future discounted cash flows expected to be generated by the reporting
unit, with its carrying value and if the carrying value exceeds the fair value, goodwill may
potentially be impaired. If there is potential impairment, the fair value of the reporting unit is
allocated to its assets and liabilities in a manner similar to a purchase price allocation in order
to determine the implied fair value of the reporting unit goodwill. This implied fair value is
then compared with the carrying amount of the reporting unit goodwill, and if the implied fair
value is less, an impairment loss is recognized. Financial Instruments The fair value of AirNets financial instruments approximated their carrying value at December31,
2005 and 2004. 41 Table of Contents Derivatives AirNet has been party to various interest rate swap agreements with banks as a hedge against the
interest rate risk associated with borrowing at variable rates. These swap agreements are
accounted for as cash flow hedges. The objective of the hedge is to eliminate the variability of
cash flows in the interest rate payments on the variable rate debt. In February2002, AirNet entered into a five-year interest rate swap agreement with a bank relative
to a $30million term loan. Following the effectiveness of the Amended Credit Agreement dated May
28, 2004, and as discussed in Note 4, AirNet paid off three secured term loans which had been
secured by aircraft. This interest rate swap agreement with a notional amount of $30million and
a fixed rate of 425% plus a margin based on AirNets funded debt ratio was terminated in August
2005. AirNet accounts for its swap agreements under SFAS No133, Accounting for Derivative Instruments
and Hedging Activities, and its amendments, SFAS Nos. 137 and 138. These statements require
AirNet to recognize all derivatives on the balance sheet at fair value. Derivatives that are not
hedges are adjusted to fair value through income. If the derivative is a hedge, depending on the
nature of the hedge, changes in the fair value of the derivative are either offset against the
change in fair value of assets, liabilities, or firm commitments through earnings or recognized in
other comprehensive income until the hedged item is recognized in earnings. The ineffective
portion of a derivatives change in fair value is immediately recognized in earnings. In 2004,
AirNet recognized comprehensive income of approximately $22,000, net of tax, related to the swaps.
At December31, 2004, the aggregate fair value of the interest rate swaps was approximately
$15,000 and was recorded in other liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. The
ineffective portion of the change in fair value is immaterial for all years presented. There were
no interest rate swap agreements in place at December31, 2005. Stock-Based Compensation At December31, 2005, AirNet had two stock-based employee compensation plans, the Amended and
Restated 1996 Incentive Stock Plan and the 2004 Stock Incentive Plan. AirNet has accounted for the
plans under the recognition and measurement principles of APB Opinion No25, Accounting for Stock
Issued to Employees, and related interpretations. No stock-based employee compensation cost is
reflected in net income, as all stock options granted under the plans have an exercise price equal
to the fair market value of the underlying common shares on the date of grant. Pro forma
information regarding net income and net income per share is required by SFAS No148, Accounting
for Stock-Based Compensation Transition and Disclosure SFAS No148, and has been determined
as if AirNet had accounted for its employee stock options under the fair value method of SFAS No.
123, Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation SFAS No123. On December16, 2004, the Financial Accounting Standards Board FASBissued SFAS No123 revised
2004, Share-Based Payment SFAS No123R, which is a revision of SFAS No123. SFAS No.
123R supersedes APB Opinion No25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees, and amends SFAS
No95, Statement of Cash Flows. Generally, the approach in SFAS No123R is similar to the
approach described in SFAS No123. However, SFAS No123R requires all share-based payments to
employees, including grants of employee stock options, to be recognized as expense in the income
statement based on their fair values. Pro forma disclosure will no longer be an alternative. SFAS No123R must be adopted no later than the first annual period beginning after June15,
2005. AirNet adopted SFAS No123R on January1, 2006. SFAS No123R permits companies to
adopt its requirements using one of two methods   
1.
A modified prospective method in which compensation cost is recognized beginning with
the effective date abased on the requirements of SFAS No123R for all share-based
payments granted after the effective date and bbased on the requirements of SFAS No123
for all awards granted to employees prior to the effective date of SFAS No123R that
remain unvested on the effective date.   
2.
A modified retrospective method which includes the requirements of the modified
prospective method described above, but also permits entities to restate financial
statements based on the amounts previously recognized under SFAS No123 for purposes of
pro forma disclosures either afor all prior periods presented or bfor prior interim
periods of the year of adoption. AirNet adopted SFAS No123R using the modified prospective method. The impact of adoption of
SFAS No123R cannot be predicted at this time because it will depend on levels of share-based
payments granted in the future. However, had AirNet adopted SFAS No123R in prior periods, the
impact of that standard would have approximated the impact of SFAS No123 as described in the
disclosure of pro forma net income lossand net income lossper share below. AirNet does not
anticipate that adoption of SFAS No123R will have a material impact on its results of
operations or its financial position. However, SFAS No123R also requires that the benefits of
tax deductions in excess of recognized compensation cost be reported as a financing cash flow,
rather than as an operating cash flow. This requirement will reduce net operating cash flows and increase net financing cash flows in periods after the
effective date. While AirNet cannot estimate what those amounts will be in the future because
they depend on, among other things, when employees exercise stock options, the amount of operating
cash flows recognized in prior periods for such excess tax deductions were not material. 42 Table of Contents AirNet adopted the fair-value-based method of accounting for share-based payments effective January
1, 2003 using the modified prospective method described in SFAS No148. Currently, AirNet uses
the Black-Scholes option pricing model to estimate the value of stock options granted to employees
for purposes of computing the pro forma disclosures required by SFAS No123. The fair value of these options was estimated at the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option
pricing model with the following weighted average assumptions for the years ended December31

Supplemental Cash Flow Data Cash paid for interest was $3,965,000, $2,414,000, and $1,584,000 for the years ended December31,
2005, 2004, and 2003, respectively. During the years ended December31, 2005 and 2004, AirNet
capitalized approximately $03million and $01million in interest, respectively, related to the
construction of its new Rickenbacker office and hangar facility. AirNet paid $265,000, $208,000,
and $459,000 and received $39,000, $62,000, and $1,332,000 for the years ended December31, 2005,
2004, and 2003, respectively, related to income taxes. 2. Impairment of Property and Equipment and Goodwill AirNet recognizes impairment losses on long-lived assets in accordance with SFAS No144. AirNet
recognizes impairment losses on long-lived assets when events or changes in circumstances indicate,
in managements judgment, that the assets might be impaired and the undiscounted cash flows
estimated to be generated by those assets are less than the carrying value of those assets. The
net carrying value of the assets not recoverable is reduced to fair market value if lower than
carrying value. In determining the fair market value of the assets, AirNet considers market
trends, published market data, recent transactions involving sales of similar assets and, as
discussed below, the letter of intent for the sale of AirNet that was announced on October26,
2005. On October26, 2005, AirNet announced that it had entered into a letter of intent for its sale in a
going private transaction at $455 per share. Since the price per share in the letter of intent
was less than AirNets net book value per share, AirNet performed the impairment tests required by
SFAS No144 for the quarter ended September30, 2005 and concluded that its long-lived assets used
in its Delivery Services segment were further impaired. Accordingly, a non-cash charge of $161
million $100million net of tax was recorded as of September30, 2005. The impairment charge
was based upon the fair values of the long-lived assets in the Delivery Services segment derived
from published sources, information provided by a third-party valuation firm retained to assist
AirNet in completing its analysis, and the discount inherent in the price per common share set
forth in the letter of intent. 43 Table of Contents AirNets long-lived assets used in its cargo operations, consisting primarily of aircraft and spare
parts, were also determined to be impaired as of September30, 2004. This determination was made
as a result of industry trends in the adoption of electronic payment alternatives and evolving
electronic alternatives to the physical movement of cancelled checks at a more rapid pace than
previously anticipated by the industry. AirNets cargo airline was originally designed, and
continues to operate, primarily to meet the needs of Bank Services customers. AirNet determined
that its airline capacity would exceed future demand, which created an impairment of the aircraft
and related assets. The impairment also reflected the overall decline in the market values of the
aircraft in its cargo fleet which had not recovered as in previous economic cycles. AirNet
determined that the expected future undiscounted cash flows from its assets used in its cargo
operations were less than the carrying value of those assets and were impaired. Accordingly, a
non-cash impairment charge of $430million $310million net of tax was recorded as of September
30, 2004, using estimated aircraft fair values. The aircraft fair values used for this purpose
were based upon published market sources as of September30, 2004, which were also used under
AirNets Amended Credit Agreement described in Note 4 below. Under SFAS No142, AirNet evaluates its goodwill for impairment annually, or more frequently if
changes in circumstances indicate impairment may have occurred sooner. At September30, 2004,
AirNet determined that as a result of the impairment of its long-lived assets used in its Delivery
Services operations, the remaining goodwill assigned to the cargo operations should be evaluated
for potential impairment. AirNet evaluated the fair value of its goodwill related to its Delivery
Services operations based upon a discounted future cash flow analysis. As a result of the
impairment test, AirNet determined that its goodwill was impaired and, accordingly, a non-cash
impairment charge of $40million was recorded at September30, 2004. Following is a progression of goodwill for the years ended December31

3. Segment Reporting AirNet operates a national air transportation network and has determined its
reportable segments are based on AirNets methods of internal reporting and management structure.
AirNets reportable segments are Delivery Services, which provides delivery service of
time-critical shipments for Bank customers and Express customers, and Passenger Charter Services
provided by Jetride, Inc., a wholly-owned subsidiary of AirNet Systems, Inc. AirNet evaluates
segment performance based on several factors, of which the primary financial measure is
contribution margin. Contribution margin represents the net revenues of the reportable segment
less costs and expenses directly associated with the reportable segment, including depreciation
expense, but does not include interest and income taxes and certain selling, general and
administrative costs. The accounting policies used for segment reporting are the same as those
described in Note 1 in the summary of Significant Accounting Policies used for consolidated
reporting. There were no material amounts of revenues or transfers between reportable segments. 44 Table of Contents Financial information for the fiscal years ended December31, 2005, 2004 and 2003 by business

Term Notes and Revolving Credit Facility In September2002, AirNet entered into a $350million unsecured revolving credit facility and a
five-year $200million unsecured term loan collectively, the Credit Agreement. The term loan
required quarterly installments of $10million beginning in December2002 and continuing through
September30, 2007. The revolving credit facility under the Credit Agreement was originally
scheduled to expire on September30, 2005 and the secured term loan was to mature on September30,
2007. On May28, 2004, AirNet and its lenders amended the terms and conditions of the Credit Agreement
the Amended Credit Agreement. The Amended Credit Agreement has been further amended by the
First, Second, Third and Fourth Change in Terms Agreements as described below. The Amended Credit
Agreement is secured by a first lien on all of the property of AirNet and its subsidiaries, other
than any interest in real estate and certain excluded fixed assets. AirNet also pledged the stock
and interests of its subsidiaries to secure the loans under the Amended Credit Agreement, and each
of AirNets subsidiaries guaranteed AirNets obligations under the Amended Credit Agreement. The
Amended Credit Agreement permits AirNet and its subsidiaries to incur other indebtedness for the
purpose of purchasing or refinancing aircraft and related tangible fixed assets, subject to certain
annual limitations. The Amended Credit Agreement contains limitations on operating leases,
indebtedness, significant corporate changes including mergers and sales of assets, investments in
subsidiaries and acquisitions, liens, capital expenditures, transactions with affiliates, sales of
accounts receivable, sale and leaseback transactions and other off-balance sheet liabilities,
contingent obligations and hedging transactions. The Amended Credit Agreement also contains certain
financial covenants that require AirNet to maintain a minimum consolidated tangible net worth and
to not exceed certain fixed charge coverage and leverage ratios specified in the Amended Credit
Agreement. The Amended Credit Agreement provided for a secured revolving credit facility of up to $350
million and a secured term loan in the aggregate amount of $140million. The amount of revolving
loans available under the Amended Credit Agreement is limited to a borrowing base equal to the
aggregate of 80% of eligible accounts receivable, plus 50% of eligible inventory, plus 70% of the
market value of certain fixed assets, reduced by the aggregate amount of AirNets outstanding
letters of credit. The Amended Credit Agreement bears interest, at AirNets option, at aa fixed
rate equal to LIBOR plus a margin determined by AirNets leverage ratio as defined in the Amended
Credit Agreement, or ba floating rate based on the greater of ithe prime rate established by
The Huntington National Bank from time to time plus a margin determined by AirNets leverage ratio
or iithe sum of 05% plus the federal funds rate in effect from time to time plus a margin
determined by AirNets leverage ratio. At December31, 2005, as a result of the various timing and
duration of short-term debt maturities, AirNets interest rates ranged from 45% to 65%. As of December31, 2005, $165million was outstanding under the secured revolving credit facility
which is included in Notes payable, less current portion in the Consolidated Balance Sheet. In
addition, AirNet had $14million in letters of credit outstanding as of such date related to
insurance programs, which reduced the amount available under the revolving credit facility. After
giving effect to the Fourth Change in Terms Agreement discussed below, AirNet had approximately
$71million available to borrow under its secured revolving credit facility under the Amended
Credit Agreement as of December31, 2005. As a result of the impairment charges recorded in September2004 as described in Note 2 above,
AirNet was not in compliance with certain terms of the Amended Credit Agreement, including the
fixed charge coverage ratio and the leverage ratio calculated as of September30, 2004, and AirNet would not have been in compliance
with the minimum consolidated tangible net worth requirement as of December31, 2004. On November
12, 2004, AirNet and its lenders under the Amended Credit Agreement agreed to modify the terms and
conditions of the Amended Credit Agreement the First Change in Terms Agreement. The First
Change in Terms Agreement modified the fixed charge coverage ratio, the leverage ratio, and the
minimum consolidated tangible net worth financial covenants in such a manner that, on a
going-forward basis, the September2004 impairment charges, in and of themselves, would not cause a
default of these financial covenants in the future. At the same time as the First Change of Terms
Agreement was entered into, AirNet and its lenders executed a waiver of any defaults or potential
defaults under the Amended Credit Agreement which occurred, or may have occurred, as a result of
AirNets failure to comply with the foregoing financial covenants due to the September2004
impairment charges. On March24, 2005, AirNet and its lenders entered into a Second Change in Terms Agreement that
further modified the terms and conditions of the Amended Credit Agreement. In accordance with the
Second Change in Terms Agreement, AirNet prepaid in full the remaining $110million balance
outstanding on its secured term loan. Upon the prepayment of the term loan, the term loan portion
of the Amended Credit Agreement was terminated. In addition, the revolving credit facility under
the Amended Credit Agreement was reduced from $350million to $300million. In the event AirNet
secures permanent financing on all or a portion of its facility within Rickenbacker International
Airport the Rickenbacker Facility 46 Table of Contents the revolving credit facility will be reduced from $300
million to $250million. Under the Second Change in Terms Agreement, the term of the revolving
credit facility was extended from September30, 2005 to October15, 2006. The December31, 2004
Consolidated Balance Sheet gives effect to the Second Change in Terms Agreement entered into on
March24, 2005. The Second Change in Terms Agreement also provided for the release of certain
fixed assets that were securing the loans under the Amended Credit Agreement and modified certain
other financial covenants. As a result of the impairment charge recorded in September2005 as described in Note 2 above,
AirNet was not in compliance with certain terms of the Amended Credit Agreement, including the
fixed charge coverage ratio and the leverage ratio calculated as of September30, 2005. On
November21, 2005, AirNet and its lenders under the Amended Credit Agreement agreed to modify the
terms and conditions of the Amended Credit Agreement the Third Change in Terms Agreement. The
Third Change in Terms Agreement modified the fixed charge coverage ratio and the leverage ratio
financial covenants in such a manner that, on a going-forward basis, the impairment charge recorded
as of September30, 2005, in and of itself, would not cause a default of these financial covenants
in the future. At the same time as the Third Change of Terms Agreement was entered into, AirNet
and its lenders executed a waiver of any defaults or potential defaults under the Amended Credit
Agreement which occurred, or may have occurred, as a result of AirNets failure to comply with the
foregoing financial covenants due to the September2005 impairment charge. On March28, 2006, AirNet and its lenders entered into a Fourth Change in Terms Agreement
extending the term of the secured revolving credit facility under the Amended Credit Agreement from
October15, 2006 to October15, 2007. The Fourth Change in Terms Agreement also reduced the amount
of the secured revolving credit facility from $30million to
$25million, reduced the amount of
annual capital expenditures permitted under the terms of the Amended Credit Agreement from $30
million to $20million, and modified the calculation of the borrowing base under the revolving
credit facility. As a result of the Fourth Change in Terms Agreement,
amounts outstanding under the revolving credit facility at December31, 2005 are classified as
long-term debt in the Consolidated Balance Sheet. Other Term Notes On March24, 2005, AirNet entered into a three-year term loan totaling $110million with a fixed
interest rate of 812%. This term loan is secured by seven Cessna Caravans and nine Learjet 35s
from AirNets cargo aircraft fleet. The aircraft securing this loan were released from the
collateral securing the loans under the Amended Credit Agreement in accordance with the Second
Change in Terms Agreement. The proceeds from this term loan were used to prepay in full AirNets
term loan under the Amended Credit Agreement as described above. The December31, 2004
Consolidated Balance Sheet reflects the reclassification of approximately $224million from
current to long-term notes payable as a result of the extension of the Amended Credit Agreement
under the Second Change in Terms Agreement and the financing of the cargo aircraft described above.
As of December31, 2005, $97million was outstanding under these term loans. During the second quarter of 2004, Jetride entered into four seven-year term loans totaling $225
million with fixed interest rates of approximately 67%. In July2004, Jetride financed two
additional passenger charter Learjet 60s for the Passenger Charter fleet at $50million each with
seven-year terms and fixed rates of approximately 65%, for a total of $325million in financing
related to AirNets Passenger Charter Services. As of December31, 2005, there was $298million
outstanding under all six loans. These term loans are secured by aircraft used in the Passenger
Charter fleet. Each of the term loans is guaranteed by AirNet. AirNet incurred approximately $20
million in interest expense in 2005 related to the financing of the nine Passenger Charter aircraft
under all six loans. Aggregate future maturities of long-term debt as of December31, 2005 are as follows

AirNets stock purchase program, which had been part of the 1996 Plan and is part of the 2004 Plan,
allows eligible employees the opportunity to acquire common shares of AirNet at up to a 15%
discount through payroll deductions. AirNet issued 23,414, 35,914, and 39,597 common shares
respectively during 2005, 2004, and 2003 from treasury shares under the stock purchase program. 6. Lease Obligations AirNet leases facility space and courier vehicles at various locations throughout the United
States. In January2002, AirNet entered into operating leases for six Cessna Caravan 208 aircraft,
which after certain extensions entered into in September2002, terminate in 2006 and 2007. In
January of 2003 and January of 2006, AirNet entered into two additional operating leases on Cessna
Caravan 208 aircraft that expire, respectively, in 2008 and 2007. In February2006, AirNet entered
into a one-year operating lease on an additional Cessna Caravan 208 aircraft. AirNet incurred lease expense of $2,587,000, $3,439,000, and $4,131,000 for the years ended
December31, 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. As of December31, 2005, future minimum lease
payments by year under non-cancelable operating leases with initial or remaining terms exceeding
one year are as follows: 2006 $629,000; 2007 $214,000; 2008 $100,000; 2009 $78,000; 2010 78,000. Concurrently with the sale of AirNets Port Columbus Facility in December2004, AirNet entered into
the New Port Columbus Lease. Pursuant to the New Port Columbus Lease, AirNet leased the real
property associated with the Port Columbus Facility and the buildings and all other improvements
thereon pending completion of the construction of AirNets new office and hangar facility at
Rickenbacker. The term of the New Port Columbus Lease commenced on December15, 2004 and
terminated on August31, 2005. The New Port Columbus Lease was rent free until May15, 2005 and
commencing May16, 2005, the rent was scheduled to increase to $30,000 per month. The Authority
waived the scheduled rent increase for the period from May16, 2005 until the relocation of AirNet
to its new Rickenbacker Facility. The New Port Columbus Lease was a net lease under which AirNet
was responsible for all costs of operating the Port Columbus Facility. This transaction was a
minor sale-leaseback, as the present value of the rental payments was less than 10% of the
propertys fair value; therefore, AirNet recorded a gain on the sale of $03million in 2004.
AirNet relocated its operations at the Port Columbus Facility as well as its administrative
functions to the Rickenbacker Facility in June2005. 7. Related Party Transactions During 2001, the Board of Directors approved a retirement agreement with Gerald G. Mercer, Founder
and former Chairman, of AirNet. As contemplated by the retirement agreement, Mr.Mercer retired as
Chairman and a Director effective August3, 2001. Under the terms of the retirement agreement, Mr.
Mercer had the option to sell up to $250,000 of AirNet common shares each quarter of 2002 to AirNet
based on then current market prices. Mr.Mercer exercised his option and, effective January2,
2003, sold 52,410 AirNet common shares to AirNet at a total cost of $249,996. Also under the terms of his retirement agreement, Mr.Mercer retained his rights to sell his
remaining AirNet common shares to private investors at any time in accordance with the applicable
laws. On or about December26, 2002, Mr.Mercer sold an aggregate of 733,200 common shares to
seven separate investors in privately negotiated transactions. On December24, 2002, he made a
gift of 256,800 common shares to Spring Hill Camps, which sold those common shares to three
separate investors, one of which also purchased common shares from Mr.Mercer, in privately
negotiated transactions. In connection with and as a condition to the investors consummating
those transactions, AirNet granted registration rights with respect to the 990,000 common shares
collectively purchased by these investors from Mr.Mercer or Spring Hill Camps and registered the
common shares in 2003. 8. Retirement Plan 49 Table of Contents AirNet has a 401k retirement savings plan. All associates who have completed a minimum of
one month of service may contribute up to 60% of their eligible annual earnings to the 401k
retirement savings plan, subject to the maximum limitation imposed under the Internal Revenue Code.
AirNet may elect, at its discretion, to make matching and profit-sharing contributions. AirNets
contribution expense related to the 401k retirement savings plan totaled $487,000, $626,000, and
$519,000 for the years ended December31, 2005, 2004, and 2003, respectively. 9. Income Taxes Income taxes are summarized as follows for the years ended December31

State
taxes, net of federal benefit includes a benefit of $158,000 in 2005
as a result of changes in tax laws in the State of Ohio. In connection with the 1996 repurchase and cancellation of the Donald Wright Warrant, AirNet
recognized a related tax benefit estimated to be $70million based upon managements judgment and
estimation of the portion of the Donald Wright Warrant which would be deductible for income tax
purposes. This tax benefit was recognized as additional paid-in capital on AirNets Consolidated
Balance Sheet and has had no effect on AirNets Consolidated Statement of Operations. During the
third quarter 2003, this matter was partially resolved and AirNet has realized tax deductions
related to this transaction in excess of managements original estimates resulting in additional
tax benefits. The additional tax benefits associated with the deductible portion of the Donald
Wright Warrant have exceeded the original estimate by $13million. The additional tax benefits,
as was the initial estimated tax benefit associated with the Donald Wright Warrant, have been
recorded as an increase to additional paid-in capital. 10. Discontinued Operations On August11, 2003, AirNet Systems, Inc. completed the sale of substantially all of the assets of
its Mercury Business Services unit to Mercury Business Services, Inc., a Delaware corporation owned
by a group that included the original owners of the Mercury business. AirNet sold the assets, primarily the accounts receivable, personal property and intellectual
property, with a carrying amount at the time of sale of approximately $10million, for
approximately $11million. AirNet received approximately $455,000 of the purchase price in a ninety day promissory note
secured by the assets being sold and guaranteed by each of the shareholders of Mercury Business
Services, Inc. Under terms of the Asset Purchase Agreement, approximately $536,000 of the purchase
price was paid with AirNet Systems, Inc. common shares owned by the shareholders of Mercury
Business Services, Inc., including 56,000 common shares tendered to AirNet Systems, Inc., prior to
the closing at $430 per common share the closing price of the AirNet Systems, Inc., common shares
on NYSE on July25, 2003 and 68,494 common shares tendered to AirNet Systems, Inc., on the closing
date at $431 per common share the average closing price of the AirNet Systems, Inc., common
shares on NYSE on August 4-6, 2003. The balance of the purchase price was paid in cash. AirNet has reported these operations as discontinued operations. The Mercury Business Services unit had revenues for the year ended December31, 2003, which
consisted of the seven months prior to the sale, of $59million. Pre-tax loss for AirNets Mercury Business Services unit for the year ended December31, 2003,
which consisted of the seven months prior to the sale, was $13,000. 11. Net Income Loss Per Common Share The following table sets forth the computation of basic and diluted net income lossper common

For the years ended December31, 2005, 2004, and 2003, options covering 553,000, 686,000, and
981,000 common shares, respectively, were excluded from the diluted weighted average common shares
outstanding calculation, as their exercise prices exceeded the average fair market value of the
underlying common shares for the year, and therefore were antidilutive. 12. Litigation and Contingencies AirNet is subject to claims and lawsuits in the ordinary course of its business. In the opinion of
management, the outcomes of these actions, which are not clearly determinable at the present time,
are either adequately covered by insurance, or if not insured, will not, in the aggregate, have a
material adverse impact upon AirNets financial position or the results of future operations. Selected Quarterly Financial Information The quarterly financial data required to be disclosed in this Item8 is incorporated herein by

officer and principal financial officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions

information relating to AirNet and its consolidated 52 Table of Contents   
subsidiaries is made known to them,
particularly during the period for which the periodic reports of AirNet, including this
Annual Report on Form 10-K, are being prepared. Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting There were no changes in AirNets internal control over financial reporting as defined in Rule
13a-15f under the Exchange Act that occurred during AirNets fiscal quarter ended December31,
2005, that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, AirNets
internal control over financial reporting. ITEM 9B. OTHER INFORMATION Continuation
of Brown Gibbons Lang Company Engagement and Establishment of Strategy Committee On January5, 2005, upon the approval of the Board of Directors the Board of AirNet, AirNet
engaged Brown Gibbons Lang Company BGL to serve as AirNets exclusive financial advisor and
investment banker to review, develop and evaluate various strategic alternatives to enhance
shareholder value, including the possible sale of AirNet. AirNets Board also established a
Special Committee, consisting solely of independent directors, to oversee the marketing process.
While the Special Committee evaluated several proposed transactions, none of the proposed
transactions met the Special Committees criteria and none of the proposed transactions resulted in
the execution of a definitive sales agreement. In
December of 2005, the Board dissolved the Special Committee and
appointed a Strategy Committee to work with management on the ongoing
business strategy and alternatives for AirNet to enhance shareholder
value. The Strategy Committee, together with the full Board,
determined that AirNet business strategy would include operating its
businesses with emphasis on cash flows from operations while seeking
other de-leveraging opportunities. The Board has elected to continue its engagement of BGL as its financial advisor on a
month-to-month basis in connection with the development and
evaluation of various strategies and opportunities to
enhance shareholder value and de-leverage the business. The fees
for Strategy Committee members for each of the 2005 fiscal year and the 2006 fiscal year
have been and remain $1,000 per meeting attended in person and $500 for each telephonic meeting
attended. Changes In Compensation of Executive Officer
On March 24, 2006, the Compensation Committee
determined to increase the annual base salary of Craig A. Leach,
Vice President, Information Systems, of AirNet, from $150,000 to $160,000. This increase was effective March 27, 2006. 2005 Incentive Compensation Plan On February2, 2005, AirNets Board, upon the recommendation of the Compensation Committee, adopted
the 2005 Incentive Compensation Plan the 2005 Incentive Plan. The Compensation Committee and
the Board subsequently approved clarifications and modifications to the 2005 Incentive Plan on
March8, 2005 and March29, 2005. As discussed further below, on August9, 2005, the Board, upon
the recommendation of the Compensation Committee, adopted amendments and clarifications to the 2005
Incentive Plan to address the possibility that a transaction for the sale of AirNet would be
consummated prior to the end of the fiscal year ended December31, 2005 the 2005 fiscal year.
On November20, 2005, the Board, upon the recommendation of the Compensation Committee, ratified a
change to the 2005 Incentive Plan to address the impact of the non-cash impairment charge recorded
by AirNet in the third quarter of the 2005 fiscal year in determining pre-tax income as determined
under the terms of the 2005 Incentive Plan for the 2005 fiscal year. The purpose of the 2005 Incentive Plan was to promote the following goals of AirNet for the 2005
fiscal year by providing incentive compensation to certain employees of AirNet and its
subsidiaries   
Exceeding budgeted pre-tax income as determined under the terms of the 2005 Incentive Plan   
Reducing fixed costs   
Creating and executing contingency plans for changes in AirNets Bank business   
Refining AirNets business plan for its Express and Jetride businesses to more
quickly and profitably diversify AirNet   
Developing AirNets leadership team; and   
Meeting high priority deadlines related to compliance with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act
of 2002 and other key projects. Participants in the 2005 Incentive Plan included AirNets executive officers, Joel E. Biggerstaff,
Gary W. Qualmann, Larry M. Glasscock, Jr., Jeffery B. Harris, Wynn D. Peterson, Ray L. Druseikis
and Craig A. Leach, and certain department managers and department directors. At the start of the
2005 fiscal year, there were 45 participants in the 2005 Incentive Plan. As of the end of the 2005
fiscal year, there were 43 participants in the 2005 Incentive Plan. 53 Table of Contents Payments under the 2005 Incentive Plan were based on a combination of AirNets pre-tax income as
determined under the terms of the 2005 Incentive Plan for the 2005 fiscal year, operating
performance of AirNets various business components and the achievement of personal goals assigned
to each participant. The Compensation Committee approved personal goals for executive officers and
reviewed the personal goals for other participants. The personal goals approved by the
Compensation Committee for each of the executive officers related to specific business objectives
related to general business operations e.g., regulatory compliance, expense reductions, etc. and
each business component e.g., execution of specific contracts with customers and vendors, cost
reductions, service improvements, etc. No incentive compensation was to be paid to the executive
officers under the 2005 Incentive Plan for the achievement of personal goals unless AirNet attained
the designated threshold level of pre-tax income other than certain amounts payable to Wynn D.
Peterson, as discussed below. No incentive compensation was to be paid under the 2005 Incentive Plan unless AirNet achieved a
designated threshold level of pre-tax income as determined under the terms of the 2005 Incentive
Plan for the 2005 fiscal year. If the designated threshold level were achieved, incentive
compensation payments would increase at predetermined pre-tax income levels until the maximum
compensation payout of $19million was reached at approximately 200% of pre-tax income for the
2004 fiscal year, determined without regard to the 2004 fiscal year impairment charges related to
property and equipment and goodwill. Once the overall amount of incentive compensation was determined based upon AirNets pre-tax income
as determined under the terms of the 2005 Incentive Plan, incentive compensation was allocated to
Bank, Express, Jetride and corporate based upon pre-established targets. Incentive compensation
was then allocated to the participants most closely involved in managing each of those business
areas based upon each participants base salary. Finally, participants must have achieved their
pre-established personal goals to achieve their maximum incentive compensation payment. The maximum percentage of annual base salary that the following executive officers could have
received as incentive compensation under the 2005 Incentive Plan was: ifor Joel E. Biggerstaff,
100%; iifor Gary W. Qualmann, Larry M. Glasscock, Jr. and Jeffery B. Harris, 75%; and iiifor
Ray L. Druseikis and Craig A. Leach, 50%. In connection with his promotion in June2005 to Senior
Vice President, Jetride Services, the incentive compensation which Mr.Peterson could have received
under the 2005 Incentive Plan was modified to include two components. He was eligible to receive
incentive compensation up to a maximum amount of $75,000 50% of his $150,000 annual base salary
prior to the increase based on the level of achievement through June30, 2005 of his personal
goals in the position as Vice President, Strategic Planning and Analysis, and achievement by AirNet
of a designated level of pre-tax income as determined under the terms of the 2005 Incentive Plan,
for the six months ended June30, 2005. The amount of $60,000 in incentive compensation was paid
to Mr.Peterson in respect of the six-month period ended June30, 2005, which payment was made in
March of 2006. Mr.Peterson was also eligible to receive incentive compensation from zero to a
maximum amount of $161,250 75% of his $215,000 annual base salary after the increase based on the
level of achievement of personal goals related to the performance of Jetride for the period from
July 1 through December31, 2005, and achievement by Jetride, and AirNet, of designated levels of
pre-tax income as determined under the terms of the 2005 Incentive Plan for the six months ending
December31, 2005. In March of 2006, the amount of $46,438 in incentive compensation was paid to
Mr.Peterson in respect of the six-month period ended December31, 2005. Except for payments to the executive officers, payments under the 2005 Incentive Plan were paid in
quarterly payments commencing with the second quarter of the 2005 fiscal year based upon AirNets
year-to-date financial performance. Except as described above in respect of Mr.Peterson, payments
of incentive compensation to AirNets executive officers serving at the time of such payments, were
made in March of 2006 based upon AirNets performance for the 2005 fiscal
year. New employees who qualified for the 2005 Incentive Plan were eligible to participate on the
first day of the calendar quarter following their date of hire. On August9, 2005, the Board, upon the recommendation of the Compensation Committee, had adopted
the following amendments and clarifications to the 2005 Incentive Plan to address the possibility
that a transaction for the sale of AirNet would be consummated prior to the end of the 2005 fiscal
year. In such event, iparticipants in the 2005 Incentive Plan would have been entitled to
receive incentive compensation measured as a percentage of their full year base salary rather than
a pro-rated portion; iito the extent that bonuses were based in part on pre-tax income as
determined under the terms of the 2005 Incentive Plan for the 2005 fiscal year, such pre-tax
income would have been measured through the month ending immediately prior to the consummation date
of the sale transaction; iiito the extent bonuses for any individual were determined in part
based upon the performance of a business unit against a pre-determined target, the performance of
such business unit would have been based upon the performance through the month ending immediately
prior to the consummation date of the sale transaction versus the targeted performance through such
month end; and ivindividuals who were employed by AirNet at the time of the consummation of a
sale transaction would have been entitled to a bonus under the 2005 Incentive Plan whether or not
they were employed at the time the bonus was to be paid. On November20, 2005, the Board, upon the recommendation of the Compensation Committee, ratified a
change to the 2005 Incentive Plan to provide that, for purposes of computing the pre-tax income of
AirNet for the 2005 fiscal year for purposes of the 2005 Incentive Plan, the $161million non-cash
impairment charge recorded by AirNet in the third quarter of 54 Table of Contents the 2005 fiscal year would be
disregarded and the pre-tax income for the 2005 fiscal year would be computed as if no impairment
charge had been incurred. During the 2005 fiscal year and the fiscal quarter ending March31, 2006, AirNet made payments
under the terms of the 2005 Incentive Plan in the aggregate amount of approximately $16million.
In March of 2006, the executive officers of AirNet were paid the following amounts under the 2005
Incentive Plan: Joel E. Biggerstaff $250,000; Jeffery B. Harris $190,250; Gary W. Qualmann 148,000; Larry M. Glasscock, Jr. $141,125; Wynn D. Peterson $106,438 $60,000 in respect of
the six-month period ended June30, 2005; $46,438 in respect of the six-month period ended December
31, 2005; Craig A. Leach $72,000; and Ray L. Druseikis $29,000 became a participant effective
July1, 2005 following his election as an executive officer of AirNet and employment with AirNet
effective June30, 2005. After reviewing AirNets pre-tax income as determined under the terms of the 2005 Incentive Plan,
the operating performance of AirNets various business components, the level of achievement of the
personal goals assigned to each executive officer and, in the case of Mr.Peterson, Jetrides
pre-tax income as determined under the terms of the 2005 Incentive Plan, at the meeting of the
Compensation Committee held on March8, 2006, the Compensation Committee determined the amount of
incentive compensation to be paid to each executive officer other than Mr.Peterson in respect of
the 2005 fiscal year and the incentive compensation to be paid to Mr.Peterson in respect of the
six-month period ended December31, 2005.
Adoption of 2006 Incentive Compensation Plan On March24, 2006, the Board of Directors of AirNet, upon the recommendation of the Compensation
Committee, adopted the 2006 Incentive Compensation Plan the 2006 Incentive Plan. The purpose of the 2006 Incentive Plan is to promote the following goals of AirNet for the fiscal
year ending on December31, 2006 Fiscal 2006 by providing incentive compensation to certain
employees of AirNet and its subsidiaries   
Attaining designated levels of pre-tax income   
Improving cash flow and reducing debt   
Defining and executing plans to offset expected declines in Bank Services revenues   
Reducing the fixed cost structure of AirNet; and   
Meeting high priority deadlines of AirNet. Participants in the 2006 Incentive Plan include AirNets executive officers Joel E. Biggerstaff
Chairman of the Board, Chief Executive Officer and President, Gary W. Qualmann Chief Financial
Officer, Treasurer and Secretary, Larry M. Glasscock, Jr. Senior Vice President, Express
Services, Jeffery B. Harris Senior Vice President, Bank Services, Wynn D. Peterson Senior Vice
President, Jetride Services, Ray L. Druseikis Controller and Principal Accounting Officer, Craig
A. Leach Vice President, Information Systems and certain department managers and department
directors. As of the date of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, there were 47 participants in the
2006 Incentive Plan. Payments under the 2006 Incentive Plan will be based upon a combination of AirNets pre-tax income
for Fiscal 2006, the operating performance of AirNets Delivery Services and Passenger Charter
Services business segments, and the achievement of personal goals assigned to each participant. The
Compensation Committee approves personal goals for executive officers and reviews the personal
goals for other participants. The personal goals approved by the Compensation Committee for each
of the executive officers relate to specific business objectives related to general business
operations e.g., regulatory compliance, expense reductions, etc. and each business segment e.g.,
execution of specific contracts with customers and vendors, cost reductions, service improvements,
etc. No incentive compensation will be paid under the 2006 Incentive Plan unless AirNet achieves a
designated threshold level of pre-tax income for Fiscal 2006. Once the designated threshold level
is achieved, the available incentive compensation payments will increase based upon predetermined
pre-tax income levels until a maximum aggregate amount of $19million in incentive compensation
payments is reached. After the overall amount of incentive compensation is determined based upon
AirNets pre-tax income for Fiscal 2006, incentive compensation will be allocated to individual
participants based upon the following four factors: ilevel of pre-tax income attained by AirNet;
iilevel of contribution margin attained by Delivery Services as compared to certain
predetermined levels; iiilevels of contribution margin attained by Passenger Charter Services as
compared to certain predetermined levels; and ivattainment of personal goals. A participants maximum incentive compensation payment ranges from 20% to 100% of the participants
base salary, depending upon such participants level of responsibility for achieving AirNets goals
for Fiscal 2006. Twenty percent of each participants incentive compensation payments will be
based upon the participants achievement of pre-established personal goals. The remaining 80% of
each participants incentive compensation payment will be based upon a combination of the other
three factors discussed above, which will be allocated to each participant based upon such
participants overall responsibility for attaining the designated levels of AirNets pre-tax income
and contribution margins for the Delivery Services and Passenger Charter Services business
segments. In the event the incentive compensation payments otherwise available for payment under the 2006
Incentive Plan based upon AirNets level of pre-tax income is not paid to certain participants as a
result of those participants failure to attain their personal goals or AirNets failure to attain
the predetermined levels of budgeted contribution margins in Delivery Services or Passenger Charter
Services, such unpaid amounts may be awarded at the discretion of the Compensation Committee to
participants in the 2006 Incentive Plan or to other employees of AirNet not participating in the
2006 Incentive Plan. The maximum percentage of annual base salary that each of AirNets executive officers may receive
as incentive compensation under the Incentive Plan is as follows: Joel E. Biggerstaff, 100%; Gary
W. Qualmann, Larry M. Glasscock, Jr., Jeffrey B. Harris and Wynn D. Peterson, 75%; Ray L. Druseikis
and Craig A. Leach, 50%. Except for payments to the executive officers, payments under the 2006 Incentive Plan will be paid
in quarterly payments commencing with the second quarter of Fiscal 2006 based upon AirNets year to
date financial performance. Payments of incentive compensation to executive officers will be made
in the first quarter of the fiscal year ending December31, 2007 based upon AirNets performance
and each executive officers performance for Fiscal 2006. In order to receive payment, a
participant must be actively employed by AirNet at the time the payment is made. New employees who
qualify for the 2006 Incentive Plan will be eligible to participate on the first day of the
calendar quarter following their date of hire. The Compensation Committee may amend, modify or terminate the 2006 Incentive Plan at any time. Modifications of Amended Credit Agreement As
