FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA
REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM
Board of Directors and Stockholders 
National HealthCare Corporation
We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of National HealthCare Corporation as of December 31, 2015 and 2014 and the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, stockholders equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2015. Our audits also included the financial statement schedule listed in the Index and a. These financial statements and schedule are the responsibility of the Companys management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements and schedule based on our audits.
We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board United States. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated financial position of National HealthCare Corporation at December 31, 2015 and 2014 and the consolidated results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2015, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. Also, in our opinion, the related financial statement schedule, when considered in relation to the basic financial statements taken as a whole, presents fairly in all material respects the information set forth therein.
As discussed in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company changed its presentation of deferred tax assets and liabilities as a result of the adoption of the amendments to the FASB Accounting Standards Codification resulting from Accounting Standards Update 2015-17, Income Taxes: Balance Sheet Classification of Deferred Taxes, effective December 31, 2015.
We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board United States, National HealthCare Corporations internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2015, based on criteria established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission 2013 Framework and our report dated February 19, 2016, expressed an unqualified opinion thereon. s/ Ernst Young LLP

Nature of Operations
National HealthCare Corporation NHC or the Company operates, manages or provides services to skilled nursing facilities, assisted living facilities, independent living facilities, and home health care programs located in 10 Southeastern, Northeastern and Midwestern states in the United States. The most significant part of our business relates to skilled and intermediate nursing care in which setting we provide assisted living and retirement services, rehabilitative therapy services, and home health care. We also have a non-controlling ownership interest in a hospice care business that services NHC owned health care centers and others. The health care environment has continually undergone changes with regard to Federal and state reimbursement programs and other payor sources, compliance regulations, competition among other health care providers and patient care litigation issues. We continually monitor these industry developments as well as other factors that affect our business. 
Principles of Consolidation and Basis of Presentation
The consolidated financial statements which are prepared in accordance with U.S.generally accepted accounting principles GAAP include our wholly owned and controlled subsidiaries and affiliates. Variable interest entities VIEs in which we have an interest have been consolidated when we have been identified as the primary beneficiary. Investments in ventures in which we have the ability to exercise significant influence but do not have control over are accounted for using the equity method. Equity method investments are initially recorded at cost and subsequently are adjusted for our share of the ventures earnings or losses and cash distributions. Our most significant equity method investment is a 751% non-controlling ownership interest in Caris Healthcare, LP Caris, a business that specializes in hospice care services. Investments in entities in which we lack the ability to exercise significant influence are included in the consolidated financial statements at cost unless there has been a decline in the market value of our investment that is deemed to be other than temporary. All material intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated in consolidation. 
Use of Estimates
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.
Net Patient Revenues and Accounts Receivable
Revenues are derived from services rendered to patients for skilled and intermediate nursing, rehabilitation therapy, hospice, assisted living and retirement and home health care services.
Revenues are recorded when services are provided based on established rates adjusted to amounts expected to be received under governmental programs and other third-party contractual arrangements based on contractual terms. These revenues and receivables are stated at amounts estimated by management to be at their net realizable value.
For private pay patients in skilled nursing, assisted living and independent living facilities, the Company bills for room and board charges, with the remittance being due on receipt of the statement and generally by the 10th day of the month the services are performed. A portion of the episodic Medicare payments for home health services are also received in advance of the services being rendered. All advance billings are initially deferred and then are recognized as revenue when the services are performed.
We receive payments from the Medicare program under a prospective payment system PPS. For skilled nursing services, Medicare pays a fixed fee per Medicare patient per day, based on the acuity level of the patient, to cover all post-hospital extended care routine service costs, ancillary costs and capital related costs.
Medicaid program payments for long-term care services are generally based on fixed per diem rates subject to program cost ceilings.
For homecare services, Medicare pays based on the acuity level of the patient and based on episodes of care. An episode of care is defined as a length of care up to 60 days with multiple continuous episodes allowed. The services covered by the episode payment include all disciplines of care, in addition to medical supplies, within the scope of the home health benefit. We are allowed to make a request for anticipated payment at the start of care equal to 60% of the expected payment for the initial episode. The remaining balance due is paid following the submission of the final claim at the end of the episode. Revenues are recognized when services are provided based on the number of days of service rendered in the episode. Deferred revenue is recorded for payments received for which the related services have not yet been provided.
Laws and regulations governing the Medicare and Medicaid programs are complex and subject to interpretation. Noncompliance with such laws and regulations can be subject to regulatory actions including fines, penalties, and exclusion from the Medicare and Medicaid programs. We believe that we are in compliance with all applicable laws and regulations.
Medicare and Medicaid program revenues, as well as certain Managed Care program revenues, are subject to audit and retroactive adjustment by government representatives or their agents. The Medicare PPS methodology requires that patients be assigned to Resource Utilization Groups RUGs based on the acuity level of the patient to determine the amount paid to us for patient services. The assignment of patients to the various RUG categories is subject to post-payment review by Medicare intermediaries or their agents. In our opinion, adequate provision has been made for any adjustments that may result from these reviews. Retroactive adjustments are estimated in the recording of revenues in the period the related services are rendered. Any differences between our original estimates of reimbursements and subsequent revisions are reflected in operations in the period in which the revisions are made often due to final determination or the period of payment no longer being subject to audit or review. We believe currently that any differences between the net revenues recorded and final determination will not materially affect the consolidated financial statements. We have made provisions of approximately $16,654,000 and $22,931,000 as of December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively, for various Medicare, Medicaid, and Managed Care claims reviews and current and prior year cost reports. 
Other Revenues
As discussed in Note 3 other revenues include revenues from the provision of insurance services, management and accounting services to other long-term care providers, and rental income. Our insurance revenues consist of premiums that are generally paid in advance and then amortized into income as earned over the related policy period. We charge for management services based on a percentage of net revenues. We charge for accounting services based on a monthly fee or a fixed fee per bed of the long-term care center under contract. We generally record other revenues on the accrual basis based on the terms of our contractual arrangements. However, with respect to management and accounting services revenue from certain long-term care providers, including but not limited to National Health Corporation National as discussed in Note 3, where collection is not reasonably assured based on insufficient historical collections and the lack of expected future collections, our policy is to recognize income only in the period in which collection is assured and the amounts at question are believed by management to be fixed or determined. 
Certain management contracts, including, but not limited to contracts with National, subordinate the payment of management fees earned under those contracts to other expenditures of the long-term care center and to the availability of cash provided by the facilitys operations. Revenues from management services provided to the facilities that generate insufficient cash flow to pay the management fee, as prioritized under the contractual arrangement, are not recognized until such time as the amount of revenue earned is fixed or determinable and collectability is reasonably assured. This recognition policy could cause our reported revenues and net income from management services to vary significantly from period to period.
We recognize rental income based on the terms of our operating leases. Under certain of our leases, we receive contingent rent, which is based on the increase in revenues of a lessee over a base year. We recognize contingent rent annually or monthly, as applicable, when, based on the actual revenue of the lessee, receipt of such income is assured. We identify leased real estate properties as nonperforming if a required payment is not received within 30 days of the date it is due. Our policy related to rental income on non-performing leased real estate properties is to recognize rental income in the period when the income is received. 
Provision for Doubtful Accounts
We evaluate the collectability of our accounts receivable based on factors such as payor type, historical collection trends and aging categories. We review these factors and determine an estimated provision for doubtful accounts. Historically, bad debts have resulted primarily from uncollectible private balances or from uncollectible coinsurance and deductibles. Receivables that are deemed to be uncollectible are written off against the allowance. The allowance for doubtful accounts balance is assessed on a quarterly basis, with changes in estimated losses being recorded in the consolidated statements of income in the period first identified. 
The Company includes provisions for doubtful accounts in operating expenses in its consolidated statements of income. The provisions for doubtful accounts were $6,583,000, $6,228,000, and $5,226,000 for 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively. 
Other Operating Expenses
Other operating expenses include the costs of care and services that we provide to the residents of our facilities and the costs of maintaining our facilities. Our primary patient care costs include drugs, medical supplies, purchased professional services, food, professional insurance and licensing fees. The primary facility costs include utilities and property insurance.
General and Administrative Costs
With the Company being a healthcare provider, the majority of our expenses are cost of revenue items. Costs that could be classified as general and administrative by the Company would include its corporate office costs, which were $347 million, $362 million, and $409 million for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014, and 2013, respectively. 
Cash and Cash Equivalents
Cash equivalents include highly liquid investments with an original maturity of three months or less when purchased.
Restricted Cash and Cash Equivalents and Restricted Marketable Securities 
Restricted cash and cash equivalents and restricted marketable securities primarily represent assets that are held by our wholly-owned limited purpose insurance companies for workers' compensation and professional liability claims.
Investments in Marketable Securities and Restricted Marketable Securities 
Our investments in marketable securities and restricted marketable securities include available for sale securities, which are recorded at fair value. Unrealized gains and losses on available for sale securities that are deemed temporary are recorded as a separate component of stockholders equity. If any adjustment to fair value reflects a significant decline in the value of the security, we consider all available evidence to evaluate the extent to which the decline is other than temporary. Credit losses are identified when we do not expect to receive cash flows sufficient to recover the amortized cost basis of a security. In the event of a credit loss, only the amount associated with the credit loss is recognized in earnings, with the amount of loss relating to other factors recorded as a separate component of stockholders equity. 
Inventories
Inventories consist generally of food and supplies and are valued at the lower of cost or market, with cost determined on a first-in, first-out FIFO basis.
Mortgage and Other Notes Receivable
In accordance with Accounting Standards Codification ASC Topic 310, Receivables, NHC evaluates the carrying values of its mortgage and other notes receivable on an instrument by instrument basis. On a quarterly basis, NHC reviews its notes receivable for recoverability when events or circumstances, including the non-receipt of contractual principal and interest payments, significant deteriorations of the financial condition of the borrower and significant adverse changes in general economic conditions, indicate that the carrying amount of the note receivable may not be recoverable. If necessary, impairment is measured as the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the discounted cash flows expected to be received under the note receivable or, if foreclosure is probable, the fair value of the collateral securing the note receivable.
Property and Equipment
Property and equipment are recorded at cost. Depreciation is provided by the straight-line method over the expected useful lives of the assets estimated as follows: buildings and improvements, 20-40 years and equipment and furniture, 3-15 years. Leasehold improvements are amortized over periods that do not exceed the non-cancelable respective lease terms using the straight-line method.
Expenditures for repairs and maintenance are charged against income as incurred. Betterments, which significantly extend the useful life, are capitalized. We remove the costs and related allowances for accumulated depreciation or amortization from the accounts for properties sold or retired, and any resulting gains or losses are included in income. 
In accordance with ASC Topic 360, Property, Plant, and Equipment, we evaluate the recoverability of the carrying values of our properties on a property by property basis. We review our properties for recoverability when events or circumstances, including significant physical changes in the property, significant adverse changes in general economic conditions, and significant deteriorations of the underlying cash flows of the property, indicate that the carrying amount of the property may not be recoverable. The need to recognize impairment is based on estimated future undiscounted cash flows from a property over the remaining useful life compared to the carrying value of that property. If recognition of impairment is necessary, it is measured as the amount by which the carrying amount of the property exceeds the estimated fair value of the property.
Goodwill
The Company accounts for goodwill under ASC Topic 350, Intangibles Goodwill and Other. Under the provisions of this guidance, goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite useful lives are not amortized but are subject to impairment tests based on their estimated fair value. Unamortized goodwill is continually reviewed for impairment in accordance with ASC. The Company performs its annual impairment assessment on the first day of the fourth quarter.
Accrued Risk Reserves
We are principally self-insured for risks related to employee health insurance and utilize wholly-owned limited purpose insurance companies for workers compensation and professional liability claims. Accrued risk reserves primarily represent the accrual for risks associated with employee health insurance, workers compensation and professional liability claims. The accrued risk reserves include a liability for unpaid reported claims and estimates for incurred but unreported claims. Our policy with respect to a significant portion of our workers compensation and professional and general liability claims is to use an actuary to assist management in estimating our exposure for claims obligation for both asserted and unasserted claims. Our health insurance reserve is based on our known claims incurred and an estimate of incurred but unreported claims determined by our analysis of historical claims paid. We reassess our accrued risk reserves on a quarterly basis, with changes in estimated losses being recorded in the consolidated statements of income in the period first identified.
Other Current Liabilities
Other current liabilities primarily represent accruals for current federal and state income taxes, real estate taxes and other current liabilities.
Continuing Care Contracts and Refundable Entrance Fees
We have one continuing care retirement center CCRC within our operations. Residents at this retirement center may enter into continuing care contracts with us. The contract provides that 10% of the resident entry fee becomes non-refundable upon occupancy, and the remaining refundable portion of the entry fee is calculated using the lessor of the price at which the apartment is re-assigned or 90% of the original entry fee, plus 40% of any appreciation if the apartment exceeds the original residents entry fee. In each case, we amortize the non-refundable part of these fees into revenue over the actuarially determined remaining life of the resident, which is the expected period of occupancy by the resident. We pay the refundable portion of our entry fees when residents relocate from our community and the apartment is re-occupied. Refundable entrance fees are classified as non-current liabilities and non-refundable entrance fees are classified as deferred revenue in the Company consolidated balance sheets. The balances of refundable entrance fees as of December 31, 2015 and December31, 2014 were $9,865,000 and $10,219,000, respectively.
Obligation to Provide Future Services 
We annually estimate the present value of the net cost of future services and the use of facilities to be provided to the current CCRC residents and compare that amount with the balance of non-refundable deferred revenue from entrance fees received. If the present value of the net cost of future services exceeds the related anticipated revenues, a liability is recorded obligation to provide future services with a corresponding charge to income. At December 31, 2015 and 2014, we have recorded a future service obligation in the amounts of $3,440,000 and $3,927,000, respectively. 
Other Noncurrent Liabilities
Other noncurrent liabilities include reserves primarily related to various uncertain income tax positions see Note 12.
Deferred Revenue 
Deferred revenue includes the deferred gain on the sale of assets to National as discussed in Note 2 and entrance fees that have been and are currently being received upon reservation and occupancy in the independent living centers we operate. The non-refundable portion 10% of the entrance fee is included in deferred revenue and is being recognized over the remaining life expectancies of the residents. 
Income Taxes
We utilize ASC Topic 740, Income Taxes, which requires an asset and liability approach for financial accounting and reporting for income taxes. Under this guidance, deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based upon differences between financial reporting and tax basis of assets and liabilities and are measured using the enacted tax laws that will be in effect when the differences are expected to reverse. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date. See Note 12 for further discussion of our accounting for income taxes.
Also under ASC Topic 740, Income Taxes, tax positions are evaluated for recognition using a more-likely-than-not threshold, and those tax positions requiring recognition are measured at the largest amount of tax benefit that is greater than 50 percent likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement with a taxing authority that has full knowledge of all relevant information. Liabilities for income tax matters include amounts for income taxes, applicable penalties, and interest thereon and are the result of the potential alternative interpretations of tax laws and the judgmental nature of the timing of recognition of taxable income. 
Stock-Based Compensation
Stock-based awards granted include stock options, restricted stock units, and stock purchased under our employee stock purchase plan. Stock-based compensation cost is measured at the grant date, based on the fair value of the awards, and is recognized as expense over the requisite service period only for those equity awards expected to vest. 
The fair value of the restricted stock units is determined based on the stock price on the date of grant. We estimated the fair value of stock options and stock purchased under our employee stock purchase plan using the Black-Scholes model. This model utilizes the estimated fair value of common stock and requires that, at the date of grant, we use the expected term of the grant, the expected volatility of the price of our common stock, risk-free interest rates and expected dividend yield of our common stock. The fair value is amortized on a straight-line basis over the requisite service periods of the awards.
Concentration of Credit Risks
Our credit risks primarily relate to cash and cash equivalents, restricted cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, marketable securities, restricted marketable securities and notes receivable. Cash and cash equivalents are primarily held in bank accounts and overnight investments. Restricted cash and cash equivalents is primarily invested in commercial paper and certificates of deposit with financial institutions and other interest bearing accounts. Accounts receivable consist primarily of amounts due from patients funded through Medicare, Medicaid, other contractual programs and through private payors and from other health care companies for management, accounting and other services. We perform continual credit evaluations of our clients and maintain allowances for doubtful accounts on these accounts receivable. Marketable securities and restricted marketable securities are held primarily in accounts with brokerage institutions. Notes receivable relate primarily to secured loans with health care facilities recorded as notes receivable in the consolidated balance sheets as discussed in Note 10. 
At any point in time we have funds in our operating accounts and restricted cash accounts that are with third party financial institutions. These balances in the U.S. may exceed the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation FDIC insurance limits. While we monitor the cash balances in our operating accounts, these cash and restricted cash balances could be impacted if the underlying financial institutions fail or could be subject to other adverse conditions in the financial markets. 
Our financial instruments, principally our notes receivable, are subject to the possibility of loss of the carrying values as a result of the failure of other parties to perform according to their contractual obligations. We obtain various collateral and other protective rights, and continually monitor these rights in order to reduce such possibilities of loss. We evaluate the need to provide reserves for potential losses on our financial instruments based on management periodic review of the portfolio on an instrument by instrument basis. See Note 10 for additional information on the notes receivable.
Comprehensive Income
ASC Topic 220, Comprehensive Income, requires that changes in the amounts of certain items, including unrealized gains and losses on marketable securities, be shown in the consolidated financial statements as comprehensive income. We report comprehensive income in the consolidated statements of comprehensive income and also in the consolidated statements of stockholders equity.
Segment Disclosures
ASC Topic 280, Segment Reporting, establishes standards for the way that public business enterprises report information about operating segments in annual and interim financial reports issued to stockholders. Management believes that substantially all of our operations are part of the post-acute health care industry segment. See Note 3 for a detail of other revenues provided by our operations within the post-acute health care industry segment. Information about the costs and expenses associated with each of the components of other revenues is not separately identifiable. 
New Accounting Pronouncements
In January 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board FASB issued Accounting Standards Update ASU No. 2016-01,Financial Instruments - Recognition and Measurement of Financial Assets and Financial LiabilitiesTopic 825. ASU No. 2016-01 revises the classification and measurement of investments in certain equity investments and the presentation of certain fair value changes for certain financial liabilities measured at fair value. ASU No. 2016-01 requires the change in fair value of many equity investments to be recognized in net income. ASU No. 2016-01 is effective for interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2017, with early adoption permitted. Adopting ASU No. 2016-01 may result in a cumulative effect adjustment to the Companys retained earnings as of the beginning of the year of adoption. We are currently evaluating the potential effects of adopting the provisions of ASU No. 2016-01.
InNovember 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-17, Income Taxes which requires that deferred tax liabilities and assets be classified as noncurrent in a classified balance sheet. Prior to the issuance of the standard, deferred tax liabilities and assets were required to be separately classified into a current amount and a noncurrent amount in the balance sheet. The new accounting guidance represents a change in accounting principle and the standard is required to be adopted in annual periods beginning after December 15, 2016. Early adoption is permitted and the Company elected to early adopt this guidance as of December 31, 2015 and to apply the guidance prospectively to the 2015 presentation. Because the application of this guidance affects classification only, such reclassifications did not have a material effect on the Companys consolidated financial position or results of operations. In April 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-03, Imputation of Interest Sub-Topic 83530: Simplifying the Presentation of Debt Issuance Costs. ASU 2015-03 requires debt issuance costs related to a recognized debt liability be presented in the balance sheet as a direct deduction from the carrying amount of that debt liability, consistent with debt discounts. In August 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-15 clarifying the application of this guidance to line of credit arrangements. The amendments in the ASUs are effective retrospectively for fiscal years, and for interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2015. Early adoption is permitted for financial statements not previously issued. The Company does not expect the adoption of this guidance to have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements. 
In February 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-02 Amendments to the Consolidation Analysis. This update is in response to stakeholders that have expressed concerns that current generally accepted accounting principles GAAP might require a reporting entity to consolidate another legal entity in situations in which the reporting entitys contractual rights do not give it the ability to act primarily on its own behalf, the reporting entity does not hold a majority of the legal entitys voting rights, or the reporting entity is not exposed to a majority of the legal entitys economic benefits or obligations. Thus, the update modifies the evaluation of whether limited partnerships and similar legal entities are variable interest entities VIEs or voting interest entities. It eliminates the presumption that a general partner should consolidate a limited partnership, for limited partnerships and similar legal entities that qualify as voting interest entities; a limited partner with a controlling financial interest should consolidate a limited partnership. A controlling financial interest may be achieved through holding a limited partner interest that provides substantive kick-out rights. Finally, it requires consideration of the effects of fee arrangements and related parties on the primary beneficiary determination. The amendments in this update are effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2015, including interim periods within that reporting period. When adopted, the Company does not expect this standard to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.
In May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board FASB issued Accounting Standards Update ASU No. 2014-09 Revenue from Contracts with Customers. This update is the result of a collaborative effort by the FASB and the International Accounting Standards Board to simplify revenue recognition guidance, remove inconsistencies in the application of revenue recognition, and to improve comparability of revenue recognition practices across entities, industries, jurisdictions, and capital markets. The FASB is amending the Accounting Standards Codification and creating a new Topic 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers. The core principle of the guidance is that an entity should recognize revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. For a public entity, the amendments in this update are effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim periods within that reporting period. Early application is not permitted. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of this guidance on our consolidated financial statements and control framework. 
In April 2014, the FASB issued ASU No. 2014-08, Reporting Discontinued Operations and Disclosures of Disposals of Components of an Entity. This standard changes the requirements for reporting discontinued operations by raising the threshold for a disposal to qualify as a discontinued operation and requires new disclosures of both discontinued operations and certain other disposals that do not meet the definition of a discontinued operation. The standard limits discontinued operations reporting to disposals of components of an entity that represent strategic shifts that have or will have a major effect on an entitys operations and financial results. This standard is effective for the Company on a prospective basis for annual periods beginning on January 1, 2015 and interim periods within that year. This standard did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. Note 2 Relationship with National Health Corporation
National Health Corporation National, which is wholly-owned by the National Health Corporation Leveraged Employee Stock Ownership Plan ESOP, was formed in 1986 and is our administrative services affiliate and contractor. As discussed below, all of the personnel conducting our business, including our executive management team, are employees of National and may have ownership interests in National only through their participation as employees in the ESOP.
Management Contracts
We currently manage five skilled nursing facilities for National under a management contract. The management contract has been extended until January 1, 2018. See Note 3 for additional information regarding management services fees recognized from National.
Financing Activities
During 1991, we borrowed $10,000,000 from National. The term note payable currently requires quarterly interest payments at the prime rate minus 85 percent. The entire principal is due at maturity in 2018.
In conjunction with our management contract, we have entered into a line of credit arrangement whereby we may have amounts due from National from time to time. The maximum loan commitment under the line of credit is $2,000,000. At December 31, 2015, National did not have an outstanding balance on the line of credit.
The maximum line of credit commitment amount of $2,000,000 is also the amount of a deferred gain that has been outstanding since NHC sold certain assets to National in 1988. The amount of the deferred gain is expected to remain deferred until the management contract with National expires, currently scheduled in January 2018. The deferred gain is included in deferred revenue in the consolidated balance sheets.
Payroll and Related Services
The personnel conducting our business, including our executive management team, are employees of National and may have ownership interests in National only through their participation in the ESOP. National provides payroll services to NHC, provides employee fringe benefits, and maintains certain liability insurance. We pay to National all the costs of personnel employed for our benefit, as well as an administrative fee equal to 1% of payroll costs. Such costs of personnel totaling approximately $532,735,000, $510,249,000, and $453,560,000, for 2015, 2014 and 2013 respectively, are reflected as salaries, wages and benefits in the accompanying consolidated statements of income. The administrative fee paid to National for 2015, 2014, and 2013 was $4,542,000, $4,395,000, and $3,693,000, respectively. At December 31, 2015, the Company has recorded $3,965,000 in accounts receivable and $4,439,000 in accounts payable in the consolidated balance sheets as a result of the timing differences between interim payments for payroll and employee benefits services costs. At December 31, 2014, the Company recorded $2,155,000 in accounts receivable in the consolidated balance sheets as a result of these timing differences. 
Nationals Ownership of Our Stock
At December 31, 2015, National owns 1,214,763 shares or approximately 81% of our outstanding common stock. 
Consolidation Considerations
Because of the contractual and management relationships between NHC and National as described in this note above, we have considered whether National should be consolidated by NHC under the guidance provided in ASC Topic 810, Consolidation. We do not consolidate National because 1 NHC does not have any obligation or rights current or future to absorb losses or to receive benefits from National. The ESOP participants bear the current and future financial gain or burden of National, 2 Nationals equity at risk is sufficient to finance its activities without past or future subordinated support from NHC or other parties, and 3 the equity holders of National that is collectively the ESOP, its trustees, and the ESOP participants possess the characteristics of a controlling financial interest, including voting rights that are proportional to their economic interests. Supporting the assertions above is the following: 1 substantive independent trustees are appointed for the benefit of the ESOP participants when decisions must be made that may create the appearance of a conflict of interest between NHC and the ESOP, and 2 National was designed, formed and is operated for the purpose of creating variability and passing that variability along to the ESOP participantsthat is, to provide retirement benefits and value to the employees of NHC and NHCs affiliates. The contractual and management relationships between NHC and National are with the skilled nursing facilities that are substantially less than 50% of the fair value of the total assets of National. NHC does not have a variable interest in National as a whole. Note 3 Other Revenues
Other revenues are outlined in the table below. Revenues from insurance services include premiums for workers compensation and professional liability insurance policies that our wholly-owned insurance subsidiaries have written for certain healthcare operators to which we provide management or accounting services. Revenues from management and accounting services include fees provided to manage and provide accounting services to other healthcare operators. Revenues from rental income include health care real estate properties owned by us and leased to third party operators. Other revenues include miscellaneous health care related earnings.

Associated losses and expenses are reflected in the consolidated statements of income as Salaries, wages and benefits.
For professional liability insurance services, the premium revenues reflected in the consolidated statements of income for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013 were $2,797,000, $2,781,000, and $3,418,000, respectively. Associated losses and expenses including those for selfinsurance are included in the consolidated statements of income as Other operating costs and expenses.
Management Fees from National
We have managed skilled nursing facilities for National since 1988, and we currently manage five centers. See Note 2 regarding our relationship with National. 
During 2015, 2014 and 2013, National paid and we recognized approximately $3,599,000, $3,544,000, and $3,491,000, respectively, of management fees and interest on management fees. Unrecognized and unpaid management fees and interest on management fees from National total $21,345,000, $21,338,000, and $21,349,000 at December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively. We have recognized approximately $44,764,000 of management fees and interest from these facilities since 1988. 
The unpaid fees from these five facilities, because the amount collectable could not be reasonably determined when the management services were provided, and because we cannot estimate the timing or amount of expected future collections, will be recognized as revenues only when the collectability of these fees can be reasonably assured. Under the terms of our management agreement with National, the payment of these fees to us may be subordinated to other expenditures of the five skilled nursing facilities. We continue to manage these facilities so that we may be able to collect our fees in the future and because the incremental savings from discontinuing services to a facility may be small compared to the potential benefit. We may receive payment for the unrecognized management fees in whole or in part in the future only if cash flows from the operating and investing activities of centers or proceeds from the sale of the centers are sufficient to pay the fees. There can be no assurance that such future improved cash flows will occur. 
Management Fees and Financial and Accounting Services for Other Healthcare Centers 
During 2015 and 2014, we provided management services to six healthcare facilities in addition to the five National centers operated by third party owners. For the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, we recognized management fees of $2,490,000 and $2,205,000 from these centers, respectively. During 2013, we provided management services to 21 healthcare centers and recognized management fees of $4,413,000 from these centers. 
During 2015, we provided accounting and financial services to 20 healthcare facilities. During 2014 and 2013, we provided accounting and financial services to 27 healthcare facilities. No management services are provided for entities in which we provide accounting and financial services.
Rental Income 
The health care properties currently owned and leased to third party operators are located in the states of Florida and Tennessee. These properties consist of nine skilled nursing facilities and four assisted living facilities. Effective January 1, 2016, we entered into a new triple net lease agreement for eleven of the thirteen properties. The new lease agreement is for a ten year period and ends on December 31, 2025. Note 4 Non-Operating Income
Non-operating income is outlined in the table below. Non-operating income includes equity in earnings of unconsolidated investments, dividends and other realized gains and losses on securities, interest income, and other miscellaneous non-operating income. Our most significant equity method investment is a 751% non-controlling ownership interest in Caris, a business that specializes in hospice care services. See Note 16 for additional disclosures regarding Caris. For the year ended December 31, 2013, the gain on the recovery of notes receivable was due to the collection of certain notes receivable. The Company had previously written down these notes due to their deteriorated credit qualities. Year Ended December 31 2015

Capital Leases
Effective March 1, 2014, NHC began leasing and operating three senior healthcare facilities in the state of Missouri under three separate lease agreements. Two of the healthcare facilities are skilled nursing facilities that also include assisted living facilities and the third healthcare facility is a memory care facility. Each of the leases is a ten year lease with two five-year renewal options. Under the terms of the leases, base rent totals $5,200,000 annually with rent thereafter escalating by 4% of the increase in facility revenue over the 2014 base year. The leases also contain certain non-performance default provisions which resulted in capital lease classification. However, the initial measurement and recording of the capital lease assets and obligations does not include any expected payments under such default provisions, as the Company does not expect to incur an obligation for such payments. 
Fixed assets recorded under the capital leases, which are included in property and equipment in the consolidated balance sheets, are as follows December 31, 2015

At December 31, 2015, we lease from National Health Investors, Inc. NHI the real property of 35 skilled nursing facilities, seven assisted living centers and three independent living centers under two separate lease agreements. As part of the first lease agreement, we sublease four Florida skilled nursing facilities to a third party operator.
On January 1, 2007, a 15-year lease extension began which included three additional five-year renewal options. On December 26, 2012, NHC extended the lease agreement through the first of the three additional five-year renewal options, which extended the lease date through 2026. The two additional five-year renewal options on the lease still remain. Under the terms of the lease, base rent totals $30,750,000 with rent thereafter escalating by 4% of the increase in facility revenue over a 2007 base year. 
On September 1, 2013 and under the second lease agreement, NHC began operating seven skilled nursing facilities in New Hampshire and Massachusetts. The 15 year lease term consists of base rent of $3,450,000 annually with rent escalating by 4% of the increase in facility revenue over a 2014 base year. Additionally, NHC has the option to purchase the seven facilities from NHI in the 13th year of the lease for a purchase price of $49,000,000.
Base rent expense under both NHI lease agreements totals $34,200,000. Percentage rent under the leases is based on a quarterly calculation of revenue increases and is payable on a quarterly basis. Percentage rent expense under both leases for 2015, 2014, and 2013 was approximately $2,510,000, $2,334,000, and $2,526,000, respectively.
Each lease with NHI is a triple net lease under which we are responsible for paying all taxes, utilities, insurance premium costs, repairs and other charges relating to the ownership of the facilities. We are obligated at our expense to maintain adequate insurance on the facilities' assets.
We have a right of first refusal with NHI to purchase any of the properties should NHI receive an offer from an unrelated party during the term of the lease or up to 180 days after termination of the related lease.

Gross unrealized losses related to available for sale securities were $2,237,000 and $824,000 as of December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. For the marketable securities in gross unrealized loss positions, a it is more likely than not that the Company will not be required to sell the investment securities before recovery of the unrealized losses, and b the Company expects that the contractual principal and interest will be received on the investment securities. As a result, the Company recognized no other-than-temporary impairments for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014.
Proceeds from the sale of investments in marketable securities during the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013 were $47,574,000, $48,786,000, and $81,389,000, respectively. Net investment gains of $566,000, $379,000, and $39,000 were realized on these sales during the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014, and 2013, respectively. Note 8 Fair Value Measurements
The accounting standard for fair value measurements provides a framework for measuring fair value and requires expanded disclosures regarding fair value measurements. Fair value is defined as the price that would be received for an asset or the exit price that would be paid to transfer a liability in the principal or most advantageous market in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date. This accounting standard establishes a fair value hierarchy, which requires an entity to maximize the use of observable inputs, where available. The following summarizes the three levels of inputs that may be used to measure fair value Level 1 The valuation is based on quoted prices in active markets for identical instruments.
Level 2 The valuation is based on observable inputs such as quoted prices for similar instruments in active markets, quoted prices for identical or similar instruments in markets that are not active, and model-based valuation techniques for which all significant assumptions are observable in the market. 
Level 3 The valuation is based on unobservable inputs that are supported by minimal or no market activity and that are significant to the fair value of the instrument. Level 3 valuations are typically performed using pricing models, discounted cash flow methodologies, or similar techniques that incorporate managements own estimates of assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the instrument, or valuations that require significant management judgment or estimation.
A financial instruments level within the fair value hierarchy is based on the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement. 
Valuation of Marketable Securities
The Company determines fair value for marketable securities with Level 1 inputs through quoted market prices. The Company determines fair value for marketable securities with Level 2 inputs through broker or dealer quotations or alternative pricing sources with reasonable levels of price transparency. Our Level 2 marketable securities have been initially valued at the transaction price and subsequently valued, at the end of each month, typically utilizing third party pricing services or other market observable data. The pricing services utilize industry standard valuation models, including both income and market based approaches and observable market inputs to determine value. These observable market inputs include reportable trades, benchmark yields, credit spreads, broker/dealer quotes, bids, offers, and other industry and economic events. 
We validated the prices provided by our broker by reviewing their pricing methods, obtaining market values from other pricing sources, analyzing pricing data in certain instances and confirming that the relevant markets are active. After completing our validation procedures, we did not adjust or override any fair value measurements provided by our broker as of December 31, 2015 or 2014. We did not have any transfers of assets between Level 1 and Level 2 of the fair value measurement hierarchy during the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014, or 2013. 
Other
The carrying amounts of cash and cash equivalents, restricted cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, and accounts payable approximate fair value due to their short-term nature. The estimated fair value of notes receivable approximates the carrying value based principally on their underlying interest rates and terms, maturities, collateral and credit status of the receivables. Our long-term debt approximates fair value due to variable interest rates. At December 31, 2015 and 2014, there were no material differences between the carrying amounts and fair values of NHCs financial instruments.

On October 7, 2015, we entered into a $175 million Credit Agreement with Bank of America that replaces our former $75 million credit facility. The maturity date of the new credit facility is October 7, 2020. Loans bear interest at either i LIBOR plus 140% or ii the base rate plus 040%. The base rate is defined as the highest of a the Federal Funds Rate plus of 1%, b the Bank of America prime rate, and c LIBOR plus 100%. The credit facility is available for general corporate purposes, including working capital and acquisitions. NHC is permitted, upon required notice to the lender, to prepay the loans outstanding under the credit facility at any time, without penalty.
The Credit Agreement contains customary representations and financial covenants, including covenants that restrict, among other things, asset dispositions, mergers and acquisitions, dividends, restricted payments, debt, liens, investments and affiliate transactions. The Credit Agreement contains customary events of default.

This ASU requires that deferred tax assets and liabilities be classified as non-current in a statement of financial position. We early adopted ASU 2015-17 effective December 31, 2015 on a prospective basis. Adoption of this ASU resulted in a reclassification of our net current deferred tax liability to the net non-current deferred tax liability in our Consolidated Balance Sheet as of December 31, 2015. No prior periods were retrospectively adjusted.

Effective income tax expense 32,131 31,824 37,563 The exercise of non-qualified stock options results in state and federal income tax benefits to the Company related to the difference between the market price at the date of exercise and the option exercise price. During 2015, 2014 and 2013, $1,942,000, $201,000, and $225,000, respectively, attributable to the tax benefit of stock options exercised and restricted stock vested, was credited to additional paid-in capital. 
Our deferred tax assets have been evaluated for realization based on historical taxable income, tax planning strategies, the expected timing of reversals of existing temporary differences and future taxable income anticipated. Our deferred tax assets are more likely than not to be realized in full due to the existence of sufficient taxable income of the appropriate character under the tax law. As such, there is no need for a valuation allowance. 
Uncertain tax positions may arise where tax laws may allow for alternative interpretations or where the timing of recognition of income is subject to judgment. We believe we have adequate provisions for unrecognized tax benefits related to uncertain tax positions. However, because of uncertainty of interpretation by various tax authorities and the possibility that there are issues that have not been recognized by management, we cannot guarantee we have accurately estimated our tax liabilities. We believe that our liabilities reflect the anticipated outcome of known uncertain tax positions in conformity with ASC Topic 740 Income Taxes. Our liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits are presented in the consolidated balance sheets within other noncurrent liabilities.
Also under ASC Topic 740, tax positions are evaluated for recognition using a morelikelythannot threshold, and those tax positions requiring recognition are measured at the largest amount of tax benefit that is greater than 50 percent likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement with a taxing authority that has full knowledge of all relevant information. 
In accordance with current guidance, the Company has established a liability for unrecognized tax benefits, which are differences between a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return and the benefit recognized and measured. Generally a liability is created for an unrecognized tax benefit because it represents a companys potential future obligation to a taxing authority for a tax position that was not recognized per above. 
A reconciliation of the beginning and ending amount of unrecognized tax benefits is as follows in thousands Deferred Tax Asset

The Company is no longer subject to U.S. federal and state examinations by tax authorities for years before 2012 with few state exceptions. Currently, the 2012 U.S. federal return is under examination. Note 13 Stock Repurchase Program 
On May 7, 2015, the Board of Directors authorized two new stock repurchase programs, one that will allow for repurchase of up to $25 million of its common stock and one that allowed for the repurchase of up to $25 million of its preferred stock. As of November 3, 2015, all of the Companys preferred stock was redeemed. Therefore, no future repurchases of the preferred stock will be performed. The common stock repurchase plan expires on August 31, 2016. No repurchases of common stock have been executed under the current program.
Under the previously approved repurchase plans, the Company repurchased 125,000 shares of its common stock on August 11, 2014 for a total cost of $6,995,000. On February 19, 2013, the Company repurchased 100,000 shares for a total cost of $4,700,000. These two repurchases were funded from cash on hand and were cancelled and returned to the status of authorized but unissued. 
Under the common stock repurchase program, the Company may repurchase its common stock from time to time, in amounts and at prices the Company deems appropriate, subject to market conditions and other considerations. The Companys repurchases may be executed using open market purchases, privately negotiated agreements or other transactions. The Company intends to fund repurchases under the new stock repurchase programs from cash on hand, available borrowings or proceeds from potential debt or other capital market sources. The stock repurchase programs may be suspended or discontinued at any time without prior notice. The Company will provide an update regarding any purchases made pursuant to the stock repurchase programs each time it reports its results of operations. Note 14 Stock-Based Compensation
NHC recognizes stock-based compensation for all stock options and restricted stock granted over the requisite service period using the fair value for these grants as estimated at the date of grant either using the Black-Scholes pricing model for stock options or the quoted market price for restricted stock.
The 2005 and 2010 Stock-Based Compensation Plans
The Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors the Committee has the authority to select the participants to be granted options; to designate whether the option granted is an incentive stock option ISO, a nonqualified option, or a stock appreciation right; to establish the number of shares of common stock that may be issued upon exercise of the option; to establish the vesting provision for any award; and to establish the term any award may be outstanding. The exercise price of any ISOs granted will not be less than 100% of the fair market value of the shares of common stock on the date granted and the term of an ISO may not be any more than ten years. The exercise price of any nonqualified options granted will not be less than 100% of the fair market value of the shares of common stock on the date granted unless so determined by the Committee.
In May 2005, our stockholders approved the 2005 Stock Option, Employee Stock Purchase, Physician Stock Purchase and Stock Appreciation Rights Plan the 2005 Plan pursuant to which 1,200,000 shares of our common stock were available to grant as stock-based payments to key employees, directors, and non-employee consultants. At December 31, 2015, 175,620 shares were available for future grants under the 2005 Plan. 
In May 2010, our stockholders approved the 2010 Omnibus Equity Incentive Plan the 2010 Plan pursuant to which 1,200,000 shares of our common stock were available to grant as stock-based payments to key employees, directors, and non-employee consultants. In May 2015, our stockholders approved to amend the 2010 Plan to increase the number of shares of our common stock authorized under the Plan from the original 1,200,000 shares to 2,575,000 shares. At December 31, 2015, 1,762,534 shares were available for future grants under the 2010 Plan. 
Under both the 2005 and 2010 Plans, the individual restricted stock and option grant awards vest over periods up to five years. The term of the options outstanding under both Plans is five years from the date of the grant. Our policy is to issue new shares to satisfy option exercises. 
Additionally, we have an employee stock purchase plan that allows employees to purchase our shares of stock through payroll deductions. The plan allows employees to terminate participation at any time. 
Compensation expense is recognized only for the awards that ultimately vest. Stock-based compensation totaled $1,982,000, $2,021,000, and $2,298,000, for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014, and 2013, respectively. The expense for the 2015 year consisted of $1,910,000 for stock options and $72,000 for restricted stock. Stock-based compensation is included in salaries, wages and benefits in the consolidated statements of income. Tax deductions for the options exercised and restricted stock vested totaled $5,263,000, $697,000, and $196,000 for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014, and 2013, respectively. The total intrinsic value of shares exercised during the year ended December 31, 2015 was $5,447,000. 
At December 31, 2015, we had $272,000 of unrecognized compensation cost related to unvested stock-based compensation awards. This expense will be recognized over the remaining weighted average vesting period, which is approximately 02 years.

The Company is required to estimate the fair value of stock-based awards on the date of grant. The fair value of each option award is estimated using the BlackScholes option valuation model with the weighted average assumptions indicated in the following table. Each grant is valued as a single award with an expected term based upon expected employment and termination behavior. Compensation cost is recognized over the requisite service period in a manner consistent with the option vesting provisions. The straightline attribution method requires that compensation expense is recognized at least equal to the portion of the grantdate fair value that is vested at that date. The expected volatility is derived using weekly historical data for periods immediately preceding the date of grant. The riskfree interest rate is the approximate yield on the United States Treasury Strips having a life equal to the expected option life on the date of grant. The expected life is an estimate of the number of years an option will be held before it is exercised. The following table summarizes the assumptions used to value the options granted in the periods shown. Year Ended December 31 2015

Accrued Risk Reserves
We are self-insured for risks related to health insurance and have wholly-owned limited purpose insurance companies that insure risks related to workers compensation and general and professional liability insurance claims both for our owned or leased entities and certain of the entities to which we provide management or accounting services. The liability we have recognized for reported claims and estimates for incurred but unreported claims totals $98,508,000 and $106,218,000 at December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. The liability is included in accrued risk reserves in the consolidated balance sheets. The amounts are subject to adjustment for actual claims incurred. It is possible that these claims plus unasserted claims could exceed our insurance coverages and our reserves, which would have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations and cash flows.
As a result of the terms of our insurance policies and our use of wholly-owned limited purpose insurance companies, we have retained significant insurance risk with respect to workers compensation and general and professional liability. We use independent actuaries to assist management in estimating our exposures for claims obligations for both asserted and unasserted claims related to deductibles and exposures in excess of coverage limits, and we maintain reserves for these obligations. Such estimates are based on many variables including historical and statistical information and other factors. 
Workers Compensation
For workers compensation, we utilize a wholly-owned Tennessee domiciled property/casualty insurance company to write coverage for NHC affiliates and for third-party customers. Policies are written for a duration of twelve months and cover only risks related to workers compensation losses. All customers are companies which operate in the long-term care industry. Business is written on a direct basis. For direct business, coverage is written for statutory limits and the insurance companys losses in excess of $1,000,000 per claim are covered by reinsurance. 
General and Professional Liability Insurance and Lawsuits
The long term care industry has experienced significant increases in both the number of personal injury/wrongful death claims and in the severity of awards based upon alleged negligence by nursing facilities and their employees in providing care to residents. As of December 31, 2015, we and/or our managed centers are currently defendants in 32 such claims covering the years 2006 through December 31, 2015. 
In 2002, due to the unavailability and/or prohibitive cost of third-party professional liability insurance coverage, we established and capitalized a wholly-owned licensed liability insurance company incorporated in the Cayman Island, for the purpose of managing our losses related to these risks. Thus, since 2002, insurance coverage for incidents occurring at all NHC owned providers, and most providers managed by us, is provided through this wholly-owned insurance company. 
Insurance coverage for all years includes both primary policies and excess policies. Beginning in 2003, both primary and excess coverage is provided through our whollyowned insurance company. The primary coverage is in the amount of $10 million per incident, $30 million per location with an annual primary policy aggregate limit that is adjusted on an annual basis. The excess coverage is $75 million annual excess in the aggregate applicable to years 20052007, $90 million annual excess in the aggregate for years 20082010, $40 million excess per occurrence for 20112013 and $90 million excess per occurrence for 2014-2015. 
Beginning in 2008 and continuing through 2015, additional insurance is purchased through third party providers that serve to supplement the coverage provided through our wholly-owned captive insurance company. 
There is certain additional litigation incidental to our business, none of which, based upon information available to date, would be material to our financial position, results of operations, or cash flows. In addition, the long-term care industry is continuously subject to scrutiny by governmental regulators, which could result in litigation or claims related to regulatory compliance matters. 
Civil Investigation Demand On December 19, 2013, the Company was served with a civil investigative demand from the U.S. Department of Justice and the Office of the U.S. Attorney for the Eastern District of Tennessee requesting the production of documents and interrogatory responses regarding the billing and medical necessity of certain rehabilitative therapy services. Based upon our review, the request appears to relate to services provided at our facilities based in Knoxville, Tennessee. 
On October 7, 2014, the Company received a subpoena from the Office of Inspector General of the United Department of Health and Human Services OIG Subpoena related to the current DOJ Investigation. The OIG Subpoena requests certain financial and organizational documents from the Company and certain of its subsidiaries and SNFs and medical records from certain of the Companys Tennessee-based SNFs. 
The Company is cooperating fully with these requests. We are unable to evaluate the outcome of this investigation at this time. It is possible that this claim could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position, results of operations and cash flows.
Caris HealthCare, L.P. Lawsuit
On December 9, 2014, Caris Healthcare, L.P. Caris, a business that specializes in hospice care services in Company-owned health care centers and in other settings in Missouri, Tennessee, South Carolina and Virginia, received notice from the U.S. Attorneys Office for the Eastern District of Tennessee and the Attorney Generals Offices for the State of Tennessee and State of Virginia that those government entities were conducting an investigation regarding patient eligibility for hospice services provided by Caris. We have a 751% non-controlling ownership interest in Caris. Caris is cooperating with these government entities in connection with this investigation. We are unable to evaluate the outcome of this investigation at this time. It is possible that this claim could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position, results of operations and cash flows.
South Carolina Medicaid Audits
The South Carolina Office of State Auditor State Auditor conducted Medicaid cost report audits for eleven of the Companys South Carolina skilled nursing facilities. The State Auditor has issued audit findings for the fiscal years ending September 30, 2013 and September 30, 2014. 
The Company has filed administrative appeals with the South Carolina Department of Health and Human Services and this process is continuing within the legal system. In January 2016, we had a preliminary conference with the State Auditors. At December 31, 2015, the liabilities titled Amounts Due to Third Party Payors in the consolidated balance sheets have been reduced by approximately $68 million due to the paybacks that have taken place regarding this matter. 
Governmental Regulations
Laws and regulations governing the Medicare, Medicaid and other federal healthcare programs are complex and subject to interpretation. Management believes that it is in compliance with all applicable laws and regulations in all material respects. However, compliance with such laws and regulations can be subject to future government review and interpretation as well as significant regulatory action including fines, penalties, and exclusions from the Medicare, Medicaid and other federal healthcare programs. 
Debt Guarantees
At December 31, 2015, no agreement to guarantee the debt of other parties exists. Note 16 Equity Method Investment in Caris HealthCare, L.P. 
As of December 31, 2015, we have a 751% non-controlling ownership interest in Caris, a business that specializes in hospice care services in NHC owned health care centers and in other settings. The carrying value of our investment is $35,771,000 and $35,020,000 at December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. The carrying amounts are included in investments in limited liability companies in the consolidated balance sheets. The difference between the carrying value of our investment and our capital account balance in Caris is due to the additional limited partner ownership interest the Company acquired from current and former partners. Summarized financial information of Caris for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014, and 2013 is provided below. December 31 2015

18,806 Consolidation Considerations
Due to our ownership percentage in Caris, we have considered whether Caris should be consolidated by NHC under the guidance provided in ASC Topic 810, Consolidation. We do not consolidate Caris because 1 Caris equity at risk is sufficient to finance its activities without additional subordinated financial support, 2 the general partner of the Partnership has the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact the economic performance of Caris, and 3 the equity holders of Caris possess the characteristics of a controlling financial interest, including voting rights that are proportional to their economic interests. Supporting the assertions above is the following: 1 the ownership percentage of the general partner remains equally divided between NHC and another party, 2 the general partner manages and controls the Partnership with full and complete discretion, and 3 the limited partners have no right or power to take part in the control of the business of the Partnership, which is where our ownership percentage increases have occurred. Note 17 Variable Interest Entity
Accounting guidance requires that a variable interest entity VIE, according to the provisions of ASC Topic 810, Consolidation, must be consolidated by the primary beneficiary. The primary beneficiary is the party that has both the power to direct activities of a VIE that most significantly impact the entitys economic performance and the obligation to absorb losses of the entity or the right to receive benefits from the entity that could potentially be significant to the VIE. We perform ongoing qualitative analysis to determine if we are the primary beneficiary of a VIE. At December 31, 2015, we are the primary beneficiary of one VIE and therefore consolidate that entity.
Springfield, Missouri Lease
In December 2010, we signed an operating agreement to lease Springfield Rehabilitation and Health Care Center, a 120-bed skilled nursing facility located in Springfield, Missouri. The terms of the lease include a ten year lease and include five additional, five year lease options as well as a purchase option. The operating lease agreement was established on the same date third party owners purchased the real estate of the 120-bed skilled nursing facility. The third party owners purchased the real estate for $4,500,000, which is the amount NHC loaned the owners to purchase the facility under the terms of the lease agreement and the mortgage note. The risks and rewards associated with the operations of the facility and any appreciation or deprecation in the value of the real estate of the facility is borne by NHC. At December 31, 2015 and 2014, the $4,500,000 mortgage note receivable from the third party owners is eliminated in our consolidated financial statements. Land and buildings and improvements of $4,500,000 have been recorded in our consolidated financial statements, as well as the operations of the facility since December 1, 2010, because we are the primary beneficiary in the relationship. Note 18 Redemption of the Series A Convertible Preferred Stock
On October 31, 2007, NHC issued $170,555,000 of NHC Series A Convertible Preferred Stock the Preferred Stock with a liquidation preference of $1575. Each share of the Preferred Stock was entitled to annual preferred dividends of $080 per share. 
On November 3, 2015, the Series A Convertible Preferred Stock was redeemed for cash at a redemption price of $1575 per share, plus an accrued dividend of $004 per share, for a total of $1579 per share. There were 8,288,098 shares of Preferred Stock redeemed under the mandatory redemption for approximately $130,538,000. As of November 3, 2015, the Preferred Stock is no longer deemed outstanding, and all rights with respect to such stock ceased and terminated, except for the right of the holders to receive payment of the redemption price, without interest. The funding of the Preferred Stock redemption was provided by the Company cash on hand and borrowings under the credit facility of approximately $110,000,000. 
In lieu of redemption, the holders of the Preferred Stock could have converted any or all of their shares into shares of the Company common stock. The holders electing to convert their Preferred Shares received 024204 shares of common stock for each Preferred Share, together with the cash payable with respect to fractional shares. There were 2,548,561 shares of preferred stock that were converted into 616,757 shares of the Company common stock during the 2015 year. Note 19 Series B Junior Participating Preferred Stock
On August 2, 2007, the NHC Board of Directors approved the adoption of a stockholder rights plan and declared a dividend distribution of one right a Right for each outstanding share of NHC common stock to stockholders of record at the close of business on August 2, 2007. Each Right entitles the registered holder to purchase from NHC a unit consisting of one one-ten thousandth of a share of Series B Junior Participating Preferred Stock, $001 par value at a purchase price of $250 per Unit, subject to adjustment. The description and terms of the Rights are set forth in a rights agreement between NHC and Computershare Trust Company, N.A., as rights agent, dated as of August 2, 2007, as may be amended, restated or otherwise modified from time to time. No shares have been issued pursuant to this stockholder rights plan. Note 20 Selected Quarterly Financial Data

CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES
Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures
Based on their evaluation as of December 31, 2015, the Chief Executive Officer and Principal Accounting Officer of the Company have concluded that the Companys disclosure controls and procedures as defined in Rules 13a-15e and 15d-15e under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended were effective to ensure that the information required to be disclosed by us in this Annual Report on Form 10-K was recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SECs rules and instructions for Form 10-K. 46 MANAGEMENTS REPORT ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING
We are responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as defined in Rule 13a-15f under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. We assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2015. In making this assessment, our management used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission COSO in Internal Control-Integrated Framework 2013 Framework. We have concluded that, as of December 31, 2015, our internal control over financial reporting is effective based on these criteria. Our independent registered public accounting firm, Ernst Young, LLP, has issued an attestation report on the effectiveness of the Companys internal control over financial reporting included herein. 47 REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM
Board of Directors and Stockholders
National HealthCare Corporation
We have audited National HealthCare Corporations internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2015, based on criteria established in Internal ControlIntegrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission 2013 Framework the COSO criteria. National HealthCare Corporations management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying Managements Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the companys internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. 
We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board United States. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.
A companys internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A companys internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that 1 pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; 2 provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and 3 provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of the companys assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
In our opinion, National HealthCare Corporation maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2015, based on the COSO criteria.
We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board United States, the consolidated balance sheets of National HealthCare Corporation as of December 31, 2015 and 2014, and the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, stockholders' equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2015 and our report dated February 19, 2016, expressed an unqualified opinion thereon. s/ Ernst Young LLP
