NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
DECEMBER 31, 1996
1. Formation and Organization
New Century Energies, Inc. NCE was incorporated under the laws of the
State of Delaware on August 21, 1995 with 50% of its outstanding 200 shares of
common stock, $100 par value, purchased by Public Service Company of Colorado
PSCo and 50% purchased by Southwestern Public Service Company SPS.
NCE, PSCo and SPS entered into an Agreement and Plan of Reorganization
the Merger Agreement, dated August 22, 1995, as amended on December 8, 1995,
providing for a business combination as peer firms involving PSCo and SPS in a
merger of equals transaction the Merger. NCE will be a holding company
registered under the Public Utility Holding Company Act of 1935, as amended.
Accordingly, as part of the Merger, on January 30, 1996, NCE filed its
application with the SEC to be a registered public utility holding company and
the parent company for PSCo and SPS. Discussions with the SEC have been held and
will continue, as needed, in an effort to expedite their approval. The Merger is
expected to occur shortly after all of the conditions to the consummation of the
Merger, including applicable regulatory approvals, are met or waived. It is
expected that the Merger will be completed during the spring of 1997; however,
the timing of the effective date of the Merger is primarily dependent upon the
regulatory process as described below.
Under the terms of the Merger Agreement, NCE will form PSCo Merger Corp.,
which will be merged with and into PSCo and NCE will form SPS Merger Corp.,
which will be merged with and into SPS. PSCo and SPS will be the surviving
corporations and will become wholly-owned subsidiaries of NCE. Each share of NCE
common stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the effective time of
the Merger will be canceled, and no consideration shall be delivered in exchange
for such stock. Each outstanding share of PSCo common stock, par value $500 per
share, will be canceled and converted into the right to receive one share of NCE
common stock and each outstanding share of SPS common stock, $100 par value,
will be canceled and converted into the right to receive 095 of one share of
NCE common stock. At December 31, 1996, PSCo had 648 million common shares
outstanding and SPS had 409 million common shares outstanding. Based on such
capitalization, the Merger would result in the common shareholders of PSCo
owning 63% of the common equity of NCE and the common shareholders of SPS owning
37% of the common equity of NCE.
NCE filed a registration statement on Form S-4 with the SEC which became
effective on December 13, 1995 with respect to the shares of common stock of NCE
issuable in the mergers discussed above. On January 31, 1996, the shareholders
of PSCo and SPS approved the Merger Agreement.
As noted above, the Merger is subject to customary closing conditions,
including the receipt of all necessary governmental approvals and the making of
all necessary governmental filings, including approvals and findings of state
utility regulators in Colorado, Texas, New Mexico, Wyoming and Kansas, as well
as the approval of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission FERC, the
Nuclear Regulatory Commission NRC, the Securities and Exchange Commission
SEC, the Federal Trade Commission and the U.S. Department of Justice DOJ
in addition to the expiration or termination of the applicable waiting periods
under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976 HSR, as
amended. The required authorizations from the Public Utilities Commission of the
State of Colorado, the Public Utility Commission of Texas, the Public Service
Commission of Wyoming, the New Mexico Public Utility Commission, the Kansas
Corporation Commission, the NRC and the DOJ have been obtained. The waiting
period under the HSR Act has expired. Related to FERC approval, hearings were
held in late September 1996 and a non-unanimous settlement agreement was
reached. On January 23, 1997, the sole party opposing the settlement agreement
filed a notice with the FERC withdrawing all of its pleadings. PSCo and SPS have
requested that the FERC give the matter expedited consideration, and accordingly
a final FERC order is expected shortly. The Company expects that the SEC will
make its ruling on the Merger within 30-60 days following the FERC decision.
5   The corporate offices of NCE will be located in Denver, Colorado with
significant operating functions based in Amarillo, Texas. NCE Board of
Directors will consist of a total of 14 directors, eight of whom will be
designated by PSCo and six of whom will be designated by SPS.
NCE currently engages in no significant  operations other than the
organization of the proposed public utility holding company. Descriptions of the
businesses of PSCo and SPS are contained in their reports under Section 13 or
15d of the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934 the 1934 Act Reports
incorporated herein by reference.
2. Related Party Transactions
PSCo and SPS have incurred all costs related to the formation of NCE,
including those costs associated with the registration of NCE common stock and
its application to be a registered public utility holding company. Such costs,
approximately $20 and $15 million in 1996 and 1995, respectively, were not
charged to NCE. Accordingly, the Company has no operating or cash flow
activities to report in statements of income or statements of cash flows for the
year ended December 31, 1996 and for the period from inception August 22, 1995
to December 31, 1995.
The cash held by NCE at December 31, 1995 was deposited into a PSCo bank
account during the first quarter of 1996 and, accordingly, NCE has recognized
this amount as a receivable from shareholder at December 31, 1996.                    6 Item 1.     1
