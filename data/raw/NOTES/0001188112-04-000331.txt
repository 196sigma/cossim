index present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Aware,
Inc. and its subsidiary at December 31, 2003 and 2002, and the results of their
operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended
December 31, 2003 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in
the United States of America. In addition, in our opinion, the financial
statement schedule listed in the accompanying index presents fairly, in all
material respects, the information set forth therein when read in conjunction
with the related consolidated financial statements. These financial statements
and financial statement schedule are the responsibility of the Company
management; our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial
statements and financial statement schedule based on our audits. We conducted
our audits of these statements in accordance with auditing standards generally
accepted in the United States of America, which require that we plan and perform
the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements
are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis,
evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements,
assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by
management, and evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We
believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. PRICEWATERHOUSECOOPERS LLP Boston, Massachusetts

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
1.  NATURE OF BUSINESS
We are a leader in the development and marketing of intellectual property
for broadband communications. Our principal offering to date has been
Asymmetric Digital Subscriber Line ADSL technology for the
telecommunications industry. ADSL enables telephone companies to use their
existing copper telephone lines to offer broadband services. We have
adopted an intellectual property business model in which we neither
manufacture nor sell integrated circuits incorporating our technology. We
license our broadband technology on a nonexclusive and worldwide basis to
semiconductor companies that manufacture and sell products that incorporate
our technology. Our licensees sell integrated circuits to equipment
companies who incorporate those integrated circuits into their products. We
also offer ADSL hardware products and image compression software products.
2.  SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
BASIS OF PRESENTATION - The consolidated financial statements include the
accounts of Aware, Inc. and its subsidiary. All significant intercompany
transactions have been eliminated.
CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS - Cash and cash equivalents consist primarily of
demand deposits, money market funds, commercial paper, and discount notes
in highly liquid short-term instruments with original maturities of three
months or less from the date of purchase and are stated at cost, which
approximates market.
INVESTMENTS - At December 31, 2003 and 2002, we categorized all securities
as available-for-sale, since we may liquidate these investments
currently. In calculating realized gains and losses, cost is determined
using specific identification. Unrealized gains and losses on
available-for-sale securities are excluded from earnings and reported in a
separate component of stockholders' equity. At December 31, 2003 and 2002,
unrealized gains and losses were not material.
The amortized cost of securities, which approximates fair value, consists
of the following at December 31, 2003 and 2002 in thousands     Short-term investments            2003       2002
Corporate debt securities.     $1,393      $3,185
U.S. agency securities.     14,154      4,849
$15,547      $8,034
Investments                 2003       2002
Corporate debt securities.     $1,709      $1,030
U.S. agency securities.     2,204      12,786
$3,913     $13,816
Short-term investments mature within three to twelve months, and
investments mature within one to three years.
ALLOWANCE FOR DOUBTFUL ACCOUNTS - Accounts are charged to the allowance for
doubtful accounts as they are deemed uncollectible based on a periodic
review of the accounts.
INVENTORIES - Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market with
cost being determined by the first-in, first-out FIFO method.
32                  AWARE, INC.
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
PROPERTY AND EQUIPMENT - Property and equipment are stated at cost.
Depreciation and amortization of property and equipment is provided using
the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets.
Upon retirement or sale, the costs of the assets disposed of and the
related accumulated depreciation are removed from the accounts and any
resulting gain or loss is included in the determination of income or loss.
The estimated useful lives of assets used by us are     Building and   30 years
Building   5 to 20 years
Furniture and fixtures and office equipment.  5 years
Computer & manufacturing equipment.  3 years
Purchased   3 years
IMPAIRMENT OF LONG-LIVED ASSETS - We review long-lived assets for
impairment whenever events or changes in business circumstances indicate
that the carrying amount of the assets may not be fully recoverable or that
the useful lives of these assets are no longer appropriate. Each impairment
test is based on a comparison of the undiscounted cash flows to the
recorded value of the asset. If an impairment is indicated, the asset is
written down to its estimated fair value on a discounted cash flow basis.
The cash flow estimates used to determine the impairment, if any, reflect
our best estimates using appropriate assumptions and projections at that
time. We believe that no significant impairment of our long-lived assets
has occurred as of December 31, 2003 and 2002.
REVENUE RECOGNITION. Effective January 1, 2000, we adopted Securities and
Exchange Commission Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 101, Revenue Recognition
in Financial Statements SAB 101, which was superseded by SAB 104
effective December 2003 and was adopted by us at that time. Accordingly,
our general revenue recognition policy is to recognize revenue when there
is persuasive evidence of an arrangement, the sales price is fixed or
determinable, collection of the related receivable is reasonably assured,
and delivery has occurred or services have been rendered.
We derive our revenue from three sources i product revenue, which
includes revenue from the sale of ADSL equipment products and compression
software products, ii contract revenue, which includes license and
engineering service fees that we receive under customer agreements, and
iii royalties that we receive under customer contracts. In addition to
the above general revenue recognition principles prescribed by SAB 104, our
specific revenue recognition policies for each revenue source are more
fully described below.
PRODUCT SALES. Product sales consist primarily of revenue from the sale of:
i hardware products, and ii compression software.
o  Hardware products, including ADSL transceiver modules and test and
development systems are standalone products that are sold
independently of our technology licensing business. The terms of sales
generally do not contain provisions that obligate us to provide
additional products or services after shipment. Additionally, we do
not grant return rights other than normal warranty rights of return.
We recognize revenue: i upon shipment when products are shipped FOB
shipping point, and ii upon delivery at the customer location when
products are shipped FOB destination.
o  Compression software consists of standard off-the-shelf software
products that are sold to OEM customers that integrate our software
into their equipment-based products. The terms of sale generally do
not contain provisions that obligate us to provide additional products
or services after shipment, other than technical telephone support for
a brief period of time post sale. The cost of providing technical
support is inconsequential because of the limited scope of the
support. Additionally, we do not grant return rights other than normal
warranty rights of return, and we generally do not customize software
for customers. Occasionally, we sell maintenance contracts that
entitle customers to product updates.
33                  AWARE, INC.
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
We recognize compression software revenue by applying the principles
set forth in SAB 104 and American Institute of Certified Public
Accountants AICPA Statement of Position No. 97-2, Software Revenue
Recognition. Accordingly, we recognize revenue for software licenses:
i upon shipment when products are shipped FOB shipping point, and
ii upon delivery at the customer location when products are
shipped FOB destination. We recognize revenue for maintenance
contracts ratably over the related contract period.
CONTRACT REVENUE. We enter into nonexclusive development and license
agreements with semiconductor licensees that generally require us to make
technology transfers and/or provide engineering services. In return, we
receive one or more of the following forms of consideration: i license
fees; ii engineering service fees; and iii royalty payments.
License fees or engineering services fees are typically paid and the
revenue is recognized during the product development period as technology
transfers are made or as engineering services milestones are achieved.
Engineering milestones have historically been formulated to correlate with
the estimated level of effort and related costs. Royalties are paid once a
customer begins shipping products that incorporate our technology. We
classify license and engineering service fees as contract revenue and we
classify royalty payments as royalties.
When our agreements include both the transfer of technology and the
provision of engineering services, we combine the total license and
engineering service fees to be paid under the agreement. These total fees
are recognized ratably over the expected product development period,
subject to the limitation that the cumulative revenue recognized through
the end of any period may not exceed cumulative contract payments to date.
We review assumptions regarding the product development period on a regular
basis and make adjustments as required. We believe that this method
represents the appropriate systematic method for revenue recognition for
this type of contract.
After customers enter into development and license agreements, they often
engage us to provide additional engineering work that is beyond the scope
of their original base agreement. When customers request additional
services, both parties agree to engineering fees that are based on the
level of effort required. We recognize revenue from these agreements either
as engineering services are performed or as milestones are achieved.
ROYALTY REVENUE. Royalty revenue is generally recognized in the quarter in
which a report is received from a licensee detailing the shipments of
products incorporating our intellectual property components i.e., in the
quarter following the sales of the licensed product by the licensee. The
terms of our licensing agreements generally require licensees to give
notification to us and to pay royalties within 45 to 60 days of the end of
the quarter during which sales of licensed products take place.
INCOME TAXES - We compute deferred income taxes based on the differences
between the financial statement and tax basis of assets and liabilities
using enacted rates in effect in the years in which the differences are
expected to reverse. We establish a valuation allowance to offset temporary
deductible differences, net operating loss carryforwards and tax credits
when it is more likely than not that the deferred tax assets will not be
realized.
CAPITALIZATION OF SOFTWARE COSTS - We capitalize certain internally
generated software development costs after technological feasibility of the
product has been established. No software costs were capitalized for the
years ended December 31, 2003, 2002 and 2001, because such costs incurred
subsequent to the establishment of technological feasibility, but prior to
commercial availability, were immaterial.
CONCENTRATION OF CREDIT RISK - At December 31, 2003 and 2002, we had cash
and investments, in excess of federally insured deposit limits of
approximately $389 million and $470 million, respectively.
Concentration of credit risk with respect to net accounts receivable
consists of $05 million, $05 million, and $04 million with three
customers at December 31, 2003 and $06 million, $04 million, and $02
million with three customers at December 31, 2002.
34                  AWARE, INC.
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION - We grant stock options to our employees and
directors. Such grants are for a fixed number of shares with an exercise
price equal to the fair value of the shares at the date of grant. As
permitted by SFAS No. 123, Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation, we
account for stock option grants in accordance with Accounting Principles
Board APB Opinion No. 25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees
and FASB Interpretation No. 44 FIN 44, Accounting for Certain
Transactions Involving Stock Compensation. Accordingly, we have adopted
the provisions of SFAS No. 123 through disclosure only.
At December 31, 2003, we have four stock-based employee compensation plans,
which are described more fully in Note 6. No stock-based employee
compensation cost is reflected in net income, as all options granted under
those plans had an exercise price equal to the fair market value of the
underlying common stock on the date of grant. The following table
illustrates the pro forma effect on net loss and earnings per share if we
had applied the fair value recognition provisions of SFAS No. 123 and SFAS
No. 148, Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation-Transition and Disclosure
- An Amendment of SFAS No. 123, to stock-based employee compensation in

Black-Scholes option pricing model. Key assumptions used to apply this
pricing model are as follows                                    Year ended December 31,
2003        2002        2001

Expected dividend yield.         -         -             COMPUTATION OF EARNINGS PER SHARE - Basic earnings per share is computed by
dividing income available to common shareholders by the weighted average
number of common shares outstanding. Diluted earnings per share is computed
by dividing income available to common shareholders by the weighted average
number of common shares outstanding plus additional common shares that
would have been outstanding if dilutive potential common shares had been
issued. For the purposes of this calculation, stock options are considered
common stock equivalents in periods in which they have a dilutive effect.
Stock options that are antidilutive are excluded from the calculation.
USE OF ESTIMATES - The preparation of our financial statements in
conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires us to
make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets
and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the
date of the financial statements and the reported amount of revenues and
expenses during the reporting period. Significant estimates include revenue
recognition, reserves for doubtful accounts, reserves for excess and
obsolete inventory, useful lives of fixed assets, valuation allowance for
deferred income tax assets, and accrued liabilities. Actual results could
differ from those estimates.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS - The carrying amounts of cash and cash
equivalents, short-term investments, accounts receivable, accounts payable
and accrued expenses approximate fair value because of their short-term
nature.
COMPREHENSIVE INCOME LOSS - Comprehensive income loss is defined as the
change in equity of a business enterprise during a period from transactions
and other events and circumstances from non-owner sources, including
foreign currency translation adjustments and unrealized gains and losses on
marketable securities. For the years ended December 31, 2003, 2002 and
2001, comprehensive income loss was not materially different from net
income loss.
ADVERTISING COSTS - Advertising costs are expensed as incurred and were not
material for 2003, 2002 and 2001.
RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS - In December 2003, the SEC issued Staff
Accounting Bulletin SAB No. 104, Revenue Recognition, which supersedes
SAB No. 101, Revenue Recognition in Financial Statements. SAB No. 104
rescinds accounting guidance in SAB No. 101 related to multiple-element
arrangements as this guidance has been superseded as a result of the
issuance of EITF 00-21, Accounting for Revenue Arrangements with Multiple
Deliverables EITF 00-21. The adoption of SAB No. 104 did not have a
material impact on the Company financial position, results of operations
or cash flows.
In May 2003, FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards 150
SFAS 150, Accounting for Certain Financial Instruments with
Characteristics of Both Liabilities and Equity. SFAS 150 establishes
standards for how an issuer classifies and measures certain financial
instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity. It
requires that an issuer classify a financial instrument that is within its
scope as a liability. For all financial instruments entered into or
modified after May 31, 2003, SFAS 150 is effective immediately. For all
other instruments, SFAS 150 goes into effect at the beginning of the first
interim period beginning after June 15, 2003. The adoption of SFAS 150 did
not have a material impact on our financial position or results of
operations.
In April 2003, the Financial Accounting Standards Board FASB issued
SFAS No. 149 SFAS 149, Amendment of Statement 133 on Derivative
Instruments and Hedging Activities. This statement amends SFAS 133 to
provide clarification on the financial accounting and reporting of
derivative instruments and hedging activities and requires contracts with
similar characteristics to be accounted for on a comparable basis. This
statement was effective for contracts entered into or modified after June
30, 2003 and for hedging relationships designated after June 30, 2003. The
Company adopted SFAS 149 on July 1, 2003 and the adoption did not have a
material effect on its consolidated financial position or results of
operations.
In January 2003, the FASB issued FASB Interpretation No. 46, as amended by
FIN 46R, Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities, an Interpretation of
ARB 51 FIN 46. The primary objectives of FIN 46 are to provide
guidance on the identification of entities for which control is achieved
through means other than through voting rights variable interest
entities or VIEs and how to determine when and which business
enterprise should consolidate the VIE. This new model for consolidation
applies to an entity which either: a the equity investors if any do not
have a controlling financial interest; or b the equity investment at risk
is insufficient to finance that entity activities without receiving
additional subordinated financial support from other parties. In addition,
FIN 46 requires that both the primary beneficiary and all other enterprises
with a significant variable interest in a VIE make additional disclosures.
FIN 46 is effective for all new VIEs created or acquired after January 31,
2003. For VIEs created or acquired prior to February 1, 2003, the
provisions of FIN 46 must be applied for the first interim or annual period
ending after March 15, 2004. The Company has not created or acquired any
VIEs after January 31, 2003. The Company does not expect the adoption of
FIN 46 to have a material impact on its financial position or results of
operations.
In November 2002, the EITF reached a consensus on issue 00-21, Accounting
for Revenue Arrangements with Multiple Deliverables. EITF 00-21 addresses
revenue recognition on arrangements encompassing multiple elements that are
delivered at different points in time, defining criteria that must be met
for elements to be considered to be a separate unit of accounting. If an
element is determined to be a separate unit of accounting, the revenue for
the element is recognized at the time of delivery. EITF 00-21 is effective
for

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
revenue arrangements entered into in fiscal periods beginning after
June 15, 2003. The Company adopted EITF 00-21 on July 1, 2003 and the
adoption did not have a material effect on its consolidated financial
position or results of operations.

of our deferred tax assets. The valuation allowance was recorded against
deferred tax assets because we determined that it was more likely than not
that all of the deferred tax assets may not be realized. In 2003, we
increased the valuation allowance by $37 million to $418 million
primarily as a result of additional operating losses and tax credits.
We have incurred operating losses in 2003, 2002 and 2001. At December 31,
2003 and 2002, these cumulative factors resulted in our decision that it is
more likely than not that all of our deferred tax assets may not be
realized. If we generate sustained future taxable income against which
these tax attributes may be applied, some portion or all of the valuation
allowance would be reversed. If the valuation allowance is reversed
approximately $241 million would be recorded as a credit to additional
paid in capital reflecting the benefit of deductions from the exercise of
stock options.
As of December 31, 2003, we had federal net operating loss and research and
experimentation credit carryforwards of approximately $487 million and
$88 million respectively, which may be available to offset future federal
income tax liabilities and expire at various dates through 2023. In
addition, at December 31, 2003, we had approximately $410 million and $46
million of state net operating losses and state research and development
and investment tax carryforwards, respectively, which expire at various
dates through 2023.
6.  EQUITY AND STOCK COMPENSATION PLANS
At December 31, 2003, we have four stock-based compensation plans, which
are described below.
FIXED STOCK OPTION PLANS - We have three fixed option plans. Under the 1990
Incentive and Nonstatutory Stock Option Plan 1990 Plan, we may grant
incentive stock options or nonqualified stock options to our employees and
directors for up to 2,873,002 shares of common stock. Under the 1996 Stock
Option Plan 1996 Plan, we may grant incentive stock options or
nonqualified stock options to our employees and directors for up to
6,100,000 shares of common stock. Under the 2001 Nonqualified Stock Plan
2001 Plan, we may grant nonqualified stock options to our employees and
directors for up to 8,000,000 shares of common stock. Under all three
plans, options are granted at an exercise price as determined by the Board
of Directors; have a maximum term of ten years; and generally vest over
three to five years. As of December 31, 2003, there were 6,242,964 shares
available for grant under the 2001 Plan, 2,381,381 shares available for
grant under the 1996 Plan, and no shares available under the 1990 Plan.

EMPLOYEE STOCK PURCHASE PLAN - In June 1996, we adopted an Employee Stock
Purchase Plan the ESPP Plan under which eligible employees may purchase
common stock at a price equal to 85% of the lower of the fair market value
of the common stock at the beginning or end of each six-month offering
period. Participation in the ESPP Plan is limited to 6% of an employee
compensation, may be terminated at any time by the employee and
automatically ends on termination of employment. A total of 350,000 shares
of common stock have been reserved for issuance. As of December 31, 2003
there were 221,117 shares available for future issuance under the ESPP
Plan. We issued 49,186, 30,694 and 27,733 common shares under the ESPP Plan
in 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively.
STOCKHOLDER RIGHTS PLAN - In October 2001, our board of directors adopted a
stockholder rights plan and declared a dividend distribution of one share
purchase right a Right for each outstanding share of our common stock
to stockholders of record at the close of business on October 15, 2001.
Each share of common stock issued after that date also will carry with it
one Right, subject to certain exceptions. Each Right, when it becomes
exercisable, will entitle the record holder to purchase from us one
ten-thousandth of a share of series A preferred stock at an exercise price
of $4000 subject to adjustment.
The Rights become exercisable upon the earliest of the following dates: i
the date on which we first publicly announce that a person or group has
become an acquiring person, or ii the date, if any, that our board of
39                  AWARE, INC.
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
directors may designate following the commencement of, or first public
disclosure of an intent to commence, a tender or exchange offer which could
result in the potential buyer becoming a beneficial owner of 15% or more of
our outstanding common stock. Under these circumstances, holders of Rights
will be entitled to purchase, for the exercise price, the preferred stock
equivalent of common stock having a market value of two times the exercise
price. The Rights expire on October 2, 2011, and may be redeemed by us for
$001 per Right.
EMPLOYEE STOCK OPTION EXCHANGE PROGRAM - On March 3, 2003, we commenced an
offer to exchange outstanding stock options with eligible employees. Under
the terms of the program, eligible employees had the right to tender for
cancellation all stock options that they held with an exercise price above
$300 per share by April 1, 2003. We accepted for exchange options to
purchase an aggregate of 6,162,952 shares of our common stock. Subject to
the terms and conditions of the offer, we were obligated to issue new
options to purchase an aggregate of up to 3,081,563 shares of our common
stock. On October 14, 2003, we granted options to purchase an aggregate of
2,854,213 shares of our common stock at the then current market value of
$327 per share in connection with the offer to exchange. The replacement
options were granted more than six months and one day after the
cancellation of the old options. As a result, the new options were
considered a fixed award and did not result in any compensation expense.
7.  COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENT LIABILITIES
LEASE COMMITMENTS - We own our principal office and research facility in
Bedford, Massachusetts, which we have occupied since November 1997. We
conduct a portion of our activities in leased facilities in Lafayette,
California under a non-cancellable operating lease that expires in 2004.
The following is a schedule of future minimum rental payments in

Rental expense was approximately $45,000, $44,000 and $36,000 in 2003, 2002
and 2001, respectively.
LITIGATION - There are no material pending legal proceedings to which we
are a party or to which any of our properties are subject which, either
individually or in the aggregate, are expected to have a material adverse
effect on our business, financial position or results of operations.
GUARANTEES AND INDEMNIFICATION OBLIGATIONS - We enter into licensing
agreements in the ordinary course of business that require us: i to
perform under the terms of the contracts, ii to protect the
confidentiality of our customers' intellectual property, and iii to
indemnify customers, including indemnification against third party claims
alleging infringement of intellectual property rights. We also have
agreements with each of our directors and executive officers to indemnify
such directors or executive officers, to the extent legally permissible,
against all liabilities reasonably incurred in connection with any action
in which such individual may be involved by reason of such individual being
or having been a director or officer of Aware.
Given the nature of the above obligations and agreements, we are unable to
make a reasonable estimate of the maximum potential amount that we could be
required to pay. Historically, we have not made any significant payments on
the above guarantees and indemnifications and no amount has been accrued in
the accompanying consolidated financial statements with respect to these
guarantees and indemnifications.

under which employees are allowed to contribute certain percentages of
their pay, up to the maximum allowed under Section 401k of the Internal
Revenue Code. Our contributions to the Plan are at the discretion of the
Board of Directors. Our contributions were $284,000, $340,000 and $313,000
in 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively.

stock equivalents of 10,525, 226,303 and 285,427, respectively, were not
included in the per share calculation for diluted EPS, because we had a net
loss and the effect of their inclusion would be anti-dilutive. For the
years ended December 31, 2003, 2002 and 2001, options to purchase
3,352,283, 4,770,052 and 3,488,215 shares of common stock at average
weighted prices of $445, $2354 and $3195 per share, respectively, were
outstanding, but were not included in the computation of diluted EPS
because the options' exercise prices were greater than the average market
price of the common shares and thus would be anti-dilutive.

Item 5. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES
Our management, including our chief executive officer and chief financial
officer, has evaluated our disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of
the period covered by this Form 10-K and has concluded that our disclosure
controls and procedures are effective. They also concluded that there were no
changes in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during
the fourth quarter of 2003 that have materially affected, or are reasonably
likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.                   PART III
