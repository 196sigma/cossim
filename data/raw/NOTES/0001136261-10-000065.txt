NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 
December 31, 2009 1.Organization and Basis of Presentation Organization Mattson Technology, Inc. the Company or Mattson was incorporated in California on
November 18, 1988. In September 1997, the Company was reincorporated in the State of Delaware.
The Company designs, manufactures and markets semiconductor wafer processing
equipment used in front-end-of-line and back-end-of-line fabrication of integrated circuits to the semiconductor
manufacturing industry worldwide. Basis of Presentation The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company
and its subsidiaries. All significant intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. The Company year ends
on December 31. The Company interim fiscal quarters end on the last Sunday in the calendar quarter.
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles
generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts
of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of
revenue and expenses during the reported periods. Actual results could differ from those estimates.
The Company evaluated events and transactions through March 5, 2010, the date the Company filed its
Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2009. There were no events or transactions that occurred during this period
that required recognition or disclosure in the financial statements. Liquidity and Management Plans Historically, the Company has relied on a combination of fundraising from the sale and issuance of equity
securities and cash generated from product and service revenues to provide funding for its operations. As of December 31, 2009, the
Company had cash, cash equivalents, restricted cash and short-term investments of $604 million. The Company believes that these balances
will be sufficient to fund its working and other capital requirements over the course of the next twelve months. The Company will continue to
review its expected cash requirements, make all efforts to collect any aged receivables, and take appropriate cost reduction measures to
ensure that it has at least six quarters of available cash at any time. In the event additional needs for cash arise, the Company may seek to
raise additional funds from a combination of sources including issuance of debt or equity securities. Additional financing may not be available
on terms favorable to the Company, or at all. Any additional financing activity could be dilutive to the Company current stockholders. If
adequate funds are not available or are not available on acceptable terms, the Company ability to take advantage of unanticipated
opportunities or respond to competitive pressures could be limited. 2.Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Cash and Cash Equivalents The Company considers all highly liquid investments purchased with an original
maturity of three months or less to be cash equivalents. The Company cash and cash equivalents are carried at fair market value, and
consist primarily of cash balances, high-grade money market funds and commercial paper.
46 Investments The Company carries short-term investments, primarily consisting of United
States agencies securities and United States corporate bonds, at fair market value. These short-term investments are classified as
available-for-sale investments, with unrealized gains and losses, net of tax, recorded as a component of stockholders' equity in the Consolidated
Balance Sheet; and realized gains and losses as well as declines in fair value that are other than temporary are recorded in the Consolidated
Statements of Operations. As of December 31, 2009, the Company had $131 million in short-term investments, with maturities of one year or
less. Concentration of Credit Risk The Company maintains its cash and cash equivalents with several financial institutions. Deposits held
with banks may exceed the amount of insurance provided on such deposits. Generally these deposits may be redeemed upon demand and
are maintained with financial institutions with reputable credit.
The Company invests in a variety of financial instruments, such as United States agency securities, commercial
paper, money market funds and corporate bonds. The Company limits the amount of credit exposure to any one financial institution or
commercial issuer. Historically, the Company has not experienced significant losses on these investments. 
The Company trade accounts receivable are concentrated with companies in the semiconductor industry and are
derived from sales in the United States, Japan, Korea, Taiwan, other Asian countries and Europe. As of December 31, 2009, three customers
accounted for 27 percent, 19 percent, and 14 percent of the Company accounts receivable. As of December 31, 2008, four customers
accounted for 27 percent, 14 percent, 13 percent and 10 percent of the Company accounts receivable. Allowance for Doubtful Accounts The Company performs ongoing credit evaluations of its customers and records specific allowances for bad debts
when a customer is unable to meet its financial obligations, as in the case of bankruptcy filings or deteriorated financial position. The Company
estimates the allowances for bad debts for all other customers based on factors such as current trends, the length of time the receivables are
past due and historical collection experience. The Company writes off a receivable when all rights, remedies and recourses against the
account and its principals are exhausted and records a benefit when previously reserved accounts are collected. Fair Value Measurements of Assets and Liabilities The Company measures certain of its assets at fair value, using observable market data. The authoritative
guidance on fair value measurement defines fair value as an exit price, representing the amount that would be received to sell an asset or paid
to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants, andestablishes a valuation hierarchy based on the level of
independent objective evidence available regarding the value of assets or liabilities. The authoritative guidance also establishes three classes
of assets or liabilities: Level 1 consists of assets and liabilities for which there are quoted prices in active markets; Level 2 consists of assets
and liabilities for which observable inputs other than Level 1 inputs are used such as prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets or
for identical assets or liabilities in less active markets and model-derived valuations for which the variables are derived from or corroborated by
observable market data; and Level 3 consists of assets or liabilities for which there are unobservable inputs to the valuation methodology that
are significant to the measurement of the fair value. The Company had no assets or liabilities classified within Level 3 as of December 31,
2009. Inventories Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market, with cost determined on a first-in, first-out basis, and include
material, labor and manufacturing overhead costs. Finished goods are reported as inventories until the point of title transfers to the customer.
Under the Company terms of sale, title generally transfers when the Company completes physical transfer of the products to the freight
carrier, unless other customer practices or terms and conditions prevail.
47 All intercompany profits pertaining to the sales and purchases of inventory among the Company and its subsidiaries are eliminated from the consolidated financial statements.
Valuation adjustments to inventory inherently involve judgments as to assumptions about expected future demand
and the impact of market conditions on those assumptions. The Company assesses the valuation of all inventories, including manufacturing
raw materials, work-in-process, finished goods and spare parts, in each reporting period. Although the Company attempts to forecast future
inventory demand, given the competitive pressures and cyclical nature of the semiconductor industry, there may be significant unanticipated
changes in demand or technological developments that could have a significant impact on the value of the Company inventories and
reported operating results in future periods.
Inventory includes evaluation tools placed at customer sites as part of the Company marketing efforts. The
Company amortizes the costs of the evaluations tools over an estimated two to three years, taking into consideration the estimated cost to
refurbish the tools and the estimated net realizable value of the tools. The amortization charges are reported as SGA expenses. Property and Equipment Property and equipment are stated at cost. Depreciation is computed using the straight-line method
based upon the estimated useful lives of the assets, which range from three to seven years. Leasehold improvements are amortized using the
straight-line method over the useful lives or the term of the related lease, whichever is shorter.
Depreciation expense was $84 million, $86 million and $65 million for the years ended December31,
2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively. When assets are retired or otherwise disposed of, the assets and the associated accumulated depreciation
are removed from the accounts. Gains or losses resulting from sales of asset are included in Other income expense, net in the Consolidated
Statements of Operations. Repair and maintenance costs are expensed as incurred. Goodwill 
The Company performs a goodwill impairment test annually during the fourth quarter of its fiscal year and
more frequently if an event or circumstance indicates that an impairment may have occurred. Such events or circumstances may include
significant adverse changes in the general business climate, among other things. The impairment test is performed by determining the fair
value of the Company based on estimated discounted future cash flows and considering the market price of its common stock. If the carrying
value of the Company, as a one reporting unit entity, is less than its fair value, then the fair value is allocated to all the assets and liabilities of
the Company including any unrecognized intangible assets as if the Company fair value was the purchase price to acquire the Company.
The excess of the fair value of the Company over the amounts assigned to its assets and liabilities is the implied fair value of goodwill. If the
carrying amount of the Company goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of that goodwill, an impairment loss is recognized in an amount
equal to that excess. Based on the deteriorating macroeconomic conditions, the weakness in the semiconductor market and significant
erosion of the Company market capitalization during fiscal 2008, the Company recorded a goodwill impairment charge of $181 million,
representing the remaining carrying amount of goodwill as of the date of the impairment test in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2008. As of
December 31, 2009, the Company had no goodwill on its books. Impairment of Long-Lived Assets The Company reviews its long-lived assets, including property and equipment and intangibles, for
impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amounts of these assets may not be recoverable.
Recoverability is measured by a comparison of the assets' carrying amount to their expected future undiscounted net cash flows. If such
assets are considered to be impaired, the impairment to be recognized and is measured based on the amount by which the carrying amount of
the asset exceeds its fair value. In 2008, the Company recorded impairment charges to write off intangible assets of $66 million and certain
lab assets of $28 million to adjust for the deteriorating value of these assets resulting from the decline in expected cash flows attributable to
the assets. See Note 6.                            48 Warranty The warranty offered by the Company on its system sales is generally 12 months, except where previous
customer agreements state otherwise, and excludes certain consumable maintenance items. A provision for the estimated cost of warranty,
based on historical costs, is recorded as cost of sales when the revenue is recognized. The Company warranty obligations require it to repair
or replace defective products or parts during the warranty period at no cost to the customer. The actual system performance and/or field
warranty expense profiles may differ from historical experience, and in those cases, the Company adjusts its warranty accruals accordingly.
See Note 8 to the consolidated financial statements. Sabbatical Leave Benefits The Company accrues for employee sabbatical leave over the service period in which employees earn the right to
sabbatical leave. The Company develops its estimates for sabbatical leave based on its employee benefit policy, employee retention rates and
restructuring activities. In January 2007, the Company adopted the authoritative guidance on sabbatical leave benefits as a change in
accounting principle and recorded an associated cumulative effect adjustment of approximately $04 million as an increase in Accumulated
deficit in the first quarter of 2007. Revenue Recognition The Company derives revenues from these primary sources - equipment tool sales, spare part sales
and service and maintenance contracts. In accordance with the authoritative guidance on revenue recognition, the Company recognizes
revenue on equipment sales as follows: 1 for equipment sales of existing products with new specifications and for sales of new products,
revenue is recognized upon customer acceptance; 2 for equipment sales to existing customers who have purchased the same equipment with
the same specifications and previously demonstrated acceptance, or equipment sales to new customers purchasing existing products with
established reliability, the Company recognizes revenue on a multiple element approach in which the Company bifurcates such sale
transactions into two separate elements based on objective evidence of fair value. The two elements are the tool and installation. Under this
approach, the portion of the invoice amount that is due upon shipment, generally 90 percent of the total invoice amount, is recognized as
revenue upon shipment and transfer of title; 100 percent of the associated costs is also recognized upon shipment; and the remaining portion,
generally 10 percent of the total invoice amount, is recognized once installation services are completed and final customer acceptance of the
tool is received. From time to time, the Company allows customers to evaluate systems, with the customer maintaining the right to return the
systems at its discretion with limited or no penalty. For this type of arrangement, the Company does not recognize revenue on the evaluation
systems until customer acceptance is received. For spare parts, the Company recognizes revenue upon shipment. For service and
maintenance contracts, the Company recognizes revenue on a straight-line basis over the service period of the related contract. In all cases,
revenue is only recognized when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, delivery has occurred, the price is fixed or determinable and
collectability is reasonably assured. Accounts receivable for which revenue has not been recognized are classified as advance billings. Research, Development and Engineering Expenses Research, development and engineering costs are expensed as incurred. Restructuring The Company recognizes expenses related to employee termination benefits when the benefit
arrangement is communicated to the employee and no significant future services are required. If an employee is required to render service
until a specific termination date in order to receive the termination benefits, the fair value of the associated liability would be recognized ratably
over the future service period. Severance costs are determined in accordance with local statutory requirements and the Company policies.
The Company recognizes costs associated with facility lease termination obligations based on the present value of future lease payments, net
of estimated sublease income.                             49 Stock-Based Compensation The Company measures the fair value of all stock-based awards, including stock options, restricted stock
units, and purchase rights under its employee stock purchase plan, on the date of grant and recognizes the related stock-based compensation
expense on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period, which is generally the vesting period. 
The Company uses the Black-Scholes option-pricing model to determine the fair value of certain of its stock-based
awards. The determination of fair value using the Black-Scholes model is affected by the Company stock price as well as assumptions
regarding a number of complex and subjective variables, which includes expected stock price volatility over the term of the awards, actual and
projected employee exercise and cancellation behaviors, risk-free interest rates, and expected dividends. 
The Company estimates the expected life of options based on an analysis of its historical
experience of employee exercise and post-vesting termination behavior considered in relation to the contractual life of the option; expected
volatility is based on the historical volatility of the Company common stock; and the risk free interest rate is equal to the U.S.Treasury
rates, with maturity approximating the expected life of the option. The Company does not currently pay cash dividends on its common stock
and does not anticipate doing so in the foreseeable future; accordingly, the expected dividend yield is zero.
The Company estimates forfeiture rates on stock-based awards at the time of grant and revises those estimates in
subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates. Such forfeitures estimates are based on historical experience. If the
assumptions for estimating stock-based compensation expense change in future periods, the amount of future stock-based compensation may
differ significantly from the amount that the Company recorded in the current and prior periods. Stock-based compensation expenses for the years ended December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007 were $29
million, $44 million and $39 million, respectively. Foreign Currency Translation The functional currencies of the Company foreign subsidiaries are their local currencies. All assets and
liabilities of these foreign operations are translated into the U.S. dollar using exchange rates in effect at the end of the period, and revenues
and costs are translated using average exchange rates for the period. Gains or losses from translation of foreign operations where the local
currencies are the functional currency are included as a component of Accumulated other comprehensive income in the Consolidated Balance
Sheet. Foreign currency transaction gains and losses are recorded in Other income expense, net in the Consolidated Statements of
Operations. Foreign Currency Forward Exchange Contracts The Company enters into forward foreign exchange contracts with high-quality financial
institutions primarily to minimize currency exchange risks associated with transactions denominated in foreign currencies. The Company does
not utilize derivative instruments for trading or speculative purposes. These forward contracts do not qualify as designated hedges, as defined
in the applicable authoritative guidance. As a result, such forward contracts were marked to market with the resulting unrealized gains losses
recorded in Other income expense, net in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. 
The Company did not engage in any hedging transactions during the years ended December 31, 2009 and 2008.
In fiscal 2007, the Company employed a hedging program, utilizing foreign currency forward exchange contracts, to hedge against foreign
currency fluctuations associated with the sales of systems denominated in Japanese Yen and accounts receivable. Income Taxes The Company provides for income taxes in accordance with the authoritative guidance,
which requires a liability-based approach in accounting for income taxes. Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are recorded
50 based on the differences between the financial statement and tax bases of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates. Valuation allowances are provided
against deferred income tax assets, which are not likely to be realized.
In January 2007, the Company adopted Financial Accounting Standards Board FASB
Interpretation No. FIN 48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes: An Interpretation of FASB Statement No. 109, now codified in
ASC Topic 740. Under this authoritative guidance the Company recognizes the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely
than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by taxing authorities, based on the technical merits of the position. The tax
benefits recognized in the financial statements from such a position are measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than fifty
percent likelihood of being realized upon ultimate resolution. The Company adoption of this authoritative guidance and the related
reassessment of its tax positions resulted in a cumulative effect of $07 million, which was recorded as an increase in Accumulated deficit in
the first quarter of 2007. New Accounting Pronouncements In June 2009, the Financial Accounting Standards Board FASB issued Accounting Standards
Codification as the single authoritative source for U.S. GAAP, which replaces all previous U.S. GAAP accounting standards, beginning in the
interim and annual periods ending after September15, 2009. The new codification standards are promulgated in the FASB Accounting
Standards Codification ASC Topic 105, Generally Accepted Accounting Principles, which the Company adopted in the
third quarter of fiscal 2009. The adoption of this standard only impacted references of accounting standards disclosed in the Company
financial statements. Such reference changes are reflected in the new accounting pronouncements discussed below as well as in the
accompanying notes to the financial statements.
In October 2009, the FASB amended the criteria in ASC Topic
605, Revenue Recognition, relating to separating consideration in multiple-deliverable arrangements. As a result of the amendment,
multiple-deliverable arrangements will be separated in more circumstances than under existing revenue recognitions standards. The
amendment establishes a selling price hierarchy for determining the selling price of a deliverable. Such selling price for each deliverable will be
based on vendor-specific objective evidence if available, third-party evidence if vendor-specific objective evidence is not available, or
estimated selling price if neither vendor-specific objective evidence nor third-party evidence is available. The amendment also replaces the
term fair value in the revenue allocation guidance with selling price to clarify that the allocation of revenue is based on entity-specific
assumptions rather than assumptions of a marketplace participant. This amendment is effective for revenue arrangements that begin or are
changed in fiscal years starting after June 15, 2010 and early adoption is permitted. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of this
amendment on its revenue recognition policies as well as the impact on its financial statements.
In October 2009, the FASB amended ASC Topic 985, Certain Revenue Arrangements
That Include Software to address the accounting model for revenue arrangements that include both tangible products and software
elements. Under the amendment, tangible products containing software components and non-software components that function together to
deliver the tangible product essential functionality are no longer within the scope of the software revenue guidance in ASC Subtopic 985-605
formerly SOP 97-2, Software Revenue Recognition. In addition, the amendment requires that hardware components of a tangible
product containing software components must always be excluded from the software revenue guidance. If software contained in a tangible
product is essential to the tangible product functionality, the software is excluded from the scope of the software revenue guidance. This
exclusion includes essential software that is sold with or embedded within the product and undelivered software elements that relate to that
tangible product essential software. This amendment also provides guidance on how a vendor should allocate arrangement consideration to
deliverables in an arrangement that includes both tangible products and software. This amendment is effective for revenue arrangements that
begin or are changed in fiscal years starting after June 15, 2010. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of this amendment on its
revenue recognition policies as well as the impact on its financial statements.
In August2009, the FASB amended ASC Topic 820, Fair Value
Measurements, to clarify that in circumstances in which a quoted price in an active market for the identical liability is not available, an entity
is required to use the quoted price of the identical liability when traded as an asset, quoted prices for similar liabilities, or quoted prices for
similar liabilities when traded as assets. If these quoted prices are not available an entity is required to use another valuation technique, such
as an income approach or a market approach. The Company adoption of the
51 amended guidance, effective in the first quarter of fiscal year
2010, will not have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements.
In May 2009, the FASB issued ASC Topic 855, Subsequent Events, which establishes general standards
of accounting for and disclosure of events that occur after the balance sheet date but before financial statements are issued or are available to
be issued. This statement sets forth the period after the balance sheet date during which management of a reporting entity should evaluate
events or transactions that may occur for potential recognition or disclosure in the financial statements, the circumstances under which an
entity should recognize events or transactions occurring after the balance sheet date in its financial statements and the disclosures that an
entity should make about events or transactions that occurred after the balance sheet date. ASC 855 is effective for financial statements
issued for interim or annual financial periods ending after June 15, 2009. The Company adoption of ASC 855 did not have a material impact
on its financial statements.
In April2009, the FASB amended ASC Topic 820, Fair Value Measurements and Disclosure and
ASC Topic 320, Investments - Debt and Equity Securities. The amendment to ASC Topic 820 provides guidance on how to determine
the fair value of assets and liabilities under the accounting standard for fair value measurements and disclosure in the current economic
environment, reemphasizes that the objective of a fair value measurement remains an exit price, provides guidance on how to determine the
fair value of assets and liabilities when the volume and level of activity for the asset/liability has significantly decreased, provides guidance on
identifying circumstances that indicate a transaction is not orderly, and requires disclosure in interim and annual periods of the inputs and
valuation techniques used to measure fair value and a discussion of changes in valuation techniques. The amendment to ASC Topic 320
modifies the requirements for recognizing other-than-temporarily impaired debt securities and revises the existing impairment model for such
securities by modifying the current intent and ability indicator in determining whether a debt security is other-than-temporarily impaired. Both
amendments became effective for interim and annual periods ending after June15, 2009. The Company adoption of these
amendments did not have any impact on its financial statements. See Note3 for information and disclosures regarding the Company
fair value measurements.
In June 2008, the FASB amended ASC Topic 260, Earnings Per Share to address whether instruments
granted in share-based payment transactions are participating securities prior to vesting and, therefore, need to be included in the earnings
allocation in computing earnings per share EPS under the two-class method described in ASC Topic 260. This amendment is
effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2008. The Company adoption of this amendment did
not have any impact on its calculation of EPS.

comprehensive income loss. For 2009, 2008 and 2007, gross realized gains and losses on sales of short-term investments were not
significant. 
The maturities of short-term investments as of December 31, 2009 and December 31, 2008 are shown
below December 31 2009 2008 thousands Due within one year $     13,089 $     24,695 Due in one to two years           -         1,585 $     13,089 $     26,280 As of December 31, 2009, the Company had certificates of deposit of $20 million, which secures standby letters
of credit provided to certain landlords and are classified as restricted cash in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheet. The Company
had no such amount at December 31, 2008, as these obligations were collateralized by the Company then available revolving line of
credit.
4.Fair Value
The Company measures assets and liabilities at fair value based on exit price, which is defined by the authoritative
guidance on fair value measurements as the amount that would be received on the sale of an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly
transaction between market participants. The Companycash and cash equivalents and short-term investments are carried at fair
value, and its accounts receivable and accounts payable are valued at their carrying amounts which approximate fair value due to their
short-term nature. The Company had no debt outstanding as of December 31, 2009. 
Fair Value Hierarchy
The authoritative guidance on fair value measurements establishes a three-tier value hierarchy, which prioritizes the inputs used in
measuring fair value as follows: 
Level 1. Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.
Level 2. Observable inputs other than Level1 prices, such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities, quoted prices in
markets with insufficient volume or infrequent transactions less active markets, or model-derived valuations in which all significant inputs are
observable or can be derived principally from or corroborated with observable market data for substantially the full term of the assets or
liabilities.
Level 3. Unobservable inputs to the valuation methodology that are significant to the measurement of the fair value of assets or
liabilities.
53 The Company cash equivalents and investment instruments are classified within Level1 or Level2 of
the fair value hierarchy, as these instruments are valued using quoted market prices, broker or dealer quotations, or alternative pricing sources
with reasonable levels of price transparency and transaction value. Specifically, the Company values its investments in
U.S. government and agency securities, money market securities and plan assets under the Company Deferred Compensation Plan
based on quoted market prices in active markets; and values its investments in corporate bonds, mortgage-backed and asset-backed
products, state, municipal and provincial obligations based on other observable inputs. The Company had no assets or liabilities classified
within Level 3 as of December 31, 2009.
Assets Measured at Fair Value on a Recurring Basis 
Assets measured at fair value on a recurring basis consisted of the following types of instruments as of December
31, 2009 and December 31, 2008 December 31, 2009 December 31, 2008 Fair Value Measurements at Fair Value Measurements at Reporting Date Using Reporting Date Using Level 1 Level 2 Total Level 1 Level 2 Total thousands thousands Cash and cash equivalents:1   Money market funds $ 15,398 $     -  $ 15,398 $ 42,222 $     -  $  42,222   Certificates of Deposit    2,000    2,000       -        -         -    Commercial paper    3,000    3,000       -    11,996    11,996 Short-term investments   United States agency securities    4,057    4,057    3,587       -      3,587   United States corporate bonds    9,032    9,032       -    22,693    22,693 Other assets   Equity instruments offsetting      deferred compensation liability     814       -      814     732       -       732 Total assets measured at fair value $ 22,269 $ 12,032 $ 34,301 $ 46,541 $ 34,689 $  81,230 1 Excludes cash in bank of $269 million and $229 million at

and $151million, respectively, representing 52 percent and 24 percent of the gross inventory balances as of December 31, 2009 and
December 31, 2008, respectively. The Company increased its reserves for excess and obsolete inventory, a component of inventory reserves,
by $131 million during the year ended December 31, 2009. The Company estimates excess and obsolete reserve adjustments, which
inherently involve judgments, using assumptions about expected future demand and the impact of market conditions on those assumptions.
Although the Company believes that the assumptions it used in estimating excess and obsolete inventory reserves are reasonable, significant
changes in any one of the assumptions in the future could produce a significantly different result. 
Included in accrued liabilities as of December 31, 2009 were reserves for existing vendor commitments totaling $11
million, representing inventory not yet received and in excess of its production requirements. The Company had no reserve for vendor
commitments as of December 31, 2008. 
During fiscal 2008, the Company recorded an impairment charge of $28 million related to the write-off of certain
property and equipment used in its research and development activities. The Company had no such charge in fiscal 2009.                             55 6.Goodwill and Intangible Assets
The following table summarizes goodwill and intangible asset activities for the years ended December

related to the write-off of goodwill and certain intangible assets, respectively. The write-offs were in connection with the Company
impairment review in the fourth quarter of 2008, in accordance with the authoritative guidance on goodwill and intangible assets and triggered
by the significant decline in the Company revenue and cash flows. The resulting assessment indicated a material decline in the Company
market valuation and projected revenues, causing a decrease in the anticipated future cash flows attributable to these assets relative to the
cash flow expectations when the assets were acquired. As a result of the write-offs, the Company had carrying amounts of goodwill and
intangible assets of zero as of December 31, 2008. In December 2009, the Company acquired intellectual property assets related to its etch
and strip plasma processes for $13 million, which were included in Intangibles, net in the Consolidated Balance Sheet as of December 31,
2009. These assets are being amortized over a 5-year period. 
The Company had amortization charges of zero and $05 million for the years ended December 31, 2009 and 2008,
respectively.
7. Restructuring Charges
In fiscal 2009 and 2008, the Company implemented several restructuring programs, resulting in a reduction of
approximately 40 percent of its workforce and related restructuring charges of $26 million and $60 million in 2009 and 2008, respectively.
The restructuring charges were principally comprised of employee severance costs and lease contract termination costs, consisting of future
rent obligations associated with a vacated facility, net of sublease income.

2010. With respect to the lease termination, the Company is currently engaged in an ongoing negotiation with the landlord, and the payment of
the lease termination expense is dependent on the timing of a final agreement with the landlord. 
8. Guarantees
The warranty offered by the Company on its system sales is generally 12 months, except where previous
customer agreements state otherwise, and excludes certain consumable maintenance items. A provision for the estimated cost of warranty,
based on historical costs, is recorded as cost of sales when the revenue is recognized. The Company warranty obligations require it to repair
or replace defective products or parts during the warranty period at no cost to the customer. The actual system performance and/or field
warranty expense profiles may differ from historical experience, and in those cases, the Company adjusts its warranty accruals accordingly. The following table summarizes changes in the product warranty accrual for the years ended December 31,
2009, 2008 and 2007 Year Ended December 31 2009 2008 2007 thousands Balance at the beginning of the year $      4,381 $      9,174 $     15,113   Accrual for warranties issued during the year 1,273 2,993 6,618   Changes in pre-existing warranty liabilities       1,834         688        695   Settlements made during the year       2,510       8,474      11,862 Balance at the end of the year $      1,310 $      4,381 $      9,174 In the ordinary course of business, the Company bank provides standby letters of credit or other guarantee
instruments on behalf of the Company to certain parties as required. The Company has not recorded any liability in connection with these
guarantee arrangements beyond what is required to appropriately account for the underlying transaction being guaranteed. The Company
does not believe, based on historical experience and information currently available, that it is probable that any amounts will be required to be
paid under such guarantee arrangements. As of December 31, 2009, the maximum potential amount that the Company could be required to
pay was approximately $16 million, consisting of standby letters of credit. The letters of credit are secured by certificates of deposit of $20
million, which are classified as restricted cash in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheet as of December 31, 2009. 
The Company is a party to a variety of agreements, pursuant to which it may be
obligated to indemnify other parties with respect to certain matters. Typically, these obligations arise in the context of contracts under which the
Company may agree to hold other parties harmless against losses arising from a breach of representations or with respect to certain
intellectual property, operations or tax-related matters. The Company obligations under these agreements may be limited in terms of time
and/or amount, and in some instances, the Company may have defenses to asserted claims and/or recourse against third parties for payments
made by the Company. It is not possible to predict the maximum potential amount of future payments under these or similar agreements due
to the conditional nature of the Company obligations and the unique facts and circumstances involved in each particular agreement.
Historically, payments made by the Company under these agreements have not had a material effect on the Company financial position,
results of operations or cash flows. The Company believes if it were to incur a loss in any of these matters, such loss would not have a material
effect on its financial position, results of operations or cash flows.
9.Borrowing Facility
In June 2009, the Company $10 million revolving line of credit expired. The line of credit was collateralized
by a blanket lien on all of the Company domestic assets, excluding intellectual property assets. The Company used this credit line principally
to secure letters of credit, totaling approximately $16 million, provided primarily to certain landlords and did not borrow or have outstanding
borrowings under this line of credit at any time during its term. As a replacement for the security that was provided by the expired line of credit,
the letters of credit are now secured by cash of $2 million, which is classified as restricted cash as of December 31, 2009. 
57 10.Commitments and Contingencies
The Company holds various operating leases related to its facilities and equipment worldwide. The
Company minimum annual rental commitments with respect to its operating leases were as follows as of December 31, 2009 Operating Year Lease Payments thousands 2010
$          5,150 2011
4,030 2012

3,785 Thereafter           10,967 $         31,357 Rent expenses were approximately $42 million, $54 million and $56 million, in 2009, 2008 and 2007,
respectively. The Company recorded sublease income related to its Exton, Pennsylvania facility of approximately $15 million for each year
ended December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively.
In 2005, the Company entered into a new lease agreement for its existing corporate headquarters building in
Fremont, California. The lease is for a period of 10 years, which commenced on May 31, 2007, and has an initial annual base rent cost of
approximately $14 million, with annual increases of approximately 35 percent. The Company is also responsible for an additional minimum
lease payment at the end of the lease term of approximately $15 million, subject to adjustment, under a restoration cost obligation provision,
which is being recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term. To secure this obligation, the Company provided the landlord a letter of
credit of $15 million, which is secured as part of a $20 million restricted cash balance as of December 31, 2009. 
The Company continues to lease one building previously used to house the administrative functions related to wet
surface preparation products in Exton, Pennsylvania. The lease for the administrative building will expire on March31, 2019, with a
current rental cost of approximately $09 million annually. The Company expects to make rent payments under this lease over the remaining
term of the lease, less any sublet amounts. In determining the facilities lease loss, various assumptions were made, including the time period
over which the buildings will be vacant, expected sublease terms and expected sublease rates. Total future expected lease payments of
approximately $84 million were assumed in determining the facilities lease loss, offset by the expected sublease income. In January 2008, the
Company sublet this facility until December2010, with an option for an additional three years; and in October 2009, the lessee entered
into an agreement with the Company to terminate the sublease agreement as of June 30, 2010 and simultaneously entered into a new
agreement to lease approximately 50 percent of the Exton facility until December 2015, cancellable anytime after December 31, 2012. Under
the existing sublease agreement, the Company has approximately $27 million of expected future sublease income as of December 31, 2009.
At both December 31, 2009 and December 31, 2008, the Company had an accrual liability balance of $07 million related to this facility.
Adjustments to this accrual will be made in future periods, if evidence of any adjustment can be reasonably estimated as future events and
circumstances become known.
In connection with its acquisition of Vortek Industries, Ltd Vortek in 2004, the Company became party to an
agreement between Vortek and the Canadian Minister of Industry the Minister relating to an investment in Vortek by Technology Partnerships
Canada. Under the agreement, as amended, the Company or Vortek renamed Mattson Technology, Canada, Inc. or MTC
agreed to various covenants, including i payment by the Company of a royalty to the Minister of 14 percent of revenues from Flash RTP
products, up to a total of CAD 14,269,290 approximately $135 million based on the applicable exchange rate as of December 31, 2009, ii
MTC maintaining a specified average workforce of employees in Canada through October 27, 2009, iii investment of a certain amount by
October 27, 2009 and certain other covenants concerning protection of intellectual property rights and manufacturing obligations. Under the
provisions of this agreement, if the Company, or MTC, did not materially satisfy its obligations pursuant to the covenants, the Minister could
have demanded payment of liquidated damages in the amount of CAD
58 14,269,290 approximately $135 million as of December 31, 2009 less
any royalties paid by MTC or the Company to the Minister. As of December 31, 2009, the Company is no longer subject to covenants ii and
iii, as discussed above; but is still subject to covenant i, relating to the payment of royalty on revenues from the Flash RTP product until
2020.
However, if MTC is dissolved, files for bankruptcy or does not
materially comply with certain terms and conditions of the contract prior to its expiration on December 31, 2020, the Company would be subject
to liquidated damages in the amount of CAD 14,269,290 approximately $135 million as of December 31, 2009 less any royalties paid by
MTC or the Company to the Minister.
In the ordinary course of business, the Company is subject to claims and litigation, including claims that it infringes third
party patents, trademarks and other intellectual property rights. Although the Company believes that it is unlikely that any current claims or
actions will have a material adverse impact on its operating results or its financial position, given the uncertainty of litigation, the Company
cannot be certain of this. The defense of claims or actions against the Company, even if not meritorious, could result in the expenditure of
significant financial and managerial resources.
From time to time, the Company is party to legal proceedings and claims, either asserted or unasserted, which
arise in the ordinary course of business. While the outcome of these matters is not presently determinable and cannot be predicted with
certainty, management does not believe that the outcome of any of these matters or any of the above mentioned legal claims will have a
material adverse effect on the Company financial position, results of operations or cash flows.
11.Stockholders' Equity Common Stock Repurchase Program In March 2007, the Company Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to $20 million of shares of the
Company common stock through open-market purchases or private transactions. In October 2007, the Company Board of Directors
authorized the repurchase of up to an additional $30 million of shares of the Company common stock. By December 31, 2008, a total of 38
million shares had been repurchased against the repurchase authorizations, at a weighted-average purchase price of $920, translating into a
purchase price of approximately $350 million. The Company did not repurchase any shares of its common stock in fiscal 2009, and has
authorization to repurchase up to an additional $15 million of its shares of common stock as of December 31, 2009. The size and timing of
future repurchases will depend on the Company share price. Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income The components of accumulated other comprehensive income, net of related tax, at December31, 2009
and 2008 are as follows December 31 2009 2008 thousands Cumulative translation adjustments $     22,123 $     20,458 Unrealized investment gain loss, net of tax        109        203 $     22,014 $     20,255 Stockholder Rights Plan On July 28, 2005, the Company adopted a Stockholder Rights Plan Rights Plan, under which stockholders of
record at the close of business on August 15, 2005 received one share purchase right Right for each share of the Company common stock
held on that date. 
59 The Rights, which currently trade with the Company common stock and represent the right to purchase one one-thousandth
of a share of preferred stock at $5500 per share, become exercisable when a person or group acquires 15 percent or more of the
Company common stock acquiror without prior approval of the Company Board of Directors. In that event, the Rights would permit the
Company stockholders, other than the acquiror, to purchase shares of the Company common stock having a market value of twice the
exercise price of the Rights, in lieu of the preferred stock. Also, under the Right Plan, i prior to a person or group acquiring 15 percent of the
Company common stock, the Company can redeem the Rights for $0001 each; ii the Company can issue one Right for each share of
common stock that becomes outstanding after the record date and before the acquisition of 15 percent of its common stock by an acquiror; iii
when the Rights become exercisable, the Company Board of Directors may authorize the issuance of one share of the Company common
stock in exchange for each Right that is then exercisable; and iv in the event of certain business combinations, the Rights permit the
purchase of the common stock of an acquiror at a 50 percent discount.
The Rights expire on July 27, 2015. As of December 31, 2009, the Company had approximately 500 million
share purchase rights outstanding.                            60 12. Employee Stock Plans
In May, 2005, the Company amended and restated its 1989 Stock Option Plan the 1989 Plan as the 2005 Equity
Incentive Plan the 2005 Plan, under which a total of approximately 12 million shares of common stock were reserved for issuance. In June
2007, the Company shareholders approved an amendment to the 2005 Plan by reserving an additional 25 million shares of common stock
for issuance under the 2005 Plan, bringing the total shares reserved to approximately 145 million shares of common stock. As of December 31,
2009, the Company had approximately 37million shares available for future grants under the 2005 Plan. The following table

2008 and 2007, respectively, with an estimated total grant-date fair value of $08 million, $25 million and $45 million, respectively, net of

As of December 31,
2009, the Company had $21 million in unrecognized stock-based compensation costs related to stock options, net of estimated forfeitures,
which will be recognized over a weighted-average period of 21 years. 
Acceleration of Stock Options
In August 2005, the Company accelerated the vesting of certain unvested and out-of-the-money stock options
under the 2005 Plan. The acceleration of vesting applied to all unvested stock options that had
an exercise price per share of $905 or higher, totaling 147 million. As a result of the acceleration, the stock options became exercisable
immediately and reduced the stock-based compensation the Company would otherwise have recognized in fiscal 2009, 2008 and 2007. Of
the 147 million stock options subject to acceleration, approximately 503,000 shares were held by executive officers and directors of the Company,
with a weighted average exercise price of $1020 per share. To prevent unintended benefits to the executive officers and directors, the
Company imposed restrictions on all shares received through the exercise of the accelerated stock options held by those individuals, preventing the
sale of those shares prior to the earlier of the original vesting date of the option or the individual termination of employment.
62 Restricted Stock Units RSU The Company equity incentive plan under the 2005 Plan provides for grants of timed-based and performance-based RSUs. Time-Based Restricted Stock Units Time-based RSU generally vest at per year. On occasion and for varying purposes, the Company grants
time-based RSU with different vesting criteria and duration. During the years ended December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007, the Company granted
zero, 02 million and 01 million time-based RSUs, respectively, with fair value of zero, $11 million and $08 million, respectively, net of
estimated forfeitures. The associated stock-compensation expense on time-based RSUs is determined based on the fair value of the
Company common stock on the date of grant of the RSU, and such expenses were $06 million, $08 million and $06 million, net of
estimated forfeitures, for the years ended December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively. As of December 31, 2009, the Company had 04
million of unvested time-based RSUs outstanding, with unrecognized compensation costs of $04 million, net of estimated forfeitures and an
estimated weighted-average amortization period of 20 years. 
RSUs under the 2005 Plan are counted against the total number of shares of common stock
issuable at 175 shares for every share subject thereto. Performance-Based Restricted Stock Units The vesting of performance-based RSUs is contingent on the Company achievement of certain
predetermined financial goals and in some cases, the achievement of certain market performance. The amount of stock-based compensation
expense recognized in any one period can vary based on the achievement or anticipated achievement of specific performance goals. If a
performance goal is not met or is not expected to be met, no compensation cost would be recognized on the underlying RSUs, and any
previously recognized compensation expense on those RSUs would be reversed.
During the first quarter of 2008, the Company Board of Directors approved the grant of 683,000 performance-based
RSUs to certain of its executives, officers and senior-level management, with vesting in four equal tranches upon the achievement of four
sequentially increasing revenue performance targets and contingent on the achievement of certain operating profit margin and stock price
thresholds. The fair value of these RSUs was determined using the Monte Carlo valuation methodology. At December 31, 2008, the Company
determined that due to the deteriorating market conditions during the fourth quarter of 2008, it was not probable that any of the four revenue
targets and the operating profit targets would be met by the specified dates. As a result, the stock-based compensation related to these RSUs
were deemed unrecognizable. Based on employee terminations, the Company cancelled 175,000 of these performance-based RSU, leaving
508,000 units outstanding as of December 31, 2008, and during 2009, the Company cancelled an additional 209,000 of these RSUs,
leaving 299,000 units outstanding as of December 31, 2009. If and when the Company determines that the related
targets are probable of being achieved, the Company will begin recognizing expenses in the period that such assessment is made. The
Company did not record any expenses related to these RSUs in fiscal 2009.  Employee Stock Purchase Plan The Company employee stock purchase plan ESPP allows eligible employees to
designate up to 15 percent of their gross compensation for stock purchases. The ESPP has an offering period of up to 27 months. Such
offering periods in fiscal 2009, 2008 and 2007 consisted of four-six month purchase periods. Under the ESPP, employees may purchase
shares of the Company common stock at a discount of up to 10 percent of the lesser of the market value at the beginning of the purchase
period or the end of each 6-month purchase period, with such purchases limited to 2,000 shares in any offering period. The Company did not
use a look-back feature in connection with ESPP purchases in fiscal 2009, 2008 and 2007, as the related compensation costs for these years
were determined using a 10 percent discount of the market value of the Company common stock at the end of the offering periods.
63 The Company has reserved 62 million shares of common stock for issuance under the ESPP, of which
30million shares were available for issuance as of December 31, 2009. During the years ended December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007,
the Company issued shares under the ESPP totaling 183,000, 249,000 and 91,000, respectively, with average purchase prices of $150 282 and $812 respectively. 13.Stock-Based Compensation
The Company accounts for stock-based compensation in accordance with the applicable authoritative
guidance, which requires the measurement of stock-based compensation on the date of grant based on the fair value of the award, and the
recognition of the expense over the requisite service period for the employee.
The Company stock-based compensation for years ended December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007 were as
follows Year Ended December 31 2009 2008 2007 thousands Stock-based compensation by type of award    Stock options $    2,280 $    3,527 $    3,234    Restricted stock units       626       766       585    Employee stock purchase plan        38        73        65 Total stock-based compensation $    2,944 $    4,366 $    3,884 Stock-based compensation by category of expense    Cost of sales $     105 $     135 $     129    Research, development and engineering       426       521       478    Selling, general and administrative      2,413      3,710      3,277 Effect on net income loss $    2,944 $    4,366 $    3,884 The Company did not capitalize any stock-based compensation as inventory as of December 31, 2009 and December 31, 2008, as such
amounts were not material. Stock-based compensation for the year ended December 31, 2008 included an additional $350,000 related to a stock
option modification that occurred in 2006, which was recorded as an increase in selling, general and administrative. Valuation Assumptions The Company uses the Black-Scholes valuation model to determine the fair value of stock options. The
Black-Scholes model requires the input of highly subjective assumptions, which are summarized in the table below for the years ended
December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007: Year Ended December 31 2009 2008 2007 Expected dividend yield    Expected stock price volatility 67 55 74 Risk-free interest rate 19 29 46 Expected life of options 5 years 5 years 5 years The Company estimates the expected life of options based on an analysis of its historical experience of employee
exercise and post-vesting termination behavior considered in relation to the contractual life of the option; expected volatility is based on the
historical volatility of the Company common stock; and the risk free interest rate is equal to the U.S.Treasury rates, with maturity
approximating the expected life of the option. The Company does not currently pay cash dividends on its common stock and does not
anticipate doing so in the foreseeable future; accordingly, the expected dividend yield is zero.                            64 14.Employee Savings Plans Employee Savings Plan The Company has a retirement/savings plan the ESP Plan, which qualifies under section401k of the
Internal Revenue Code. All full-time employees of eligible age over twenty-one years old can participate in the ESP Plan and can contribute
up to an amount allowed by the applicable Internal Revenue Service guidelines. At its discretion, the Company can make matching
contributions to the ESP Plan equal to a percentage of the participants' contributions. The Company made matching contributions of
approximately $01 million, $07 million and $06 million for the years ended December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively. In March
2009, the Company suspended matching contributions under the ESP Plan as a cost-cutting measure. Deferred Compensation Plan In 2006, the Company adopted a deferred compensation plan the DC Plan, under which the Company allows
eligible employees and non-employee members of its Board of Directors to defer a specified percentage of their base salary or retainer fees,
as appropriate. The Company is obligated to deliver on a future date the contributions to the DC Plan plus income earned on such
contributions. These liabilities represent an unsecured general obligations of the Company and rank in parity with other unsecured and
unsubordinated indebtedness of the Company and are non-transferable and non-tradable. 
As of December 31, 2009 and 2008, the Company had approximately $08 million and $07 million, respectively, in
net assets under the DC Plan, which were invested primarily in equity investment funds. These assets are reflected as a component of Other
assets and the corresponding liabilities are reflected as a component of Other liabilities in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets. 15.Reportable Segments
The Company has one operating segment, the design, manufacturing and marketing of advanced fabrication
equipment to the semiconductor manufacturing industry. The authoritative guidance on segment reporting and disclosure defines operating
segment as a component of an enterprise for which separate financial information is available that is evaluated regularly by the chief operating
decision maker in deciding how to allocate resources and in assessing performance. As the Company business is completely focused on one
industry segment, the design, manufacturing and marketing of advanced fabrication equipment to the semiconductor manufacturing industry,
management believes that the Company has one reportable segment. The Company revenues and profits are generated from the sales of
systems and services in this one segment. For the proposes of evaluating the Company reportable segments, the Company Chief
Executive Officer is its chief operating decision maker, as defined in the applicable authoritative guidance.

2008, two customers accounted for 19 percent and 10 percent of total revenues, respectively. In 2007, four customers accounted for 15
percent, 13 percent, 12 percent and 10 percent of total revenues, respectively. At December 31, 2009, three customers accounted for 27
percent, 19 percent, and 14 percent of the Company accounts receivable. At December 31, 2008, four customers accounted for 27 percent,
14 percent, 13 percent and 10 percent of the Company accounts receivable.

In March 2002, a jury in San Jose, California rendered a verdict in favor of the Company then subsidiary,
Mattson Wet Products, Inc. formally CFM Technologies,Inc., in a patent infringement suit against Dainippon Screen Manufacturing
Co., Ltd. DNS, a Japanese manufacturer of semiconductor wafer processing equipment. In June 2002, the Company entered into a
settlement agreement and a license agreement with DNS, under which DNS agreed to make payments to the Company totaling between
$750 million minimum and $1050million maximum for past damages, partial reimbursement of attorney fees and costs and license
fees. Through December 31, 2008, DNS had paid the Company a total of $951 million under the terms of the settlement and license
agreements. The Company recognized $64 million and $115 million of royalty revenue from DNS for the years ended December 31, 2008
and 2007, respectively, which are reflected as a component of Net sales in the Consolidated Statements Operations for those years. DNS
paid its last royalty payment to the Company in May 2008, and as of that date, DNS had satisfied all of its obligations to the Company pursuant
to the settlement and license agreements.

as well as certain foreign deferred tax assets. The Company valuation allowance was determined in accordance with the applicable
authoritative guidance, which requires an assessment of both positive and negative evidence when determining whether it is more likely than
not that deferred assets are recoverable, with such assessment being required on a jurisdiction-by-jurisdiction basis. Management believes
that sufficient uncertainty exists with regard to the realizability of these tax assets such that a valuation allowance is necessary. Factors
considered in providing a valuation allowance include the lack of a significant history of consistent profits, the current weakness in the overall
semiconductor market thereby negatively impacting the Company ability to sustain or grow revenues and earnings and the lack of carry-back
capacity to realize these assets. Based on the absence of sufficient positive objective evidence, management is unable to assert that it is
more likely than not that the Company will generate sufficient taxable income to realize these remaining net deferred assets. The amount of
the deferred tax asset valuation allowance, however, could be reduced in future periods to the extent that future taxable income is
realized.
As of December 31, 2009, the Company had Federal and state net operating loss carryforwards of approximately
$3862 million and $1382 respectively, which will begin expiring in 2018 for Federal and 2010 for state. The Company also has foreign net
operating loss carryforwards in Canada, Japan, and Germany of approximately $215 million, $15 million, and $107 million, respectively.
Canada and Japan net operating loss carryforwards will begin expiring in 2010. The German net operating loss carryforward has an indefinite
carryover life.
The Company acquired $480 million of deferred tax assets as a result of its acquisitions of Vortek, STEAG
Semiconductor Division, CFM and Concept Systems Design, Inc. The Federal and state net operating losses acquired from the STEAG
Semiconductor Division, CFM and Concept are also subject to change in control limitations as defined in Section 382 of the Internal Revenue
Code. In addition, the Company had a change in control in April 2002, which limited its net operating losses generated prior to the date the
ownership change occurred. If certain substantial changes in the Company ownership occur, there would be an additional annual limitation
on the amount of the net operating loss carryforwards that can be utilized. 
As of December 31, 2009, the Company had research credit carryforwards of approximately $34 million and $40
million for Federal and state income tax purposes, respectively. If not utilized, the Federal carryforward will expire in various amounts
beginning in 2026. The state tax credit can be carried forward indefinitely.
The Company provides U.S. income taxes on the earnings of foreign subsidiaries unless the subsidiaries earnings are
68 considered indefinitely reinvested outside the U.S. As of December 31, 2009, U.S. income
taxes were not provided for on a cumulative total of $38M of undistributed earnings for certain foreign
subsidiaries.  If these earnings were repatriated, the Company would be subject to additional U.S. income
taxes subject to an adjustment for foreign tax credits. It is not practical to determine the income tax liability
that might be incurred if these earnings were to be repatriated. The Company intends to permanently
reinvest all foreign unremitted earnings of foreign subsidiaries outside of the U.S. The Company
permanently reinvested non-U.S. earnings have been deployed in active business operations, and it is
unlikely that the Company will repatriate any portion of its permanently reinvested non-U.S. earnings in the
future.
During the twelve months ended December 31, 2009, due to decreased working capital requirements for
one of its foreign subsidiaries, the Company initiated a repatriation of $147 million from Mattson
International to Mattson U.S. During the twelve months ended December 31, 2008, due to the global
economic downturn, the Company initiated a repatriation of $237 million from Mattson International to
Mattson U.S.
As of December 31, 2009, the Company total unrecognized tax benefits were approximately $276 million exclusive
of interest and penalties described below. Included in the $276 million is approximately $33 million of unrecognized tax benefits net of
federal benefit, that if recognized, would favorably affect the effective tax rate in a future period before consideration of changes in the
valuation allowance.  The Company does not anticipate there will be a significant change of its unrecognized tax benefit within next twelve
months. 
The Company practice is to recognize interest and/or penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits in income tax expense.
Income tax expense included an estimated interest of $03 million for 2009, $03 million for 2008, and $06 million for 2007.
As of December 31, 2009 and 2008, the Company had $11 million and $13 million respectively accrued for estimated interest.
As of December 31, 2009 and 2008, the Company had $01 million and $01 million, respectively, accrued for estimated penalties.
The Company and its subsidiaries are subject to United States Federal income tax as well as to income taxes in
Germany and various other foreign and state jurisdictions. The Company Federal and state income tax returns are generally not subject to
examination by tax authorities for years before 2003. During the twelve months ended December 31, 2009, the Company closed its German
audit for years 2001 through 2004, which resulted in a decrease of the recognized tax benefit of $93 million and accrued interest of $06
million, respectively.
A reconciliation of the January 1, 2009 through December 31, 2009 amount of unrecognized tax benefits
is as follows Year Ended December 31, 2009 2008 2007 millions millions millions Balance at the beginning of the year $       363 $       296 $       252   Increases for tax positions          05          76          38   Effect of exchange rates on tax positions          02         07          09   Settlements         93           -            -    Expiration of statutes of limitations         01         02         03 Balance at the end of the year $       276 $       363 $       296 18.Net Income Per Share
The Company presents both basic and diluted net income per share on the face of its Consolidated
Statements of Operations in accordance with the authoritative guidance on earnings per share. Basic earnings per share is computed by
dividing net income by the weighted-average number of shares of common stock outstanding for the period. Diluted net income per share is
computed using the weighted-average number of shares of common stock outstanding plus the effect of all dilutive securities representing
potential shares of common stock outstanding during the period. For purposes of computing diluted net income per share, weighted average
common stock equivalents do not include stock options with an exercise price that exceeded the average market price of the Company
common stock for the period.
69 The following table summarizes the incremental shares of common stock from potentially dilutive securities,
calculated using the treasury stock method Year Ended December 31 2009 2008 2007  thousands Weighted average common shares outstanding - basic    49,832    49,471    51,771   Diluted potential common shares from stock options      and restricted stock units        -         -       945 Weighted average common shares - diluted    49,832    49,471    52,716 There were no stock options or unvested RSU included in the computation of diluted shares for the years ended
December 31, 2009 and 2008, since the Company has net losses in for these years, as the inclusion of such shares would have been
antidilutive. For the year ended December 31, 2007, the Company excluded 38 million stock options and RSUs from the computations of
diluted shares. As of December 31, 2009 and 2008, the Company had outstanding stock options and RSUs of 54 million and 65 million,
respectively. 19.Related Party Transactions
The Company did not engage in related party transactions in fiscal 2009 and 2008. Through May 2007, the
Company contracted outsourced installation and repair services and sold spare parts through an unrelated party, Mattson Service Company
MSC in Japan. A director of the Company, Shigeru Nakayama, holds a minority interest in MSC. The value of spare parts and services
transactions between the Company and MSC was $05 million in fiscal 2007. The Company believes that the payments of commissions to
MSC for sales of spare parts to customers in Japan and payments for installation and repair services rendered by MSC were on terms that
represented the market value of such transactions.                            70 Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm
To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of Mattson Technology, Inc.
In our opinion, the accompanying consolidated balance sheets and the related consolidated statements of
operations, stockholders' equity and comprehensive income loss and cash flows present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position
of Mattson Technology, Inc. and its subsidiaries
at December 31, 2009 and 2008 and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three
years in the period ended December 31, 2009 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. In
addition, in our opinion, the financial statement schedule listed in the accompanying index appearing under a2 presents fairly, in all
material respects, the information set forth therein when read in conjunction with the related consolidated financial statements. Also in our
opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2009 based on
criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway
Commission COSO. The Company management is responsible for these financial statements schedules, for maintaining effective internal
control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in Management
Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting under Item 9a. Our responsibility is to express opinions on these financial statements, on
the financial statements, financial statement schedule, and on the Company internal control over financial reporting based on our integrated
audits. We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board United States. Those
standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of
material misstatement and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audits of the
financial statements included examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements,
assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, and evaluating the overall financial statement
presentation. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial
reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal
control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the
circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.
As discussed in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements, in fiscal 2007, the Company changed the manner in
which it accounts for uncertainty in income taxes and the manner in which it accounts for sabbatical leave and other similar benefits.
A company internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding
the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted
accounting principles. A company internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that ipertain to the
maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company;
iiprovide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in
accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in
accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and iiiprovide reasonable assurance regarding
prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company assets that could have a material effect on the
financial statements.
Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.
Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of
changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. s/ PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP

Selected Quarterly Consolidated Financial Data Unaudited
The following tables set forth our unaudited condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations data for each of
the eight quarterly periods ended December 31, 2009. We have prepared this unaudited information on a basis consistent with our audited
consolidated financial statements, reflecting all normal recurring adjustments that we consider necessary for a fair presentation of our financial
position and operating results for the fiscal quarters presented. Basic and diluted earnings per share are computed independently for each of
the quarters presented. Therefore, the sum of quarterly basic and diluted per share information may not equal annual basic and diluted
earnings per share.

22 PART II  Item 5. Controls and Procedures
Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures
Our management, with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, conducted
an evaluation of our disclosure controls and procedures, as such term is defined in Rule 13a-15e promulgated under the Securities Exchange
Act of 1934, as amended, as of December 31, 2009. Our disclosure controls and procedures are intended to ensure that the information we
are required to disclose in the reports that we file or submit under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 is i recorded, processed, summarized
and reported within the time periods specified in the Securities and Exchange Commission rules and forms and ii accumulated and
communicated to our management, including the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as the principal executive and financial
officers, respectively, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosures. Based on that evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief
Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of the end of the period covered by this report.
It should be noted that any system of controls, however well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable, and
not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the system will be met. In addition, the design of any control system is based in part upon certain
assumptions about the likelihood of future events.
Management Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting
Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial
reporting; as such term is defined in Rule 13a-15f under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. A company internal control over
financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of
financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company internal control over
financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that i pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately
and fairly reflect the transactions and disposition of the assets of the company; ii provide reasonable assurance that transactions are
recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that
receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the
company; and iii provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the
company assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.
Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of
changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
Under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief
Financial Officer, we conducted an assessment of the effectiveness of the Company internal control over financial reporting as of
December31, 2009. In making this assessment, management used the criteria set forth in the framework established by the Committee
of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission COSO entitled Internal Control-Integrated Framework. Based on our
evaluation under the framework in Internal Control - Integrated Framework, our management concluded that our internal control over
financial reporting was effective as of December 31, 2009.
The effectiveness of the Company internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2009 has been
audited by PricewaterhouseCoopers, LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in their report, which appears in Item 8
of this report.
73 Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting
Our management, with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, also
conducted an evaluation of our internal control over financial reporting to determine whether any change occurred during the year ended
December 31, 2009 that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. Based
on that evaluation, our management concluded that there was no such change during the fourth quarter.
