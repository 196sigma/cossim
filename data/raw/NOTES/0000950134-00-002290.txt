33           REPORT OF INDEPENDENT PUBLIC ACCOUNTANTS To the Board of Directors of Heska Corporation   We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Heska
Corporation a Delaware corporation and subsidiaries as of December 31, 1998
and 1999, and the related consolidated statements of operations and
comprehensive loss, stockholders' equity and cash flows for each of the three
years in the period ended December 31, 1999. These financial statements are the
responsibility of the Company management. Our responsibility is to express an
opinion on these financial statements based on our audits.
We conducted our audits in accordance with auditing standards generally
accepted in the United States. Those standards require that we plan and perform
the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements
are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis,
evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An
audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant
estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial
statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis
for our opinion.
In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly,
in all material respects, the financial position of Heska Corporation and
subsidiaries as of December 31, 1998 and 1999, and the results of their
operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended
December 31, 1999, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted
in the United States.   Our audit was made for the purpose of forming an opinion on the basic
financial statements taken as a whole. The schedule listed in the index of
financial statements is presented for purposes of complying with the Securities
and Exchange Commission rules and is not part of the basic financial
statements. This schedule has been subjected to the auditing procedures applied
in the audit of the basic financial statements and, in our opinion, fairly
states in all material respects the financial data required to be set forth
therein in relation to the basic financial statements taken as a whole.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
1.  ORGANIZATION AND BUSINESS
Heska Corporation Heska or the Company is primarily focused on the
discovery, development and marketing of companion animal health products. In
addition to manufacturing certain of Heska companion animal health products,
the Company primary manufacturing subsidiary, Diamond Animal Health, Inc.
Diamond, also manufactures bovine vaccine products and pharmaceutical
products that are marketed and distributed by third parties. In addition to
manufacturing veterinary allergy products for marketing and sale by Heska,
Heska subsidiaries, Center Laboratories, Inc. Center and CMG-Heska Allergy
Products S.A. CMG, a Swiss corporation, also manufacture and sell human
allergy products. The Company also offers diagnostic services to veterinarians
at its Fort Collins, Colorado location.
From the Company inception in 1988 until early 1996, the Company
operating activities related primarily to research and development activities,
entering into collaborative agreements, raising capital and recruiting
personnel. Prior to 1996, the Company had not received any revenues from the
sale of products. During 1996, Heska grew from being primarily a research and
development concern to a fully-integrated research, development, manufacturing
and marketing company. The Company accomplished this by acquiring Diamond, a
licensed pharmaceutical and biological manufacturing facility in Des Moines,
Iowa, hiring key employees and support staff, establishing marketing and sales
operations to support Heska products introduced in 1996, and designing and
implementing more sophisticated operating and information systems. The Company
also expanded the scope and level of its scientific and business development
activities, increasing the opportunities for new products. In 1997, the Company
introduced additional products and expanded in the United States through the
acquisition of Center, a Food and Drug Administration FDA and United States
Department of Agriculture USDA licensed manufacturer of allergy
immunotherapy products located in Port Washington, New York, and internationally
through the acquisitions of Heska UK Limited Heska UK, formerly Bloxham
Laboratories Limited, a veterinary diagnostic laboratory in Teignmouth, England
and CMG formerly Centre Medical des Grand'Places S.A. in Fribourg,
Switzerland, which manufactures and markets allergy diagnostic products for use
in veterinary and human medicine, primarily in Europe. Each of the Company
acquisitions during this period was accounted for under the purchase method of
accounting and accordingly, the Company financial statements reflect the
operations of these businesses only for the periods subsequent to the
acquisitions. In July 1997, the Company established a new subsidiary, Heska AG,
located near Basel, Switzerland, for the purpose of managing its European
operations.
During the first quarter of 1998 the Company acquired Heska Waukesha
formerly Sensor Devices, Inc., a manufacturer and marketer of patient
monitoring devices used in both animal health and human applications. The
financial results of Heska Waukesha have been consolidated with those of the
Company under the pooling-of-interests accounting method for all periods
presented. The operations of Heska Waukesha were combined with existing
operations in Fort Collins, Colorado and Des Moines, Iowa during the fourth
quarter of 1999. The Heska Waukesha facility was closed in December 1999.
In late 1999, the Company announced its intent to sell Heska UK. The
transaction was completed in March 2000. The Company recorded a loss on
disposition of approximately $10 million during 1999 for this sale.
The Company has incurred net losses since its inception and anticipates
that it will continue to incur additional net losses in the near term as it
introduces new products, expands its sales and marketing
38
39            HESKA CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS capabilities and continues its research and development activities. Cumulative
net losses from inception of the Company in 1988 through December 31, 1999 have
totaled $1526 million.
The Company ability to achieve profitable operations will depend
primarily upon its ability to successfully market its products, commercialize
products that are currently under development, develop new products and
efficiently integrate acquired businesses. Most of the Company products are
subject to long development and regulatory approval cycles and there can be no
guarantee that the Company will successfully develop, manufacture or market
these products. There can also be no guarantee that the Company will attain
profitability or, if achieved, will remain profitable on a quarterly or annual
basis in the future. Until the Company attains positive cash flow, the Company
may continue to finance operations with additional equity and debt financing.
There can be no guarantee that such financing will be available when required or
will be obtained under favorable terms.
2.  SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
Basis of Presentation
The accompanying consolidated financial statements include the accounts of
the Company and of its wholly-owned subsidiaries since their respective dates of
acquisitions when accounted for under the purchase method of accounting, and for
all periods presented when accounted for under the pooling-of-interests method
of accounting. All material intercompany transactions and balances have been
eliminated in consolidation.
Use of Estimates
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally
accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and
assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the
disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial
statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the
reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.
Cash and Cash Equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents are stated at cost, which approximates market,
and include short-term highly liquid investments with original maturities of
less than three months.
Marketable Securities and Restricted Investments
The Company classifies its marketable securities as available-for-sale
and, accordingly, carries such securities at aggregate fair value. During 1999,
the Company recognized a loss in its financial statements of $943,000 on the
sale of certain long-term U.S. government agency obligations. Unrealized gains
or losses, if material, are included as a component of accumulated other
comprehensive income.
At December 31, 1998 these securities had an aggregate amortized cost,
using specific identification, of $462 million, a maximum maturity of
approximately ten years and consisted entirely of U.S. government agency
obligations. At December 31, 1999 these securities had an aggregate amortized
cost, using specific identification, of $231 million, a maximum maturity of
approximately 4 years and consisted of $78 million of U.S. government agency
obligations and $153 million of U.S. corporate commercial paper. The fair
market value of marketable securities at December 31, 1998 and 1999 was
approximately $463 million and $228 million, respectively. An unrealized gain
of approximately
39
40            HESKA CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 85,000 has been recorded as a component of accumulated comprehensive income
within stockholders' equity as of December 31, 1998. An unrealized loss on its
marketable securities invested in U.S. government agency obligations of
approximately $291,000 has been recorded as a component of accumulated
comprehensive income within stockholders' equity as of December 31, 1999.
Marketable securities at both December 31, 1998 and 1999 included approximately
$281,000 of restricted investments held as collateral for capital leases See
Note 4 and $460 million and $225 million of short-term marketable securities,
respectively.
Concentration of Credit Risk
Financial instruments that potentially subject the Company to a
concentration of credit risk consist of cash and cash equivalents, marketable
securities and accounts receivable. The Company maintains the majority of its
cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities with financial institutions
that management believes are creditworthy in the form of demand deposits, U.S.
government agency obligations and U.S. corporate commercial paper. The Company
has no significant off-balance sheet concentrations of credit risk such as
foreign exchange contracts, options contracts or other foreign hedging
arrangements.
The Company performs ongoing credit evaluations of its customers' financial
condition and generally does not require collateral. Its accounts receivable
balances are due primarily from domestic veterinary clinics and individual
veterinarians, and both domestic and international corporations.
Fair Value of Financial Instruments
The Company financial instruments consist of cash and cash equivalents,
short-term trade receivables and payables and notes payable. The carrying values
of cash and cash equivalents and short-term trade receivables and payables
approximate fair value. The fair value of notes payable is estimated based on
current rates available for similar debt with similar maturities and collateral,
and at December 31, 1999, approximates the carrying value.
Inventories, net
Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market using the first-in,
first-out method. If the cost of inventories exceeds fair market value,
provisions are made for the difference between cost and fair market value.
Inventories, net of provisions, consist of the following in thousands                                   DECEMBER 31,

Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities
During 2001, the Company will adopt the provisions of SFAS No. 133,
Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities. The Statement
establishes accounting and reporting standards requiring that every derivative
instrument including certain derivative instruments embedded in other
contracts be recorded in the balance sheet as either an asset or liability
measured at fair value. The
40
41            HESKA CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Statement requires that changes in the derivative fair value be recognized
currently in earnings unless specific hedging criteria are met. The Company does
not expect that the adoption of this Statement will have a material impact on
its reported earnings or comprehensive income.
Property, Equipment and Intangible Assets
Property and equipment are recorded at cost and depreciated on a
straight-line or declining balance basis over the estimated useful lives of the
related assets. Amortization of assets acquired under capital leases is included
with depreciation expense on owned assets.
Leasehold improvements are amortized over the applicable lease period or
their estimated useful lives, whichever is shorter. Maintenance and repairs are
charged to expense when incurred, and major renewals and improvements are
capitalized.
Intangible assets primarily consist of various assets arising from business
combinations and are amortized using the straight-line method over the period of
expected benefit.
The Company periodically reviews the appropriateness of the remaining life
of its property, equipment and intangible assets considering whether any events
have occurred or conditions have developed which may indicate that the remaining
life requires adjustment. After reviewing the appropriateness of the remaining
life and the pattern of usage of these assets, the Company then assesses their
overall recoverability by determining if the net book value can be recovered
through undiscounted future operating cash flows. Absent any unfavorable
findings, the Company continues to amortize and depreciate its property,
equipment and intangible assets based on the existing estimated life. During
1999, the Company review of property, equipment and intangible assets
determined that a write-down to fair market value of $10 million for equipment
and $372,000 for intangible assets was needed. These amounts were recorded as
part of the loss on assets held for disposition in the accompanying statement of
operations.
Property and equipment consist of the following in thousands                                         DECEMBER 31,

1998 and 1999, respectively.

$ 4,311   $ 1,629
The customer lists and market presence resulted from the Company 1997
acquisitions. The remaining intangible assets resulted primarily from the
acquisitions of certain lines of business and assets in 1996, 1997 and 1998.
Amortization expense for intangible assets was $19 million, $20 million and
$16 million for the years ended December 31, 1997, 1998 and 1999, respectively.
Revenue Recognition
Product revenues are recognized at the time goods are shipped to the
customer, or at the time services are performed, with an appropriate provision
for returns and allowances.
The Company recognizes revenue from sponsored research and development as
research activities are performed or as development milestones are completed
under the terms of the research and development agreements. Costs incurred in
connection with the performance of sponsored research and development are
expensed as incurred. The Company defers revenue recognition of advance payments
received during the current year until research activities are performed or
development milestones are completed. In connection with these sponsored
research and development agreements, the Company has recognized $26 million 13 million and $900,000 of research and development revenue for the years
ended December 31, 1997, 1998 and 1999, respectively.
In addition to its direct sales force and a contract sales force
specializing in equine products, the Company utilizes both distributors and
sales agency organizations to sell its products. Distributors purchase goods
from the Company, take title to those goods and resell them to their customers
in the distributors' territory. Sales agents maintain inventories of goods on
consignment from the Company and sell these goods on behalf of the Company to
customers in the sales agents' territory. The Company recognizes revenue at the
time goods are sold to the customers by the sales agents. Sales agents are paid
a fee for their services, which include maintaining product inventories, sales
activities, billing and collections. Fees earned by sales agents are netted
against revenues generated by these entities.
In December 1999, the SEC issued SAB No. 101, Revenue Recognition SAB
101. SAB 101 clarifies the SEC staff views in applying generally accepted
accounting principles to selected revenue recognition issues. The guidance in
SAB 101 must be implemented by the Company first quarter of fiscal 2000. The
Company is currently reviewing the guidelines provided in SAB 101, and believes
that SAB 101 will not significantly affect its results of operations.
42
43            HESKA CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Cost of Sales
Royalties payable in connection with certain research, development and
licensing agreements See Note 9 are reflected in cost of sales as incurred.
Basic and Diluted Net Loss Per Share
The Company presents basic and diluted net loss per share in accordance
with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards SFAS No. 128, Earnings per
Share, which establishes standards for computing and presenting basic and
diluted earnings per share. Also, the Company has adopted the guidance of
Securities and Exchange Commission SEC Staff Accounting Bulletin SAB No.
98 and related interpretations. Basic net loss per common share is computed
using the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the
period. Diluted net loss per share is computed using the sum of the weighted
average number of shares of common stock outstanding and, if not anti-dilutive,
the effect of outstanding stock options and warrants determined using the
treasury stock method. At December 31, 1999, securities that have been excluded
from diluted net loss per share because they would be anti-dilutive are
outstanding options to purchase 4,246,183 shares of the Company common stock
and warrants to purchase 1,165,000 shares of the Company common stock.
Due to the automatic conversion of all shares of convertible preferred
stock into common stock upon the closing of the Company initial public
offering in July 1997 the IPO, historical basic and diluted net loss per
common share for fiscal 1997 is not considered meaningful as it would differ
materially from the pro forma basic and diluted net loss per common share and
common stock equivalent shares given the changes in the capital structure of the
Company.
The Company has assumed the conversion of convertible preferred stock
issued into 11,289 shares of common stock in 1997.
Foreign Currency Translation
The functional currencies of the Company international subsidiaries are
the Pound Sterling pound, the French Franc FRF and the Swiss Franc
CHF. Assets and liabilities of the Company international subsidiaries are
translated using the exchange rate in effect at the balance sheet date. Revenue
and expense accounts are translated using an average of exchange rates in effect
during the period. Cumulative translation gains and losses, if material, are
shown in the consolidated balance sheets as a separate component of
stockholders' equity. Exchange gains and losses arising from transactions
denominated in foreign currencies i.e., transaction gains and losses are
recognized in current operations. To date, the Company has not entered into any
forward contracts or hedging transactions.
3.  BUSINESS ACQUISITION
Acquisition of Heska Waukesha. In March 1998 the Company completed its
acquisition of all of the outstanding shares of Heska Waukesha, a manufacturer
and marketer of medical sensor products, in a transaction valued at
approximately $89 million using the pooling-of-interests accounting method. The
Company issued 639,622 shares of its common stock and also reserved an
additional 147,898 shares of its common stock for issuance in connection with
outstanding Heska Waukesha options that were assumed by the Company in the
merger. Accordingly, in 1998, the consolidated financial statements of the
Company were restated to include the accounts of Heska Waukesha for all prior
periods presented. There were no adjustments required to the net assets or
previously reported results of operations of the
43
44            HESKA CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Company or Heska Waukesha as a result of the adoption of the same accounting
practices by the respective entities.
4.  CAPITAL LEASE OBLIGATIONS
The Company has entered into certain capital lease agreements for
laboratory equipment, office equipment, machinery and equipment, and computer
equipment and software. For the years ended December 31, 1998 and 1999, the
Company had capitalized machinery and equipment under capital leases with a
gross value of approximately $23 million and $25 million and net book value of
approximately $14 million and $12 million, respectively. The capitalized cost
of the equipment under capital leases is included in the accompanying balance
sheets under the respective asset classes. Under the terms of the Company
lease agreements, the Company is required to make monthly payments of principal
and interest through the year 2004, at interest rates ranging from 405% to
2000% per annum. The equipment under the capital leases serves as security for
the leases.
The Company has a capital lease with a commercial bank which requires the
Company to pledge cash or investments as additional collateral for the lease.
The lease agreement, which has a borrowing limit of $20 million calls for a
collateral balance equal to 25% of the borrowed amount when the Company annual
revenues reach $280 million. The lease also requires the Company to maintain
minimum levels of cash and cash equivalent balances throughout the term of the
lease. At both December 31, 1998 and 1999, the Company was in compliance with
all covenants of the master lease and held restricted U.S. Treasury Bonds of
approximately $281,000 as additional collateral under the lease.
The future annual minimum required payments under capital lease obligations
as of December 31, 1999 were as follows in thousands YEAR ENDING

5.  RESTRUCTURING EXPENSES
In August 1999, the Company announced plans to consolidate its Heska
Waukesha operations with existing operations in Fort Collins, Colorado and Des
Moines, Iowa. This consolidation was based on the Company determination that
significant operating efficiencies could be achieved through the combined
operations. The Company recognized a charge to operations of approximately $12
million for
44
45            HESKA CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS this consolidation. These expenses related primarily to personnel severance
costs for 40 individuals and the costs associated with facilities being closed
and excess equipment, primarily at the Company Waukesha, Wisconsin location.
This facility was closed in December 1999.
In December 1998 the Company completed a cost reduction and restructuring
plan. The restructuring was based on the Company determination that, while
revenues had been increasing steadily, management believed that reducing
expenses was necessary in order to accelerate the Company efforts to reach
profitability. In connection with the restructuring, the Company recognized a
charge to operations in 1998 of approximately $24 million. These expenses
related to personnel severance costs for 69 individuals and costs associated
with excess facilities and equipment, primarily at the Company Fort Collins,
Colorado location.
Shown below is a reconciliation of restructuring costs for the year ended

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS   The IDED and City of Des Moines promissory notes are secured by a first
security interest in essentially all assets of Diamond except assets acquired
through capital leases and are included as cross- collateralized obligations by
the respective lenders. These notes were assumed as a result of the 1996 Diamond
acquisition.
The Heska Waukesha line of credit and SBA and State of Wisconsin loans were
secured by a first security interest in essentially all assets of Heska Waukesha
except assets acquired through capital leases and were included as
cross-collateralized obligations by the respective lenders. These obligations,
along with the unsecured note payable, were assumed as a result of the
acquisition of Heska Waukesha in March 1998.
The Company other debt instruments are secured by the assets of the
respective subsidiaries and general corporate guarantees by Heska Corporation.
As of December 31, 1999, one of the Company wholly-owned subsidiaries,
Diamond, did not meet certain financial covenants contained in its existing
$2,500,000 line of credit agreement. The commercial bank who provides the line
of credit waived the covenant non-compliance as of December 31, 1999. The
Company has reflected the $917,000 outstanding under the existing agreement as
current in its financial statements. The Company has received a proposal for a
new, larger corporate line of credit with the same commercial bank. The proposal
is subject to a number of closing conditions. Management believes that such
conditions will be satisfactorily met, however there can be no assurance the new
line of credit facility will close. Under the terms and covenants of the
proposed facility, the Company would have been in compliance as of December 31,
1999.

7.  ACCRUED PENSION LIABILITY
Diamond has a noncontributory defined benefit pension plan covering all
employees who have met the eligibility requirements. The plan provides monthly
benefits based on years of service which are subject to certain reductions if
the employee retires before reaching age 65. Diamond funding policy is to make
the minimum annual contribution that is required by applicable regulations.
Effective October 1992, Diamond froze the plan, restricting new participants and
benefits for future service.

The Company accounts for income taxes under the provisions SFAS No. 109,
Accounting for Income Taxes. As of December 31, 1999 the Company had
approximately $1275 million of net operating loss NOL carryforwards for
income tax purposes and approximately $27 million of research and development
tax credits available to offset future federal income tax, subject to
limitations for alternative minimum tax. The NOL and credit carryforwards are
subject to examination by the tax authorities and expire in various years from
2003 through 2019. The Tax Reform Act of 1986 contains provisions that may limit
the NOL and credit carryforwards available for use in any given year upon the
occurrence of certain events, including significant changes in ownership
interest. A change in ownership of a company of greater
48
49            HESKA CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS than 50% within a three-year period results in an annual limitation on the
Company ability to utilize its NOL carryforwards from tax periods prior to the
ownership change. The acquisition of Diamond in April 1996 resulted in such a
change of ownership and the Company estimates that the resulting NOL
carryforward limitation will be approximately $47 million per year for periods
subsequent to April 19, 1996. The Company believes that this limitation may
affect the eventual utilization of its total NOL carryforwards.
The acquisition of Diamond was completed on a tax free basis. Accordingly,
the basis of the assets for financial reporting purposes exceeds the basis of
the assets for income tax purposes. The Company has recorded a deferred tax
liability related to this basis difference. As the Company had previously
recorded a valuation allowance against its deferred tax assets, the Company
reduced its valuation allowance in an amount equal to the deferred tax liability
at the date of the merger.
The Company NOL represent a previously unrecognized tax benefit.
Recognition of these benefits requires future taxable income, the attainment of
which is uncertain, and therefore, a valuation allowance has been established
for the entire tax benefit and no benefit for income taxes has been recognized
in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations.

In November 1998, Synbiotics Corporation Synbiotics filed a lawsuit
against the Company in the United States District Court for the Southern
District of California in which it alleges that the Company infringed a patent
owned by Synbiotics relating to heartworm diagnostic technology. The Company has
answered the complaint, discovery is proceeding and no trial date has been set.
The Company has obtained legal opinions from outside patent counsel that its
heartworm diagnostic products do not infringe the Synbiotics patent and that the
patent is invalid. The opinions of non-infringement are consistent with the
results of the Company internal evaluations. While management believes that
the Company has valid defenses to Synbiotics' allegations and intends to defend
the action vigorously, there can be no assurance

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS that an adverse result or settlement would not have a material adverse effect on
the Company financial position, its results of operations or cash flow.
The Company holds certain rights to market and manufacture all products
developed or created under certain research, development and licensing
agreements with various entities. In connection with such agreements, the
Company has agreed to pay the entities royalties on net product sales. In the
years ended December 31, 1997, 1998 and 1999, royalties of $15,000, $52,000 and
$10 million became payable under these agreements, respectively.
In connection with an equity investment by a pharmaceutical firm in April
1996 the Investor, the Company granted the Investor the rights, co-exclusive
with the Company rights, to market two products under development by the
Company, the flea control vaccine and feline heartworm vaccine. The Company and
the Investor have a revenue sharing arrangement for net sales of these products
through the year 2005.
In addition to the marketing agreements described above, the Company
entered into a pharmaceutical screening cooperation agreement with the Investor,
pursuant to which the two parties may enter into joint development arrangements
to develop pharmaceutical and vaccine products. In addition, to the extent that
the Company decides to grant a license to any third party for any products or
technology for companion or food animal applications, the Investor must be
offered first right to negotiate to acquire such license.
In connection with the acquisition of Center, the Company entered into a
sales and marketing agreement with a domestic distribution company which grants
the right to the distribution company to market and sell Center allergenic
extracts for human use, with sales commission rates which vary from 20% to 25%.
The agreement expires in December 2002.
The Company contracts with various parties that conduct research and
development on the Company behalf. In return, the Company generally receives
the right to commercialize any products resulting from these contracts. In the
event the Company licenses any technology developed under these contracts, the
Company will generally be obligated to pay royalties at specified percentages of
future sales of products utilizing the licensed technology.
The Company has entered into operating leases for its office and research

Common Stock
In December 1999, the Company completed a follow-on public offering of
6,500,000 shares of common stock at a price of $2063 per share, providing the
Company with net proceeds of approximately $133 million.
In July 1998, the Company issued 1165 million shares of the Company
common stock to Ralston Purina Company Ralston Purina, for $1475 million in
cash, and also issued, for an additional cash payment of $250,000, warrants to
purchase an additional 1165 million shares of the Company common stock. The
exercise price of the warrants was $1267 for the first year of the warrants,
increasing by 20% per year for each of the second and third years of the
warrants. The warrants were exercisable immediately as of July 30, 1998 and
expire in three years with respect to any unexercised shares.
In July 1998, the Company issued 205,619 shares of common stock to Bayer
Corporation Bayer in consideration for the acquisition by Diamond of certain
assets, including land and buildings formerly leased by Diamond from Bayer, and
as repayment in full of certain indebtedness of Diamond to Bayer, in a
transaction valued at approximately $23 million.
In March 1998, the Company completed its follow-on public offering of
5,750,000 shares of common stock including 500,000 shares offered by a
stockholder of the Company and an underwriters' over-allotment option exercised
for 750,000 shares at a price of $9875 per share, providing the Company with
net proceeds of approximately $486 million.
In July 1997, the Company completed its IPO of 5,637,850 shares of common
stock including an underwriters' over-allotment option exercised for 637,850
shares at a price of $850 per share, providing the Company with net proceeds
of approximately $439 million. Upon closing of the IPO, all of the outstanding
shares of Series A, B, C, D, E and F preferred stock were automatically
converted into 11,289,388 shares of common stock.
The Company has granted stock purchase rights to acquire 322,000 shares of
common stock to key executives and Directors pursuant to the 1994 Key Executive
Stock Plan. As of December 31, 1998, executives had exercised all of these stock
purchase rights by executing promissory notes payable to the Company. The fair
market value of the underlying common stock equaled the exercise price on the
date of grant and exercise. The notes mature in six years, bear interest at 75%
and are secured by a pledge of the underlying shares of common stock. Under the
terms of the Key Executive Stock Plan, if the purchaser relationship with the
Company ceases for any reason within 48 months of the grant date, the Company
may, within 90 days following termination, repurchase at the original exercise
price all of the stock which has not vested. The stock vests ratably over a 48
month period. During the years ended December 31, 1998 and 1999, 310,520 and
316,760 shares had vested and been released from the purchase option,
respectively. As of December 31, 1999, only one promissory note related to these
shares remained outstanding.
Stock Option Plans
The Company has a stock option plan which authorizes granting of stock
options and stock purchase rights to employees, officers, directors and
consultants of the Company to purchase shares of common stock. In 1997, the
board of directors adopted the 1997 Stock Incentive Plan the 1997 Plan and
terminated two prior option plans. However, options granted and unexercised
under the prior plans are still outstanding. All shares remaining available for
grant under the terminated plans were rolled into the 1997 Plan. In addition,
all shares which are subsequently cancelled under the prior plans are rolled
into the 1997 Plan on a quarterly basis. The number of shares reserved for
issuance under the 1997 Plan increases
51

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS automatically on January 1 of each year by a number equal to the lesser of a

immediately preceding December 31. The number of shares reserved for issuance
under all plans as of January 1, 2000 was 5,051,420.
The stock options granted by the board of directors may be either incentive
stock options ISOs or nonstatutory stock options NSOs. The purchase
price for options under all of the plans may be no less than 100% of fair market
value for ISOs or 85% of fair market value for NSOs. Options granted will expire
no later than the tenth anniversary subsequent to the date of grant or 90 days
following termination of employment, except in cases of death or disability, in
which case the options will remain exercisable for up to twelve months. Under
the terms of the 1997 Plan, in the event the Company is sold or merged, options
granted will either be assumed by the surviving corporation or vest immediately.
SFAS No. 123 SFAS 123
SFAS 123, Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation, defines a fair value
based method of accounting for employee stock options, employee stock purchases,
or similar equity instruments. However, SFAS 123 allows the continued
measurement of compensation cost for such plans using the intrinsic value based
method prescribed by APB Opinion No. 25, Accounting for Stock Issued to
Employees APB 25, provided that pro forma disclosures are made of net income
or loss, assuming the fair value based method of SFAS 123 had been applied. The
Company has elected to account for its stock-based compensation plans under APB
25; accordingly, for purposes of the pro forma disclosures presented below, the
Company has computed the fair values of all options granted during 1997, 1998
and 1999, using the Black-Scholes pricing model and the following weighted
average assumptions                   1997      1998       1999

Expected dividend yield.      0%       0%       0   To estimate expected lives of options for this valuation, it was assumed
options will be exercised at varying schedules after becoming fully vested
dependent upon the income level of the option holder. For measurement purposes,
options have been segregated into three income groups, and estimated exercise
behavior of option recipients varies from six months to one and one half years
from the date of vesting, dependent on income group less highly compensated
employees are expected to have shorter holding periods. All options are
initially assumed to vest. Cumulative compensation cost recognized in pro forma
basic net income or loss with respect to options that are forfeited prior to
vesting is adjusted as a reduction of pro forma compensation expense in the
period of forfeiture. Fair value computations are highly sensitive to the
volatility factor assumed; the greater the volatility, the higher the computed
fair value of the options granted.
The total fair value of options granted was computed to be approximately
$50 million, $88 million and $38 million for the years ended December 31,
1997, 1998 and 1999, respectively. The amounts are amortized ratably over the
vesting periods of the options. Pro forma stock-based compensation, net of the
effect of forfeitures, was $18 million, $39 million and $36 million for 1997,
1998 and 1999, respectively.

Employee Stock Purchase Plan the ESPP
Under the 1997 Employee Stock Purchase Plan, the Company is authorized to
issue up to 250,000 shares of common stock to its employees. Employees of the
Company and its U.S. subsidiaries who are expected to work at least 20 hours per
week and five months per year are eligible to participate. Under the terms of
the plan, employees can choose to have up to 10% of their annual base earnings
withheld to purchase the Company common stock. The purchase price of the stock
is 85% of the lower of its beginning-of-enrollment period or end-of-measurement
period market price. Each enrollment period is two years, with six month
measurement periods ending June 30 and December 31.
The Company has computed the fair values of stock purchased under the ESPP
