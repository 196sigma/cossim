consummation of its initial public offering in March 1994, the Company was
treated for income tax purposes as an S corporation under Subchapter S of
the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, and under comparable tax
laws of certain states. As a result, earnings of the Company during that
period were taxed for federal and certain state income tax purposes
directly to the Company stockholders, rather than to the Company. Upon
the termination of the Company S corporation status, in addition to
becoming subject to corporate tax at the federal level and in a number of
states, the Company was required to    provide for deferred federal and state income taxes, calculated in
accordance with the Financial Accounting Standards Board Statement 109,
Accounting for Income Taxes FAS 109, for the cumulative temporary
differences between the financial reporting and income tax basis of the
Company assets and liabilities, resulting in a charge to the provision
for income taxes in the amount of $1,213,000 in 1994.
2 The Company used a portion of its net proceeds from the initial public
offering to prepay the $12,000,000 in principal of the Company 1088%
Senior Secured Notes and related accrued interest of $653,000. This
prepayment resulted in an extraordinary after tax loss of $1,160,000, net
of related income tax benefit of $710,000. The gross extraordinary loss
included a prepayment penalty of $1,728,000 and the write-off of
unamortized deferred loan costs of $142,000.
3 The actual and pro forma net income per share data is based on the
historical weighted average number of shares outstanding, as adjusted to
reflect i a Common Stock split of 508-for-one in connection with a
reincorporation merger transaction completed in January 1994, ii the
3-for-2 split of the Common Stock effected on March 5, 1995, and iii the
3-for-2 split of the Common Stock effected on December 5, 1995.
4 The pro forma statement of income data for 1994 is based on historical net
income, as adjusted to reflect a provision for income taxes at an assumed
effective rate of 38%, as if the Company had been a C corporation since
its inception. The pro forma statement of income data was calculated using
the criteria established under FAS 109, which requires the use of an asset
and liability approach to financial reporting and accounting for income
taxes. The 1994 pro forma provision for income taxes does not include the
$1,213,000 charge related to the Company termination of its S corporation
status as discussed in note 1 above.
ITEM 7  MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS
OF OPERATIONS
The following discussion should be read in conjunction with, and is
qualified in its entirety by, the Financial Statements and the Notes thereto and
Selected Financial Data included elsewhere in this Form 10-K. Historical
operating results and percentage relationships among any amounts included in the
Financial Statements are not necessarily indicative of trends in operating
results for any future period.
OVERVIEW
The Company core business is the manufacture and sale of high quality,
precision steel balls and rollers. In 1998, balls accounted for approximately
92% of the Company net sales, while rollers accounted for the remaining 8%.
Although all of the Company net sales from 1980 through 1986 were exclusively
to domestic customers, the Company international sales have increased
significantly since then and represented approximately 46% of net sales in 1998.
See Note 8 of the Notes to Financial Statements. In 1998, both domestic and
international sales declined due to reduced demand in the United States and
abroad.
Significant factors in the Company growth since its founding include its
displacement of captive ball manufacturing divisions of domestic and
international bearing manufacturers as a source of precision balls and increased
sales of high precision balls for quiet bearing applications. From 1994 through
1998, the percentage of high precision balls produced by the Company for use in
quiet bearing applications has increased from approximately 69% to approximately
81% of total net ball sales. Management believes that the Company sales growth
since 1994 is due to its ability to capitalize on opportunities in overseas
markets and provide precision balls at competitive prices, as well as its
emphasis on product quality and customer service. The sales decline in 1998 was
due in large part to economic conditions in Asia and South America and a decline
in outsourcing by certain captive producers. The Company sales in Asia
declined by approximately $35 million dollars in 1998. Further, the Company was
adversely affected by increased competition from Asian-based competitors who
sought to reduce overcapacity. RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 1998 COMPARED TO THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 1997
NET SALES. The Company net sales decreased $22 million, or 30%, from
$752 million in 1997 to $730 million in 1998. Foreign net sales decreased $12
million, or 34%, from $349 million in 1997 to $337 million in 1998. The
decrease in foreign net sales was due primarily to decreased sales volumes to
existing customers, largely due to general economic conditions in Asia and South
America. Domestic net sales decreased $10 million, or 25%, from $403 million
in 1997 to $393 million in 1998. This decrease was due primarily to decreased
sales volumes to domestically-based Asian companies.
GROSS PROFIT. Gross profit decreased by $892,000, or 38% from $235
million in 1997 to $227 million in 1998. As a percentage of net sales, gross
profit decreased slightly from 313% in 1997 to 310% in 1998. The decrease in
gross profit is largely due to decreased levels of volume during 1998 as
compared to 1997 and related capacity under-utilization issues at the Company
manufacturing facilities.
SELLING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES. Selling, general and
administrative expenses increased by $378,000, or 68% in 1998 to $59 million
from $55 million in 1997. This increase was due primarily to increased expenses
related to the Ireland facility, which began production in the fourth quarter of
1997, as well as increases in 1998 to implement the Company strategic plan. As
a percentage of net sales, selling, general and administrative expenses
increased to 81% in 1998 from 73% in 1997.
DEPRECIATION EXPENSE. Depreciation expense increased $451,000, or 110%, to
$46 million in 1998 from $41 million in 1997. This increase was due primarily
to purchases of capital equipment related to the new Ireland facility which
began production in the fourth quarter of 1997. As a percentage of sales,
depreciation expense increased to 62% in 1998 from 55% in 1997.   NET INCOME. Net income decreased $854,000, or 10% from $85 million in 1997
to $77 million in 1998. As a percentage of net sales, net income decreased from
113% in 1997 to 105% in 1998. The decrease in net income as a percentage of
net sales was due primarily to excess capacity at the Company manufacturing
facilities, increased selling, general and administrative expenses and the
increase in depreciation expense discussed above. Slightly offsetting these
factors was a lower federal tax rate due to the shifting of sales to the Irish
facility which benefits from a 10% corporate tax rate. The lower federal tax
rate was in turn offset slightly by a decrease in the level of tax benefit from
the Company participation in a shared foreign sales corporation.
YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 1997 COMPARED TO THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 1996
NET SALES. The Company net sales decreased $93 million, or 110%, from
$845 million in 1996 to $753 million in 1997. Foreign net sales decreased $72
million, or 171%, from $421 million in 1996 to $349 million in 1997. The
decrease in foreign net sales was due primarily to decreased sales volumes with
existing customers, largely because of a decline in outsourcing of captive
production by certain of the Company customers including, one of the
Company major customers bringing in house a portion of its business that was
previously outsourced to the Company and general economic conditions in Europe
and Asia. Domestic net sales decreased $21 million, or 50%, from $424 million
in 1996 to $403 million in 1997. This decrease was primarily due to decreased
sales to existing customers.
GROSS PROFIT. Gross profit decreased by $43 million, or 154% from $278
million in 1996 to $235 million in 1997. As a percentage of net sales, gross
profit decreased from 329% in 1996 to 313% in 1997. The decrease in gross
profit is due largely to costs related to the new facility start-up in Ireland
and costs associated with excess capacity resulting from decreased sales to some
existing customers.
SELLING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES. Selling, general and
administrative expenses increased by $628,000, or 128% to $55 million from
$49 million in 1996. This increase was due primarily to increased legal,
accounting and employee relocation expenses related to the Ireland facility
start-up, as well as increased consulting expenses related to the Company
strategic development process. As a percentage of net sales, selling, general
and administrative expenses increased to 73% in 1997 from 58% in 1996.
DEPRECIATION EXPENSE. Depreciation expense increased $748,000, or 223%, to
$41 million in 1997 from $34 million in 1996. This increase was due primarily
to capital expenditures associated with expansion of the Company existing
facilities and the start-up of the Ireland facility. Also, new assets added in
1996 related to the Mountain City facility were depreciated utilizing the
half-year convention in the prior year versus a full year of depreciation taken
in 1997. As a percentage of net sales, depreciation increased to 55% in 1997
from 40% in 1996.
INTEREST EXPENSE. Interest expense decreased $267,000, or 902%, from
$296,000 in 1996 to $29,000 in 1997. The decrease was due to decreased levels
outstanding under the Company line of credit in 1997 as compared to 1996. See
Management Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition --Liquidity and
Capital Resources.
NET INCOME. Net income decreased $40 million, or 317% from $125 million
in 1996 to $85 million in 1997. As a percentage of net sales, net income
decreased to 113% in 1997 from 147% in 1996. The decrease in net income as a
percentage of net sales was due primarily to costs associated with the new
Ireland facility start-up, excess capacity at the Company plants, increased
selling, general and administrative expenses and the increased depreciation
expense discussed above. In addition, the Company increased the provision for
income taxes due to the decrease in foreign sales as a percentage of total sales
and the anticipated decrease in the level of tax benefit from the Company
participation in a shared foreign sales corporation. LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES
In July 1997, the Company entered into a loan agreement with First American
National Bank First American that provides for a revolving credit facility
of up to $25 million, which will expire June 30, 2000.
Amounts outstanding under the revolving facility are unsecured and bear
interest at a floating rate equal to, at the Company option, either LIBOR plus
065% or the Fed Funds effective rate plus 15%. The loan agreement contains
customary financial and operating restrictions on the Company, including
covenants restricting the Company, without First American consent, from
incurring additional indebtedness from, or pledging any of its assets to, other
lenders and from disposing of a substantial portion of its assets. In addition,
the Company is prohibited from declaring any dividend if a default exists under
the revolving credit facility at the time of, or would occur as a result of,
such a declaration. The loan agreement also prohibits sales of property outside
of the ordinary course of business. The loan agreement contains financial
covenants with respect to the Company, including a covenant that the Company
earnings will not decrease in any year by more than fifty percent of earnings in
the Company immediately preceding fiscal year. The Company, as of March 19,
1999, was in compliance with all such covenants.
The Company arrangements with its domestic customers typically provide
that payments are due within 30 days following the date of the Company
shipment of goods, while arrangements with foreign customers other than foreign
customers that have entered into an inventory management program with the
Company generally provide that payments are due within either 90 or 120 days
following the date of shipment. Under the Company inventory management
program, payments typically are due within 30 days after the product is used by
the customer. The Company has developed a presence in foreign markets, and to
the extent foreign sales increase, management believes that the Company
working capital requirements will increase as a result of longer payment terms
provided to foreign customers. The Company net sales historically have not
been of a seasonal nature. However, as foreign sales have increased as a
percentage of total sales, seasonality has become a factor for the Company in
that many foreign customers cease production during the month of August.
In the fourth quarter of 1997, upon the commencement of production in its
Kilkenny, Ireland facility, the Company began to bill and receive payment from
some of its foreign customers in their own currency. To date, the Company has
not been materially adversely affected by currency fluctuations or foreign
exchange restrictions. Nonetheless, as a result of these sales, the Company
foreign exchange risk has increased. Various strategies to manage this risk are
under development and implementation. The Company has considered and continues
to consider implementing a hedging program, but has not done so. In addition, a
strengthening of the US dollar against foreign currencies could impair the
ability of the Company to compete with internationally based competitors for
foreign as well as domestic sales.
Working capital, which consists principally of cash and cash equivalents,
accounts receivable and inventories, was $209 million at December 31, 1998, as
compared to $187 million at December 31, 1997. The ratio of current assets to
current liabilities increased slightly to 37:1 at December 31, 1998 from 35:1
at December 31, 1997. Cash flow from operations decreased to $127 during 1998
from $141 million during 1997.
During 1999, the Company plans to spend approximately $29 million on
capital expenditures, primarily on maintenance of its machinery and equipment at
all four of the Company facilities. The Company does not intend to increase
capacity in 1999. The Company intends to finance these activities with cash
generated from operations and funds available under the credit facility
described above. The Company believes that funds generated from operations and
borrowings from the credit facility will be sufficient to finance the Company
working capital needs and capital expenditure requirements in 1999.   On August 4, 1998 the Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to
740,213 shares of the Company Common Stock, equaling 5% of the Company
issued and outstanding shares as of August 4, 1998. The Company did not purchase
any shares under this program during 1998.
SEASONALITY AND FLUCTUATION IN QUARTERLY RESULTS
The Company net sales historically have not been of a seasonal nature.
However, as foreign sales have increased as a percentage of total sales,
seasonality has become a factor for the Company in that many foreign customers
cease production during the month of August. For information concerning the
Company quarterly results of operations for the years ended December 31, 1998
and 1997, see Note 12 of the Notes to Financial Statements.
INFLATION AND CHANGES IN PRICES
While the Company operations have not been affected by inflation during
recent years, prices for 52100 Steel and other raw materials purchased by the
Company are subject to change. For example, during 1995, due to an increase in
worldwide demand for 52100 Steel and the decrease in the value of the United
States dollar relative to foreign currencies, the Company experienced an
increase in the price of 52100 Steel and some difficulty in obtaining an
adequate supply of 52100 Steel from its existing suppliers. Typically, the
Company pricing arrangements with its steel suppliers are subject to
adjustment once every six months. In an effort to limit its exposure to
fluctuations in steel prices, the Company has generally avoided the use of
long-term, fixed price contracts with its customers. Instead, the Company
typically reserves the right to increase product prices periodically in the
event of increases in its raw material costs. The Company was able to minimize
the impact on its operations resulting from the 52100 Steel price increases by
taking such measures.
CAUTIONARY STATEMENTS FOR PURPOSES OF THE SAFE HARBOR PROVISIONS OF THE
PRIVATE SECURITIES LITIGATION REFORM ACT OF 1995.
The Company wishes to caution that this report and the 1998 Annual Report
to Stockholders contain, and future filings by the Company, press releases and
oral statements made by the Company authorized representatives may contain,
forward looking statements that involve certain risks and uncertainties. The
Company actual results could differ materially from those expressed in such
forward looking statements due to important factors bearing on the Company
business, many of which are discussed elsewhere in this filing and in the
Company prior filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. The
following paragraphs discuss the risk factors that the Company regards as the
most significant, although the Company wishes to caution that other factors that
currently are not considered significant or that currently cannot be foreseen
may in the future prove to be important in affecting the Company results of
operations. The Company undertakes no obligation to update publicly or revise
any forward looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future
events or otherwise.
INDUSTRY RISKS. The precision ball and roller industry is cyclical and
tends to decline in response to overall declines in industrial production. The
Company sales could be negatively affected by adverse conditions in the
industrial production sector of the economy or by adverse global or national
economic conditions generally.
COMPETITION. The precision ball and roller market is highly competitive,
and many of the ball and roller manufacturers in the market are larger and have
substantially greater resources than the Company. The Company competitors are
continuously exploring and implementing improvements in technology and
manufacturing processes in order to improve product quality, and the Company
ability to remain competitive will depend, among other things, on whether it is
able, in a cost effective manner, to keep pace with such quality improvements.
In addition, the Company competes with many of its customers that, in addition
to producing bearings, also internally produce balls and rollers for sale to
third parties. The Company also faces a risk that its customers will decide to produce balls and
rollers internally rather than outsourcing their needs to the Company.
RAW MATERIAL SHORTAGES. Because the balls and rollers manufactured by the
Company have highly-specialized applications, their production requires the use
of very particular types of steel. Due to quality constraints in the United
States, the Company obtains the vast majority of its steel from overseas
suppliers. Steel shortages or transportation problems, particularly with respect
to 52100 Steel, could have a detrimental effect on the Company business.
RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH INTERNATIONAL TRADE. Because the Company obtains a
majority of its raw materials from overseas suppliers and sells to a large
number of international customers, the Company faces risks associated with i
adverse foreign currency fluctuations, ii changes in trade, monetary and
fiscal policies, laws and regulations, and other activities of governments,
agencies and similar organizations, iii the imposition of trade restrictions
or prohibitions, iv the imposition of import or other charges or taxes, and
v unstable governments or legal systems in countries in which the Company
suppliers and customers are located. In the fourth quarter of 1997, the Company
began accepting payment in foreign currency from foreign customers. In addition,
an increase in the value of the United States dollar relative to foreign
currencies may adversely affect the ability of the Company to compete with its
foreign-based competitors for international as well as domestic sales to the
extent payments are made in United States dollars.
DEPENDENCE ON MAJOR CUSTOMERS. During 1998, the Company ten largest
customers accounted for approximately 76% of its net sales. Sales to various
U.S. and foreign divisions of SKF, which is one of the largest bearing
manufacturers in the world, accounted for approximately 37% of net sales in
1998, and sales to FAG accounted for approximately 11% of net sales in 1998.
There can be no assurance, however, that SKF will not centralize purchasing
decisions in the future. None of the Company other customers accounted for
more than 10% of its net sales in 1998, but sales to two of its customers each
represented more than 5% of the Company 1998 net sales. The loss of all or a
substantial portion of sales to these customers would have a material adverse
effect on the Company business.
YEAR 2000
The Year 2000 issue is the result of computer programs written using two
digits rather than four digits to identify a particular year. Without corrective
action, programs with time-sensitive software could potentially act as if a date
ending in 00 is the year 1900 rather than the year 2000. This could cause
computer applications to create erroneous results or cause a system failure.
The Company has conducted a comprehensive evaluation of both its
information technology systems and non-information technology systems to
determine if there would be a Year 2000 problem with these systems. Prior to
that evaluation, however, the Company had decided to upgrade its information
technology systems. The systems the Company intends to install have been
certified by the vendor to be Year 2000 compliant. The Company also evaluated
its non-information technology systems and has received certification by the
manufacturers of that equipment that they are Year 2000 compliant.
The Company expects that it will have implemented these system upgrades by
mid-1999. The Company has also developed contingency plans that it believes
would permit it to continue operating without causing any material harm to the
results of operations.
The Company expects to spend approximately $800,000 to replace its
information technology systems and train personnel. As of December 31, 1998, the
Company had spent approximately $600,000 on this project. The Company has not
made any significant additional expenditures in 1999 through March 20, 1999 on
Year 2000 matters, and overall its expenditures on this issue have not been
material. The Company has assigned one employee to coordinate its Year 2000
efforts, and has relied on existing personnel to evaluate its Year 2000
readiness.   The Company relies on third party suppliers for raw materials and a variety
of goods and services. Among its most important suppliers are those that provide
the steel necessary to make quality balls and rollers. The Company has obtained
written representation from approximately 99 percent of its suppliers that their
systems are Year 2000 compliant. The Company believes that these representations
and its own review of its systems will ensure that it will not be materially
affected by the Year 2000 issue. So far, no supplier or vendor has indicated
that the Year 2000 issue will affect its ability to provide goods and services
to the Company. Despite these assurances, if the Company suppliers are unable
to meet its needs, there could be a material adverse effect on the results of
operations, liquidity and financial condition of the Company.
The Company believes it is taking the necessary steps to resolve the Year
2000 issue in a comprehensive and timely manner. Nonetheless, should any
unforeseen circumstance arise that would delay the replacement of its system,
the Company ability to manufacture and ship its products, take orders, invoice
customers, and collect payment could be adversely affected. This could have a
material adverse effect on the Company results of operations, liquidity and
financial condition to a degree the Company has not determined.
THE EURO
The Treaty on European Union provided that an economic and monetary union
be established in Europe whereby a single European currency, the euro, was
introduced to replace the currencies of participating member states. The euro
was introduced on January 1, 1999, at which time the value of participating
member state currencies were irrevocably fixed against the euro and the European
Currency Unit. For the three year transitional period ending December 31, 2001,
the national currencies of member states will continue to circulate but be
subunits of the euro. At the end of the transitional period, euro banknotes and
coins will be issued, and the national currencies of the member states will
cease to be legal tender no later than June 30, 2002.
The Company currently has operations in Ireland, which is one of the euro
participating countries, and sells product to customers in many of the
participating countries. The functional currency of the Company Ireland
operations will remain unchanged until December 31, 2001, when it will switch to
the euro. The Company is in the process of reviewing and making changes required
for euro readiness and does not anticipate the costs associated with the
implementation of the euro to be significant.
RECENTLY ISSUED ACCOUNTING STANDARDS
In February 1998, the FASB issued SFAS No. 132 Employers' Disclosures
about Pensions and Other Postretirement Benefits which revises the disclosure
requirements for pensions and other postretirement benefits and is effective for
the Company December 31, 1998 financial reporting. The adoption of this
standard by the Company did not result in significant adjustments to existing
financial reporting practices as the Company does not currently provide pension
or postretirement benefits which are subject to the disclosure provisions of FAS
132.
In June 1998, the FASB issued SFAS No. 133 Accounting for Derivative
Instruments and Hedging Activities which establishes accounting and reporting
standards for derivative instruments and hedging activities and is effective for
the Company 2000 reporting cycle. The adoption of this standard by the Company
is not expected to result in significant adjustments to existing accounting
practices as the Company does not currently hold any derivative financial
instruments or participate in hedging activities.
Statement of Position SOP 98-1, Accounting for the Costs of Computer
Software Developed or Obtained for Internal Use, was issued by the American
Institute of Certified Public Accountants in March 1998 and requires
capitalization of certain internal-use computer software costs. The Company will
comply with the requirements of this SOP Effective for its 1999 financial
reporting. The standard is not expected to have a material effect on the
Company results of operations. ITEM 7A      QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK
The Company is exposed to changes in financial market conditions in the
normal course of its business due to its use of certain financial instruments as
well as transacting in various foreign currencies. To mitigate its exposure to
these market risks, the Company has established policies, procedures and
internal processes governing its management of financial market risks.
The Company is exposed to changes in interest rates primarily as a result
of its borrowing activities, which include a $25 million floating rate revolving
credit facility which is used to maintain liquidity and fund its business
operations. At December 31, 1998, the Company did not have any borrowings
outstanding under the revolving credit facility. The nature and amount of the
Company borrowings may vary as a result of future business requirements,
market conditions and other factors.
The Company operating cash flows denominated in foreign currencies are
exposed to changes in foreign exchange rates. Beginning in the 1997 fourth
quarter, upon the commencement of production in its Kilkenny, Ireland facility,
the Company began to bill and receive payment from some of its foreign customers
in their own currency. To date, the Company has not been materially adversely
affected by currency fluctuations of foreign exchange restrictions. However, as
foreign sales approximate 46% of total revenues, management is currently
evaluating various strategies to manage this financial market risk, including
the implementation of a foreign currency hedging program. The Company did not
hold a position in any foreign currency instruments of December 31, 1998.                    -18 ITEM 8. FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA Index to Financial Statements

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
DECEMBER 31, 1998, 1997, AND 1996
- 
NOTE 1 - THE COMPANY AND ITS SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
NN Ball & Roller, Inc. the Company is a manufacturer of balls and rollers
used primarily in the bearing industry. The Company has manufacturing facilities
in Tennessee and South Carolina. During 1997, the Company opened NN Ball &
Roller, Ltd., an operating facility in Kilkenny, Ireland. The Company sells to
both foreign and domestic customers See Note 8.
CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS
The Company considers all highly liquid investments with an original maturity of
three months or less as cash equivalents.
INVENTORIES
Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market. Cost is determined using
the first-in, first-out method.
PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT
Property, plant and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation.
Expenditures for maintenance and repairs are charged to expense as incurred.
Major renewals and betterments are capitalized. When a major property item is
retired, its cost and related accumulated depreciation or amortization are
removed from the property accounts and any gain or loss is recorded in income or
expense. The Company reviews the carrying values of long-lived assets for
impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying
amount of an asset may not be recoverable. In management opinion, no material
impairment exists at December 31, 1998 or 1997.
Depreciation is provided principally on the straight-line method over the
estimated useful lives of the depreciable assets for financial reporting
purposes. Accelerated depreciation methods are used for income tax purposes.
REVENUE RECOGNITION
The Company generally recognizes a sale when goods are shipped and ownership is
assumed by the customer. The Company has an inventory management program for
certain major customers whereby sales are recognized when products are used by
the customer from consigned stock, rather than at the time of shipment.
Inventory on consignment at December 31, 1998 and 1997 was approximately
$3,635,000 and $2,431,000, respectively.
INCOME TAXES
Income taxes are provided based upon income reported for financial statement
purposes. Deferred income taxes reflect the tax effect of temporary differences
between the financial reporting and income tax bases of the Company assets and
liabilities See Note 9.
NET INCOME PER COMMON SHARE
Basic earnings per share reflect reported earnings divided by the weighted
average number of common shares outstanding. Diluted earnings per share include
the effect of dilutive stock options outstanding during the year.                   - 25 NN BALL & ROLLER, INC.
NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
DECEMBER 31, 1998, 1997, AND 1996

STOCK INCENTIVE PLAN
The Company uses the intrinsic value method to account for employee stock
options. Accordingly, under this method, the Company has not recorded
compensation expense related to the options Note 7. The exercise price of each
option equals the market price of the Company stock on the date of grant.
PRINCIPLES OF CONSOLIDATION
The Company financial statements include the accounts of NN Ball & Roller,
Inc. and its subsidiary NN Ball & Roller, Ltd. All intercompany accounts and
investments in subsidiaries are eliminated upon consolidation.
FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSLATION
Assets and liabilities of the Company foreign subsidiary are translated at
current exchange rates, while revenue and expenses are translated at average
rates prevailing during the year. Cumulative translation adjustments are
reported as a component of other comprehensive income.
USE OF ESTIMATES IN THE PREPARATION OF FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted
accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that
affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of
contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and
the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period.
Actual results could differ from those estimates.
RECENTLY ISSUED ACCOUNTING STANDARDS
In February 1998, the FASB issued SFAS No. 132 Employers' Disclosures about
Pensions and Other Postretirement Benefits which revises the disclosure
requirements for pensions and other postretirement benefits and is effective for
the Company December 31, 1998 financial reporting. The adoption of this
standard by the Company did not result in significant adjustments to existing
financial reporting practices as the Company does not currently provide pension
or postretirement benefits which are subject to the disclosure provisions of FAS
132.
In June 1998, the FASB issued SFAS No. 133 Accounting for Derivative
Instruments and Hedging Activities which establishes accounting and reporting
standards for derivative instruments and hedging activities and is effective for
the Company 2000 reporting cycle. The adoption of this standard by the Company
is not expected to result in significant adjustments to existing accounting
practices as the Company does not currently hold any derivative financial
instruments or participate in hedging activities.
Statement of Position SOP 98-1, Accounting for the Costs of Computer
Software Developed or Obtained for Internal Use, was issued by the American
Institute of Certified Public Accountants in March 1998 and requires
capitalization of certain internal-use computer software costs. The Company will
comply with the requirements of this SOP effective for its 1999 financial
reporting. The standard is not expected to have a material effect on the
Company results of operations.                   - 26 NN BALL & ROLLER, INC.

options available for exercise was $1175.
On December 7, 1998 the Company granted a total of 20,000 options to the members
of its Board of Directors. These options carry an exercise price equal to the
market price on the date of issuance and vest equally over a period of three
years, beginning one year from date of grant. The maximum term of these options

$2550 for 1996 and $622 and $1250 for 1997, respectively. Certain of these
options were considered non qualified options and, accordingly, the Company
recorded compensation expense, for income tax purposes only, of approximately
$1,967,000 in 1996 and $2,150,000 in 1997. The reduction in taxes payable of
approximately $686,000 in 1996 and $789,000 in 1997 was recorded as additional

except those granted to the Company Board of Directors as described above,
vest 20% annually beginning one year from date of grant. The exercise price of

SFAS 123 encourages but does not require a fair value based method of
accounting for stock compensation plans. The Company has elected to continue
accounting for its stock compensation plan using the intrinsic value based
method and, accordingly, has not recorded compensation expense for each of the
three years ended December 31, 1998. Had compensation cost for the Company
stock compensation plan been determined based on the fair value at the option
grant dates, the Company net income and earnings per share would have been
