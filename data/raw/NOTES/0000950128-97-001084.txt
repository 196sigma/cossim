NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
1. FINANCIAL STATEMENT PRESENTATION
Rockwell International Corporation the Company or Rockwell is engaged in
research, development and manufacture of electronics products, with global
leadership positions in the automation, avionics and communications and
semiconductor systems markets. The Company was incorporated in 1996 and is the
successor to the former Rockwell International Corporation as a result of a
tax-free reorganization completed on December 6, 1996 the Reorganization.
Pursuant to the Reorganization, the Company merged its former Aerospace &
Defense businesses the A Business with a subsidiary of The Boeing Company
Boeing in a transaction valued at approximately $32 billion, including the
assumption by Boeing of $23 billion of liabilities of Rockwell, principally
debt, and the issuance of $09 billion of Boeing stock to Rockwell shareowners
in exchange for their interest in the A Business.
On September 30, 1997 the Company completed the spin-off of its automotive
component systems businesses into an independent, separately traded, publicly
held company by distributing all of the issued and outstanding shares of Meritor
Automotive, Inc. Meritor to the Company shareowners on the basis of one
share of Meritor Common Stock for every three shares of Company Common Stock
owned. In connection with the spin-off, Meritor made a special payment of $445
million to the Company.
Except as indicated, amounts reflected in the financial statements or
disclosed in the notes to financial statements relate to the Company
continuing operations and prior year amounts have been reclassified to conform
with the current presentation. See Note 3 for a discussion of the Company
discontinued operations.
2. ACCOUNTING POLICIES
Consolidation
The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company
and those majority-owned subsidiaries in which the Company has control. All
significant intercompany accounts and transactions are eliminated in
consolidation.
Use of Estimates
The financial statements have been prepared in accordance with generally
accepted accounting principles which require management to make estimates and
assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements. Actual
results could differ from those estimates.
Inventories
Inventories are stated at the lower of cost using LIFO, FIFO, or average
methods or market determined on the basis of estimated realizable values.
Property
Property is stated at cost. Depreciation of property is provided based on
estimated useful lives generally using accelerated and straight-line methods.
Significant renewals and betterments are capitalized and replaced units are
written off. Maintenance and repairs, as well as renewals of minor amount, are
charged to expense.
Purchased Intangibles
Goodwill and other intangible assets generally result from business
acquisitions. The Company accounts for business acquisitions by assigning the
purchase price to tangible and intangible assets and liabilities, including
research and development projects which have not yet reached technological
feasibility and have no alternative future use purchased research and
development. Assets acquired and liabilities assumed are recorded at their fair
values; the appraised value of purchased research and development is immediately
charged to expense, and the excess of the purchase price over the amounts
assigned is recorded as goodwill.
22
23
Goodwill is amortized by the straight-line method over periods generally
ranging from 10 to 40 years. Trademarks, patents, product technology, and other
intangibles are amortized on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful
lives, ranging from 5 to 40 years.
Impairment of Long-Lived Assets
Long-lived assets are reviewed for impairment by assessing their net
realizable values based on undiscounted cash flows over remaining useful lives.
If impairment is indicated, the carrying amount of the asset is reduced to its
fair value.
Revenue Recognition
Sales are generally recorded as products are shipped or services are
rendered, except sales under certain contracts requiring performance over
several periods which are accounted for under the percentage-of-completion
method of accounting.
Environmental Matters
The Company records accruals for environmental matters in the accounting
period in which its responsibility is established and the cost can be reasonably
estimated. At environmental sites in which more than one potentially responsible
party has been identified, the Company records a liability for its estimated
allocable share of costs related to its involvement with the site as well as an
estimated allocable share of costs related to insolvent parties or unidentified
shares. At environmental sites in which the Company is the only responsible
party, the Company records a liability for the total estimated costs of
remediation before consideration of recovery from insurers or other third
parties. If recovery from a third party is determined to be probable, the
Company records a receivable for the estimated recovery.
Earnings Per Share
Earnings per share are based on the weighted average number of common
shares outstanding during each year. The computation does not include the
negligible dilutive effect of stock options.
New Accounting Standards
In October 1996, the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants
issued Statement of Position No. 96-1, Environmental Remediation Liabilities,
which is effective for 1998. The Company does not expect adoption of this
standard to have a material effect on the financial statements.
In February 1997, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Statement
of Financial Accounting Standards SFAS No. 128, Earnings per Share, which is
effective for 1998. The adoption of this standard will not have a material
effect on the financial statements.
3. DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS
The financial statements have been restated to classify the Company
Automotive Business which includes Meritor and a discontinued product line as
a discontinued operation, together with the A Business and Graphic Systems
business, which had previously been reported as discontinued operations, for all
23
24
periods presented. The assets and liabilities of these businesses as of
September 30, 1996, consisted of the following in millions:
AUTOMOTIVE   A    GRAPHIC
BUSINESS   BUSINESS  SYSTEMS
$ 478   $  738   $ 169

Short-term      27      565     Accounts payable and other     725      782    283
Long-term      5     1,597     Accrued retirement     332     1,469    11
Total    1,089     4,413    294
Net assets liabilities of discontinued businesses.   $ 612   $ 1,309  $ 560
The net assets of Meritor as of the September 30, 1997 spin-off date of
$151 million including $445 million of debt incurred to make the special
payment to Rockwell were recorded as a decrease to equity.
Pursuant to the Reorganization, in addition to the A Business, Boeing
acquired certain Rockwell corporate property and pension plan assets and
liabilities relating to former employees of non-A businesses. Boeing also
assumed $22 billion of the short- and long-term domestic borrowings of the
Company. Accordingly, these amounts have been presented on the balance sheet as
net liabilities of the A Business at September 30, 1996. In connection with
the Reorganization, all shares of Common Stock held in treasury were canceled
and the net liabilities of the A Business at the date of the Reorganization of
approximately $12 billion were recorded as an increase to additional paid-in
capital.
In October 1996, the Graphic Systems business was sold to an affiliate of
Stonington Partners, Inc. for approximately $600 million.
Summarized results of discontinued operations are as follows in millions:
YEAR ENDED SEPTEMBER 30,
1997   1996   1995
Revenues:
Automotive   $3,342  $3,221  $3,153
A    535   3,089   3,244
Graphic     --    712    717
$3,877  $7,022  $7,114
Income before income taxes:
Automotive   $ 121  $ 166  $ 188
A     --    311    353
Graphic     --     8    62
$ 121  $ 485  $ 603
Net income loss:
Automotive   $  58  $ 104  $ 125
A     --    178    212
Graphic     --    7    37
$  58  $ 275  $ 374
24
25
The earnings of the A Business for the first two months of 1997 were
entirely offset by expenses related to the transaction.
The 1997 and 1996 income of the Automotive Business includes restructuring
charges of $21 million $15 million after-tax and $46 million $30 million
after-tax, respectively. The income of the Automotive Business for 1997 also
includes a charge of $57 million $48 million after-tax for transaction and
separation-related costs incurred in connection with the spin-off of Meritor.
The 1996 net loss of Graphic Systems includes net income from operations of
$3 million offset by a provision for loss on the sale of $10 million.
The Automotive, A and Graphic Systems businesses utilized certain
services which are provided for all of the Company businesses on a centralized
basis, including payroll administration, data processing, and telecommunications
services. These businesses were also allocated costs of centrally administered
programs, including employee medical claims and property and casualty insurance.
These costs were charged to these businesses based on actual usage of these
services and programs and were $58 million, $132 million, and $177 million in
1997, 1996, and 1995, respectively.
These businesses also received other services provided by the Company,
including financial, legal, tax, corporate communications, and human resources.
For the A Business, the costs of these services are allowable overhead costs
on government contracts and, accordingly, have been included in the results of
operations of this business. These costs have been allocated to the A Business
using a variety of factors, including sales, assets, inventory, and payroll and
were $3 million, $35 million, and $32 million in 1997, 1996, and 1995,
respectively. Management believes that the methods of allocating costs to these
businesses are reasonable.
Interest expense of $40 million, $169 million and $155 million in 1997,
1996 and 1995, respectively, has been allocated to the Automotive and A
businesses based on the actual interest expense associated with the borrowings
assumed by Meritor and Boeing, respectively.
4. RESTRUCTURING
During 1996, the Company recorded restructuring charges of $76 million $47
million after-tax, or 22 cents per share. The restructuring charges relate to a
decision to exit non-strategic product lines of continuing operations, as well
as the costs associated with staff reductions in the Automation and Avionics &
Communications businesses.
The provision includes asset impairments of $51 million, severance and
other employee costs of $9 million, and contractual commitments and other costs
of $16 million. These actions were substantially completed by the end of 1997.
5. ACQUISITIONS OF BUSINESSES
The Company acquired several businesses in 1997 at a net cost of $115
million, including $53 million $42 million after-tax related to purchased
research and development.
In September 1996, the Company acquired Brooktree Corporation Brooktree,
a designer and manufacturer of digital and mixed-signal integrated circuits for
computer graphics, multimedia, imaging, and communications applications, for
$278 million, including $121 million for purchased research and development.
Pro forma information for acquisitions in 1997 and 1996 is not presented as
the results of operations of these businesses were not material in relation to
the Company income from continuing operations for these periods.
In January 1995, the Company completed its acquisition of Reliance Electric
Company Reliance, a major manufacturer of industrial products and
telecommunications equipment, for $1,066 million, net of proceeds from the sale
of Reliance telecommunications business. If Reliance had been acquired as of
the
25
26
beginning of 1995, pro forma revenues, net income and earnings per share for
that year would have been $6,314 million, $742 million, and $342, respectively.
These acquisitions were accounted for as purchases and, accordingly, the
results of operations of these businesses have been included in the statement of
income since their dates of acquisition.
6. INVENTORIES

11. FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS
The Company financial instruments include cash, equity securities,
short-and long-term debt, and foreign currency forward exchange contracts. At
September 30, 1997, the carrying values of the Company financial instruments
approximated their fair values based on current market prices and rates.
It is the policy of the Company not to enter into derivative financial
instruments for speculative purposes. The Company does enter into foreign
currency forward exchange contracts to protect itself from adverse currency rate
fluctuations on foreign currency commitments entered into in the ordinary course
of business. These commitments are generally for terms of less than one year.
The gains and losses relating to these foreign currency forward exchange
contracts are deferred and included in the measurement of the foreign currency
transaction subject to the hedge. The amount of any deferred gain or loss on
these contracts is immaterial.
The foreign currency forward exchange contracts are executed with
creditworthy banks and are denominated in currencies of major industrial
countries. The notional amount of all of the Company outstanding foreign
currency forward exchange contracts aggregated $239 million and $919 million at
September 30, 1997 and 1996, respectively. The contracts outstanding at
September 30, 1996 included contracts relating to the Company discontinued
operations. The Company does not anticipate any material adverse effect on its
results of operations or financial position relating to these foreign currency
forward exchange contracts.
12. CAPITAL STOCK
At September 30, 1997, the authorized stock of the Company consisted of one
billion shares of Common Stock, with a $1 par value, and 25 million shares of
preferred stock, without par value. At September 30, 1997, 25 million shares of
Common Stock were reserved for various employee incentive plans. On February 23,
1997, all outstanding shares of Class A Common Stock were converted into Common
Stock.

Preferred Share Purchase Rights
Each outstanding share of Common Stock provides the holder with one
Preferred Share Purchase Right Right. The Rights will become exercisable only
if a person or group acquires, or offers to acquire, 20% or more of the Common
Stock, although the Company is authorized to reduce the 20% threshold for
triggering the Rights to not less than 10%. Upon exercise, each Right entitles
the holder to 1/100th of a share of Series A Junior Participating Preferred
Stock of the Company Junior Preferred Stock at a price of $250, subject to
adjustment.
Upon an acquisition of the Company, each Right other than Rights held by
the acquiror will generally be exercisable for $500 worth of Common Stock or
common stock of the acquiror for $250. In certain circumstances, each Right may
be exchanged by the Company for one share of Common Stock or 1/100th of a share
of Junior Preferred Stock. The Rights will expire on December 6, 2006, unless
earlier exchanged or redeemed at $001 per Right.
13. STOCK OPTIONS
Options to purchase Common Stock of the Company have been granted under
various incentive plans to directors, officers and other key employees at prices
equal to or above the fair market value of such stock on the dates the options
were granted. The plans provide that the option price for certain options
granted under the plans may be paid in cash, the Company Common Stock, or a
combination thereof.
Under the 1995 Long-Term Incentives Plan, the Company may grant up to 16
million shares of Company Common Stock as non-qualified options, incentive stock
options, stock appreciation rights and restricted stock. Shares available for
future grant or payment under various incentive plans were 13 million at
September 30, 1997. Stock options expire ten years from the date they are
granted and have vesting periods which range from one to three years. None of
the incentive plans presently permits options to be granted after September 30,
2005.

In connection with the divestiture of the A Business and the spin-off of
Meritor, the number of options outstanding and the exercise prices of such
options were adjusted in order to preserve the value of the options that existed
as of the date of each divestiture. Additionally, in connection with the Meritor
spin-off, Rockwell options granted to Meritor employees during 1997 were
converted into Meritor options.

In 1997, the Company adopted the disclosure-only provisions of SFAS No.
123, Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation. Accordingly, no compensation
expense has been recorded relative to the Company stock-based compensation
plans. If the Company accounted for its stock-based plans using the fair value
method provided by SFAS No. 123, the Company net income and earnings per share
would have been reduced to the following pro forma amounts in millions, except
per share amounts:

The pro forma effect on net income for 1997 may not be indicative of the
pro forma effect on net income of future years.
The weighted average fair value of options granted was $1538 and $1283
per share in 1997 and 1996, respectively. The fair value of each option was
estimated on the date of grant or subsequent date of option adjustment using the
Black-Scholes pricing model and the following assumptions:

14. RETIREMENT MEDICAL PLANS
The Company has retirement medical plans which cover most of its United
States employees and provide for the payment of medical costs of eligible
employees and dependents upon retirement.
Retirement medical expense for continuing operations consisted of the
following in millions:
1997  1996  1995
Service cost--benefits attributed to service during the year.  $ 8   $ 8  $ 7
Interest accrued on accumulated retirement medical obligation.  50    48   45
Amortization of plan amendments and net actuarial gains and losses.  8   12  15
Retirement medical   $50   $ 44  $ 37
The Company retirement medical obligation at September 30, 1997 and 1996
consisted of the following in millions:
1997   1996
Accumulated retirement medical obligation:
$499   $466
Employees eligible to    62    70
Employees not eligible to    132   119

Assumptions used June 30 measurement date:
Discount    75%  775%
Health care cost trend    80%*  80 
* Decreasing to 55% after 2015.
Increasing the health care cost trend rates by one percentage point would
increase the accumulated retirement medical obligation at September 30, 1997 by
approximately $57 million and would increase retirement medical expense by
approximately $6 million.
15. RETIREMENT PENSION PLANS
The Company has pension plans which cover most of its employees and provide
for monthly pension payments to eligible employees upon retirement. Pension
benefits for salaried employees generally are based on years of credited service
and average earnings. Pension benefits for hourly employees generally are based
on specified benefit amounts and years of service. The Company policy is to
fund its pension obligations in conformity with the funding requirements of
applicable laws and governmental regulations.
Net pension expense for continuing operations consisted of the following
in millions:
1997   1996   1995
Service cost--benefits earned during the year.  $ 65  $ 64  $ 51
Interest accrued on projected benefit    139   215   202
Assumed return on plan   157  228  211

Net actuarial loss     5    26    12
Net pension   $ 50  $ 63  $ 39

Pension plan assets are primarily equity securities, United States
Government obligations, and other fixed income investments whose values are
subject to fluctuations of the securities market. The actual return on plan
assets allocated to continuing operations was $373 million, $514 million, and
$421 million in 1997, 1996, and 1995, respectively. Differences between these
actual returns and the related assumed returns on plan assets are deferred and
considered in the determination of net pension income or expense in future
periods.
Prior to the Reorganization, pension plan obligations attributable to
United States active employees of continuing businesses and the Automotive and
Graphic Systems businesses as of January 1, 1996, and a proportionate share of
pension plan assets, were transferred from the Company United States pension
plan to a newly-established pension plan. Pension plan assets and obligations
related to employees of the A Business and all retirees of the Company
United States pension plan prior to January 1, 1996 were transferred as part of
the A Business pursuant to the merger agreement with Boeing.
The following table reconciles the funded status of the Company
overfunded pension plans to amounts included in Other Assets in the balance
sheet in millions:
1997   1996

The Company also sponsors certain defined contribution savings plans for
eligible employees. Expense related to these plans was $50 million, $47 million,
and $35 million for 1997, 1996, and 1995, respectively.

16. INCOME TAXES
The components of the provision for income taxes are as follows in
millions:
1997  1996  1995
Current:
United   $258  $329  $175
Research and experimentation    --   65       40   54   34

Provision for income   $337  $279  $255
During 1996 the Company reached an agreement with the Internal Revenue
Service on its research and experimentation tax credit refund claim related to
certain prior years and recorded $65 million as a reduction of its provision for
income taxes.
Net deferred income tax benefits included in the balance sheet at September
30, 1997 and 1996 consist of the tax effects of temporary differences related to
the following in millions:
1997   1996
Accrued compensation and   $ 97  $ 79

Long-term deferred income   $ 19  $ 63
Management believes it is more likely than not that current and long-term
tax assets will be realized through the reduction of future taxable income.
Significant factors considered by management in its determination of the
probability of the realization of the deferred tax assets included: a the
historical operating results of the Company $17 billion of United States
income from continuing operations before income taxes over the past three
years, b expectations of future earnings, and c the extended period of time
over which the retirement medical liability will be paid. The valuation
allowance represents the amount
32
33
of tax benefits related to net operating loss, capital loss and foreign tax
credit carryforwards that have not yet been recognized. The carryforward period
for net operating and capital losses expires between 1998 and 2004. The
carryforward period for foreign tax credits expires between 1998 and 2002.
The consolidated effective tax rate was different from the United States
statutory rate for the reasons set forth below:
1997   1996   1995
Statutory tax   350%  350%  350%
State and local income   34   40   34
Foreign income   02   15   30
Non-deductible   13   16   26
Purchased research and   09   58    Foreign sales corporation   24  26  31
Utilization of foreign loss   07  10  08
Tax   13  89  02
01   28   10
Effective tax   365%  382%  409%
The income tax provisions were calculated based upon the following
components of income from continuing operations before income taxes in
millions:
1997  1996  1995
United States   $733  $518  $469
Foreign   190   212   154
$923  $730  $623
No provision has been made for United States, state, or additional foreign
income taxes related to approximately $130 million of undistributed earnings of
foreign subsidiaries which have been or are intended to be permanently
reinvested.
The audit of the Company United States income tax returns for the years
1989 through 1991 has been completed. The Company United States income tax
returns for the years 1992 through 1994 are currently under examination. In
connection with the divestiture of the A Business and the Meritor spin-off,
the Company has retained all tax liabilities and the right to all tax refunds
related to United States and certain non-U.S. operations of the A and
Automotive businesses for periods prior to the respective divestiture dates.
Management believes that adequate provision for income taxes has been made for
all years through 1997.

1995, respectively, and are included in the determination of the cash flows of
discontinued operations.
Minimum future rental commitments under operating leases having
noncancelable lease terms in excess of one year aggregated $236 million as of
September 30, 1997 and are payable as follows in millions: 1998, $62; 1999 50; 2000, $34; 2001, $24; 2002, $18; and after 2002, $48.
18. CONTINGENT LIABILITIES
Claims have been asserted against the Company for utilizing the
intellectual property rights of others in certain of the Company products. The
resolution of these matters may result in the negotiation of a license
agreement, a settlement or the resolution of such claims through arbitration or
litigation. The Company accrues the estimated cost of the ultimate resolution of
these matters. Management believes that the resolution of these matters will not
have a material adverse effect on the Company financial statements.
Various other lawsuits, claims and proceedings have been or may be
instituted or asserted against the Company relating to the conduct of its
business, including those pertaining to product liability, safety and health,
environmental, and employment matters. Pursuant to the Reorganization, Rockwell
has agreed to indemnify Boeing for certain government contract and environmental
matters related to operations of the A Business for periods prior to the
merger. In connection with the spin-off, Meritor has agreed to indemnify the
Company for substantially all contingent liabilities related to the Automotive
Business. Although the outcome of litigation cannot be predicted with certainty
and some lawsuits, claims, or proceedings may be disposed of unfavorably to the
Company, management believes the disposition of matters which are pending or
asserted will not have a material adverse effect on the Company financial
statements.
