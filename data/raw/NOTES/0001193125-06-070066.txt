REPORT OF ERNST YOUNG LLP, INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM The Board of Directors and Stockholders
Radiologix, Inc. We have audited the accompanying
consolidated balance sheets of Radiologix, Inc. as of December31, 2005 and 2004 and the related consolidated statements of operations, stockholders equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December31,
2005. Our audits also included the financial statement schedule listed in the Index at a. These consolidated financial statements and schedule are the responsibility of management of Radiologix, Inc. the Company. Our
responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements and schedule based on our audits. We conducted our audits in accordance with the
standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board United States. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit
includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the
overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. In our opinion, the financial statements
referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated financial position of Radiologix, Inc. at December31, 2005 and 2004, and the consolidated results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three years
in the period ended December31, 2005, in conformity with U. S. generally accepted accounting principles. Also, in our opinion, the related financial statement schedule, when considered in relation to the basic consolidated financial statements
taken as a whole, presents fairly, in all material respects, the information set forth therein. The consolidated financial statements as of
December31, 2004 and for the year then ended have been restated as discussed in Note 3. We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of
the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board United States, the effectiveness of Radiologix, Inc.s internal control over financial reporting as of December31, 2005, based on criteria established in Internal Control-Integrated
Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission and our report dated March8, 2006, expressed an unqualified opinion on managements assessment and an adverse opinion on the effectiveness of
internal control over financial reporting.  Ernst Young LLP

REPORT OF ERNST YOUNG LLP, INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM The Board of Directors and Shareholders Radiologix, Inc. We have audited managements assessment, included in the accompanying Managements Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting, that Radiologix, Inc.
did not maintain effective internal control over financial reporting as of December31, 2005, because of the effect of a material weakness in Radiologix, Inc.s procedures for accounting for lease terminations, based on criteria
established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission the COSO criteria. Radiologix, Inc.s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control
over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on managements assessment and an opinion on the effectiveness of the companys
internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting
Oversight Board United States. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included
obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, evaluating managements assessment, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control, and performing such other procedures as we
considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion. A companys internal control over
financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.
A companys internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that 1pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the
assets of the company; 2provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of
the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and 3provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the
companys assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial
reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance
with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. A material weakness is a control deficiency, or combination of control deficiencies, that results in more
than a remote likelihood that a material misstatement of the annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected. The following material weakness has been identified and included in managements assessment: in its
assessment, management identified as a material weakness inadequate controls over accounting for leases. These procedures are used to determine the appropriate accounting for lease transactions, including termination of leases. The effect of this
was the capitalization, in error, of $139 million of intangible assets related to a lease termination. Consequently, the Company has restated its 2004 financial statements in this Form 10-K and recorded and expensed the $139 million as a lease
termination expense. This material weakness was considered in determining the nature, timing, and extent of audit tests applied in our audit of the 2005
financial statements, and this report does not affect our report dated March8, 2006 on those financial statements. In our opinion, managements
assessment that Radiologix, Inc. did not maintain effective internal control over financial reporting as of December31, 2005, is fairly stated, in all material respects, based on the COSO control criteria. Also, in our opinion, because of the
effect of the material weakness described above on the achievement of the objectives of the control criteria, Radiologix, Inc. has not maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of December31, 2005, based on the COSO
control criteria.  Ernst Young LLP

RADIOLOGIX, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS DECEMBER 31, 2005, 2004 AND 2003 NOTE 1.
DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS Radiologix, Inc. together with its subsidiaries, Radiologix or the Company, a
Delaware corporation, is a leading national provider of diagnostic imaging services through its ownership and operation of free-standing, outpatient diagnostic imaging centers. Radiologix utilizes sophisticated technology and technical expertise to perform a broad range of imaging procedures, such as magnetic resonance imaging
MRI, computed tomography CT, position emission tomography PET, nuclear medicine, ultrasound, mammography, bone densitometry DEXA, general radiology X-ray and fluoroscopy. As of December31, 2005, we owned, operated or maintained,
through our two operating segments, an ownership interest in imaging equipment at 71 locations with imaging centers located in 7 states, including primary operations in the Mid-Atlantic; the Bay Area, California; Treasure Coast, Florida; Northeast
Kansas; and the Finger Lakes Rochester and Hudson Valley markets in New York state; and Questar operations with imaging centers located in California, Colorado and Minnesota. We offer multi-modality imaging services at 52 of our diagnostic imaging
centers, which provide patients and referring physicians access to advanced diagnostic imaging services in one convenient location. We
also provide administrative, management and information services to certain radiology practices that provide professional services in connection with our diagnostic imaging centers and to hospitals and radiology practices with which we operate joint
ventures. The services we provide leverage our existing infrastructure and, we believe, improve the profitability, efficiency and effectiveness of the radiology practice or joint venture. Our results may be impacted by variability due to changes in modality mix and the volume of procedures performed, physician referral and vacation
patterns, the impact of hospital and physician-affiliated imaging centers that compete in our primary and Questar operations, the timing and negotiation of managed care and service contracts, the availability of technologists and other personnel
resources, and trends in receivable collectibility. We are impacted by seasonality in that referring physicians and technologists often schedule vacations in the summer months which typically results in a decline in our volumes and service fee
revenue while increasing costs of services as we contract for the services of temporary technologists at higher rates. NOTE 2. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT
ACCOUNTING POLICIES Basis of Presentation The consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America and include the accounts of the Company and its wholly owned and majority owned
subsidiaries. All significant intercompany transactions have been eliminated. Investments in entities that the Company does not control, but in which it has a substantial ownership interest and can exercise significant influence, are accounted for
using the equity method. Use of Estimates in the Preparation of Financial Statements The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to
make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, results of operations and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and
expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. Cash and Cash Equivalents We consider all highly liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less to be cash equivalents. Property and Equipment Property and equipment are
stated at cost, net of accumulated depreciation and amortization. Property and equipment are depreciated using the straight-line method over their estimated useful life. Amortization of assets under capital leases is included in depreciation and
amortization. 
53 Table of Contents
Index to Financial Statements
Goodwill, Intangible and Long-lived Assets The value of goodwill and intangible assets is stated at the lower of cost or fair value. Goodwill is not subject to amortization; however it is subject
to periodic valuation assessments. Under the provisions of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, the Company is required to perform at least an annual impairment test and to consider other
indicators that may arise throughout the year to reevaluate carrying value. To the extent book value exceeds fair value, at the date an impairment is determined, the Company reduces goodwill by recording a charge to operations. We perform our annual
impairment test in the first quarter of each fiscal year. Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No144, Accounting for the
Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets SFAS No144, requires impairment losses to be recognized for long-lived assets through operations when indicators of impairment exist and the underlying cash flows are not sufficient to
support the assets carrying value. In addition, SFAS No144 requires that a long-lived asset disposal group to be sold that meets certain recognition criteria be classified as held for sale and measured at the lower of
carrying amount or fair value less cost to sell. SFAS No144 also requires that a long-lived asset subject to closure abandonment before the end of its previously estimated useful life continue to be classified as held and used
until disposal, with depreciation estimates revised to reflect the use of the asset over its shortened useful life. In addition to the
annual impairment test we perform with respect to goodwill, we regularly evaluate the carrying value of goodwill, intangible and long-lived assets for events or changes in circumstances that indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable
or that the remaining estimated useful life should be changed. Potential indicators of impairment can include, but are not limited to 1history of operating losses or expected future losses; 2significant adverse change in legal
factors; 3changes in the extent or manner in which the assets are used; 4current expectations to dispose of the assets by sale or other means and 5reductions or expected reductions of cash flow. In the event that we determine
there is an indication of impairment, we compare undiscounted net cash flows to the carrying value of the respective asset. If the carrying value exceeds the undiscounted net cash flows, we perform an impairment calculation using discounted cash
flows, valuation analysis from independent valuation specialists or comparisons to recent sales or purchase transactions to determine estimated fair value. Deferred Financing Costs Deferred financing costs are amortized on a straight-line method, which approximates the effective
interest method. As of December31, 2005 and 2004, accumulated amortization of deferred financing costs was approximately $67 million and $51 million, respectively. Accrued Physician Retention Accrued physician retention represents amounts payable to contracted
radiology practices under the management services agreements. The service agreements require Radiologix to remit physician retention to the contracted radiology practices by the end of the month after the month in which services were rendered.
Revenue Recognition Service fee
revenue from contracted radiology practice groups professional revenue component and diagnostic imaging centers technical revenue component is recorded when services are rendered by the contracted radiology practices and diagnostic imaging
centers based on established gross charges billed and reduced by estimated contractual adjustments and amounts retained by the contracted radiology practice groups under the terms of management services agreements. Our patient accounting system
currently does not record contractual adjustments at the time of billing. Instead, contractual adjustments and the provision for doubtful accounts are estimated based on historical collection experience using a retrospective collection analysis,
which we began using in December 2004, payment-versus-charge schedules and aging models. Should circumstances change shift in payor mix, decline in economic conditions or deterioration in aging of patient receivables, our estimates of the net
realizable value of patient receivables could be reduced by a material amount. We have estimated that a change in our collection percentage of 10% could result in a change in service fee revenue of $52 million per year.

Revenue Presentation The Financial Accounting Standards Boards Emerging Issues Task Force issued its abstract, Issue 97-2, Application of FASB Statement No94 and APB Opinion No16 to Physicians Practice Management
Entities and Certain Other Entities with Contractual Arrangements EITF 97-2. Since Radiologix has not established a controlling financial interest under EITF 97-2, Radiologix does not consolidate the contracted radiology
practices. Income Taxes We account
for income taxes under the asset and liability method. This approach requires the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the carrying amounts and the tax bases of
assets and liabilities. Developing our provision for income taxes, including our effective tax rate, and analysis of potential tax
exposure items, if any, requires significant judgment and expertise in federal and state income tax laws, regulations and strategies, including the determination of deferred tax assets and liabilities and, any estimated valuation allowances we deem
necessary to value deferred tax assets. Our judgments and tax strategies are subject to audit by various taxing authorities. While we believe we have provided adequately for our income taxes in our consolidated financial statements, adverse
determinations by these taxing authorities could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. Fair Value of Financial Instruments Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No107, Disclosure About Fair
Value of Financial Instruments, requires disclosure about the fair value of certain financial instruments. The carrying amounts of cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, accounts payable and accrued expenses approximate fair value due
to the short maturity of these instruments. The estimates of fair value are based upon the quoted market prices for the same or similar issues of long term-debt with the same maturities, when available, or discounted cash flows. Concentration of Credit Risk The Companys
accounts receivable consist primarily of service fee revenue generated by radiology practices and imaging centers for services performed, that are immediately purchased by us and ultimately due from Medicare, Medicaid, managed care and private and
other payors. The Company estimates that approximately 29%, 29% and 28% of these revenues in 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively, were funded through the Medicare and Medicaid programs. The Company and its contracted radiology practices perform
ongoing credit evaluations of their patients and generally do not require collateral. The Company and its contracted radiology practices maintain estimated allowances for potential credit losses. Stock-Based Awards The Company currently accounts
for its employee stock-based compensation arrangements using the intrinsic-value method pursuant to the provisions of Accounting Principles Board Opinion No25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees APB 25. Accordingly,
because stock options are issued at fair value at the date of grant we do not recognize compensation expense for our stock option grants. In December 2002, the Financial Accounting Standards Board FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No148, Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation Transition and Disclosure SFAS
No148. SFAS No148 provides companies alternative methods of transitioning to Statement of Accounting Standards No123 Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation SFAS No123, which promulgates a fair value method
of accounting for stock-based employee compensation. It also requires certain disclosure in both annual and quarterly financial statements about the method of accounting for stock-based employee compensation and the effect of the method used on
reported results. SFAS No148 does not mandate fair value accounting for stock-based employee compensation, but does require all companies to meet the disclosure requirements. On December16, 2004, the FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No123 revised 2004, Share-Based Payment,
which is a revision of Statement No123. Statement 123R supersedes APB 25, and amends Statement No95, Statement of Cash Flows. Generally, the approach in Statement 123R is similar to the approach described in Statement
123. However, Statement 123R requires all share-based payments to employees, including grants of employee stock options, to be recognized in the income statement based on their fair values. Pro forma disclosure is no longer an alternative.
55 Table of Contents
Index to Financial Statements
Pursuant to an SEC Amendment to Regulation S-X effective April21, 2005, a revised date for adopting
SFAS 123R is now the first interim reporting period of a registrants first fiscal year beginning on or after June15, 2005. As a result, the Company adopted SFAS 123R on January1, 2006 using the modified-prospective method.
The modified prospective method provides for the recognition of compensation cost beginning with the effective date
abased on the requirements of Statement 123R for all share-based payments granted after the effective date and bbased on the requirements of Statement 123 for all awards granted to employees prior to the effective date of Statement
123R that remain unvested on the effective date. The Company has estimated the charge to operating expenses resulting from this adoption to be approximately $14 million in 2006. NOTE 3. RESTATEMENT OF FINANCIAL STATEMENTS In reviewing the PresGar equipment lease contract
acquired on October31, 2004, see Note 4, the Company has determined that its original accounting treatment of capitalizing the $139 million lease termination costs was incorrect and in fact should have been expensed. Accordingly, the Company
has restated its financial statements for the year ended December31, 2004 to increase operating expense and decrease intangible assets, net. The Company has also restated its financial statements for each of the three quarters ended
March31,June30, and September30 of 2005 to decrease depreciation and amortization expense and decrease intangible assets, net. See Note 22 for more details. We did not record a tax benefit for the $139 million lease termination costs since we determined that a valuation allowance was necessary due to the
fact that we have had losses for the previous three years and the realization of additional deferred tax assets is questionable. We have
also reclassified certain previously reported amounts for all periods presented, including 1amortization of deferred financing costs from Depreciation and Amortization expense to Interest Expense, net, on our consolidated statement of
operations, 2notes receivable from non-consolidated affiliates from Other Current Assets to Due from Affiliates on our consolidated balance sheets, 3stock option exercise proceeds from Other Items in net cash used in financing
activities to Proceeds from Exercise of Stock Options in the same section of our consolidated statement of cash flows, 4restricted stock expense from Other Items in net cash from financing activities to Restricted Stock Expense in net cash
provided by operating activities in our consolidated statement of cash flows, 5Distributions from joint ventures and distributions to minority interests in consolidated subsidiaries have been reclassified from net cash used in investing
activities to net cash from operating activities in the consolidated statement of cash flows, 6certain balances in the Consolidating Balance Sheets and the Consolidating Statements of Operations in Note 21, Supplemental Guarantor
Information, have been revised; these revisions primarily consist of separate reporting of investments in subsidiaries and intercompany receivables/payables in the Consolidating Balance Sheets and separate reporting of equity in income of wholly
owned subsidiaries in the Consolidating Statements of Operations, 7certain changes were made to our calculation of deferred tax assets and liabilities that affect both our consolidated balance sheet for the year ended December31, 2004
and Note 15, Income Taxes, resulting from amendments to our income tax filings for certain prior years that were completed during 2005, and 8supply cost rebate from Unallocated Amounts in the Segment to Consolidated Operating Result
reconciliation table to Total Costs and Expenses of Primary Operations in the summary table of Segment Operating Results in Note 20, Segment Reporting.

NOTE 4. LEASE TERMINATION EXPENSE Effective October31, 2004, we entered into a definitive agreement for $155 million in cash for the following:  the purchase of four MRI systems and the assumption of an operating lease for one additional MRI system; and  an equipment lease contract that was entered into prior to the formation of Radiologix by the Ide Group, P.C. Ide. This lease was terminated. 
The four MRI systems were recorded in the financial statements at their fair market value of $16 million. The remaining $139 million was expensed as a lease
termination charge to operating expense. The equipment lease contract was originally sold by Ide in 1990 to MICA Imaging, Inc., a
predecessor of PresGar Companies, LLC. Ide is a non-affiliated radiology practice that entered into a Medical Services Agreement MSA with the Company in 1997 when Radiologix was formed. As a condition of entering into the MSA, the
Company assumed the obligation under the equipment lease contract that PresGar had entered into with Ide in 1990. The acquisition of the equipment lease contract increased both the profitability and value of the Ide MSA. Under this equipment lease contract, PresGar had acquired a long-term perpetual right to provide certain MRI systems and the obligation to service the
equipment and replace that equipment as it became obsolete to the Company as successor to Ide and to charge the Company usage-based rent on these pieces of equipment. The acquisition of the equipment lease contract eliminates expenses that
previously varied based on volume resulting in incremental reductions in equipment lease expense as volume increased. If this transaction had been effective on January1, 2004 instead of October31, 2004, we estimate that cost of services
would have increased by $500,000, equipment lease expense would have decreased by $45 million, and pre-tax loss would have decreased by $40 million for the year ended December31, 2004. NOTE 5. GOODWILL AND INTANGIBLE ASSETS A summary of

NOTE 6. IMPAIRMENT OF GOODWILL, INTANGIBLE AND LONG-LIVED ASSETS Impairment - Management Services Agreement During the
third quarter of 2004, management determined that the ability of one of the radiology groups to perform in accordance with a management services agreement administered by one of our Mid-Atlantic subsidiaries had diminished significantly. With
several owned imaging centers covered by the management services agreement operating at financial losses, deteriorating financial conditions at hospitals involving professional reading arrangements, and the resignation from the practice of two
physician leaders, management concluded that the value of intangible asset related to this management services agreement had become significantly impaired. As a result, Radiologix and the radiology group terminated the management services agreement on January31, 2005. The Company decided to dispose of three unprofitable imaging centers and to transfer the
professional reading responsibility for certain other centers to another radiology group that operates under a management services agreement with us in the Mid-Atlantic market. Based on our assessment and the actions that we have undertaken, the Company recorded 2004 third quarter impairment charges of: $65 million to write-off
the unamortized portion of intangible assets related to this groups management services agreement, and $800,000 to write-off long-lived assets related to the centers planned for disposition, all of which were disposed of at December31,
2005. Service fee revenue and pre-tax income loss for the two centers disposed of in 2005, and the professional reading arrangements
that we no longer are a party to, as reflected in continuing operations including impairment charges, are as follows in thousands:  For the Year Ended December 31 2005

Service fee revenue 968 5,910 5,890 Pre-tax income loss 417 5,871 2,312 Impairments Questar Subsidiary In December 2005, we recorded a $22 million pre-tax impairment charge to continuing operations to write-off the remaining goodwill related to our Questar
centers in California, Colorado and Minnesota. These centers are three of five Questar sites that remained in continuing operations at December31, 2005. Increased competition in these markets has eroded the profitability of these centers. The
increased competition throughout 2005 coupled with managements decision to not invest in new equipment or invest in new imaging centers in these markets has reduced the future expectations for these centers, thus lowering their value.
In December 2004, we recorded an impairment charge of $11 million to reduce goodwill related to our Questar center in Arizona. This
center was one of six Questar sites that remained in continuing operations at December31, 2004. We did not anticipate this impairment previously as the center is in a strategic location and was projected to improve in volumes, revenues and
cash flows in the fourth quarter of 2004 and throughout 2005. However, it appears that because of disruption caused by the move to this new location, confusion in the community due to a change in the centers name, and increased local
competition, we had difficulty in achieving the volumes, profitability and cash flow levels that we expected in the fourth quarter of 2004 and budgeted for in 2005. Accordingly, we closed this center in 2005 after exhaustive attempts to engineer a
turnaround in its operations. In June 2004, after performing an extensive assessment of our Questar imaging center portfolio, management
concluded that seven centers were not strategic to our future plans and would be unable to meet and sustain our profitability requirements going forward. That assessment considered the following: location, contracting leverage, expected capital
requirements, the single modality nature of most of these centers, current operating trends, and the sale of our most profitable Questar center on June21, 2004. The Companys decision to dispose of these seven imaging centers created an event that required us to reassess the carrying value of the assets related to these centers, including goodwill at our Questar segment.
This reassessment considered the impact on the value of the ongoing, deteriorating operating trends in these centers, as well as the implications of disposing of individual centers versus operating those centers as part of an ongoing operating
enterprise.

Index to Financial Statements
To assist us in that reassessment, we engaged an independent valuation firm to estimate the fair value of
our combined Questar sites. The valuation performed by this firm was based on a blending of: 1discounted cash flows and an exit multiple for the business, 2a market approach using public company information, discounted to reflect the
nature of the Questar operations, and 3individual transactions experienced by Radiologix and similar companies in recent months. At managements recommendation, the valuation firm applied a high 70%weighting factor to the
valuation derived under the individual transaction method described in 3above. Based on the independent valuation, Radiologix
recognized an impairment charge of $104 million in the second quarter of 2004 to reduce the Questar goodwill carrying value to estimated fair value. This charge is in addition to the $55 million charge we recorded in the first quarter of 2004
related to Questar in connection with our annual assessment of goodwill. The first quarter valuation included the operating results of our most profitable Questar center and also gave equal weighting factors to an income and market approach. We also
recorded a $617,000 pre-tax charge to impair long-lived assets of certain Questar centers in June 2004. In 2003, we recorded impairment
charges of $89 million to write-down goodwill and long-lived assets, respectively, related to Questar imaging centers using expected sales values determined based on individual transactions experienced by Radiologix and our knowledge of the
business environment, to estimate fair value. The components of our impairment charges are as follows in thousands:  For the Year Ended December 31 2005

Impairment of long-lived assets 772 10,978 8,867 In November 2004, we sold our 80% joint venture interest in our Questar Tampa operations,
including accounts receivable, to our venture partner for $275,000 in cash, resulting in a loss of $591,000, including the write-off of goodwill for $354,000. In June 2004, we sold a Questar center for $31 million in cash resulting in a gain of $682,000, net of a write-off of goodwill of $500,000. The Company regularly considers whether events or circumstances may affect either the fair value of recorded intangible assets or their associated useful
lives. At December31, 2005, the combined operations of our remaining five Questar centers are generating positive cash flow; and, the Company does not believe there are any additional indicators that the carrying values or the useful lives of
these assets need to be adjusted. However, in the event we decide to dispose of any remaining Questar centers, additional charges may result depending on cash flow and market conditions at the time of disposal.

our Northeast operations which software has been replaced in connection with our Radiologix Enhanced Workflow And Record Distribution REWARD Program. In fiscal 2003, we incurred impairment charges of
$523,000 to write-off a patient scheduling software system that we replaced. NOTE 7. DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS A summary of discontinued operations, related to our Questar operations, is as follows in thousands:  As of and For the Year Ended December

operations, was $201 million, $199 million and $236 million, respectively. NOTE 9. SERVICE FEE REVENUE Radiologix has two models by which it contracts with radiology practices: a comprehensive services model and a technical services model. Under the
comprehensive services model, the Company enters into a long-term agreement with a radiology practice group typically 40 years. Under this arrangement, in addition to earning technical service fee revenue for the use of Radiologixs
diagnostic imaging equipment and the provision of technical services, the Company provides management services and receives service fee revenue based on the practice groups professional revenue, including revenue outside of our diagnostic
imaging centers. Under the technical services model, the Company enters into a shorter-term agreement with a radiology practice group typically 10 to 15 years and earns service fee revenue and pays them a fee based on cash collections from
reimbursements for imaging procedures. Service fee revenue of the contracted radiology practice groups professional revenue component
and diagnostic imaging centers technical revenue component is recorded when services are rendered by the contracted radiology practices and diagnostic imaging centers based on established gross charges billed and reduced by estimated contractual
allowances and amounts retained by the contracted radiology practice groups under the terms of management services agreements. Our patient accounting system currently does not record contractual allowances at the time of billing. Instead, allowances
for contractual adjustments and doubtful accounts are estimated based on historical collection experience using a retrospective collection analysis, which we began using in the fourth quarter of 2004, payment-versus-charge schedules and aging
models. In connection with our December 2004 year-end closing process, we did finalize this retrospective collection analysis and increased contractual adjustments by $91 million, resulting in a corresponding decrease in service fee revenue and
accounts receivable in the fourth quarter of 2004 to reflect the change in estimate in net realizable value. Should circumstances change shift in payor mix, decline in economic conditions or deterioration in aging of patient receivables, our
estimates of the net realizable value of patient receivables could be reduced by a material amount. Because Radiologix has no financial
controlling interest in the radiology practice groups, as defined in Emerging Issues Task Force Issue 97-2 EITF 97-2, the Company does not consolidate the financial statements of those practices in its consolidated financial statements. The
following table sets forth the amounts of revenue for the contracted radiology practices and diagnostic imaging centers that would have been presented in the consolidated statements of operations had Radiologix met the provisions of EITF 97-2 in
thousands:  2005 2004 2003 Revenue for contracted radiology practices and diagnostic imaging centers, net of contractual adjustments 345,417 352,308 339,385 Amounts retained by contracted radiology practices 93,977 101,017 97,347 Service fee revenue 251,440 251,291 242,038 The Companys service fee revenue is dependent upon the operating results of the contracted
radiology practices and diagnostic imaging centers. Where state law allows, service fees due under the service agreements for the contracted radiology practices are derived from two distinct revenue streams: 1a negotiated percentage of the
professional revenues, reduced by certain expenses, as defined in the management services agreements; and 2100% of the adjusted technical revenues as defined in the service agreements. In states where the law requires a flat fee structure,
Radiologix has negotiated a base service fee, which approximates the estimated fair market value of the services provided under the service agreements and which is renegotiated each year. Service fee revenue is comprised of the following in
thousands:  2005

NOTE 10. MANAGEMENT SERVICES AGREEMENTS In addition to the management services agreement we terminated effective January31, 2005 see Note 6, we amended 1a management services
agreement which resulted in a 15% reduction in our management fee effective January1, 2004 and 2a separate management services agreement which resulted in the establishment of a technical bonus to the contracted radiology group and a
3% reduction in our management fee effective October1, 2004. Our management fees for certain other management services agreements
declined by 1% in 2005 and will decline by an additional 1% in 2006. The estimated annual impact to our service fee revenue for these 1% decreases is approximately $500,000. In connection with the amendment of a management services agreement with a contracted radiology group in July 2002, the Company recorded deferred revenue
of $33 million in consideration for the amended agreement, which amount is amortized over 20 years. In December 2002, the Company amended the management services agreement of another contracted radiology practice and recorded deferred revenue of
$48 million in consideration for the amended agreement, which is amortized over 19 years.

NOTE 11. LONG-TERM DEBT AND CAPITAL LEASE OBLIGATIONS Long-term debt and capital lease obligations consists of the following at December31, 2005 and 2004 in thousands:  2005 2004 105% Senior Notes, due December15, 2008 158,270 158,270 8% Convertible Junior Subordinated Note due July 2009 11,980 11,980 Note payable to bank and capital lease obligations, various interest rates 94 249 170,344 170,499 Current portion of long-term debt and capital lease obligations 32 157 Long-term debt and capital lease obligations, net of current portion 170,312 170,342 The maturities of long-term debt, including capital lease obligations, are approximately $32,000
in fiscal 2006, $34,000 in fiscal 2007, $1583 million in fiscal 2008 and $120 million due in fiscal 2009. Senior Notes
The Companys $1583 million in senior notes due December15, 2008, bear interest at 105% payable semiannually in arrears on
June15 and December15. The senior notes are redeemable on or after December15, 2005 at various redemption prices, plus accrued interest to the date of redemption. These notes are unsecured obligations, which rank senior in right of
payment to all subordinated indebtedness and equal in right of payment with all other senior indebtedness. The senior notes are unconditionally guaranteed on a senior unsecured basis by certain restricted existing and future subsidiaries. The
required debt incurrence ratio under these notes is 275. Our debt incurrence ratio of 234 at December31, 2005 is not in compliance with the requirements of these notes. The non-compliance with the debt incurrence ratio imposes the following
limitations on the Company: 1 limits the Companys ability to make restricted payments e.g., retirement of the Convertible Junior Subordinated Note to a maximum of $5,000,000; 2 prevents sale and leaseback transactions; 3 limits the
incurrence of additional indebtedness this does not impact our lease lines or credit facility as they are Permitted Indebtedness; and 4 prevents the designation of an unrestricted subsidiary as a subsidiary. In order to pass the current debt
incurrence ratio of 275 to 100, the Company will need to reach $503 million in EBITDA for four consecutive quarters. In the 2004 second quarter, the Company retired $173 million of these senior notes at a price equal to 10325% of face value. At
December31, 2005 and 2004, our senior notes were trading at 980% and 1105% of face value, respectively. Convertible Junior
Subordinated Note The Company has a $120 million convertible junior subordinated note, which matures July31, 2009, and bears
interest, payable quarterly in cash or in-kind securities, at an annual rate of 80%. The note holder may convert borrowings under the note to common stock at $752 per share. This note is considered in the calculation of diluted earnings per share
as applicable see Note 16. The market value of these notes is not readily determinable. Revolving Credit Agreement At December31, 2005, amounts considered outstanding under the revolving credit facility totaled $14 million related to two letters of credit in
connection with our high retention workers compensation program with $272 million available for borrowings. Borrowings under this line are limited to 85% of eligible accounts receivable, as defined under the credit facility. Borrowings are
secured by substantially all of our assets and a pledge of the capital stock of our wholly owned subsidiaries. NOTE 12. COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES
Master Lease Agreement Radiologix maintains operating leases for certain imaging equipment under an Amended and Restated Master Lease Agreement with GE Healthcare Financial Services GE. Through this arrangement, GE has agreed to fund up to $600 million of
equipment leases through December31, 2006, and requires that at least two-thirds of the outstanding balance represent GE healthcare equipment. In connection with the Master Lease Agreement, the Company is required to provide additional cash collateral in a restricted account equal to 20% of the aggregate amounts outstanding under the Master Lease Agreement.
The accompanying December31, 2005 balance sheet includes $57 million of restricted cash under this provision. The Master Lease
Agreement also contains certain covenants related to financial leverage, fixed charge coverage, and total indebtedness to GE. Failure to comply with these covenants would restrict our ability to lease additional equipment under the Master Lease
Agreement until the covenants are met. GE provided us with a written waiver stating that GE agreed to waive compliance with the financial leverage ratio for the year ended December31, 2004 and to modify this calculation for 2005 to exclude the
$91 million adjustment to service fee revenue after implementing the retrospective collection analysis in the fourth quarter of 2004.

At December31, 2005, applicable amounts outstanding under the Master Lease Agreement totaled $277
million; and $153 million remained available for future leases. Commitments for leases signed but not placed in service under the Master Lease Agreement were $170 million at December31, 2005. Leases The Company leases office and facility space
as well as certain diagnostic equipment under operating leases. Future minimum lease payments under these operating leases for fiscal 2006, 2007, 2008, 2009, 2010 and 2011 and thereafter are $252 million, $239 million, $212 million, $169
million, $114 million, and $128 million, respectively. Combined equipment and facility lease expense was approximately $272 million, $313 million and $300 million in 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. Our facility lease terms generally vary in length from 1 year to 15 years with renewal options upon prior written notice, from 1 year to 10 years
depending on the agreed upon terms with the local landlord. Facility lease amounts generally increase from 1% to 4% on an annual basis. We do not have options to purchase the facilities we currently lease. These leases usually contain exclusivity
clauses prohibiting the landlord from leasing space to potentially competitive businesses within a defined distance of our existing locations. Our equipment lease agreements are generally negotiated through either GE or Siemens Medical Solutions USA, Inc. These leases typically contain payment terms from 60 to 62 months and may include early buy-out options equal to the estimated
fair market value of the equipment, plus applicable taxes, at the time of the option. Litigation Our current litigation is iexpected to be covered by liability insurance or iiis not expected to adversely affect our business. Some risk
exists, however, that we could subsequently be named as a defendant in additional lawsuits or that pending litigation could escalate and adversely affect us. Self-insurance At December31, 2005, the amount of reserves related to the potential obligations under our
self-insured arrangements, which are comprised of estimated health benefits and workers compensation obligations was $19 million. We believe we are adequately reserved for estimated potential obligations under these arrangements. 
NOTE 13. 401K PLAN The Company established a
defined contribution plan the 401k plan in January 1999. Employees are eligible immediately upon date of hire. The 401k plan allows for a discretionary employer match of contributions made by participants after such participants
have completed 1,000 hours of service. With respect to the Company match, a participant vests 20% after two years of service, 40% after three years of service, 60% after four years of service, 80% after five years of service and 100% after six years
of service. The Company may make matching contributions under this plan of up to 3% of the participants compensation if the
participant contributes 6% or more of their compensation. For participants who contribute less than 6% of their compensation, matching contributions may be made up to 50% of the amount contributed. Company contributions to the plan were
approximately $12 million in 2005, $12 million in 2004 and $11 million in 2003. NOTE 14. STOCKHOLDERS EQUITY Under the 1996 Stock Option Plan the 1996 Plan, an initial 4,000,000 options to purchase shares of the Companys common stock were
available for grant to key directors, employees and other healthcare professionals associated with Radiologix, as defined by the 1996 Plan. On July15, 2004, the Companys stockholders approved the adoption of the 2004 Long-Term Incentive
Plan. As a result, all stock award grants from then on are made under this 2004 Plan. The total number of shares reserved and available for grant under the 2004 Plan are 3,000,000 plus any shares remaining available for grant under the prior 1996
Plan. Options granted under the 2004 Plan may be either incentive stock options ISO or nonqualified stock options NQSO. The option price per share under the 2004 Plan may not be less than 100% of the fair market value at
the grant date for ISO and may not be less than 85% of the fair market value at the grant date for NQSO. All of the options granted under the 2004 and 1996 Plans through December31, 2005 were at fair market value on the date of grant.
Generally, options vest over a five-year period and are exercisable over a ten-year life. In 2004, 200,000 options were granted which vest in portions based on the Companys common stock exceeding various stock closing sales prices for 20
consecutive days. These performance based

options were cancelled on December31, 2004 upon termination of the employee option holder. As of December31,
2005, 2004 and 2003, 3,153,628, 3,091,503 and 2,694,710 options, respectively, were outstanding under the 2004 and 1996 Plans. Included in the December31, 2005 balance are 549,806 options related to a 300,000 Restricted Stock Award to our
Chief Executive Officer and Restricted Stock Units of 66,537 to directors, which awards count as 15 options for every 1 award granted, pursuant to Section4a of the 2004 Long-Term Incentive Compensation Plan. Since the 1996 Plans
inception, the Board of Directors granted options to purchase 285,000 shares of common stock outside the 1996 Plan. Compensation expense related to the non-employee portion of these shares is not material. The following table summarizes the combined
activity under the Plan and the options granted outside the Plan at December31 shares in thousands:  2005

368,848 951 1,603,776 During the year ended December31, 2005, the Company granted 770,000 options to purchase the
Companys common stock, primarily as employment inducements for key executives. Of these options, 63,000 vest after one year and the remaining 707,000 vest over a five-year period. During 2003, the Company issued 100,000 options to a
consultant, of which 30,000 vested immediately and the remaining 70,000 options vest in portions based on the Companys common stock exceeding various stock closing sales prices for 20 consecutive days. The Company recognized $40,000, $40,000
and $27,000 of compensation expense in 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively, related to these options. The Company granted a Restricted Stock Award of 300,000 shares and a Restricted Stock Units of 11,392 shares in the fourth quarter of 2004 and

The summary below presents the pro-forma financial results that would have been reported if the Company
had applied the provisions of SFAS No123, as amended by Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No148 dollars are presented in thousands, except per share amounts:  For the Year Ended December 31 2005 2004 2003 Asrestated Net loss, as reported 1,531 31,855 7,963 Total stock-based compensation expensed in net income loss, net of related tax effects 557 78 40 Total stock-based compensation expense determined under fair value based method for all awards, net of related tax effects 1,071 1,681 1,482 Pro forma net loss 2,045 33,458 9,405 Loss per common share Basicas reported 007 146 037 Basicpro forma 009 154 043 Loss per share Dilutedas reported 007 146 037 Dilutedpro forma 009 154 043
The fair value of each option grant is estimated at the date of grant using a Black-Scholes option
pricing model with the following weighted average assumptions for grants in 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively: risk-free interest rate of 447, 423, and 427 percent; expected life of 335, 545 and 527 years; expected volatility of 403, 388,
and 616 percent; and dividend yield of zero in 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. The weighted-average grant-date fair value of new grants in 2005, 2004 and 2003 was $252 per share, $190 per share, and $256 per share, respectively. The
stock-based compensation expense determined under the fair value based method presented on a pro forma basis includes an adjustment during the year ended December31, 2004 to reverse expenses related to certain variable options that were
cancelled. As permitted by APB 25, the Company originally reported an expense for the total estimated amount for these options on a pro forma basis in the period the options were granted. NOTE 15. INCOME TAXES Income tax expense benefit

The income tax expense benefit on the gain loss from discontinued operations in 2005, 2004 and 2003
was zero, $54 million and $46 million, respectively. The tax effects of temporary differences that give rise to the deferred income
taxes at December31, 2005 and 2004 are presented below in thousands:  2005 2004 Asrestated Deferred tax assets Prepaid expenses and other 183 Fixed assets and intangibles 1,298 Joint ventures Deferred revenue 2,465 2,620 Other 249 141 Federal and state tax net operating loss carryforwards 7,699 8,915 Valuation allowance 10,535 7,549 Total deferred tax assets 1,359 4,127 Deferred tax liabilities Accounts receivable 802 1,793 Prepaid expenses and other 187 Fixed assets and intangibles 1,383 Joint ventures 557 968 Total deferred tax liabilities 1,359 4,331 Total net deferred tax assets liabilities 204 The federal and state tax net operating loss carryforwards of $152 million and $642 million,
respectively, principally expire in 2024. Realization of deferred tax assets is dependent on generating sufficient taxable income prior to
expiration of the twenty-year loss carryforward period. We recorded valuation allowances of $75 million in 2004 and $105 million in 2005 that relate to net tax deferred assets, including state and federal net operating losses. Due to losses for the last three years the realization of deferred tax assets is questionable. Therefore, valuation allowances for net deferred tax
assets were recorded in 2004 and 2005. The tax provision of $662,000 for the year ended December31, 2005 is for state income taxes and federal alternative minimum tax. NOTE 16. GAIN ON SALE OF OPERATIONS Effective April30, 2004, we completed the sale of our
operations in San Antonio, Texas. The purchase price was $105 million, resulting in a pre-tax gain on sale of approximately $47 million. Net cash received was $97 million after purchase price adjustments. The sale included 1assets we
owned and leased in our operation of MS Imaging Partners, Inc., 2a diagnostic imaging center, and 3certain partnership interests, but did not include accounts receivable aggregating approximately $47 million, which we retained.

NOTE 17. EARNINGS LOSS PER SHARE Basic earnings loss per share EPS is calculated by dividing income available to common stockholders by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the period. The weighted average number of
common shares outstanding increased during the year ended December31, 2005 and 2004 primarily due to the exercise of stock options. Diluted EPS includes options, warrants, and other potentially dilutive securities, using the treasury stock method for options and warrants to the extent that these securities are not anti-dilutive. Diluted EPS also includes the effect of
the convertible junior subordinated note using the if converted method to the extent these securities are not anti-dilutive.  For the Year EndedDecember 31 2005

respectively, of stock options were not included in the computation of diluted EPS because to do so would be anti-dilutive. For the years
ended December31, 2005, 2004 and 2003, approximately $575,000 of interest, net of tax, and 1,593,040 shares related to the convertible junior subordinated note were not included in the computation of diluted EPS because to do so would be
anti-dilutive. NOTE 18. UNCONSOLIDATED AFFILIATES JOINT VENTURES The Company has seven unconsolidated joint ventures with ownership interests ranging from 22% to 50%. These joint ventures represent partnerships with hospitals, health systems or radiology practices and were formed
for the purpose of owning and operating diagnostic imaging centers. Professional services at the joint venture diagnostic imaging centers are performed by contracted radiology practices or a radiology practice that participates in the joint venture.
The Companys investments in these joint ventures are accounted for under the equity method. Total assets for the years ended December31, 2005 and 2004 include notes receivable from certain unconsolidated joint ventures aggregating $13
million and $21 million, respectively. Interest income related to these notes receivable was approximately $152,000, $245,000, and $241,000 in fiscal 2005, 2004, and 2003, respectively. The Company also received management service fees of $31
million, $24 million and $22 million for the years ended December31, 2005, 2004, and 2003, respectively, in connection with operating the centers underlying these joint ventures.

NOTE 19. VARIABLE INTEREST ENTITIES In January 2003, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards Board Interpretation No46, Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities, an Interpretation of ARB
No41 FIN 46. In December 2003, the FASB modified FIN 46 to make certain technical corrections and address certain implementation issues that had arisen. FIN 46 provides a new framework for identifying variable interest entities
VIEs and determining when a company should include the assets, liabilities, non-controlling interests and results of activities of a VIE in its consolidated financial statements. In general, a VIE is a corporation, partnership, limited liability corporation, trust or any other legal structure used to conduct activities or hold
assets that either 1has an insufficient amount of equity to carry out its principal activities without additional subordinated financial support, 2has a group of equity owners that are unable to make significant decisions about its
activities, or 3has a group of equity owners that do not have the obligation to absorb losses or the right to receive returns generated by its operations. However, FIN 46 specifically excludes a VIE that is a business if the variable
interest holder did not participate significantly in the design or redesign of the entity. The Company adopted the provisions of FIN 46 as
of March31, 2004. The Company reviewed its investment in unconsolidated joint ventures and contracted radiology practice arrangements as of December31, 2005 and 2004 and under the provisions of FIN 46 and has determined that none of its
arrangements or investments meet the definition of a variable interest entity. NOTE 20. SEGMENT REPORTING The Companys primary operations consist of owning and operating diagnostic imaging centers and providing administrative, management and information
services to the contracted radiology practice groups that provide professional interpretation and supervision services in connection with the Companys diagnostic imaging centers and to hospitals and radiology practices with which the Company
operates joint ventures. Because of different characteristics from our primary operations, including location, market concentration,
contracting leverage, capital requirements, the single modality nature of most of the centers and the structure of the management service agreements with physicians related to the Companys Questar operations, senior management makes resource
allocation decisions separately for Questar and its primary operations. The following table summarizes the operating results, including
continuing and discontinued operations, and assets of our primary and Questar operations in thousands:  For the Year Ended December31, 2005 PrimaryOperations Questar Total Service fee revenue 243,761 7,679 251,440 Total costs and expenses 210,525 8,937 219,462 Income loss before equity in earnings of unconsolidated affiliates, minority interests in consolidated subsidiaries, income taxes and

22 PART II.  Item5. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES. Disclosure Controls and Procedures. The Company maintains disclosure
controls and procedures defined in Rule 13a-15e under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended the Exchange Act, as controls and other procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by the
issuer in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the time periods specified in the Securities and Exchange Commissions rules and forms. Disclosure controls and
procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in the reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to our management, including
our Chief Executive Officer CEO and Chief Financial Officer CFO as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. In connection with our year end close process and the preparation of this Annual Report on Form 10-K as of December31, 2005, an evaluation was performed under the supervision and with the participation of the
Companys management, including the CEO and CFO, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of the Companys disclosure controls and procedures. Based on that evaluation, the CEO and CFO have concluded that the Companys
disclosure controls and procedures are ineffective at December31, 2005 because of the material weakness in internal control over financial reporting noted below. Managements Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Management of the Company is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting defined in
Rule 13a-15f under the Exchange Act as a process designed by, or under the supervision of, our CEO and CFO and effected by our Board of Directors, management and other personnel, to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of
financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement preparation and presentation. Therefore, even those systems determined to be effective
may not prevent or detect all misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with
the policies or procedures may deteriorate. Management assessed the effectiveness of the Companys internal control over financial
reporting as of December31, 2005, using the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission COSO in Internal Control Integrated Framework. As part of this assessment, management
evaluated the controls over the procedures for accounting for lease terminations and concluded that a material weakness existed in these controls. We use these procedures to determine the accounting treatment for terminating lease contracts. In
2004, we capitalized $139 million relating to the termination of the lease contract with PresGar when, in fact, it should have been expensed. Consequently, this lead to a restatement of our 2004 consolidated financial statements in this Form 10-K
whereby we increased operating expense by $139 million, decreased amortization expense by $01 million, and decreased intangible assets by $139 million. Management determined that the material weakness in the procedures for accounting for lease
terminations was not remediated as of December31, 2005. Because of this material weakness, management has concluded that the Companys internal control over financial reporting was not effective as of December31, 2005. 
Managements assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting as of December31, 2005 has been audited by
Ernst Young LLP, the independent registered public accounting firm who also audited the Companys consolidated financial statements. Ernst Youngs attestation report on managements assessment of the
Companys internal control over financial reporting appears on page 48 hereof.

Changes to Internal Control over Financial Reporting As noted in our 2004 Form 10-K, subsequent to December31, 2004, but prior to the finalization of our 2004 consolidated financial statements, the
Company placed into operations new controls to address the material weakness we identified in our accounts receivable estimation process. These new controls include a retrospective collection analysis that matches cash collections to billed charges
by month of service. We believe these new controls have remediated the material weakness that existed as of December31, 2004, and that these controls operated effectively during the twelve months ended December31, 2005. In response to a comment letter that the Company received from the staff of the Securities and Exchange Commission in connection with a customary review
of the Companys Annual Report in Form 10-K for the year ended December31, 2004, the Company has reevaluated the accounting treatment of the PresGar equipment lease financing arrangement acquired on October31, 2004 for $139
million. This was an isolated transaction, not a part of the Companys ordinary course of business. However, the Company determined that the financial statements in the 2004 Annual Report should be restated. Management has enhanced the review
process by ensuring that future material unusual transactions are subject to a more thorough and detailed review. The Company has revised its accounting policy for material unusual transactions to include a review by senior financial officers and
outside accounting experts if deemed necessary. Management believes that these new policies have remediated the material weakness in the Companys internal controls over financial reporting that existed as of December31, 2005, and that
these internal controls are effective at the reasonable assurance level. However, since these changes were implemented after year end, these changes did not alter the conclusion of management that our internal controls over financial reporting were
ineffective at year end.
