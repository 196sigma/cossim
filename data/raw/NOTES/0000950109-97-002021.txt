REPORT OF INDEPENDENT ACCOUNTANTS
To the Board of Directors of
AMISYS Managed Care Systems, Inc.
We have audited the accompanying balance sheets of AMISYS Managed Care
Systems, Inc. the Company as of December 31, 1996 and 1995, and the related
statements of operations, stockholders' equity deficit and cash flows for the
years then ended and the period from May 27, 1994 to December 31, 1994, 
respectively. We have also audited the accompanying statements of operations, 
stockholder equity deficit and cash flows of American International 
Healthcare, Inc. AIHI, a wholly owned subsidiary of American International
Group, Inc. for the period from January 1, 1994 to May 26, 1994 see Note 1.
These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company and AIHI
management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial
statements based on our audits.
We conducted our audits in accordance with generally accepted auditing
standards. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material
misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting
the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes
assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by
management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.
We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly,
in all material respects, the financial position of the Company and AIHI for the
periods described above and the results of operations and cash flows of the
Company and AIHI for the periods described above, in conformity with generally
accepted accounting principles.

1. Description of Business and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies
Description of Business
AMISYS Managed Care Systems, Inc. the Company is a health care
information systems company that develops, sells and supports the AMISYS system,
a comprehensive managed health care administration and risk management
information system. The principal markets for the AMISYS system are U.S. based
companies within the managed health care industry.
Basis of Presentation
The accompanying financial statements represent the accounts of the
Company, formerly American International Healthcare, Inc. AIHI, the
surviving corporation of a merger between AIHI and AIH Systems, Inc. AIH
which was incorporated on May 23, 1994 for the purpose of acquiring AIHI. On May
27, 1994, AIH purchased 100% of the issued and outstanding shares of AIHI from
American International Group, Inc. AIG, parent company of AIHI. The
financial statements reflect the segregation of the operating activities for the
periods related to the different owners. The post acquisition financial
statements reflect the purchase accounting adjustments as described in Note 2.
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally
accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and
judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and
disclosures of contingencies at the date of the financial statements and
revenues and expenses recognized during the reporting period. Actual results
could differ from those estimates.
Financial Statement Presentation
On November 1, 1995, the Board of Directors authorized and the stockholders
approved: i a two-for-one stock split of the outstanding shares of the
Company common stock. Accordingly, all references to common stock, options,
and per share data have been restated to give effect to the stock split.
Revenue Recognition
Revenues are derived primarily from the sale of information systems
which include software, hardware, installation labor and consulting services.
Contracts for the installation of AMISYS information systems are
negotiated individually and are non-cancelable. The Company recognizes revenues
from the sale of information systems using the percentage-of-completion method
as the work is performed, measured primarily by the ratio of labor hours
incurred to total estimated labor hours for each specific contract. When the
total estimated cost of a contract is expected to exceed the contract price, the
total estimated loss is charged to expense in the period when the information
becomes known.

For the period January 1, 1994 to May 26, 1994
NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
dollars in thousands
Revenues from the sale of additional hardware subsequent to the initial
AMISYS software license are recognized upon shipment in satisfaction of 
non-cancelable agreements and upon determination that collectibility is
probable. Revenues from software support and maintenance contracts are
recognized ratably as the services are rendered.
Amounts billed in advance of satisfying revenue recognition criteria are
classified as deferred revenue in the accompanying balance sheet. Costs incurred
in excess of the contract percent complete are classified as costs incurred on
deferred revenue. Deferred revenue is presented net of costs incurred on
deferred revenue.
Cash and Cash Equivalents
The Company considers all highly liquid investments with original
maturities of 3 months or less to be cash equivalents. Cash and cash equivalents
include time deposits with commercial banks used for temporary cash management
purposes.
Short-Term Investments
At December 31, 1996 and 1995 short-term investments which mature
within one year have been categorized as available-for-sale and are recorded at
fair value. Fair values for available-for-sale securities are based on quoted
market prices. The estimated fair value of each investment approximates the
cost, and therefore there are no unrealized gains or losses as of December 31,
1996 and 1995. Under Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 115,
Accounting for Certain Investments in Debt and Equity Securities, unrealized
gains and losses for available-for-sale securities are reported, net of any
related income tax effect, as a separate component of stockholders' equity.
Realized gains and losses on the sale of available-for-sale securities are
included in the determination of net income in the period of disposition using
the specific identification cost method. If the decline in fair value of an
available-for-sale security is considered other than temporary, the cost basis
of that security is written down to fair value as a new cost basis and the
amount of the write-down is accounted for as a realized loss.
Available-for-sale securities are summarized as follows

Concentration of Credit Risk
Financial instruments which potentially expose the Company to concentration
of credit risk consist primarily of cash, short term investments and trade
accounts receivable. The Company places its temporary cash and short-term
investments in one or more financial institutions. The Company has not
experienced any losses on these investments to date.
The Company has not experienced significant losses related to receivables
from individual customers or groups of customers in the health care industry.
Due to these factors, no additional credit risk beyond amounts provided for
collection losses is believed by management to be inherent in the Company
accounts receivable. The largest customer at December 31, 1996 and 1995,
represents 16% and 24%, respectively, of the total accounts receivable balance.
Revenues from one customer represent 10% and 18% of total revenues for the years
ended December 31, 1996 and 1995, respectively.
Property and Equipment
Computer equipment, office furniture and fixtures, and leasehold
improvements are recorded at cost. Depreciation and amortization of furniture
and equipment is recorded using the straight-line method over a useful life of
three to five years. Leasehold improvements are amortized over the lesser of
their estimated useful life or the lease term. Repairs and maintenance costs are
charged to expense as incurred. Upon sale or retirement of property and
equipment, the costs and related accumulated depreciation are eliminated from
the accounts and any resulting gain or loss on such disposition is included in
the determination of net income.
Software Development Costs
Software development costs, which are primarily comprised of salaries and
related costs, are expensed until technological feasibility is established and
then capitalized until a marketable product is completed. Technological
feasibility is established upon completion of a working model. Amortization of
capitalized software costs begins when the related product is available for
general release to customers and is provided for each product based on the
greater of the amount computed using i the ratio of current gross revenues to
total current and anticipated future gross revenues for the related software or
ii the straight-line method over a five-year life or the product estimated
economic life, if shorter.
The Company has not capitalized software development costs for the years
ended December 31, 1996 and 1995 or the period ended December 31, 1994, as no
product development activities were considered to have reached technological
feasibility during these periods.

As of May 27, 1994, all unamortized capitalized software development costs
were written off as a result of the determination of the fair value of assets at
the date of acquisition. Refer to Note 2 Acquisition for further discussion.
Amortization of software development costs was $448 for the period January 1,
1994 to May 26, 1994.
Purchased Software
Purchased software represents the fair market value of all rights to the
AMISYS software product that were acquired when the Company was purchased from
AIG. Purchased software costs are amortized on a straight line basis over their
estimated useful life. The Company assesses the net realizable value and useful
life of purchased software at each balance sheet date. Effective July 1, 1995,
the Company changed its estimate of the useful life of purchased software to
increase it from 18 to 42 months. The effect of this change in estimate was to
decrease amortization expense and increase net income by $160 or $03 per common
share for the year ended December 31, 1995.
Purchased software consists of the following

Income Taxes
The Company accounts for income taxes under Statement of Financial
Accounting Standards No. 109, Accounting for Income Taxes, SFAS 109. Under
SFAS 109, deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax
consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement
carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax
bases. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured by applying enacted
statutory tax rates, that are applicable to the future years in which deferred
tax assets or liabilities are expected to be settled or realized, to the
differences between the financial statement carrying amount and the tax bases of
existing assets and liabilities. Under SFAS 109, the effect of a change in tax
rates on deferred tax assets and liabilities is recognized in net income in the
period in which the tax rate change is enacted. The statement also requires a
valuation allowance against net deferred tax assets if, based upon the available
evidence, it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets
may not be realized.
Net Income Per Common Share
Net income per common share is computed on a primary and fully diluted
basis using the weighted average number of shares of common stock, assuming
conversion of dilutive common stock equivalent shares from common stock options.
Primary and fully diluted net income per common share were equivalent for all
periods presented. Pursuant to the Securities Exchange Commission Staff
Accounting Bulletin No. 83, common stock and common stock equivalent shares
issued by the Company at prices below the public offering price during the
twelve month period prior to the offering date of December 20, 1995 using the
treasury stock method and the public offering price of $1450 per share have
been included in the calculation of common and common equivalent shares as if
they were outstanding for all periods presented.
Net income per common share subsequent to the Company initial public
offering is calculated in accordance with Accounting Principles Board Opinion
No. 15 Earnings per Share.
Reclassifications
Certain reclassifications have been made to the prior years' financial
statements to conform to the classifications used in the current period.

2. Acquisition
On May 27, 1994, 100% of the stock of AIHI was purchased from AIG. This
transaction was accounted for using the purchase method of accounting. The total
purchase price of $15,730, including assumed liabilities of $4,947 and
acquisition costs of $283, has been allocated to the Company assets and
liabilities based upon their estimated fair values as of the date of purchase.
Adjustments necessary to reflect the fair value and purchase price
allocations have been reflected in the post-acquisition financial statements.
Approximately $1,200 of the purchase price was allocated to AIHI existing
AMISYS software technology and is being amortized over its projected remaining
useful life. Approximately $6,500 was allocated to in-process product
development of a client/server version of the same software based on the
determination of the future product net present value. The Company used a
discounted cash flow model to determine the valuation of both products. At the
time of the purchase, management determined that the purchased research and
development had not reached technological feasibility and there was no
alternative future use for this technology. Accordingly, this in-process product
development was written-off as of May 27, 1994.

11.  Stock-Based Compensation Plans
The Company has stock-based compensation plans which are described below.
In October 1995 the FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No.
123, Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation, SFAS 123. SFAS 123 is
effective for periods beginning after December 15, 1995. SFAS 123 requires that
companies either recognize compensation expense for grants of stock, stock
options, and other equity instruments based on fair value, or provide pro forma
disclosure of net income and earnings per share in the notes to the financial
statements. The Company adopted the disclosure provisions of SFAS 123 in 1996
and has applied Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 25 and related
Interpretations in accounting for its plans. Accordingly, no compensation cost
has been recognized for its stock option plans. Had compensation cost for the
Company stock-based compensation plans been determined based on the fair value
at the grant dates as calculated in accordance with SFAS 123, the Company net
income and earnings per share for the year ended December 31, 1996 would have
