Controls and Procedures. Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and
Procedures We maintain disclosure controls and procedures, as such term is defined in Rule13a-15e
under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 the Exchange Act, that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized, and
reported within the time periods specified in Securities and Exchange Commission rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as
appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. In designing and evaluating our disclosure controls and procedures, management recognized that disclosure controls and procedures, no matter how well conceived and operated, can
provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the disclosure controls and procedures are met. Additionally, in designing disclosure controls and procedures, our management necessarily was required to apply judgment in
evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of those disclosure controls and procedures. The design of any disclosure controls and procedures also is based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there can be no
assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions. Our disclosure controls and procedures are designed to provide reasonable assurance that the controls and procedures will meet their
objectives. Based on their evaluation as of the end of the period covered by this Annual Report on Form10-K, our
Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures, as of June 30, 2008, were effective in providing reasonable assurance that the objectives of the disclosure controls and procedures are
met. Managements Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as defined in Rule13a-15f of the Exchange Act. Because of its inherent
limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect all misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes
in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. We assessed the
effectiveness of the Companys internal control over financial reporting as of June30, 2008. In making this assessment, we used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission
COSO in Internal Control Integrated Framework. Based on our assessment using those criteria, we concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of June30, 2008. The effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of June30, 2008 has been audited by Ernst Young,
LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in their report which appears in the Companys Annual Report to Shareholders for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2008, which is incorporated by reference in this Form10-K.
Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting There was no change in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the quarter ended June30, 2008 that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal
control over financial reporting.  ITEM9B.
