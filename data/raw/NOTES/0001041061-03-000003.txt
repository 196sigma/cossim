Note 1 Description of Business
On May 16, 2002, Tricon Global Restaurants, Inc. changed its name to YUM! Brands,
Inc. in order to better reflect our expanding portfolio of brands. In addition, on the
same day, Tricon Restaurants International changed its name to YUM! Restaurants
International.
YUM! Brands, Inc. and Subsidiaries collectively referred to as YUM or
the Company comprises the worldwide operations of KFC, Pizza Hut, Taco Bell
and since May 7, 2002, Long John Silvers LJS and AW All-American
Food Restaurants AW collectively the Concepts, which were
added when we acquired Yorkshire Global Restaurants, Inc. YGR. YUM is the
worlds largest quick service restaurant company based on the number of system
units, with nearly 33,000 units in more than 100 countries and territories of which
approximately 36% are located outside the U.S. YUM was created as an independent,
publicly owned company on October 6, 1997 the Spin-off Date via a tax-free
distribution by our former parent, PepsiCo, Inc. PepsiCo, of our
Common Stock the Distribution or Spin-off to its
shareholders. References to YUM throughout these Consolidated Financial Statements
are made using the first person notations of we, us or our.
Through our widely-recognized Concepts, we develop, operate, franchise and
license a system of both traditional and non-traditional quick service restaurants.
Each Concept has proprietary menu items and emphasizes the preparation of food with
high quality ingredients as well as unique recipes and special seasonings to provide
appealing, tasty and attractive food at competitive prices. Our traditional
restaurants feature dine-in, carryout and, in some instances, drive-thru or delivery
service. Non-traditional units, which are principally licensed outlets, include
express units and kiosks which have a more limited menu and operate in
non-traditional locations like airports, gasoline service stations, convenience
stores, stadiums, amusement parks and colleges, where a full-scale traditional outlet
would not be practical or efficient. We are actively pursuing the strategy of
multibranding, where two or more of our Concepts are operated in a single unit. In
addition, we are testing multibranding options involving one of our Concepts and a
restaurant concept not owned or affiliated with YUM.
Note 2 - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies
Our preparation of the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements in conformity
with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires
us to make estimates and assumptions that affect reported amounts of assets and
liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the
financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the
reporting period. Actual results could differ from the estimates.
Principles of Consolidation and Basis of Preparation. Intercompany accounts and
transactions have been eliminated. Certain investments in businesses that operate
our Concepts are accounted for by the equity method. Generally, we possess 50%
ownership of and 50% voting rights over these affiliates. Our lack of majority voting
rights precludes us from controlling these affiliates, and thus we do not consolidate
these affiliates. Our share of the net income or loss of those unconsolidated
affiliates is included in other income expense.
We participate in various advertising cooperatives with our franchisees and
licensees. In certain of these cooperatives we possess majority voting rights, and
thus control the cooperatives. We have previously netted assets of the
cooperatives we control with the related advertising payables. We have shown the
assets and liabilities of these cooperatives on a gross basis in the Consolidated
Balance Sheet for December 28, 2002, and reclassified amounts in the Consolidated
Balance Sheet for December 29, 2001 accordingly. As the contributions are
designated for advertising expenditures, any cash held by these cooperatives is
considered restricted and is included in prepaid expenses and other current assets.
Such restricted cash was approximately $44 million and $18 million at December 28,
2002 and December 29, 2001, respectively. Additionally, these cooperatives had
receivables from franchisees of $13 million and $15 million and other 46  current
assets of $3 million and $4 million at December 28, 2002 and December 29, 2001,
respectively, which have been included in our Consolidated Balance Sheets. As the
contributions to these cooperatives are designated and segregated for advertising,
we act as an agent for the franchisees and licensees with regard to these
contributions. Thus, in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards SFAS
No. 45, Accounting for Franchise Fee Revenue, we do not reflect
franchisee and licensee contributions to these cooperatives in our Consolidated
Statements of Income.
Fiscal Year. Our fiscal year ends on the last Saturday in December and, as a result,
a fifty-third week is added every five or six years. Fiscal year 2000 included 53
weeks. The Companys next fiscal year with 53 weeks will be 2005. The first
three quarters of each fiscal year consist of 12 weeks and the fourth quarter consists
of 17 weeks in fiscal years with 53 weeks and 16 weeks in fiscal years with 52 weeks.
Our subsidiaries operate on similar fiscal calendars with period end dates suited
to their businesses. The subsidiaries period end dates are within one week of YUMs
period end date with the exception of our international businesses, which close
one period or one month earlier to facilitate consolidated reporting.
Reclassifications. We have reclassified certain items in the accompanying
Consolidated Financial Statements and Notes thereto for prior periods to be
comparable with the classification we adopted for the fiscal year ended December 28,
2002. These reclassifications had no effect on previously reported net income.
Franchise and License Operations. We execute franchise or license agreements for
each unit which sets out the terms of our arrangement with the franchisee or licensee.
Our franchise and license agreements typically require the franchisee or licensee to
pay an initial, non-refundable fee and continuing fees based upon a percentage of
sales. Subject to our approval and payment of a renewal fee, a franchisee may generally
renew the franchise agreement upon its expiration.
We recognize initial fees as revenue when we have performed substantially all
initial services required by the franchise or license agreement, which is generally
upon the opening of a store. We recognize continuing fees as earned with an
appropriate provision for estimated uncollectible amounts, which is included in
franchise and license expenses. We recognize renewal fees in income when a renewal
agreement becomes effective. We include initial fees collected upon the sale of a
restaurant to a franchisee in refranchising gains losses. Fees for development
rights are capitalized and amortized over the life of the development agreement.
We incur expenses that benefit both our franchise and license communities and their
representative organizations and our company operated restaurants. These expenses,
along with other costs of sales and servicing of franchise and license agreements are
charged to general and administrative expenses as incurred. Certain direct costs of
our franchise and license operations are charged to franchise and license
expenses. These costs include provisions for estimated uncollectible fees,
franchise and license marketing funding, amortization expense for franchise related
intangible assets and certain other direct incremental franchise and license support
costs. Franchise and license expenses also includes rental income from subleasing
restaurants to franchisees net of the related occupancy costs.
We monitor the financial condition of our franchisees and licensees and record
provisions for estimated losses on receivables when we believe that our franchisees
or licensees are unable to make their required payments. While we use the best
information available in making our determination, the ultimate recovery of
recorded receivables is also dependent upon future economic events and other
conditions that may be beyond our control. Included in franchise and license expenses
are provisions for uncollectible franchise and license receivables of $15 million, $24
million and $30 million in 2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively. 47 Direct Marketing Costs. We report substantially all of our direct marketing
costs in occupancy and other operating expenses. We charge direct marketing costs to
expense ratably in relation to revenues over the year in which incurred and, in the
case of advertising production costs, in the year first shown. Deferred direct
marketing costs, which are classified as prepaid expenses, consist of media and
related advertising production costs which will generally be used for the first time
in the next fiscal year. To the extent we participate in advertising cooperatives,
we expense our contributions as incurred. At the end of 2002 and 2001, we had
deferred marketing costs of $8 million and $2 million, respectively. Our advertising
expenses were $384 million, $328 million and $325 million in 2002, 2001 and 2000,
respectively.
Research and Development Expenses. Research and development expenses, which we
expense as incurred, were $23 million in 2002, $23 million in 2001 and $24 million in
2000.
Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets. Effective December 30, 2001, the
Company adopted SFAS No. 144, Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of
Long-Lived Assets SFAS 144. SFAS 144 retained many of the
fundamental provisions of SFAS No. 121, Accounting for the Impairment of
Long-Lived Assets and for Long-Lived Assets to Be Disposed Of SFAS 121,
but resolved certain implementation issues associated with that Statement. The
adoption of SFAS 144 did not have a material impact on the Companys consolidated
results of operations.
In accordance with SFAS 144, we review our long-lived assets related to each
restaurant to be held and used in the business, including any allocated intangible
assets subject to amortization, semi-annually for impairment, or whenever events or
changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of a restaurant may
not be recoverable. We evaluate restaurants using a two-year history of
operating losses as our primary indicator of potential impairment. Based on the
best information available, we write down an impaired restaurant to its estimated fair
market value, which becomes its new cost basis. We generally measure estimated fair
market value by discounting estimated future cash flows. In addition, when we
decide to close a restaurant it is reviewed for impairment and depreciable lives
are adjusted. The impairment evaluation is based on the estimated cash flows from
continuing use through the expected disposal date and the expected terminal value.
Store closure costs include costs of disposing of the assets as well as other
facility-related expenses from previously closed stores. These store closure costs
are expensed as incurred. Additionally, at the date the closure is considered
probable, we record a liability for the net present value of any remaining operating
lease obligations subsequent to the expected closure date, net of estimated sublease
income, if any.
Refranchising gains losses includes the gains or losses from the sales of
our restaurants to new and existing franchisees and the related initial franchise
fees, reduced by transaction costs and direct administrative costs of refranchising.
In executing our refranchising initiatives, we most often offer groups of
restaurants. We classify restaurants as held for sale and suspend depreciation and
amortization when a we make a decision to refranchise; b the stores can be
immediately removed from operations; c we have begun an active program to locate
a buyer; d significant changes to the plan of sale are not likely; and e the
sale is probable within one year. We recognize losses on refranchisings when the
restaurants are classified as held for sale. We recognize gains on restaurant
refranchisings when the sale transaction closes, the franchisee has a minimum amount
of the purchase price in at-risk equity, and we are satisfied that the franchisee
can meet its financial obligations. If the criteria for gain recognition are not
met, we defer the gain to the extent we have a remaining financial exposure in
connection with the sales transaction. Deferred gains are recognized when the
gain recognition criteria are met or as our financial exposure is reduced. When
we make a decision to retain a store previously held for sale, we revalue the store at
the lower of its a net book value at our original sale decision date less normal
depreciation and amortization that would have been recorded during the period held
for sale or b its current fair market value. This value becomes the stores new
cost basis. We charge or credit any difference between the stores carrying
amount and its new cost basis to refranchising gains losses. When we make a
decision to close a store previously held for sale, we reverse any previously
recognized refranchising loss and then record impairment and store closure costs
as described above. Refranchising gains losses also include charges for
estimated exposures related to 48 those partial guarantees of franchisee loan pools
and contingent lease liabilities which arose from refranchising activities. These
exposures are more fully discussed in Note 24.
SFAS 144 also requires the results of operations of a component entity that is
classified as held for sale or has been disposed of be reported as discontinued
operations in the Consolidated Statements of Income if certain conditions are met.
These conditions include elimination of the operations and cash flows of the
component entity from the ongoing operations of the Company and no significant
continuing involvement by the Company in the operations of the component entity after
the disposal transaction. The results of operations of stores meeting both these
conditions that were disposed of in 2002 or classified as held for sale at December
28, 2002 were not material for any of the three years ended December 28, 2002.
Considerable management judgment is necessary to estimate future cash flows,
including cash flows from continuing use, terminal value, closure costs, sublease
income, and refranchising proceeds. Accordingly, actual results could vary
significantly from our estimates.
Impairment of Investments in Unconsolidated Affiliates. Our methodology for
determining and measuring impairment of our investments in unconsolidated affiliates
is similar to the methodology we use for our restaurants except we use cash flows
after interest and taxes instead of cash flows before interest and taxes as we use for
our restaurants. Also, we record impairment charges related to investments in
unconsolidated affiliates if circumstances indicate that a decrease in the value of an
investment has occurred which is other than temporary.
Considerable management judgment is necessary to estimate future cash flows.
Accordingly, actual results could vary significantly from our estimates.
Cash and Cash Equivalents. Cash equivalents represent funds we have temporarily
invested with original maturities not exceeding three months as part of managing our
day-to-day operating cash receipts and disbursements.
Inventories. We value our inventories at the lower of cost computed on the
first-in, first-out method or net realizable value.
Property, Plant and Equipment. We state property, plant and equipment at cost
less accumulated depreciation and amortization, impairment writedowns and
valuation allowances. We calculate depreciation and amortization on a
straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of the assets as follows: 5
to 25 years for buildings and improvements, 3 to 20 years for machinery and
equipment and 3 to 7 years for capitalized software costs. As discussed above, we
suspend depreciation and amortization on assets related to restaurants that are held for
sale.
Internal Development Costs and Abandoned Site Costs. We capitalize direct costs
associated with the site acquisition and construction of a Company unit on that
site, including direct internal payroll and payroll-related costs. Only those
site-specific costs incurred subsequent to the time that the site acquisition is
considered probable are capitalized. We consider acquisition probable upon final
site approval. If we subsequently make a determination that a site for which internal
development costs have been capitalized will not be acquired or developed, any
previously capitalized internal development costs are expensed and included in general
and administrative expenses.
Goodwill and Intangible Assets. The Company has adopted SFAS No. 141, Business
Combinations SFAS 141. SFAS 141 requires the use of the purchase
method of accounting for all business combinations and modifies the application of the
purchase accounting method. Goodwill represents the excess of the cost of a
business acquired over the net of the amounts assigned to assets acquired,
including identifiable intangible assets, and liabilities assumed. SFAS 141
specifies criteria to be used in determining whether intangible assets acquired
in a purchase method business combination must be recognized and reported
separately from goodwill. We base amounts assigned to goodwill and other identifiable
intangible assets on independent appraisals or internal estimates. 49 The Company has also adopted SFAS No. 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets SFAS
142. SFAS 142 eliminates the requirement to amortize goodwill and
indefinite-lived intangible assets, addresses the amortization of intangible assets
with a defined life, and addresses impairment testing and recognition for goodwill
and indefinite-lived intangible assets. SFAS 142 applies to goodwill and intangible
assets arising from transactions completed both before and after its effective
date. As a result of adopting SFAS 142, we ceased amortization of goodwill and
indefinite-lived intangible assets beginning December 30, 2001. Prior to the
adoption of SFAS 142, we amortized goodwill on a straight-line basis up to 20
years and indefinite-lived intangible assets on a straight-line basis over 3 to 40
years. Amortizable intangible assets continue to be amortized on a straight-line
basis over 3 to 40 years. As discussed above, we suspend amortization on those
intangible assets with a defined life that are allocated to restaurants that are held
for sale.
In accordance with the requirements of SFAS 142, goodwill has been assigned to
reporting units for purposes of impairment testing. Our reporting units are our
operating segments in the U.S. see Note 23 and our business management units
internationally typically individual countries. Goodwill impairment tests
consist of a comparison of each reporting units fair value with its carrying
value. The fair value of a reporting unit is the amount for which the unit as a whole
could be sold in a current transaction between willing parties. We generally estimate
fair value based on discounted cash flows. If the carrying value of a reporting unit
exceeds its fair value, goodwill is written down to its implied fair value. As
required by SFAS 142, we completed transitional impairment tests of goodwill as of
December 30, 2001, which indicated that there was no impairment. We have selected
the beginning of our fourth quarter as the date on which to perform our ongoing
annual impairment test. As a result of the poor performance by our Pizza Hut France
reporting unit from the date of the transitional impairment test through September 8,
2002 the beginning of our fourth quarter, goodwill assigned to that reporting
unit of $5 million was deemed impaired and written off in the fourth quarter.
See Note 12 for further discussion of SFAS 142.
Stock-Based Employee Compensation. At December 28, 2002, the Company had four
stock-based employee compensation plans in effect, which are described more fully
in Note 18. The Company accounts for those plans under the recognition and
measurement principles of APB Opinion No. 25, Accounting for Stock Issued to
Employees, and related Interpretations. No stock-based employee compensation
cost is reflected in net income, as all options granted under those plans had an
exercise price equal to the market value of the underlying common stock on the date
of grant. The following table illustrates the effect on net income and earnings
per share if the Company had applied the fair value recognition provisions of SFAS
No. 123 Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation, to stock-based employee
compensation.

50 Derivative Financial Instruments. Our policy prohibits the use of derivative
instruments for trading purposes, and we have procedures in place to monitor and
control their use. Our use of derivative instruments has included interest rate swaps
and collars, treasury locks and foreign currency forward contracts. In addition, on
a limited basis we utilize commodity futures and options contracts. Our interest rate
and foreign currency derivative contracts are entered into with financial institutions
while our commodity derivative contracts are exchange traded.
We account for derivative financial instruments in accordance with SFAS No. 133,
Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities SFAS
133. SFAS 133 requires that all derivative instruments be recorded on the
Consolidated Balance Sheet at fair value. The accounting for changes in the fair
value i.e., gains or losses of a derivative instrument is dependent upon whether
the derivative has been designated and qualifies as part of a hedging relationship
and further, on the type of hedging relationship. For derivative instruments that are
designated and qualify as a fair value hedge, the gain or loss on the derivative
instrument as well as the offsetting gain or loss on the hedged item attributable to
the hedged risk are recognized in the results of operations. For derivative
instruments that are designated and qualify as a cash flow hedge, the effective
portion of the gain or loss on the derivative instrument is reported as a component
of other comprehensive income loss and reclassified into earnings in the same
period or periods during which the hedged transaction affects earnings. Any
ineffective portion of the gain or loss on the derivative instrument is recorded in
the results of operations immediately. For derivative instruments not designated as
hedging instruments, the gain or loss is recognized in the results of operations
immediately. See Note 16 for a discussion of our use of derivative instruments,
management of credit risk inherent in derivative instruments and fair value
information related to debt and interest rate swaps.
New Accounting Pronouncements Not Yet Adopted.
In June 2001, the Financial Accounting Standards Board FASB issued
SFAS No. 143, Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations SFAS 143.
SFAS 143 addresses the financial accounting and reporting for legal obligations
associated with the retirement of tangible long-lived assets and the associated asset
retirement costs. SFAS 143 is effective for the Company for fiscal year 2003. We
currently do not anticipate that the adoption of SFAS 143 will have a material
impact on our Consolidated Financial Statements.
In June 2002, the FASB issued SFAS No. 146, Accounting for Costs Associated
with Exit or Disposal Activities SFAS 146. SFAS 146 addresses
significant issues regarding the recognition, measurement, and reporting of costs
associated with exit or disposal activities, and nullifies Emerging Issues Task Force
Issue No. 94-3, Liability Recognition for Certain Employee Termination
Benefits and Other Costs to Exit an Activity including Certain Costs Incurred in
a Restructuring. Costs addressed by SFAS 146 include costs to terminate a
contract that is not a capital lease, costs of involuntary employee termination
benefits pursuant to a one-time benefit arrangement, costs to consolidate
facilities, and costs to relocate employees. SFAS 146 is effective for exit or
disposal activities that are initiated after December 31, 2002. Although SFAS 146
will change the timing of expense recognition for certain costs we incur while
closing restaurants or undertaking other exit or disposal activities, the timing
difference is not expected to be significant in length. We do not anticipate that
the adoption of SFAS 146 will have a material impact on our Consolidated
Financial Statements.
In December 2002, the FASB issued SFAS No. 148, Accounting for Stock-Based
Compensation - Transition and Disclosure SFAS 148. SFAS 148
provides alternative methods of transition for a voluntary change to the fair value
method of accounting for stock-based employee compensation as required by SFAS 123.
In addition, SFAS 148 amends the disclosure requirements of SFAS 123 to require more
prominent and more frequent disclosures in financial statements about the effects
of stock-based compensation. Our disclosure regarding the effects of stock-based
compensation included in these Notes is in compliance with SFAS 148.
In November 2002, the FASB issued Interpretation No. 45, Guarantors
Accounting and Disclosure Requirements for Guarantees, Including Indirect
Guarantees of Indebtedness to Others, an interpretation of FASB Statements No. 5, 57 and
107 and a rescission of FASB Interpretation No. 34 FIN 45. FIN 45
elaborates on the disclosures to be made by a 51 guarantor in its interim and annual
financial statements about its obligations under guarantees issued. FIN 45 also
clarifies that a guarantor is required to recognize, at inception of a guarantee, a
liability for the fair value of the obligation undertaken. The disclosure
requirements of FIN 45 are included in Note 24. The initial recognition and
measurement provisions are applicable to guarantees issued or modified after
December 31, 2002. As described in Note 24, we have in the past provided certain
guarantees that would have required recognition upon issuance or modification under
the provisions of FIN 45. While the nature of our business will likely result in
issuance of certain guarantee liabilities in the future, we do not anticipate that
FIN 45 will have a material impact on the Consolidated Financial Statements.
In January 2003, the FASB issued Interpretation No. 46, Consolidation of
Variable Interest Entities, an interpretation of ARB No. 51 FIN 46.
FIN 46 addresses the consolidation of entities whose equity holders have either
a not provided sufficient equity at risk to allow the entity to finance its own
activities or b do not possess certain characteristics of a controlling financial
interest. FIN 46 requires the consolidation of these entities, known as variable
interest entities VIEs, by a primary beneficiary of the entity. A
primary beneficiary is the entity, if any, that is subject to a majority of the risk
of loss from the VIEs activities, entitled to receive a majority of the VIEs residual
returns, or both. FIN 46 applies immediately to variable interests in VIEs created
or obtained after January 31, 2003. For variable interests in a VIE created
before February 1, 2003, FIN 46 is applied to the VIE no later than the end of the
first interim or annual reporting period beginning after June 15, 2003 the quarter
ending September 6, 2003 for the Company. The Interpretation requires certain
disclosures in financial statements issued after January 31, 2003, if it is reasonably
possible that the Company will consolidate or disclose information about variable
interest entities when the Interpretation becomes effective.
As discussed further in Note 24, we have posted $32 million of letters of credit
supporting our guarantee of franchisee loan pools. Additionally, we have provided a
standby letter of credit under which we could potentially be required to fund a
portion up to $25 million of one of the franchisee loan pools. The letters of
credit were issued under our existing bank credit agreement see Note 14. These
franchisee loan pools primarily funded purchases of restaurants from the Company
and, to a lesser extent, franchisee development of new restaurants. The total loans
outstanding under these loan pools were approximately $153 million and $180
million at December 28, 2002 and December 29, 2001, respectively. Our maximum
exposure to loss as a result of our involvement with these franchisee loan pools was
$57 million at December 28, 2002. We are in the process of determining if we are the
primary beneficiary of these VIEs. We currently believe that it is reasonably
possible we are the primary beneficiary and thus we would be required to
consolidate these VIEs, as they are currently structured, upon FIN 46 becoming
effective for the Company. We are currently evaluating alternative structures related
to these franchisee loan pools.
The Company along with representatives of the franchisee groups of each of
its Concepts has formed purchasing cooperatives for the purpose of purchasing
certain restaurant products and equipment in the U.S. Our equity ownership in each
cooperative is generally proportional to our percentage ownership of the U.S. system
units for the Concept. We are continuing to evaluate whether any of these
cooperatives are VIEs under the provisions of FIN 46 and, if so, whether we are the
primary beneficiary. We do not currently believe that consolidation will be
required for these cooperatives as a result of our adoption of FIN 46.
Note 3 - Two-for-One Common Stock Split
On May 7, 2002, the Company announced that its Board of Directors approved a
two-for-one split of the Companys outstanding shares of Common Stock. The stock
split was effected in the form of a stock dividend and entitled each shareholder
of record at the close of business on June 6, 2002 to receive one additional share
for every outstanding share of Common Stock held on the record date. The stock dividend
was distributed on June 17, 2002, with approximately 149 million shares of common
stock distributed. All per share and share amounts in the accompanying
Consolidated Financial Statements and Notes to the Financial Statements have been
adjusted to reflect the stock split. 52 Note 4 YGR Acquisition
On May 7, 2002, YUM completed its acquisition of YGR. At the date of acquisition,
YGR consisted of 742 and 496 company and franchise LJS units, respectively, and 127
and 742 company and franchise AW units, respectively. In addition, 133 multibranded
LJS/AW restaurants were included in the LJS unit totals. This acquisition was made
to facilitate our strategic objective of achieving growth through multibranding,
where two or more of our Concepts are operated in a single restaurant unit.
We paid approximately $275 million in cash and assumed approximately $48 million of
bank indebtedness in connection with the acquisition of YGR. The purchase price was
allocated to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on estimates of
their fair values at the date of acquisition. We determined these fair values with
the assistance of a third party valuation expert.
The following table summarizes the fair values of YGRs assets acquired
and liabilities assumed at the date of acquisition.

Of the $250 million in acquired intangible assets, $212 million was assigned to
brands/trademarks, which have indefinite lives and are not subject to amortization.
The remaining acquired intangible assets primarily consist of franchise contract
rights which will be amortized over thirty years, the typical term of a YGR
franchise agreement including renewals. Of the $212 million in brands/trademarks
approximately $191 million and $21 million were assigned to the U.S. and International
operating segments, respectively. Of the $38 million in intangible assets subject to
amortization, approximately $31 million and $7 million were assigned to the U.S. and
International operating segments, respectively.
The $209 million in goodwill was primarily assigned to the U.S. operating
segment. As we acquired the stock of YGR, none of the goodwill is expected to be
deductible for income tax purposes.
Liabilities assumed included approximately $48 million of bank indebtedness that
was paid off prior to the end of the second quarter of 2002 and approximately $11
million in capital lease obligations. We also assumed approximately $168 million in
present value of future rent obligations related to existing sale-leaseback
agreements entered into by YGR involving approximately 350 LJS units. As a result
of liens held by the buyer/lessor on certain personal property within the units,
the sale-leaseback agreements have been accounted for as financings and reflected as debt.
Additionally, as of the date of acquisition we recorded approximately $49 million
of reserves exit liabilities related to our plans to consolidate
certain support functions, and exit certain markets through store refranchisings and
closures, as presented in the table below. The consolidation of certain support
functions included the termination of approximately 53 100 employees. Plans associated
with exiting certain markets through store refranchisings and closures are expected to
be finalized prior to May 7, 2003. Adjustments to the purchase price allocation
related to the finalization of these plans are not expected to be material. The unpaid
exit liabilities as of December 28, 2002 have been reflected on our Consolidated
Balance Sheet as accounts payable and other current liabilities $30 million and other
liabilities and deferred credits $10 million. Amounts recorded as other
liabilities and deferred credits are expected to result in payments principally in 2004.

Additionally, we expensed approximately $6 million of integration costs related to
the acquisition in 2002. These costs were recorded as unusual items expense. See Note 7
for further discussion regarding unusual items income expense.
The results of operations for YGR have been included in our
Consolidated Financial Statements since the date of acquisition. If the acquisition
had been completed as of the beginning of the years ended December 28, 2002 and
December 29, 2001, pro forma Company sales, and franchise and license fees would have
been as follows   
2002

The impact of the acquisition, including interest expense on debt incurred to finance
the acquisition, on net income and diluted earnings per share would not have been
significant in 2002 and 2001.
The pro forma information is not necessarily indicative of the results of
operations had the acquisition actually occurred at the beginning of each of these
periods nor is it necessarily indicative of future results.

the computation of diluted EPS because their exercise prices were greater than the
average market price of our Common Stock during the year.

Note 12 Goodwill and Intangible Assets
The Companys business combinations have included acquiring restaurants from
our franchisees. Prior to the adoption of SFAS 141, the primary intangible asset
to which we generally allocated value in these business combinations was
reacquired franchise rights. We determined that reacquired franchise rights did not
meet the criteria of SFAS 141 to be recognized as an asset apart from goodwill.
Accordingly, on December 30, 2001, we reclassified $241 million of reacquired
franchise rights to goodwill, net of related deferred tax liabilities of $53 million.
The changes in the carrying amount of goodwill, net for the year ended December 28,
2002 is as follows

As noted above, on December 30, 2001, we reclassified $241 million of
reacquired franchise rights to goodwill, net of related deferred tax liabilities of $53
million.
As a result of adopting SFAS 142, we ceased amortization of goodwill and
indefinite-lived intangible assets beginning December 30, 2001. Amortization
expense for definite-lived intangible assets was $6 million in 2002. Amortization
expense for goodwill and all intangible assets was $37 million and $38 million
in 2001 and 2000, respectively. Amortization expense for definite-lived intangible
assets will approximate $5 million for each of the next five years.

On June 25, 2002, we closed on a new $14 billion senior unsecured Revolving
Credit Facility the New Credit Facility. The New Credit Facility
replaced the existing bank credit agreement which was comprised of a senior
unsecured Term Loan Facility and a $175 billion senior unsecured Revolving Credit
Facility collectively referred to as the Old Credit Facilities that
were scheduled to mature on October 2, 2002. Amounts outstanding under the Old Credit
Facilities were classified as short-term borrowings in the Consolidated Balance Sheet
at December 29, 2001. On December 27, 2002, we voluntarily reduced our maximum
borrowing limit under the New Credit Facility to $12 billion. The New Credit
Facility matures on June 25, 2005. We used the initial borrowings under the New
Credit Facility to repay the indebtedness under the Old Credit Facilities.
The New Credit Facility is unconditionally guaranteed by our principal domestic
subsidiaries and contains other terms and provisions including representations,
warranties, covenants, conditions and events of default similar to those set forth in
the Old Credit Facilities. Specifically, the New Credit Facility contains financial
covenants relating to maintenance of leverage and fixed charge coverage ratios. The
New Credit Facility also contains affirmative and negative covenants including, among
other things, limitations on certain additional indebtedness, guarantees of
indebtedness, cash dividends, aggregate non-U.S. investment and certain other
transactions as defined in the agreement. 61 Under the terms of the New Credit Facility, we may borrow up to the maximum
borrowing limit less outstanding letters of credit. At December 28, 2002, our unused
New Credit Facility totaled $09 billion, net of outstanding letters of credit of $02
billion. The interest rate for borrowings under the New Credit Facility ranges from
100% to 200% over the London Interbank Offered Rate LIBOR or 000% to
065% over an Alternate Base Rate, which is the greater of the Prime Rate or the
Federal Funds Effective Rate plus 1%. The exact spread over LIBOR or the
Alternate Base Rate, as applicable, will depend upon our performance under
specified financial criteria. Interest is payable at least quarterly. In the
third quarter of 2002, we capitalized debt issuance costs of approximately $9 million
related to the New Credit Facility. The costs will be amortized into interest
expense over the life of the New Credit Facility. At December 28, 2002, the
weighted average contractual interest rate on borrowings outstanding under the New
Credit Facility was 26%.
In 2002, we expensed facility fees of approximately $5 million, which was
comprised of $3 million related to the New Credit Facility and $2 million related to
the Old Credit Facilities, prior to being replaced. In both 2001 and 2000, we
expensed facility fees of approximately $4 million related to the Old Credit Facilities.
In 1997, we filed a shelf registration statement with the Securities and Exchange
Commission for offerings of up to $2 billion of senior unsecured debt. In June 2002,
we issued $400 million of 770% Senior Unsecured Notes due July 1, 2012 the 2012
Notes. The net proceeds from the issuance of the 2012 Notes were used to repay
indebtedness under the New Credit Facility. Additionally, we capitalized debt
issuance costs of approximately $5 million related to the 2012 Notes in the third
quarter of 2002. The following table summarizes all Senior Unsecured Notes
issued under this shelf registration through December 28, 2002

As discussed in Note 4, upon the acquisition of YGR, we assumed approximately $168
million in present value of future rent obligations related to certain
sale-leaseback agreements entered into by YGR involving approximately 350 LJS
units. As a result of liens held by the buyer/lessor on certain personal property
within the units, the sale-leaseback agreements have been accounted for as financings
and are reflected as debt in our Consolidated Financial Statements as of December 28,
2002. Rental payments made under these agreements will be made on a monthly basis
through 2019 with an effective interest rate of approximately 11%. 62 The annual maturities of long-term debt as of December 28, 2002, excluding capital
lease obligations of $99 million and derivative instrument adjustments of $44 million,
are as follows   Year ended:

Interest expense on short-term borrowings and long-term debt was $180 million 172 million and $190 million in 2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively. Net interest
expense of $9 million on incremental borrowings related to the AmeriServe bankruptcy
reorganization process was included in unusual items income expense in 2000.
Note 15 Leases
We have non-cancelable commitments under both capital and long-term operating
leases, primarily for our restaurants. Capital and operating lease commitments
expire at various dates through 2087 and, in many cases, provide for rent
escalations and renewal options. Most leases require us to pay related executory
costs, which include property taxes, maintenance and insurance.
Future minimum commitments and amounts to be received as lessor or sublessor under
non-cancelable leases are set forth below

Derivative Instruments
Interest Rates - We enter into interest rate swaps and forward rate agreements
with the objective of reducing our exposure to interest rate risk and lowering
interest expense for a portion of our debt. Under the contracts, we agree with other
parties to exchange, at specified intervals, the difference between variable rate
and fixed rate amounts calculated on a notional principal amount. At both December
28, 2002 and December 29, 2001, we had outstanding pay-variable interest rate
swaps with notional amounts of $350 million. These swaps have reset dates and floating
rate indices which match those of our underlying fixed-rate debt and have been
designated as fair value hedges of a portion of that debt. As the swaps qualify for the
short-cut method under SFAS 133 no ineffectiveness has been recorded. The fair
value of these swaps as of December 28, 2002 and December 29, 2001 was approximately
$48 million and $36 million, respectively, and has been included in other assets.
The portion of this fair value which has not yet been recognized as a reduction to
interest expense approximately $44 million and $34 million at December 28, 2002 and
December 29, 2001, respectively has been included in long-term debt.
During the second quarter of 2002, we entered into treasury locks with notional
amounts totaling $250 million. These treasury locks were entered into to hedge the
risk of changes in future interest payments attributable to changes in the benchmark
interest rate prior to issuance of additional fixed-rate debt. These locks were
designated and effective in offsetting the variability in cash flows associated with
the future interest payments on a portion of the 2012 Notes. Thus, the insignificant
loss at which these treasury locks were settled will be recognized as an increase to
interest on the debt through 2012.
At December 29, 2001, we had outstanding pay-fixed interest rate swaps with a
notional amount of $650 million. These swaps had been designated as cash flow
hedges of a portion of our variable-rate debt. As the critical terms of the swaps
and hedged interest payments were the same, we determined that the swaps were
completely effective in offsetting the variability in cash flows associated with
interest payments on that debt due to interest rate fluctuations. During 2002, due
to decreased borrowings under our New Credit Facility, interest rate swaps with a
notional amount of $150 million were terminated. An insignificant amount was
reclassed from accumulated other comprehensive income to interest expense as a result
of this termination. The remaining interest swaps with notional amounts of $500
million matured during 2002.
Foreign Exchange - We enter into foreign currency forward contracts with the
objective of reducing our exposure to cash flow volatility arising from foreign
currency fluctuations associated with certain foreign currency denominated
financial instruments, the majority of which are intercompany short-term receivables
and payables. The notional amount, maturity date, and currency of these contracts match
those of the underlying receivables or payables. For those foreign currency exchange
forward contracts that we have designated as cash flow hedges, we measure
ineffectiveness by comparing the cumulative change in the forward contract with the
cumulative change in the hedged item. No ineffectiveness was recognized in 2002 or
2001 for those foreign currency forward contracts designated as cash flow hedges.
Commodities - We also utilize on a limited basis commodity futures and options
contracts to mitigate our exposure to commodity price fluctuations over the next
twelve months. Those contracts have not been designated as hedges under SFAS 133.
Commodity future and options contracts entered into for the fiscal years ended December
28, 2002 and December 29, 2001 did not significantly impact the Consolidated Financial
Statements.
Deferred Amounts in Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income Loss - As of December
28, 2002, we had a net deferred loss associated with cash flow hedges of
approximately $2 million, net of tax. Of this amount, we estimate that a net
after-tax loss of less than $1 million will be reclassified into earnings through
December 27, 2003. The remaining net after-tax loss of approximately $2 million,
which arose from the settlement of treasury locks entered into prior to the issuance of
certain amounts of our fixed-rate debt, will be reclassified into earnings from
December 28, 2003 through 2012 as an increase to interest expense on this debt. 64 Credit Risks
Credit risk from interest rate swap, treasury lock and forward rate agreements
and foreign exchange contracts is dependent both on movement in interest and
currency rates and the possibility of non-payment by counterparties. We mitigate
credit risk by entering into these agreements with high-quality counterparties, and
netting swap and forward rate payments within contracts.
Accounts receivable consists primarily of amounts due from franchisees and
licensees for initial and continuing fees. In addition, we have notes and lease
receivables from certain of our franchisees. The financial condition of these
franchisees and licensees is largely dependent upon the underlying business trends of
our Concepts. This concentration of credit risk is mitigated, in part, by the
large number of franchisees and licensees of each Concept and the short-term
nature of the franchise and license fee receivables.
Fair Value
At December 28, 2002 and December 29, 2001, the fair values of cash and cash
equivalents, short-term investments, accounts receivable, and accounts payable
approximated carrying value because of the short-term nature of these instruments.
The fair value of notes receivable approximate carrying value after consideration of
recorded allowances.

Pension Benefits
We sponsor noncontributory defined benefit pension plans covering substantially all
full-time U.S. salaried employees, certain hourly employees and certain international
employees. During 2001, the YUM Retirement Plan the Plan was amended
such that any salaried employee hired or rehired by YUM after September 30, 2001
will not be eligible to participate in the Plan. Benefits are based on years of
service and earnings or stated amounts for each year of service.
Postretirement Medical Benefits
Our postretirement plan provides health care benefits, principally to U.S. salaried
retirees and their dependents. This plan includes retiree cost sharing provisions.
During 2001, the plan was amended such that any salaried employee hired or rehired by
YUM after September 30, 2001 will not be eligible to participate in this plan.
Employees hired prior to September 30, 2001 are eligible for benefits if they
meet age and service requirements and qualify for retirement benefits.

We have assumed the annual increase in cost of postretirement medical benefits was
120% for both non-Medicare eligible retirees and Medicare eligible retirees in
2002 and will be 120% for both in 2003. We are assuming the rates for non-Medicare
and Medicare eligible retirees will decrease to an ultimate rate of 55% by 2011 and
remain at that level thereafter. There is a cap on our medical liability for certain
retirees. The cap for Medicare eligible retirees was reached in 2000 and the cap for
non-Medicare eligible retirees is expected to be reached between the years 2007-2008;
once the cap is reached, our annual cost per retiree will not increase.
Assumed health care cost trend rates have a significant effect on the amounts
reported for our postretirement health care plans. A one percent increase or
decrease in the assumed health care cost trend rates would have increased or
decreased our accumulated postretirement benefit obligation at December 28, 2002 by
approximately $2 million. The impact on our 2002 benefit cost would not have been
significant.
Note 18 Stock-Based Employee Compensation
At year-end 2002, we had four stock option plans in effect: the YUM! Brands,
Inc. Long-Term Incentive Plan 1999 LTIP, the 1997 Long-Term Incentive
Plan 1997 LTIP, the YUM! Brands, Inc. Restaurant General Manager Stock
Option Plan YUMBUCKS and the YUM! Brands, Inc. SharePower Plan SharePower.
We may grant awards of up to 152 million shares and 450 million shares of stock
under the 1999 LTIP and 1997 LTIP, respectively. Potential awards to employees and
non-employee directors under the 1999 LTIP include stock options, incentive stock
options, stock appreciation rights, restricted stock, stock units, restricted stock
units, performance shares and performance units. Potential awards to employees and
non-employee directors under the 1997 LTIP include stock appreciation rights,
restricted stock and performance restricted stock units. Prior to January 1, 2002, we
also could grant stock options and incentive stock options under the 1997 LTIP.
We have issued only stock options and performance restricted stock units under the
1997 LTIP and have issued only stock options under the 1999 LTIP.
We may grant stock options under the 1999 LTIP to purchase shares at a price equal to
or greater than the average market price of the stock on the date of grant. New option
grants under the 1999 LTIP can have varying vesting provisions and exercise periods.
Previously granted options under the 1997 LTIP and 1999 LTIP vest in periods ranging
from immediate to 2006and expire ten to fifteen years after grant.
We may grant options to purchase up to 150 million shares of stock under YUMBUCKS
at a price equal to or greater than the average market price of the stock on the date
of grant. YUMBUCKS options granted have a four year vesting period and expire ten
years after grant. We may grant options to purchase up to 140 million shares of
stock at a price equal to or greater than the average market price of the stock on
the date of grant under SharePower. Previously granted SharePower options have
expirations through 2006. 68 At the Spin-off Date, we converted certain of the unvested options to purchase
PepsiCo stock that were held by our employees to YUM stock options under either the
1997 LTIP or SharePower. We converted the options at amounts and exercise prices
that maintained the amount of unrealized stock appreciation that existed
immediately prior to the Spin-off. The vesting dates and exercise periods of the
options were not affected by the conversion. Based on their original PepsiCo grant
date, these converted options vest in periods ranging from one to ten years and
expire ten to fifteen years after grant.
We estimated the fair value of each option grant made during 2002, 2001 and
2000 as of the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model with the

69 In November 1997, we granted two awards of performance restricted stock units
of YUMs Common Stock to our Chief Executive Officer CEO. The
awards were made under the 1997 LTIP and may be paid in Common Stock or cash at the
discretion of the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors. Payment of an
award of $27 million was contingent upon the CEOs continued employment
through January25, 2001 and our attainment of certain pre-established earnings
thresholds. In January 2001, our CEO received a cash payment of $27 million
following the Compensation Committees certification of YUMs attainment
of the pre-established earnings threshold. Payment of an award of $36 million is
contingent upon his employment through January 25, 2006 and our attainment of
certain pre-established earnings thresholds. The annual expense related to these
awards included in earnings was $04 million for 2002, $05 million for 2001 and $13
million for 2000.
Note 19 Other Compensation and Benefit Programs
We sponsor two deferred compensation benefit programs, the Restaurant Deferred
Compensation Plan and the Executive Income Deferral Program the RDC Plan and
the EID Plan, respectively for eligible employees and non-employee
directors.
Effective October 1, 2001, participants can no longer defer funds into the RDC
Plan. Prior to that date, the RDC Plan allowed participants to defer a portion of
their annual salary. The participants balances will remain in the RDC Plan
until their scheduled distribution dates. As defined by the RDC Plan, we credit the
amounts deferred with earnings based on the investment options selected by the
participants. Investment options in the RDC Plan consist of phantom shares of various
mutual funds and YUM Common Stock. We recognize compensation expense for the
appreciation or depreciation, if any, attributable to all investments in the RDC
Plan, and prior to October 1, 2001, for any matching contributions. Our obligations
under the RDC program as of the end of 2002 and 2001 were $10 million and $13
million, respectively. We recognized annual compensation expense of less than $1
million in 2002, $3 million in 2001 and $1 million in 2000 for the RDC Plan.
The EID Plan allows participants to defer receipt of a portion of their annual
salary and all or a portion of their incentive compensation. As defined by the EID
Plan, we credit the amounts deferred with earnings based on the investment
options selected by the participants. These investment options are limited to cash and
phantom shares of our Common Stock. The EID Plan allows participants to defer
incentive compensation to purchase phantom shares of our Common Stock at a 25%
discount from the average market price at the date of deferral the Discount
Stock Account. Participants bear the risk of forfeiture of both the discount
and any amounts deferred to the Discount Stock Account if they voluntarily separate
from employment during the two year vesting period. We expense the intrinsic value
of the discount over the vesting period. As investments in the phantom shares of our Common Stock can only be settled in
shares of our Common Stock, we do not recognize compensation expense for the
appreciation or the depreciation, if any, of these investments. Deferrals into the
phantom shares of our Common Stock are credited to the Common Stock Account.
Our cash obligations under the EID Plan as of the end of both 2002 and 2001 were $24
million. We recognized compensation expense of $2
million in 2002, $4 million in 2001 and $6 million in 2000 for the EID Plan.
We sponsor a contributory plan to provide retirement benefits under the
provisions of Section 401k of the Internal Revenue Code the 401k Plan
for eligible U.S. salaried and hourly employees. During 2002, participants were able
to elect to contribute up to 15% of eligible compensation on a pre-tax basis the
maximum participant contribution increased from 15% to 25% effective January 1,
2003. Participants may allocate their contributions to one or any combination of
10 investment options within the 401k Plan. Effective October 1, 2001, the 401k
Plan was amended such that the Company matches 100% of the participants
contribution up to 3% of eligible compensation and 50% of the participants
contribution on the next 2% of eligible compensation. Prior to this amendment, we
made a discretionary matching contribution equal to a predetermined percentage of
each participants contribution to the YUM Common Stock Fund. We determined our
percentage match at the beginning of each year based on the immediate prior year
performance 70 of our Concepts. All matching contributions are made to the YUM Common
Stock Fund. We recognized as compensation expense our total matching contribution of
$8 million in 2002, $5 million in 2001 and $4 million in 2000.
Note 20 Shareholders Rights Plan
In July 1998, our Board of Directors declared a dividend distribution of one
right for each share of Common Stock outstanding as of August 3, 1998 the Record
Date. As a result of the two-for-one stock split distributed on June 17,
2002, each holder of Common Stock is entitled to one right for every two shares of
Common Stock one-half right per share. Each right initially entitles the
registered holder to purchase a unit consisting of one one-thousandth of a share a
Unit of Series A Junior Participating Preferred Stock, without par
value, at a purchase price of $130 per Unit, subject to adjustment. The rights,
which do not have voting rights, will become exercisable for our Common Stock ten
business days following a public announcement that a person or group has acquired,
or has commenced or intends to commence a tender offer for, 15% or more, or 20% or
more if such person or group owned 10% or more on the adoption date of this plan, of
our Common Stock. In the event the rights become exercisable for Common Stock, each
right will entitle its holder other than the Acquiring Person as defined in the
Agreement to purchase, at the rights then-current exercise price, YUM
Common Stock having a value of twice the exercise price of the right. In the event
the rights become exercisable for Common Stock and thereafter we are acquired in a
merger or other business combination, each right will entitle its holder to purchase,
at the rights then-current exercise price, common stock of the acquiring company
having a value of twice the exercise price of the right.
We can redeem the rights in their entirety, prior to becoming exercisable, at
$001 per right under certain specified conditions. The rights expire on July 21,
2008, unless we extend that date or we have earlier redeemed or exchanged the rights
as provided in the Agreement.
This description of the rights is qualified in its entirety by reference to
the Rights Agreement between YUM and BankBoston, N.A., as Rights Agent, dated as of
July 21, 1998 including the exhibits thereto.
Note 21 - Share Repurchase Program
In November 2002, our Board of Directors authorized a new share repurchase
program. This program authorizes us to repurchase, through November 20, 2004, up
to $300 million excluding applicable transaction fees of our outstanding Common
Stock. During 2002, we repurchased approximately 12 million shares for approximately
$28 million at an average price per share of approximately $24 under this program.
At December 28, 2002, approximately $272 million remained available for repurchases
under this program. Based on market conditions and other factors, additional
repurchases may be made from time to time in the open market or through privately
negotiated transactions at the discretion of the Company.
In February 2001, our Board of Directors authorized a share repurchase
program. This program authorized us to repurchase up to $300 million excluding
applicable transaction fees of our outstanding Common Stock. This share
repurchase program was completed in 2002. During 2002, we repurchased
approximately 70 million shares for approximately $200 million at an average
price per share of approximately $29 under this program. During 2001, we
repurchased approximately 48 million shares for approximately $100 million at
an average price per share of approximately $21 under this program.
In 1999, our Board of Directors authorized a share repurchase program. This
program authorized us to repurchase up to $350 million excluding applicable
transaction fees of our outstanding Common Stock. This share repurchase program was
completed in 2000. During 2000, we repurchased approximately 128 million shares for
approximately $216 million at an average price per share of approximately $17. In
total, we repurchased approximately 195 million shares for approximately $350
million at an average price per share of approximately $18 under this program. 71 Note 22 - Income Taxes

Taxes payable were reduced by $49 million, $13 million and $5 million in 2002, 2001
and 2000, respectively, as a result of stock option exercises. In addition,
goodwill and other intangibles were reduced by $8 million in 2001 as a result of the
settlement of a disputed claim with the Internal Revenue Service relating to the
deductibility of reacquired franchise rights and other intangibles offset by an $8
million reduction in deferred and accrued taxes payable.
In 2002, valuation allowances related to deferred tax assets in certain states and
foreign countries were increased by $1 million and $6 million, respectively,
primarily as a result of determining that it is more likely than not that certain
losses would not be utilized prior to expiration.
In 2001, valuation allowances related to deferred tax assets in certain states and
foreign countries were reduced by $9 million $6 million, net of federal tax and $6
million, respectively, as a result of making a determination that it is more likely
than not that these assets will be utilized in the current and future years. In 2000,
valuation allowances related to deferred tax assets in certain states and foreign
countries were reduced by $35 million $23 million, net of federal tax and $6
million, respectively, as a result of making a determination that it is more likely
than not that these assets will be utilized in the current and future years.
The deferred foreign tax provision for both 2002 and 2001 included a $2 million
charge to reflect the impact of changes in statutory tax rates in various countries.
The impact of statutory rate changes in foreign countries was less than $1 million in
2000.

A determination of the unrecognized deferred tax liability for temporary
differences related to our investments in foreign subsidiaries and investments in
foreign unconsolidated affiliates that are essentially permanent in duration is not
practicable.
We have available net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards totaling
approximately $13 billion at December 28, 2002 to reduce future tax of YUM and
certain subsidiaries. The carryforwards are related to a number of foreign and
state jurisdictions. Of these carryforwards, $4 million expire in 2003 and $11
billion expire at various times between 2004 and 2020. The remaining carryforwards of
approximately $179 million do not expire. 73 Note 23 Reportable Operating Segments
We are principally engaged in developing, operating, franchising and licensing
the worldwide KFC, Pizza Hut and Taco Bell concepts, and since May 7, 2002, the LJS
and AW concepts, which were added when we acquired YGR. KFC, Pizza Hut, Taco Bell,
LJS and AW operate throughout the U.S. and in 88, 85, 12, 5 and 17 countries and
territories outside the U.S., respectively. Our five largest international markets
based on operating profit in 2002 are China, United Kingdom, Canada, Australia and
Korea. At December 28, 2002, we had investments in 10 unconsolidated affiliates
outside the U.S. which operate principally KFC and/or Pizza Hut restaurants. These
unconsolidated affiliates operate in Canada, China, Japan, Poland and the United
Kingdom. Additionally, we had an investment in an unconsolidated affiliate in the
U.S. which operates Yan Can restaurants.
We identify our operating segments based on management responsibility within the
U.S. and International. For purposes of applying SFAS No. 131, Disclosure About
Segments of An Enterprise and Related Information SFAS 131, we
consider LJS and AW to be a single segment. We consider our KFC, Pizza Hut, Taco
Bell and LJS/AW operating segments to be similar and therefore have aggregated
them into a single reportable operating segment. Within our International
operating segment, no individual country was considered material under the SFAS 131
requirements related to information about geographic areas and therefore, none have
been reported separately.

Note 24 Guarantees, Commitments and Contingencies
Lease Guarantees
As a result of a assigning our interest in and obligations under real
estate leases as a condition to the refranchising of certain Company restaurants;
b contributing certain Company restaurants to unconsolidated affiliates; and c
guaranteeing certain other leases we are frequently contingently liable on lease
agreements. These leases have varying terms, the latest of which expires in 2030. As
of December 28, 2002 and December 29, 2001, the potential amount of undiscounted
payments we could be required to make in the event of non-payment by the primary lessee
was $388 million and $435 million, respectively. The present values of these
potential payments discounted at our pre-tax cost of debt at December 28, 2002 and
December 29, 2001, were $278 million and $293 million, respectively. Current
franchisees are the primary lessees under the vast majority of these leases. We
generally have cross-default provisions with these franchisees that would put them
in default of their franchise agreement in the event of non-payment under the lease. We
believe these cross-default provisions significantly reduce the risk that we will be
required to make payments under these leases. Accordingly, the liability recorded
for our exposure under such leases at December 28, 2002 and December 29, 2001, was not
significant.
Guarantees Supporting Financial Arrangements of Certain Franchisees,
Unconsolidated Affiliates and Other Third Parties
At December 28, 2002 and December 29, 2001, we had guaranteed approximately $32
million of financial arrangements of certain franchisees, including partial
guarantees of franchisee loan pools related primarily to the Companys
refranchising programs. The total loans outstanding under these loan pools were
approximately $153 million at December 28, 2002. In support of these guarantees, we
have posted $32 million of letters of credit. We also provide a 75 standby letter of
credit under which we could potentially be required to fund a portion up to $25
million of one of the franchisee loan pools. Any funding under the guarantees or
letters of credit would be secured by the franchisee loans and any related
collateral. We believe that we have appropriately provided for our estimated probable
exposures under these contingent liabilities. These provisions were primarily charged
to refranchising gains losses.
We have guaranteed certain financial arrangements of unconsolidated affiliates
and third parties. These financial arrangements primarily include lines of credit,
loans and letters of credit and totaled $41 million and $28 million at December 28,
2002 and December 29, 2001, respectively. If all such lines of credit and letters of
credit were fully drawn down, the maximum contingent liability under these
arrangements would be approximately $53 million and $56 million as of December 28,
2002 and December 29, 2001, respectively. We have varying levels of recourse
provisions and collateral that mitigate our risk under these guarantees. Accordingly,
we have no recorded liability as of December 28, 2002 or December 29, 2001.
Insurance Programs
We are currently self-insured for a portion of our current and prior years workers compensation,
employment practices liability, general liability and automobile liability losses
collectively, casualty losses as well as property losses and certain
other insurable risks. To mitigate the cost of our exposures for certain property
and casualty losses, we make annual decisions to either retain the risks of loss up
to certain maximum per occurrence or aggregate loss limits negotiated with our
insurance carriers, or to fully insure those risks. Since the Spin-off, we have
elected to retain the risks subject to certain insured limitations. Since August
1999, we have bundled our risks for casualty losses, property losses and various
other insurable risks into one pool with a single self-insured retention and
purchased reinsurance coverage up to a specified limit that is significantly above our
actuarially determined probable losses. We are self-insured for losses in excess of the
reinsurance limit; however, we believe the likelihood of losses exceeding the
reinsurance limit is remote. We are also self-insured for healthcare claims for
eligible participating employees subject to certain deductibles and limitations. We
have accounted for our retained liabilities for property and casualty losses and
healthcare claims, including reported and incurred but not reported claims, based on
information provided by independent actuaries.
Due to the inherent volatility of our actuarially determined property and
casualty loss estimates, it is reasonably possible that we could experience changes
in estimated losses which could be material to our growth in quarterly and annual net
income. We believe that we have recorded our reserves for property and casualty
losses at a level which has substantially mitigated the potential negative impact of
adverse developments and/or volatility.
Change of Control Severance Agreements
In September 2000, the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors approved
renewing severance agreements with certain key executives the Agreements.
These Agreements are triggered by a termination, under certain conditions, of the
executives employment following a change in control of the Company, as defined in
the Agreements. If triggered, the affected executives would generally receive
twice the amount of both their annual base salary and their annual incentive in a lump
sum, a proportionate bonus at the higher of target or actual performance, outplacement
services and a tax gross-up for any excise taxes. These Agreements have a three-year
term and automatically renew each January 1 for another three-year term unless the
Company elects not to renew the Agreements. If these Agreements had been triggered as
of December 28, 2002, payments of approximately $33 million would have been
made. In the event of a change of control, rabbi trusts would be established and
used to provide payouts under existing deferred and incentive compensation plans. 76 Litigation
We are subject to various claims and contingencies related to lawsuits, taxes,
environmental and other matters arising out of the normal course of business. Like
certain other large retail employers, the Company has been faced in certain states
with allegations of purported class-wide wage and hour violations.
On August 29, 1997, a class action lawsuit against Taco Bell Corp., entitled Bravo,
et al. v. Taco Bell Corp. Bravo, was filed in the Circuit Court of the
State of Oregon of the County of Multnomah. The lawsuit was filed by two former Taco
Bell shift managers purporting to represent approximately 17,000 current and former
hourly employees statewide. The lawsuit alleges violations of state wage and hour
laws, principally involving unpaid wages including overtime, and rest and meal
period violations, and seeks an unspecified amount in damages. Under Oregon class
action procedures, Taco Bell was allowed an opportunity to cure the
unpaid wage and hour allegations by opening a claims process to all putative class
members prior to certification of the class. In this cure process, Taco Bell paid
out less than $1 million. On January 26, 1999, the Court certified a class of all
current and former shift managers and crew members who claim one or more of the alleged
violations. A Court-approved notice and claim form was mailed to approximately 14,500
class members on January 31, 2000. Trial began on January 4, 2001. On March 9, 2001,
the jury reached verdicts on the substantive issues in this matter. A number of these
verdicts were in favor of the Taco Bell position; however, certain issues were
decided in favor of the plaintiffs. In April 2002, a jury trial to determine the
damages of 93 of those claimants found that Taco Bell failed to pay for certain
meal breaks and/or off-the-clock work for 86 of the 93 claimants. However, the
total amount of hours awarded by the jury was substantially less than that sought
by the claimants. In July and September 2002, the court ruled on several post-trial
motions, including fixing the total number of potential claimants at 1,031 including
the 93 claimants for which damages have already been determined and holding that
claimants who prevail are entitled to prejudgment interest and penalty wages. The court
has indicated that it will likely schedule a damages trial for the remaining 938
claimants sometime in 2003. Taco Bell intends to appeal the April 2002 damages
verdict, as well as the March 2001 liability verdict.
We have provided for the estimated costs of the Bravo litigation, based on a projection of eligible claims including
claims filed to date, where applicable, the amount of each eligible claim, including the estimated legal fees incurred
by plaintiffs, and the results of settlement negotiations in this and other wage and hour litigation matters. Although
the outcome of this case cannot be determined at this time, we believe the ultimate cost in excess of the amounts
already provided will not be material to our annual results of operations, financial condition or cash flows. Any
provisions have been recorded as unusual items.
On January 16, 1998, a lawsuit against Taco Bell Corp., entitled Wrench LLC,
Joseph Shields and Thomas Rinks v. Taco Bell Corp. Wrench was filed in
the United States District Court for the Western District of Michigan. The lawsuit
alleges that Taco Bell Corp. misappropriated certain ideas and concepts used in its
advertising featuring a Chihuahua. Plaintiffs seek to recover monetary damages under
several theories, including breach of implied-in-fact contract, idea
misappropriation, conversion and unfair competition. On June 10, 1999, the District
Court granted summary judgment in favor of Taco Bell Corp. Plaintiffs filed an
appeal with the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit the Court of
Appeals, and oral arguments were held on September 20, 2000. On July 6, 2001,
the Court of Appeals reversed the District Courts judgment in favor of Taco
Bell Corp. and remanded the case to the District Court. Taco Bell Corp.
unsuccessfully petitioned the Court of Appeals for rehearing en banc, and its
petition for writ of certiorari to the United States Supreme Court was denied on
January 21, 2002. The case has now officially been returned to the District Court,
where the Wrench plaintiffs will be allowed to bring their claims to trial. It is
expected that the trial will commence in May 2003.
We believe that the Wrench plaintiffs claims are without merit and are
vigorously defending the case. However, in view of the inherent uncertainties of
litigation, the outcome of the case cannot be predicted at this time. Likewise, the
amount of any potential loss cannot be reasonably estimated. 77 Obligations to PepsiCo, Inc. After Spin-off
In connection with the Spin-off, we entered into separation and other related
agreements the Separation Agreements governing the Spin-off and our
subsequent relationship with PepsiCo. These agreements provide certain indemnities
to PepsiCo.
The Separation Agreements provided for, among other things, our assumption of all
liabilities relating to the restaurant businesses, including California Pizza Kitchen,
Chevys Mexican Restaurant, DAngelos Sandwich Shops, East Side Marios
and Hot n Now collectively the Non-core Businesses, which were
disposed of in 1997, and our indemnification of PepsiCo with respect to these
liabilities. These liabilities were not material as of December 28, 2002.
In addition, we have indemnified PepsiCo for any costs or losses it incurs with
respect to all letters of credit, guarantees and contingent liabilities relating to
our businesses under which PepsiCo remains liable. As of December 28, 2002, PepsiCo
remains liable for approximately $65 million on a nominal basis related to these
contingencies. This obligation ends at the time PepsiCo is released, terminated or
replaced by a qualified letter of credit. We have not been required to make any
payments under this indemnity.
Under the Separation Agreements, PepsiCo maintains full control and absolute
discretion with regard to any combined or consolidated tax filings for periods
through October 6, 1997. PepsiCo also maintains full control and absolute
discretion regarding any common tax audit issues. Although PepsiCo has contractually
agreed to, in good faith, use its best efforts to settle all joint interests in any
common audit issue on a basis consistent with prior practice, there can be no
assurance that determinations made by PepsiCo would be the same as we would reach,
acting on our own behalf. Through December 28, 2002, there have not been any
determinations made by PepsiCo where we would have reached a different
determination.
We also agreed to certain restrictions on our actions to help ensure that the
Spin-off maintained its tax-free status. These restrictions, which were generally
applicable to the two-year period following October 6, 1997, included among other
things, limitations on any liquidation, merger or consolidation with another
company, certain issuances and redemptions of our Common Stock, our granting of
stock options and our sale, refranchising, distribution or other disposition of
assets. If we failed to abide by these restrictions or to obtain waivers from PepsiCo
and, as a result, the Spin-off fails to qualify as a tax-free reorganization, we may
be obligated to indemnify PepsiCo for any resulting tax liability, which could be
substantial. No payments under these indemnities have been required or are expected to
be required. Additionally, PepsiCo is entitled to the federal income tax benefits
related to the exercise after the Spin-off of vested PepsiCo options held by our
employees. We expense the payroll taxes related to the exercise of these options as
incurred.
Note 25 - AmeriServe Bankruptcy Reorganization Process
AmeriServe was the principal distributor of food and paper supplies to our U.S.
stores when it filed for protection under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code on
January 31, 2000. A plan of reorganization for AmeriServe the POR was
approved on November 28, 2000, which resulted in, among other things, the assumption of
our distribution agreement, subject to certain amendments, by McLane Company, Inc.
During the AmeriServe bankruptcy reorganization process, we took a number of
actions to ensure continued supply to our system. Those actions resulted in a
cumulative net unusual items expense of $110 million, which was principally
recorded in 2000, being recorded through year-end 2002.
Under the POR we are entitled to proceeds from certain residual assets, preference
claims and other legal recoveries of the estate which are generally recorded as unusual
items income when they are realized. We recorded $39 million and $21 million of net
recoveries under the POR as unusual items income in 2002 and 2001, respectively.
These net recoveries are included in the cumulative net unusual items expense of $110
million. 78 Note 26 - Selected Quarterly Financial Data Unaudited

See Note 7 for details of facility actions net loss gain and unusual items income
expense. 79 Managements Responsibility for Financial Statements To Our Shareholders We are responsible for the preparation, integrity and fair presentation of the
Consolidated Financial Statements, related notes and other information included
in this annual report. The financial statements were prepared in accordance
with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America and
include certain amounts based upon our estimates and assumptions, as required. Other
financial information presented in the annual report is derived from the financial
statements.
We maintain a system of internal control over financial reporting, designed to
provide reasonable assurance as to the reliability of the financial statements, as
well as to safeguard assets from unauthorized use or disposition. The system is
supported by formal policies and procedures, including an active Code of Conduct
program intended to ensure employees adhere to the highest standards of personal and
professional integrity. Our internal audit function monitors and reports on the
adequacy of and compliance with the internal control system, and appropriate
actions are taken to address significant control deficiencies and other opportunities
for improving the system as they are identified.
The Consolidated Financial Statements have been audited and reported on by our
independent auditors, KPMG LLP, who were given free access to all financial records
and related data, including minutes of the meetings of the Board of Directors and
Committees of the Board. We believe that management representations made to the
independent auditors were valid and appropriate.
The Audit Committee of the Board of Directors, which is composed solely of outside
directors, provides oversight to our financial reporting process and our controls
to safeguard assets through periodic meetings with our independent auditors,
internal auditors and management. Both our independent auditors and internal auditors
have free access to the Audit Committee.
Although no cost-effective internal control system will preclude all errors and
irregularities, we believe our controls as of December 28, 2002 provide reasonable
assurance that our assets are reasonably safeguarded. David J. Deno
Chief Financial Officer 80 Report of Independent Auditors The Board of Directors
YUM! Brands, Inc. We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of YUM! Brands, Inc.
and Subsidiaries YUM formerly TRICON Global Restaurants, Inc. as of
December 28, 2002 and December 29, 2001, and the related consolidated statements of
income, cash flows and shareholders equity deficit and comprehensive
income for each of the years in the three-year period ended December 28, 2002.
These consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of YUMs
management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated financial
statements based on our audits.
We conducted our audits in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in
the United States of America. Those standards require that we plan and perform the
audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are
free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis,
evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An
audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant
estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement
presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present
fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of YUM as of December 28,
2002 and December 29, 2001, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for
each of the years in the three-year period ended December 28, 2002, in conformity with
accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.
As discussed in Notes 2 and 12 to the consolidated financial statements, YUM
adopted the provisions of the Financial Accounting Standards Boards Statement
of Financial Accounting Standards No. 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible
Assets, in 2002. s/KPMG LLP
