REPORT OF INDEPENDENT ACCOUNTANTS
To the Board of Directors and
Stockholders of ScanSoft, Inc.
In our opinion, the accompanying consolidated balance sheets and the
related consolidated statements of operations, of stockholders' equity and of
cash flows present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of
ScanSoft, Inc. and its subsidiaries at December 31, 1999 and 1998, and the
results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in
the period ended December 31, 1999, in conformity with accounting principles
generally accepted in the United States. These consolidated financial statements
are the responsibility of the Company management; our responsibility is to
express an opinion on these consolidated financial statements based on our
audits. We conducted our audits of these consolidated statements in accordance
with auditing standards generally accepted in the United States, which require
that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether
the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement. An
audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and
disclosures in the consolidated financial statements, assessing the accounting
principles used and significant estimates made by management, and evaluating the
overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a
reasonable basis for the opinion expressed above.

SCANSOFT, INC.
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
1. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
Organization and Presentation
ScanSoft, Inc. the Company was incorporated as Visioneer, Inc. in the
State of California on March 10, 1992 and was reincorporated in the state of
Delaware on December 5, 1995. The Company develops and markets software for
scanning, editing and communicating paper documents and photos for sale
primarily through retail distributors or directly to retailers. Up until 1999,
the Company was also a scanner hardware company and derived a majority of its
revenues from the sale of scanners.
In December 1998, the Company negotiated an agreement with Primax
Electronics, Ltd. Primax to sell the hardware business of the Company which
was completed on January 6, 1999. See Note 2. As part of the sale to Primax,
the name Visioneer was also sold and the Company employees associated with
the hardware business became employees of Primax. The Company also entered into
an agreement to purchase the business of ScanSoft, Inc., an indirect
wholly-owned subsidiary of Xerox Corporation. This transaction was consummated
on March 2, 1999. See Note 3. In connection with this acquisition, the Company
changed its name to ScanSoft, Inc.
Effective beginning in fiscal 1999, the Company changed its year-end to
December 31. Prior to 1999, the Company fiscal year ended on the Sunday
closest to December 31. Accordingly, fiscal 1998 ended January 3, 1999 and
contained 53 weeks. Fiscal year 1997 had 52 weeks. The Company quarterly
periods also now end on the last day of the calendar quarter. Prior to 1999, the
Company reported quarterly results generally on thirteen-week quarterly periods,
each ending on the Sunday closest to month-end. For purposes of presentation,
the Company has indicated its accounting year as ending on December 31 or the
interim quarterly periods as ending on the respective calendar month-end.
Use of Estimates
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally
accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and
assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and
disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities on the date of the financial
statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting
period. Actual results could differ from those estimates
Principles of Consolidation
The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company
and its subsidiaries. Intercompany transactions and balances have been
eliminated.
Revenue Recognition
Revenue from hardware product sales to customers primarily occurring prior
to 1999 is generally recognized when the product is shipped, provided no
significant obligations remain and collectibility is probable. Revenue from
software product sales to customers is generally recognized when the product is
delivered, the fee is fixed or determinable and collectibility is probable.
Revenues from sales to distributors and authorized resellers are subject to
agreements allowing price protection and certain rights of return. Accordingly,
reserves for estimated future returns, exchanges and credits for price
protection are provided for upon revenue recognition. The Company has limited
control over the extent to which products sold to distributors and resellers are
sold through to end users. Accordingly, a portion of the Company sales may
from time to time result in increased inventory at its distributors and
resellers. The Company provides sales returns reserves for distributor and
reseller inventories. These reserves are based on the Company estimates of
inventory held by its distributors and resellers and the expected sell through
of its products by its distributors and resellers. Actual results could differ
from these estimates.

SCANSOFT, INC.
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS -- CONTINUED
The Company earns royalty and custom software development revenue pursuant
to certain license agreements and records revenue when earned. Development
revenues are recognized using percentage of completion method. Percentage of
completion is computed using the input method of costs incurred. Payments
received from customers prior to revenue recognition are reported as deferred
revenues.
Cash Equivalents and Short-Term Investments
Cash equivalents are short-term, highly liquid instruments with original
maturities of 90 days or less. The Company has classified all its securities as
available for sale. These securities are comprised primarily of commercial
paper with maturities within one year. At December 31, 1999 and 1998, the fair
market value of these securities approximated cost.
Inventory
Inventory is stated at the lower of cost or market, cost being determined
on a first-in, first-out basis.
Property and Equipment
Property and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and
amortization. Depreciation is computed using the straight-line method over the
estimated useful lives of the assets, which is generally one to five years.
Leasehold improvements are amortized over the term of the related lease or the
useful life, if shorter. The costs of sold or retired assets are removed from
the related asset and accumulated depreciation accounts and any gain or loss is
included in operations.
Intangible Assets
Intangible assets resulting from business acquisitions, comprising cost in
excess of net assets acquired, core technology, trademarks, OEM relationships,
workforce and registered users base, are being amortized on a straight-line
basis over the estimated useful lives of the assets, which is generally three to
seven years.
Software Development Costs
Software development costs incurred prior to establishment of technological
feasibility are expensed as incurred. The Company defines establishment of
technological feasibility as the completion of a working model. Software
development costs incurred subsequent to the establishment of technological
feasibility through the period of general market availability of products will
be capitalized, if material. To date, all software development costs have been
expensed.
Income Taxes
The Company accounts for income taxes utilizing an asset and liability
approach that requires the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities
for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in
the Company financial statements or income tax returns. In estimating future
tax consequences, the Company generally considers all expected future events
other than enactments of changes in the tax laws or rates. No U.S. Federal and
State income taxes are provided on earnings of non-US subsidiaries, to the
extent such earnings are deemed to be indefinitely invested.
Comprehensive Income Loss
Comprehensive income is defined as the changes in equity other than
transactions resulting from investments by owners and distributions to owners.
The Company comprehensive loss for 1999, 1998 and 1997 is the same as its
reported net loss.

SCANSOFT, INC.
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS -- CONTINUED
Concentration of Credit Risk
Financial instruments that potentially subject the Company to significant
concentrations of credit risk consist principally of cash equivalents,
short-term investments and trade accounts receivable. The Company invests in a
wide variety of financial instruments, such as certificates of deposits,
commercial paper, municipal debt and U.S. government agency debt. The Company,
by policy, limits the amount of credit exposure to any one financial
institution. The Company performs ongoing credit evaluations of its customers'
financial condition and maintains an allowance for uncollectible receivables
based upon expected collectibility of accounts receivable. At December 31, 1999
and 1998, the Company top two customers in aggregate accounted for 75% and
30%, respectively, of accounts receivable.
Fair Value Disclosures of Financial Instruments
The estimated fair value of financial instruments at December 31, 1999 and
1998 was not significantly different than the values presented in the balance
sheets.
Net Loss Per Share
Basic loss per share is based on the weighted average number of common
shares outstanding, and diluted loss per share is based on the weighted average
number of common shares outstanding and dilutive potential common shares
outstanding. However, because the Company has been in a net loss position on an
annual basis since 1995, the effects of potential common shares outstanding have
been excluded as they would be anti-dilutive in the loss per share calculation.
All options outstanding during 1999, 1998 and 1997 were excluded from diluted
loss per share calculations because they were anti-dilutive in view of the
losses incurred by the Company.
Employee Stock Plans
In October 1995, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Statement
of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123 SFAS No. 123, Accounting for
Stock Compensation. SFAS 123 establishes an accounting method based on the fair
value of equity instruments awarded to employees as compensation. The Company
has elected to retain its current application of Accounting Principles Board
APB Opinion No. 25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees. The Company
has adopted, as required, the disclosure provisions of SFAS No. 123.
Recently Issued Accounting Standards
In November 1999, the Securities and Exchange Commission SEC issued
Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 100, Restructuring and Impairment Charges SAB
100. In December 1999, the SEC issued Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 101,
Revenue Recognition in Financial Statements SAB 101. SAB No. 100 expresses
the views of the SEC staff regarding the accounting for and disclosure of
certain expenses commonly reported in connection with exit activities and
business combinations. The Company does not expect the provisions of SAB No. 100
to have a material impact on its financial statements. SAB No. 101 expresses the
views of the SEC staff in applying generally accepted accounting principles to
certain revenue recognition issues. The Company does not expect the provisions
of SAB No. 101 to have a material impact on its financial statements.
In June 1998, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Statement of
Financial Accounting Standards No. 133 SFAS 133, Accounting for Derivative
Instruments and Hedging Activities. SFAS 133 requires that all derivatives be
recognized at fair value in the statement of financial position, and that
corresponding gains or losses be reported either in the statement of operations
or as a component of comprehensive income, depending on the type of hedging
relationship that exists. The standard will be

SCANSOFT, INC.
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS -- CONTINUED
effective for the Company in fiscal 2000. The Company does not currently use
derivative instruments and, therefore, does not expect that adoption of SFAS 133
will have any impact on their financial position or results of operations.
Reclassifications
Certain prior year balances have been reclassified to conform with the 1999
presentation.
2. SALE OF HARDWARE BUSINESS
On December 3, 1998, the Company entered into an agreement to sell its
hardware assets, liabilities and intellectual property to Primax for
approximately $68 million in cash. The terms of the agreement also grant to
Primax a software license agreement that allows them to bundle, market and
sell the Company PaperPort software with Primax hardware products. The
agreement requires the payment of certain royalties by Primax to the Company.
On January 6, 1999 the agreement with Primax was consummated. The Company
reported a non-operating gain of $882,000 related to the sale of the hardware
business, net of the costs and expenses of disposing of the business. The most
significant assets and liabilities at December 31, 1998 of the hardware business
were receivables, inventories and accounts payable in the approximate amounts of
$127 million, $44 million and $107 million, respectively. Pursuant to the
agreement, the Company agreed to purchase the vested option shares of employees
that were terminated and transferred to Primax. The total cost to the Company
was $273,000 and was recorded against the gain on sale. In addition, Primax
assumed the lease of the Company then corporate facilities. The Company
entered into an agreement with Primax to pay Primax rent for their use of this
facility until the move of the corporate offices to Peabody, Massachusetts after
the acquisition of ScanSoft in March 1999.

3. ACQUISITION OF SCANSOFT
Effective March 2, 1999, the Company acquired Xerox Corporation ScanSoft
subsidiary for approximately 68 million shares of Common Stock, 36 million
shares of non-voting Preferred Stock and the exchange of 17 million employee
stock options to purchase Common Stock of the Company in exchange for
outstanding employee stock options of ScanSoft. In conjunction with the
acquisition, the Company incurred approximately $11 million of acquisition
related costs. The purchase price of ScanSoft, including acquisition costs, was
$186 million which has been determined as follows in thousands

The purchase price was allocated to the assets acquired and liabilities
assumed based on the fair value of ScanSoft current assets, property and
equipment, and liabilities. The excess of the purchase price over the fair value
of tangible assets acquired has been allocated to intangible assets acquired
in-process research and development, core technology, trade mark and trade name,
and assembled workforce acquired based on an independent appraisal. The
allocation of purchase price is estimated as follows in thousands

$18,596
This acquisition has been accounted for under the purchase method of
accounting and the results of operations of ScanSoft have been included in the
consolidated statements of operations of the Company from the date of
acquisition.
The Company recorded a one time write-off of approximately $39 million in
the quarter ended March 31, 1999 relating to the value of in-process research
and development acquired as part of the purchase that had not yet reached
technological feasibility and had no alternative future use. Accordingly, this
amount was immediately charged to expense in the consolidated statements of
operations upon consummation of the acquisition. The value assigned to acquired
in-process technology was determined by identifying research projects in areas
for which technological feasibility has not been established. These include
projects primarily major version upgrades in each of ScanSoft major
products, including ScanWorks, Pagis, TextBridge and API. The value was
determined by estimating the revenue contribution of each of these products and
the amount of the revenues attributable to the core/developed technology, the
in-process -- completed, the in-process -- to be completed and the future
yet-to-be-defined elements. The net cash flows for the in-process -- completed
were then discounted utilizing a weighted average cost of capital of 25%. This
discount rate takes into consideration the inherent uncertainties surrounding
the successful development of the in-process research and development, the
profitability levels of such technology and the uncertainty of technological
advances which could potentially impact the estimates described above. The
allocation between the in-process -- completed and the in-process -- to be
completed amounts were estimated based on the time and related costs incurred in
development before the close of the acquisition and estimated to be incurred
after the close of the acquisition. The average percentage of completion of the
projects ranged from 73% to 95% at the date of the acquisition. All of these
projects were successfully completed in 1999, however, at the time of

acquisition there was risk that if these projects were not successfully
developed, future revenue and profitability of ScanSoft may have been adversely
affected.

forma results of operations are not indicative of the actual results that would
have occurred had the transactions actually taken place at the beginning of
these periods.
5. RESTRUCTURING
Pursuant to the disposal of the hardware business and acquisition of the
software business, the Company initiated restructuring actions in the first
quarter of 1999 and recorded a charge of $346,000 for such actions. Included in
the charge was $188,000 related to a workforce reduction. The workforce
reduction costs primarily include severance costs related to the involuntary
termination of employment for approximately 10 employees from research and
development in California. The terminations were necessary in order to
consolidate the Company research and development efforts to the new corporate
headquarters in Massachusetts. Also included was approximately $46,000 in fixed
assets and $82,000 in non-refundable commitments associated with the California
operation which were no longer required once the headquarters were moved to
Massachusetts, and $30,000 in other exit costs. Severance costs and other exit
costs were determined in accordance with EITF No. 94-3, Liability Recognition
for Certain Employee Termination Benefits and Other Costs to Exit an Activity.
All planned restructuring actions were completed and all related liabilities
were paid in 1999, and there are no remaining accruals at December 31, 1999.
The Company implemented a restructuring plan of all its organizations in
May 1997 which included a decrease of approximately 40% of total employee and
consultant headcount. A one-time restructuring charge of $675,000 was recorded
in the three-month period ended June 30, 1997, representing severance paid to
terminated employees.
6. ACQUISITION OF METACREATIONS PRODUCT LINES

Pursuant to the Purchase Agreement, the Company purchased all of the
inventory, intangibles, marketing materials and MetaCreations' website content
relating to the Products. Under the License Agreement, MetaCreations granted the
Company a non-exclusive, royalty free license to use, reproduce, license, sell
and distribute the intellectual property relating to the Products and other
related software technology. The

Company paid MetaCreations an aggregate of $1,000,000 in cash and issued a 7%
promissory note in the principal amount of $1,600,000, due in full on June 30,
2000. Additionally the Company assumed the obligations to fulfill sales orders
relating to the Products, all liabilities under all original equipment
manufacturer and other agreements pertaining to the Products, and up to $950,000
of product returns relating to Products sold prior to the date of the Purchase
Agreement. The Purchase Agreement includes contingent financial performance
incentive payments under which the Company could pay MetaCreations up to an
additional $1,000,000, depending on the revenue levels achieved on the Products
and certain other technology licensed in the License Agreement.
The purchase price was allocated to the assets acquired and liabilities
assumed based on the fair value of MetaCreations assets and liabilities. The
excess of the purchase price over the fair value of tangible assets acquired has
been allocated to intangible assets core technology, OEM relationships,
trademarks, and registered users base acquired based on an independent

interest rate of 825%. At December 31, 1998, the Company had bank borrowings of
$60 million under this line of credit and the Company was not in compliance
with certain covenants, for which the bank issued a waiver. In connection with
the sale of the hardware business in January 1999 see Note 2, the outstanding
borrowings were paid and the line of credit was terminated.

objective evidence creates sufficient uncertainty regarding the realizability of
the deferred tax assets such that full valuation allowance has been recorded.
These factors include the lack of significant history of profits, the fact that
the market in which the Company competes is intensely competitive and
characterized by rapidly changing technology, and lack of carryback capacity to
realize these assets.
Differences between the U.S. statutory federal income tax rate and the
Company effective income tax rate are analyzed below                                YEAR ENDED

At December 31, 1999, the Company had federal and state net operating loss
carryforwards of approximately $60 million and $26 million, respectively, of
which approximately $1,306,000 and $653,000 related to tax deductions from stock
compensation, respectively. The tax benefit related to the stock compensation
benefit, when realized, will be accounted for as an addition to additional paid
in capital rather than as a reduction of the provision for income tax. Research
and development credit carryforwards as of December 31, 1999 were approximately
$22 million. The net operating loss and credit carryforwards will expire at
various dates beginning in 2007, if not utilized. Utilization of the net
operating losses and credits may be subject to a substantial annual limitation
due to the ownership change limitations provided by the Internal Revenue Code of
1986 and similar state provisions. The annual limitation may result in the
expiration of net operating losses and credits before utilization.
10. STOCKHOLDERS' EQUITY
Preferred Stock
The Company is authorized to issue up to 20,000,000 shares of preferred
stock, par value $0001 per share. In connection with the acquisition of
ScanSoft Note 3, the Company issued 3,562,238 shares of Series B Preferred
Stock to Xerox. The Series B Preferred Stock is convertible into shares of
common stock on a share for share basis at any time after March 2, 2001.
However, the Series B is convertible immediately if the holder ownership of
outstanding common stock falls below 30%, unless such conversion results in the
holder owning more than 50% of the outstanding Company common stock. The Series
B Preferred Stock has a liquidation preference over the common shareholders
equal to $130 per share plus all declared but unpaid dividends.
45
48
SCANSOFT, INC.
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS -- CONTINUED
The Series B Preferred Stock is entitled to dividends at the rate of $0065
per annum per share, payable when, as and if declared by the Board of Directors.
Dividends are non-cumulative. Holders of Series B Preferred Stock have no voting
rights, except those rights provided under Delaware law.
Common Stock Warrants
In connection with the ScanSoft acquisition Note 3, the Company issued
Xerox a ten-year warrant that allows Xerox to acquire a number of shares of
common stock equal to the number of options whether vested or unvested that
remains unexercised at the termination of any ScanSoft option assumed by the
Company in the merger. The exercise price for each warrant share is $061. If
all of the assumed ScanSoft options terminate without being exercised, Xerox
would be entitled to purchase approximately 1,736,630 shares of common stock.
The warrant is exercisable at any time; however, Xerox may not exercise the
warrant prior to two years from the date of its initial issuance, unless,
immediately after such exercise, Xerox owns directly or indirectly a number of
outstanding shares of common stock that represents less than 45% of the total
number of shares common stock outstanding immediately after such exercise. From
the date of acquisition through December 31, 1999, approximately 252,075
ScanSoft options have been forfeited and are available for exercise by Xerox.
At December 31, 1994, the Company had 101,500 Series C Convertible
Preferred Stock warrants outstanding which were exercisable at $4 per share. In
conjunction with its initial public offering, 85,000 of these warrants were
exercised on a net issuance basis for 65,000 Common shares. The remaining 16,500
warrants automatically converted into Common Stock warrants upon the completion
of the Company initial public offering. These warrants will expire on June 30,
2004.
Deferred Compensation Relating to Stock Options
Based on an independent consultant valuation report, management concluded
that the exercise price for certain options granted during 1995 was below the
estimated fair value of the Company Common Stock at the dates of the grants.
The Company recorded deferred compensation expense of $400,000 related to these
grants which has been amortized over related vesting periods of the options. The
Company recorded $50,000, $100,000 and $100,000 in compensation expense for the
years ended December 31, 1999, 1998 and 1997, respectively. As of December 31,
1999, the deferred compensation has been fully amortized.
11. STOCK COMPENSATION PLANS
1993 Incentive Stock Option Plan
In February 1993, the Company Board of Directors adopted the 1993
Incentive Stock Option Plan the Option Plan. Under the Option Plan, the
Board of Directors are authorized to issue options for up to 3,870,000 shares of
Common Stock to employees and consultants of the Company at grant prices

not officers or directors of the Company, with the exception of officers who
were not previously employed by the Company and for whom an option grant is an
inducement essential to such officers' entering into an employment relationship
or contract with the Company. The 1997 Option Plan was adopted in response to
the non-availability of options for future grant under the Option Plan. The
Company has reserved a total of 1,300,000 shares under this plan.
Options granted under the 1997 Option Plan expire no later than ten years
from the date of grant no later than five years for 10% shareholders. The

exercisable in increments over a period of four years from the date of grant. At
the discretion of the Board of Directors, options may be granted with different
vesting terms.
Repricing of Stock Options
In January 1998, the Company allowed all holders of outstanding options to
exchange higher priced options for new options at $175 per share, the fair
market value at the time of the exchange. The repricing terms provided that for
each seven shares of options exchanged, six new options would be granted. The
repriced options maintained the same vesting schedule. Options for 2,656,449
shares were exchanged for new options for 2,276,956 shares and are included in
the summary stock option table in the options cancelled and options granted
categories.
1998 Stock Option Plan
In conjunction with the acquisition of ScanSoft Note 3, the Company
assumed the ScanSoft 1998 Stock Option Plan the 1998 Option Plan, which
provides for the granting of incentive stock options to officers and employees

from the date of grant no later than five years for 10% shareholders. The
exercise price will be at least 100% and 85% of the fair value of the stock
subject to the option on the date the option is granted as determined by the
Board of Directors for incentive and non-statutory stock options, respectively

Litigation and Other Claims
From time to time, the Company becomes party to litigation and patent
infringement matters and claims which arise in the course of the Company
operations. While the results of such litigation and claims cannot be predicted
with certainty, the Company believes that the final outcome of such matters will
not have a significant adverse effect on the Company financial position and
results of operations. However, should the Company not prevail in any such
litigation, its operating results and financial position could be adversely
impacted.
13. RELATED PARTIES
At December 31, 1999, Xerox owned approximately 44% of the Company
outstanding common stock and all of the Company outstanding Series B Preferred
Stock. In addition, Xerox has the opportunity to acquire additional shares of
common stock pursuant to a warrant Note 10. In addition, Xerox has two
designees on the Board of Directors, including the Chairman of the Board see
Note 15. In 1999, Xerox accounted for 14% of total net revenues.
In 1999, the Company acquired preferred stock of an internet web content
management company for $150,000. The Company investment represents less than a
20% ownership and, accordingly, is recorded at cost in the accompanying balance
sheet. The founder and CEO of the investee is also a member of the Company
Board of Directors.
14. SEGMENT, GEOGRAPHIC AND SIGNIFICANT CUSTOMER INFORMATION
In 1998, the Company adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standards
No. 131 SFAS 131, Disclosures about Segments of an Enterprise and Related
Information. SFAS 131 supersedes SFAS 14, Financial Reporting for Segments of
a Business Enterprise, replacing the industry segment approach with the
management approach. The management approach designates the internal
organization that is used by management for making operating decisions and
assessing performance as the source of the Company reportable segments. SFAS
131 also requires disclosures about products and services, geographic areas and
major customers. Prior to the acquisition of ScanSoft, the Company operated and
managed one reporting segment.
Since the acquisition of ScanSoft, the Company operates, manages and
assesses performance in two segments, United States operations and European
operations. The Company evaluates the performance of each segment based on
operating profit, exclusive of interest and taxes. Each segment follows the
Company significant accounting policies. Following is a table of selected
financial data on the Company reportable segments in thousands.

15. SUBSEQUENT EVENTS
On January 15, 2000, ScanSoft signed a definitive agreement to acquire
Caere Corporation Caere in a purchase transaction. The merger was completed
on March 13, 2000. Caere designs, develops, manufactures and markets a range of
optical character recognition software tools and for the year ended December 31,
1999, reported revenues of approximately $58 million. Under the merger
agreement, ScanSoft will issue approximately 186 million shares of its common
stock, $483 million in cash and options to purchase 47 million shares of its
common stock in exchange for all the outstanding shares and options of Caere.
The purchase price of the Caere acquisition is estimated to be approximately
$1798 million, which has been determined as follows                              
Fair value of shares of common stock. $107,845
Fair value of   16,055
48,344
Estimated transaction    3,925
Estimated restructuring    3,600
$179,769
Common stock has been valued using an average price of ScanSoft common
stock for a few days before and after the consummation of the Caere merger. The
estimated transaction costs represent estimated fees for the financial advisors,
accountants, attorneys and expenses expected to be incurred in conjunction with
the Caere merger. ScanSoft management plans to terminate redundant employees
primarily associated with duplicate corporate, sales, marketing and other
administrative functions soon after consummation of the merger. The associated
restructuring costs of termination have been included in the purchase
accounting. These costs have been based on preliminary estimates of management
and are subject to further revision upon finalization of ScanSoft management
plans with respect to Caere operations.
Effective March 13, 2000, the Company elected three additional directors to
the Board of Directors comprising of two Caere directors and an additional Xerox
designee.
