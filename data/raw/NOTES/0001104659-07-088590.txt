31 REPORT
OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM
The Board of Directors and Shareholders of MAXIMUS, Inc. We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of
MAXIMUS, Inc. as of September 30, 2007 and 2006, and the related consolidated
statements of operations, changes in shareholders equity, and cash flows for
each of the three years in the period ended September 30, 2007. These financial
statements are the responsibility of the Companys management. Our
responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on
our audits. We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public
Company Accounting Oversight Board United States. Those standards require
that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether
the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes
examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in
the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting
principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as
evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our
audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present
fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated financial position of
MAXIMUS, Inc. at September 30, 2007 and 2006, and the consolidated results of
its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period
ended September 30, 2007, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting
principles. We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public
Company Accounting Oversight Board United States, MAXIMUS, Inc.s internal
control over financial reporting as of September 30, 2007, based on criteria
established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of
Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission and our report dated
December 3, 2007 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon. /s/

and 2007
1. Business and Summary of Significant
Accounting Policies
a Description of Business
MAXIMUS,Inc. the Company
or we provides consulting, systems solutions and operations program
management primarily to government. The Company conducts its operations through
three business segments: Consulting, Systems and Operations. The Consulting
Segment provides specialized financial consulting services such as assisting
states, local agencies, and schools in obtaining federal funding reimbursements
for their programs, and implementing cost reductions strategies, as well as
providing technical services and software products. The Systems Segment provides
systems products including justice and asset software solutions as well as
systems development, design and implementation to improve the efficiency and
cost-effectiveness of program administration. The Operations Segment provides a
variety of program management services, primarily the delivery of
administrative services for government health and human service programs.
The Company operates
predominantly in the United States. Revenue from foreign-based projects
and offices was 8%, 11%, and 12% of total revenue for the years ended
September30, 2005, 2006 and 2007,
respectively.
b Principles of Consolidation
The consolidated financial
statements include the accounts of MAXIMUS, Inc. and its wholly-owned
subsidiaries. In addition to the Companys wholly owned subsidiaries, the
financial statements as of and for the fiscal years ended September 30, 2007,
2006 and 2005 include a majority 55% owned international subsidiary. All
significant intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in
consolidation.
c Revenue Recognition
In fiscal 2007, approximately
75% of our total revenue was derived from state and local government agencies;
7% from federal government agencies; 13% from foreign customers; and 5% from
other sources, such as commercial customers. Revenue is
generated from contracts with various pricing arrangements, including: 1
fixed-price; 2 performance-based criteria; 3 costs incurred plus a
negotiated fee cost-plus; and 4 time and materials. Also, some contracts
contain not-to-exceed provisions. Of the contracts with not-to-exceed
provisions, to the extent we estimate we will exceed the contractual limits, we
treat these contracts as fixed price. For fiscal 2007, revenue from fixed-price
contracts was approximately 41% of total revenue; revenue from
performance-based contracts was approximately 37% of total revenue; revenue
from cost-plus contracts was approximately 15% of total revenue; and revenue
from time and materials contracts was approximately 7% of total revenue. A majority
of the contracts with state and local government agencies have been fixed-price
and performance-based, and our contracts with the federal government generally
have been cost-plus. Fixed-price and performance-based contracts generally
offer higher margins but typically involve more risk than cost-plus or time and
materials reimbursement contracts. 37 We
recognize revenue on general service arrangements as work is performed and
amounts are earned in accordance with the Staff Accounting Bulletin SAB
No101, Revenue Recognition in Financial Statements, as amended by
SABNo104, Revenue Recognition SAB104. We consider
amounts to be earned once evidence of an arrangement has been obtained,
services are delivered, fees are fixed or determinable, and collectibility is
reasonably assured.
We
recognize revenue on fixed-priced contracts when earned, as services are
provided. For certain fixed-price contracts, primarily systems design, development
and implementation, we recognize revenue based on costs incurred using
estimates of total expected contract revenue and costs to be incurred in
accordance with the provisions of AICPA Statement of Position 81-1, Accounting for Performance of Construction-Type and Certain
Production-Type Contracts SOP 81-1. The cumulative impact of any
revisions in estimated revenue and costs is recognized in the period in which
the facts that give rise to the revision become known. For other fixed-price
contracts, revenue is recognized on a straight-line basis unless evidence
suggests that revenue is earned or obligations are fulfilled in a different
pattern. With fixed-price contracts, we are subject to the risk of potential
cost overruns. For fixed-price contracts accounted for under SOP 81-1,
provisions for estimated losses on incomplete contracts are provided in full in
the period in which such losses become known. Costs related to contracts may be
incurred in periods prior to recognizing revenue. These costs are generally
expensed. However, certain direct and incremental set-up costs may be deferred
until services are provided and revenue begins to be recognized, when such
costs are recoverable from a contractual arrangement. Set-up costs are costs
related to activities that enable us to provide contractual services to a
client. The timing of expense recognition may result in irregular profit
margins.
We
recognize revenue on performance-based contracts as such revenue becomes fixed
or determinable, which generally occurs when amounts are billable to customers.
For certain contracts, this may result in revenue being recognized in irregular
increments.
Revenue
on cost-plus contracts is recognized based on costs incurred plus an estimate
of the negotiated fee earned. Revenue on time and materials contracts is
recognized based on hours worked and expenses incurred.
Our
most significant expense is cost of revenue, which consists primarily of
project-related costs such as employee salaries and benefits, subcontractors,
computer equipment and travel expenses. Our management uses its judgment and
experience to estimate cost of revenue expected on projects. Our managements
ability to accurately predict personnel requirements, salaries and other costs
as well as to effectively manage a project or achieve certain levels of
performance can have a significant impact on the gross margins related to our
fixed-price, performance-based and time and materials contracts. If actual
costs are higher than our managements estimates, profitability may be
adversely affected. Service cost variability has little impact on cost-plus
arrangements because allowable costs are reimbursed by the customer.
We also license software
under license agreements. Software revenue is recognized in accordance with
AICPA Statement of Position 97-2, Software Revenue
Recognition SOP 97-2, as amended by
Statement of Position 98-9, Modification of SOP 97-2,
With Respect to Certain Transactions SOP 98-9. Software license
revenue is recognized when a customer enters into a non-cancelable license
agreement, the software product has been delivered, there are no uncertainties
surrounding product acceptance, there are no significant future performance
obligations, the license fees are fixed or determinable and collection of the
license fee is considered probable. Amounts received in advance of meeting
these criteria are deferred and classified as deferred revenue in the
accompanying consolidated balance sheets. As required by SOP 98-9, the Company
determines the value of the software component of its multiple-element
arrangements using the residual method as vendor specific objective evidence VSOE
of fair value exists for the undelivered elements such as the support and
maintenance agreements and related implementation and training services, but
not for all delivered elements such as the software itself. The residual method
requires revenue to be allocated to the undelivered elements based on the fair
value of such elements, as indicated by VSOE. VSOE is based on the price
charged when the element is sold separately. Maintenance and post-contract
customer support revenue are recognized ratably over the term of the related
agreements, which in most cases is one year. Revenue from software-related
consulting services under time and material contracts and for training is
recognized as services are performed. Revenue from other software-related
contract services requiring significant modification or customization of
software is recognized under the percentage-of-completion method. 38 Emerging Issues Task Force
Issue No. 00-21 EITF 00-21, Revenue Arrangements with
Multiple Deliverables, requires contracts with multiple deliverables
to be divided into separate units of accounting if certain criteria are met. We
apply the guidance therein and recognize revenue on multiple deliverables as
separate units of accounting if the criteria are met.
d Cash Equivalents
The Company considers all highly liquid investments
with an original maturity of three months or less when purchased to be cash
equivalents. Cash equivalents are valued at cost, which approximates market.
e Marketable Securities
Marketable securities are
classified as available-for-sale and are recorded at fair market value with
unrealized gains and losses, net of taxes, reported as a separate component of
shareholders equity. Realized gains losses and declines in market value
judged to be other than temporary, of which there were $288,000 in 2005 237,000 in 2006 and none in 2007, are included in other income. Interest and
dividends are also included in other income. Marketable securities consist
primarily of short-term auction rate bonds. At September 30, 2005, 2006, and
2007, accumulated unrealized gains losses on marketable securities, net of
tax, included in accumulated other comprehensive income loss, were $150,000, none, and none, respectively.
f Restricted Cash
Restricted cash represents
amounts collected on behalf of certain customers and its use is restricted to
the purposes specified under our contracts with these customers.
g Accounts Receivable and
Allowance for Doubtful Accounts
Accounts receivable are recorded
at their face amount less an allowance for doubtful accounts. We maintain an
allowance for doubtful accounts at an amount we estimate to be sufficient to
cover the risk of collecting less than full payment on our receivables. On a regular basis
we re-evaluate our client receivables, especially receivables that are past
due, and reassess our allowance for doubtful accounts based on specific client
collection issues.
h Property and Equipment
Property and equipment is stated
at cost and depreciated using the straight-line method based on estimated
useful lives not to exceed 395years for the Companys buildings and
between three and seven years for office furniture and equipment. Leasehold
improvements are amortized over their useful life or the remaining term of the
lease, whichever is shorter. Direct costs of time and material incurred for the
development of application software for internal use are capitalized as
property and equipment. These costs are depreciated using the straight-line
method over the estimated useful life of the software, ranging from three to
seven years. 39 i Software
Development Costs
Software development
costs are capitalized in accordance with FAS No. 86, Accounting
for the Cost of Computer Software to be Sold, Leased, or Otherwise Marketed.
The Company capitalizes both purchased software that is ready for resale and
costs incurred internally for software development projects from the time
technological feasibility is established. Capitalized software development
costs are reported at the lower of unamortized cost or estimated net realizable
value. Upon the general release of the software to customers, capitalized
software development costs for the products are amortized over the greater of
the ratio of gross revenues to expected total revenues of the product or on the
straight-line method of amortization over the estimated economic life of the
product, which ranges from three to five years.
j Deferred Contract Costs
Deferred contract costs consist of contractually
recoverable direct set-up costs relating to long-term service contracts in
progress. These costs include direct and incremental costs incurred prior to
the commencement of us providing service to enable us to provide the contracted
services to our customer. Such costs are expensed over the period services are
provided under the long-term service contract. We review deferred contract costs for impairment
whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount
may not be recoverable. Our review is based on our projection of the undiscounted
future operating cash flows of the related customer project. To the extent such
projections indicate that future undiscounted cash flows are not sufficient to
recover the carrying amount, we recognize a non-cash impairment charge to
reduce the carrying amount to equal projected future discounted cash flows.
k Goodwill and Intangible Assets
The Company applies Statements of Financial Accounting
Standards No. 141, Business Combinations FAS 141,
and No. 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets FAS
142. Under these rules, goodwill is not amortized but is subject to annual
impairment tests in accordance with FAS 142. Annually, the Company performs a
fair value analysis of its reporting units using valuation techniques
prescribed in FAS 142. Based on the analysis performed as of June
30,2007, the Company determined that there had been no impairment of
goodwill.
Intangible assets from
acquisitions, which consist primarily of customer contracts and relationships,
technology-based intangibles and non-competition agreements, are amortized over
five to ten years, based on their estimated useful lives.
l Long-Lived Assets excluding
Goodwill
The Company follows the
provisions of Financial
Accounting Standards No. 144, Accounting
for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets FAS 144. FAS 144 requires that long-lived
assets be reviewed for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate
that the carrying amount of an asset may not be fully recoverable. An
impairment loss is recognized if the sum of the long-term undiscounted cash
flows is less than the carrying amount of the long-lived assets being
evaluated. Any write-downs are treated as permanent reductions in the carrying
amount of the assets. The Company believes that the carrying values of its
assets as of September 30, 2007 are fully realizable. 40 m Income Taxes
Deferred tax liabilities and
assets are determined based on the difference between the financial statement
and tax basis of assets and liabilities using enacted rates expected to be in
effect during the year in which the differences reverse. The effect on deferred
tax assets and liabilities due to a change in tax rates is recognized in income
tax expense in the period that includes the enactment date. A tax benefit or
expense is recognized for the net change in the deferred tax asset or liability
during the year and the current tax liability for the year. As of September 30,
2007, the Company had $25 million of total tax-effected net operating loss
carryforwards, related to a subsidiary in Canada. We believe we will generate
sufficient taxable income to utilize the net operating loss carryforwards
within the expiration period based on an existing contract within our Canadian
operations. To the extent that future taxable income from this contract is
revised and it is determined that there will be insufficient taxable income
generated to utilize all available net operating loss carryforwards, a
valuation allowance will be recorded in the provision for income taxes in the
period the determination is made, and the deferred tax assets will be reduced
by this amount. As of September 30, 2007, the Company had $61 million of net
operating loss carryforwards, related to another subsidiary in Canada, which
have not been tax-effected. A full valuation allowance of $21 million has been
established against these net operating loss carryforwards. Evaluating the
net operating loss carryforwards requires us to make certain estimates, which
we believe are reasonable. In the event that actual circumstances differ from
managements estimates, or to the extent that these estimates are adjusted in
the future, any changes to the valuation allowance could be material.
n
Comprehensive Income Loss
Comprehensive income loss
includes changes in the balances of the items that are reported directly as
separate components of shareholders equity. Comprehensive income loss
includes net income plus changes in the net unrealized gain loss on investments,
net of taxes, and changes in cumulative foreign currency translation
adjustments.

The assets and liabilities of
foreign operations are translated into U.S. dollars at current exchange rates
and revenue and expenses are translated at average exchange rates for the
period. The resulting cumulative translation adjustment is included in
accumulated other comprehensive income loss on the consolidated balance
sheet. At September 30, 2005, 2006, and 2007, accumulated foreign currency gains
losses included in accumulated other comprehensive income loss were
$673,000, $1,067,000 and $1,579,000, respectively. Foreign currency
transaction gains losses, including foreign currency gains losses on
short-term loans with our foreign subsidiaries, are included in other income
and were $396,000, $741,000 and $194,000 for the years ended September 30,
2005, 2006 and 2007, respectively.
p Earnings per Share
FAS
128, Earnings Per Share, requires
dual presentation of basic and diluted earnings per share on the face of the
Consolidated Statements of Operations. Basic earnings per share exclude
dilution and are computed by dividing net income by the weighted average number
of common shares outstanding for the period. Diluted earnings per share reflect
potential dilution that could occur if securities or other contracts to issue
common stock were exercised or converted into common stock. Diluted earnings
per share include the incremental effect of stock options and restricted stock
units calculated using the treasury stock method.
q Fair Value of Financial
Instruments
The Company considers the
recorded value of its financial assets and liabilities, which consist primarily
of cash and cash equivalents, marketable securities, accounts receivable and
accounts payable, to approximate the fair value of the respective assets and
liabilities at September30, 2006 and 2007. 41 r Stock-Based
Compensation
Effective October 1, 2005, the Company adopted the provisions of SFAS No.
123R, Share-Based Payment, using the
method.
s Use of Estimates
The preparation of financial
statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the
United States requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect
the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent
assets and liabilities, and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during
the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.
Significant estimates used by the Company include estimates of profits or loss
on contracts in process, estimates of collectibility of receivables, evaluation
of asset impairment and accrual of estimated liabilities.
t Legal and Settlement Expense
Legal and settlement expense
consists of costs, net of reimbursed insurance claims, related to significant
legal settlements and non-routine legal matters, including future probable
legal costs estimated to be incurred in connection with those matters. Legal
expenses incurred in the ordinary course of business are included in selling,
general and administrative expense.
u Reclassifications
Certain prior year amounts have been reclassified to
conform to the fiscal year 2007 presentation.
v Contingencies
From time to time, we are involved in legal
proceedings, including contract and employment claims, in the ordinary course
of business. We assess the likelihood of any adverse judgments or outcomes to
these contingencies as well as potential ranges of probable losses and
establish reserves accordingly. The amount of reserves required may change in
future periods due to new developments in each matter or changes in approach to
a matter such as a change in settlement strategy.
2. Sale of Business
On October 5, 2006, the Company sold its Corrections
Services business for proceeds of $19 million, net of transaction costs of
$08 million, and recognized a pre-tax gain on the sale of $05 million. During
the fiscal year ended September 30, 2006, this business had revenue of $91
million and generated an operating loss of approximately $06 million.

Unbilled accounts receivable and
deferred revenue relate primarily to contracts wherein the timing of billings
to customers varies based on individual contracts and often differs from the
period of revenue recognition. At September 30, 2006 and 2007, there was $70
million and $30 million, respectively, billed but not paid by customers
pursuant to contractual retainage provisions. Such balances are included in
billed accounts receivable in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets.
At September 30, 2006 and 2007 27 million and $25 million of billed long-term contract receivables, net of
reserves of $07 million and $06 million, respectively, are included in other
assets.
In evaluating the net realizable
value of accounts receivable, the Company considers such factors as current
economic trends, customer credit-worthiness, and changes in the customer
payment terms and collection trends. Changes in the assumptions used in
analyzing a specific account receivable may result in a reserve being
recognized in the period in which the change occurs. 42 Changes in the reserves against
billed accounts receivable were as follows in thousands

6. Deferred Contract Costs
Deferred contract costs consist
of contractually recoverable direct set-up costs relating to long-term service
contracts in progress. These costs include direct and incremental costs
incurred prior to the commencement of us providing contracted services to our
customers totaling $263 million and $286 million at September 30, 2006 and
2007, respectively, of which $76 million is leased equipment at September 30,
2006 and 2007. Deferred contract costs are expensed ratably as services are
provided under the contracts. For the fiscal years ended September 30, 2006 and
2007, accumulated amortization of deferred contract costs was $152 million and
$205 million, of which $42 million and $57 million, respectively, is the
accumulated amortization of capital lease assets included in deferred costs. 43 During the fiscal year ended September 30, 2006, the Company determined
that the estimated undiscounted cash flows associated with the Texas Integrated
Eligibility project over its remaining term were insufficient to recover the
projects deferred contract costs. As a result, the Company recognized a
non-cash impairment charge of $171 million to write off the full unamortized
balance of the projects deferred contract costs. The write-off is included in
the results of the Operations Segment. Additional information regarding the
Texas Integrated Eligibility project is disclosed in Note 20.

weighted-average amortization periods for non-competition agreements,
technology-based intangibles, and customer contracts and relationships are
approximately six years, five years, and seven years, respectively. The
weighted-average amortization period for total intangible assets is
approximately six years. The estimated amortization expense for the years
ending September 30, 2008, 2009, 2010, 2011, and 2012 is $15 million, $11
million, $04 million, $04 million, and $02 million, respectively. During fiscal
2007, the Company disposed of $04 million of intangible assets net of

9. Credit Facilities
In June 2003, in connection with a long-term
contract, the Company issued a standby letter of credit in an initial amount of
up to $200 million, which amount was reduced to $100 million on April 1,
2005. The letter of credit, which expires on March 31, 2009, may be called by
the customer in the event the Company defaults under the terms of the contract.
In March 2006, in connection with another long-term contract, the Company
issued a standby letter of credit in the amount of $40 million. The letter of
credit, which expires on September 30, 2008, may be called by the customer in
the event the Company defaults under the terms of the contract. Both letters
of credit contain financial covenants that establish minimum levels of tangible
net worth, earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization EBITDA,
cash balances and a maximum level of losses on the Texas Integrated Eligibility
project. The Company was in compliance with all covenants as of September 30,
2007.
10. Leases
The Company leases office space
under various operating leases which typically contain clauses permitting
cancellation upon certain conditions, including the early termination,
non-renewal or material alteration of the related customer contract. The terms
of these leases typically provide for certain minimum payments as well as
increases in lease payments based upon the operating cost of the facility and
the consumer price index. Rent expense for the years ended September30,
2005, 2006, and 2007 was $231 million, $233 million, and $218 million,
respectively.
On July 15, 2003, the Company entered into a capital
lease financing arrangement with a financial institution, whereby the Company
acquired assets pursuant to an equipment lease agreement. Rental payments for
assets leased are payable over a 60-month period at a rate of 405% commencing
in January 2004. On March 29, 2004, the Company entered into a supplemental
capital lease financing arrangement with the same financial institution whereby
the Company acquired additional assets pursuant to an equipment lease
agreement. Rental payments for assets leased under the supplemental arrangement
are payable over a 57-month period at a rate of 361% commencing in April 2004.
At September 30, 2007, capital lease obligations of $20 million were
outstanding related to these lease arrangements for equipment. 45 Minimum future payments under
leases in effect as of September 30, 2007 are as follows in thousands

We do not provide for U.S. income taxes on the undistributed earnings of
our foreign subsidiaries, as we consider these to be permanently reinvested in
the operations of such subsidiaries. If some of these earnings were
distributed, some countries may impose withholding taxes; in addition, as
foreign taxes have been previously paid on these earnings, we would expect to
be entitled to a U.S. foreign tax credit that would reduce the U.S. taxes owed
on such distributions. As such, it is not practical to determine the net amount
of the related unrecognized U.S. deferred tax liability.
As of September 30, 2007, the
Company had $25 million of total tax-effected net operating loss
carryforwards, related to a subsidiary in Canada. These net operating loss
carryforwards begin to expire at the end of fiscal 2014 through fiscal 2016. We
believe we will generate sufficient taxable income to utilize the net operating
loss carryforwards within the expiration period based on an existing contract
within our Canadian operations. To the extent that future taxable income from
this contract is revised and it is determined that there will be insufficient
taxable income generated to utilize all available net operating loss
carryforwards, a valuation allowance will be recorded in the provision for
income taxes in the period the determination is made, and the deferred tax
assets will be reduced by this amount. As of September 30, 2007, the Company
had $61 million of net operating loss carryforwards, related to another
subsidiary in Canada, which have not been tax-effected. A full valuation
allowance of $21 million has been established against these net operating loss
carryforwards. These net operating loss carryforwards begin to expire at the
end of fiscal 2013 through fiscal 2017. 47 Cash paid for income taxes during
the years ended September30, 2005, 2006, and 2007 was $94 million, $220
million, and $103 million, respectively.
Approximately 90% of the Companys
total goodwill is expected to be deductible for income tax purposes.
13. Shareholders Equity
Stock-Based Compensation
The Companys Board of Directors established stock
option plans during 1997 pursuant to which the Company may grant non-qualified
stock options to officers, employees and directors of the Company. Such plans
also provide for stock awards and direct purchases of the Companys common
stock. At September 30, 2007, the Board of Directors had reserved 81 million
shares of common stock for issuance under the Companys stock plans. At
September 30, 2007, 19 million shares remained available for grants under the
Companys stock plans.
Stock options are granted at exercise prices equal
to the fair market value of the Companys common stock at the date of grant.
Stock options generally vest ratably over a period of four years, and beginning
in fiscal 2005, expire six years after date of grant. Options issued prior to
fiscal 2005 expire ten years after date of grant. For the fiscal years ended
September 30, 2006 and 2007, compensation expense related to stock options was
$44 million and $08 million, respectively.
The Company also issues Restricted Stock Units
RSUs to officers, employees and directors of the Company under its 1997
Equity Incentive Plan Plan. Generally, these RSUs vest ratably over six
years with full vesting upon the sixth anniversary of the date of grant,
provided, however, that the vesting will accelerate if the Company meets
certain earnings targets determined by the Board of Directors. The fair value
of the RSUs, based on the Companys stock price at the grant date, is expensed
over the vesting period. For the fiscal years ended September 30, 2005, 2006
and 2007, compensation expense recognized related to RSUs was $14 million 21 million and $31 million, respectively.
Prior to October 1, 2005, the Company
accounted for its stock-based compensation plans using the intrinsic value
method in accordance with the provisions of Accounting Principles Board APB
Opinion No. 25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees, and related
Interpretations, as permitted by Statement of Financial Accounting Standards
SFAS No. 123, Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation. Effective October 1,
2005, the Company adopted the provisions of SFAS No. 123R, Share-Based
Payment, using the  method.
Under the 
method, compensation cost recognized in the fiscal year ended September 30,
2006, included i compensation cost for all stock-based payments granted prior
to but not yet vested as of October 1, 2005, based on the grant date fair value
estimated in accordance with the original provisions of SFAS No. 123, and ii
compensation cost for all share-based payments granted subsequent to October 1,
2005, based on the grant date fair value estimated in accordance with the
provisions of SFAS No. 123R. Results for prior periods have not been
restated. 48 Stock-based compensation cost is recognized
in selling, general and administrative expense and, under the fair value
provisions of SFAS No. 123R, was $38 million for the fiscal year ended
September 30, 2007. The total income tax benefit recognized in the income
statement for share-based compensation arrangements was $21 million for the
fiscal year ended September 30, 2007.
The following table illustrates the effect on
net income and earnings per share if the Company had applied the fair value

As of September 30, 2007, the total remaining
unrecognized compensation cost related to unvested stock options and RSUs was
$35 million and $74 million, respectively.
Prior to the adoption of SFAS No. 123R, the
Company presented all tax benefits of deductions resulting from the exercise of
stock options as operating cash flows in the consolidated statement of cash
flows. SFAS No. 123R requires the cash flows resulting from the tax benefits
generated from tax deductions in excess of the compensation costs recognized
for those options excess tax benefits to be classified as financing cash
flows.
Employee Stock Purchase Plan
The Company previously offered an employee stock
purchase plan ESPP that allowed eligible employees to purchase shares of the
Companys common stock each quarter at 95% of the market value on the last day
of the quarter. The ESPP was not considered compensatory under the provisions
of SFAS No. 123R and therefore no portion of the costs related to ESPP
purchases were included in the Companys stock-based compensation expense. During fiscal 2005, 2006, and 2007, respectively, the Company issued
76,900, 36,971, and 6,838 shares of common stock pursuant to this plan at an
average price of $2580, $2813, and $2924 per share. The ESPP was terminated
in fiscal 2007 and the last purchase under the plan was made in January 2007
for the fiscal quarter ending December 31, 2006.
Stock
Repurchase Program
Under
resolutions adopted in May 2000, July 2002, and March 2003, the Board of
Directors has authorized the repurchase, at managements discretion, of up to
an aggregate of $900 million of the Companys common stock. In addition, in
June 2002, the Board of Directors authorized the use of option exercise
proceeds for the repurchase of the Companys common stock. During the year
ended September 30, 2006, the Company repurchased 282,100 shares. During the
year ended September 30, 2007, the Company did not repurchase any shares. At
September 30, 2007, approximately $399 million remained available for future
stock repurchases under the program. See Note 19. Subsequent Events below for
information related to the $1500 million Accelerated Share Repurchase program
ASR announced by the Company on November 14, 2007. 51 14. Commitments and Contingencies
Litigation
The
Company is involved in various legal proceedings, including contract and
employment claims, in the ordinary course of its business. The matters reported
on below involve significant pending or potential claims against us. a
In 2006, Emergis, Inc. filed a demand for arbitration against MAXIMUS and
certain of its wholly-owned subsidiary companies in British Columbia, Canada.
Emergis was a subcontractor to MAXIMUS BC Health, Inc. and MAXIMUS BC Health
Benefit Operations, Inc. in support of their contract with the British Columbia
Ministry of Health. The subcontract required Emergis to provide a system for
the adjudication, processing and payment of health care claims for the Province
and had a total value of approximately $320 million Canadian $321 million
U.S. as of September 30, 2007. MAXIMUS had declared Emergis in default and
ultimately terminated the subcontract in September 2006. In its demand for
arbitration, Emergis challenged the basis of the termination and sought payment
of damages including the amounts that it would have received under the
subcontract. MAXIMUS believed that termination was justified and that, in any
event, damages would have been limited to the contractual limitation of
liability, which was less than $20 million Canadian $20 million U.S. as of
September 30, 2007. In September 2007, the parties agreed to restructure their
business relationship and settle the arbitration matter. As part of the
settlement, MAXIMUS did not pay any damages. b
In January 2007, MAXIMUS delivered to Accenture LLP a written formal demand for
arbitration to resolve disputes relating to the Companys role as a
subcontractor in support of Accentures prime contract with the Texas Health
and Human Services Commission HHSC for the Integrated Eligibility and
Enrollment Services program the Program. The Companys claims include i
Accentures attempt to misappropriate the Companys intellectual property, ii
Accentures failure to deliver required technology under the subcontract, iii
Accentures unilateral negotiation of issues with HHSC having a direct effect
on the Company, iv Accentures unfounded assertions that the Company had
breached its obligations with respect to the Childrens Health Insurance
Program CHIP operations under the subcontract, and v Accentures
imposition of excessive and unsubstantiated cover costs on the Company arising
out of the amendment to the subcontract entered into in June 2006. MAXIMUS
seeks to recover its damages which it believes exceed $1000 million. Accenture
submitted a response disputing MAXIMUS claims and asserting a counterclaim
that MAXIMUS breached the subcontract. Accenture seeks unspecified damages
which it has stated could be hundreds of millions of dollars. The subcontract
incorporated the terms and conditions of the prime contract which contains a
limitation of liability of $2500 million. Also
in January 2007, Accenture delivered a letter purporting to declare the Company
in default of its obligations under that subcontract. The letter stated that
Accenture planned to exercise step-in rights with respect to certain management
and supervisory services provided by the Company for the CHIP operations. The
letter also stated that Accenture intended to partially terminate the
subcontract as of February 5, 2007 with respect to the Companys obligations
regarding CHIP integrated eligibility services. The letter included a proposed turnover
plan for transitioning the CHIP services from the Company to Accenture.
Accenture has alleged that the Company owes damages relating to the CHIP
operations of at least $450 million plus $300 million in indemnification for
amounts that Accenture agreed to pay to HHSC. In
February 2007, MAXIMUS terminated its subcontract with Accenture. In March
2007, HHSC announced that it was winding down its contract with Accenture. In
connection with that process, MAXIMUS has entered into agreements directly with
HHSC to provide enrollment broker, CHIP operations and eligibility support
services. The contracts for CHIP operations and eligibility support services
run through December 31, 2008, and the enrollment broker contract runs through
August 31, 2010. The
Company believes that its positions are meritorious and that Accentures
positions are without merit, including Accentures unjustified issuance of a
default notice with respect to the CHIP operations. During the fiscal year
ended September 30, 2007, the Company recorded $100 million in legal costs
related to the arbitration. This amount represents costs incurred to date of
$78 million and an estimate of future probable legal costs of $22 million. It
is reasonably possible that the estimate of future probable legal costs of $22
million will change due to future developments. The Company will continue to
aggressively pursue its rights and remedies against Accenture to resolve the
current dispute. The arbitration hearing is scheduled for the third quarter of
fiscal year 2008. The Company cannot predict the outcome of the arbitration
proceedings or any settlement negotiations or the impact they may have on the
Companys operating results or financial condition, and therefore no accrual
for this loss contingency has been recorded on the balance sheet. 52 c In November
2007 MAXIMUS was sued by the State of Connecticut in the Superior Court in the
Judicial District of Hartford. MAXIMUS had entered into a contract in 2003 with
the Connecticut Department of Information Technology to update the States
criminal justice information system. The State claims that MAXIMUS breached its
contract and also alleges negligence and beach of the implied warranty of
fitness for a particular purpose. MAXIMUS has sued its primary subcontractor on
the effort ATS Corporation which abandoned the project before completing its
obligations. Although the State did not specify damages in its complaint, it
demanded payment of alleged damages of approximately $62 million in a letter
sent to the Company in September 2007. The Company denies that it has breached
its contract with the State. During the fiscal year ended September 30, 2007,
the Company recorded $02 million in legal costs related to this matter. The
Company cannot predict the outcome of the legal proceedings or any settlement
negotiations or the impact they may have on the Companys operating results or
financial condition. d
In December 2007, the Company became aware of a lawsuit filed by Image API
against the Company in the District Court of Travis County, Texas. That lawsuit
has not yet been served on the Company. The plaintiff was a subcontractor to
MAXIMUS under the Integrated Eligibility and Enrollment Services program the
Program with the Texas Health and Human Services Commission HHSC. As
described above, MAXIMUS was a subcontractor to Accenture under the Program
until February 2007. The Company and Image API had a number of disagreements
under their subcontract regarding Image API performance and scope of
responsibilities. Following the termination of the Company subcontract with
Accenture, the Company and Image API were not able to agree on the role Image
API would play in support of MAXIMUS' new agreements with HHSC, and Image API
terminated its services. The plaintiff has asserted a variety of claims
including breach of contract, fraud, misrepresentation, business disparagement
and trade secret misappropriation. MAXIMUS denies those allegations. The plaintiff
claims damages due to the loss of compensation expected under its subcontract
with MAXIMUS in an amount exceeding $300 million. The Company believes the
nature and the amount of the asserted claims are without merit and intends to
defend the matter vigorously. Nevertheless, the Company cannot predict the
outcome of the legal proceedings or any settlement negotiations or the impact
they may have on the Companys operating results or financial condition. Employment Agreements
The Company has employment
agreements with three of its executives and other employees with terms of the
employment obligations ending between fiscal 2008 and fiscal 2010.
15. Concentrations of Credit Risk and Major
Customers
Financial instruments that
potentially subject the Company to significant concentrations of credit risk
consist primarily of accounts receivable, billed and unbilled, on uncompleted
contracts. To date, these financial instruments have been derived from contract
revenue earned primarily from federal, state and local government agencies
located in the United States.
For the years ended September 30,
2005, 2006, and 2007, the Company derived approximately 16%, 14%, and 14 respectively, of its consolidated revenue from contracts with the state of
California, principally within our Operations Segment. 53 16. Business Segments

18. Recent Accounting Pronouncements
In
July 2006, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Interpretation FIN
No. 48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes which is effective in
fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2006, which is the Companys 2008
fiscal year. The purpose of FIN 48 is to clarify and set forth consistent rules
for accounting for uncertain tax positions in accordance with Statement of
Financial Accounting Standards No. 109, Accounting for Income Taxes. The
cumulative effect of initially applying the provisions of this interpretation
are required to be reported separately as an adjustment to the opening balance
of retained earnings in the year of adoption. While we are in the process of
reviewing and evaluating FIN 48, and therefore the ultimate impact of its
adoption is not yet known, we do not believe that FIN 48 will have a material
impact on our financial statements.
In
September 2006, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Statement of
Financial Accounting Standards SFAS No. 157, Fair Value Measurements, which
is effective in fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2007, which is the
Companys 2009 fiscal year. SFAS No. 157 defines fair value, establishes a
market-based framework or hierarchy for measuring fair value and expands
disclosures about fair value measurements. The new standard is applicable
whenever another accounting pronouncement requires or permits assets and liabilities
to be measured at fair value, with limited exceptions. We are in the process of
reviewing and evaluating SFAS No. 159, and therefore the ultimate impact of its
adoption is not yet known.
In
February 2007, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Statement of
Financial Accounting Standards SFAS No. 159, The Fair Value Option for
Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities Including an amendment of FASB
Statement No. 115, which is effective in fiscal years beginning after November
15, 2007, which is the Companys 2009 fiscal year. SFAS No. 159 permits
entities to choose to measure eligible items at fair value at specified
election dates and report unrealized gains and losses on items for which the
fair value option has been elected in earnings at each subsequent reporting
date. We are in the process of reviewing and evaluating SFAS No. 159, and
therefore the ultimate impact of its adoption is not yet known. 56 19. Subsequent Events
On
October 5, 2007, the Companys Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash
dividend of $010 for each share of the Companys common stock outstanding. The
dividend was paid on November 30, 2007, to shareholders of record on November
15, 2007. Based on the number of shares outstanding, the payment was $22
million.
On July 23, 2007, the Company announced that it had
retained UBS Investment Bank as a financial advisor to assist the Board of
Directors in exploring strategic alternatives to enhance shareholder value,
including a possible sale of the Company. On November 14, 2007, the
Company announced that its Board of Directors had completed its process to
explore strategic alternatives and had authorized the repurchase of up to
$1500 million of the Companys outstanding common stock under an Accelerated
Share Repurchase ASR program. After a thorough review process, the Board of
Directors concluded that launching a $1500 million ASR program, concentrating
the Companys strategic focus on core health and human services offerings and
considering alternatives for certain non-core assets, provides the best
opportunity to maximize shareholder value, reflecting the Companys strong
financial position and future growth prospects.
In
connection with the ASR program, the Company entered into an ASR agreement with
UBS Investment Bank on November 15, 2007. Under the ASR agreement, the Company
acquired 3,758,457 shares approximately 17% of the Companys outstanding
shares at September 30, 2007 at an initial price of $3991 per share on
November 15, 2007. At the completion of the ASR agreement, the Companys
initial price under the ASR agreement will be adjusted up or down based on the
volume-weighted average price VWAP of the stock during this period. Such
adjustment may be settled in cash or stock at the Companys discretion. The
Company financed the $1500 million ASR program with cash and cash equivalents
on hand and the sale of marketable securities. The Company also announced plans
to secure a $500 million to $750 million line of credit to provide additional
financial flexibility. 57 20. Texas Integrated Eligibility Project
Our fiscal 2006 and 2007 results were respectively impacted by a $494
million and $252 million operating loss on the Texas Integrated Eligibility
project. Up until February 2007, we served as a subcontractor to Accenture as
part of the Texas Access Alliance, which provides services under the Texas
Health and Human Services Commissions TX HHSC Integrated Eligibility
Program. We were awarded the five-year, $370 million subcontract in June 2005.
In June 2006, we amended our subcontract with Accenture to reduce scope and
realign responsibilities. In November 2006, we announced that we commenced
negotiations with Accenture to further reduce our scope on the project. In
December 2006, we initiated arbitration to resolve certain disputes under the
subcontract and in February 2007, we terminated our subcontract with Accenture.
In March 2007, the TX HHSC terminated its contract with Accenture and
contracted directly with us to provide support services for its State Childrens
Health Insurance Program SCHIP and to provide enrollment broker services for
its Medicaid program. We continue to provide services under these programs, but
on a profitable basis. The arbitration with Accenture remains ongoing. See Note 14.

21. Legal and Settlement Expense
Legal
and settlement expense consists of costs, net of reimbursed insurance claims,
related to significant legal settlements and non-routine legal matters,
including future probable legal costs estimated to be incurred in connection
with those matters. Legal expenses incurred in the ordinary course of business
are included in selling, general and administrative expense. The following
table sets forth the matters that represent legal and settlement expense

Evaluation
of Disclosure Controls and Procedures. Our management, with the
participation of our principal executive officer and principal financial
officer, has evaluated the effectiveness of the design and operation of our
disclosure controls and procedures as defined in Rule 13a-15e under the
Securities Exchange Act of 1934 the Exchange Act as of the end of the
period covered by this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Based on this evaluation,
our principal executive officer and principal financial officer concluded that
our disclosure controls and procedures are effective and designed to ensure
that the information required to be disclosed in our reports filed or submitted
under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within
the requisite time periods.
Managements
Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. Our
management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal
control over financial reporting as defined in Rule 13a-15f under the
Exchange Act. Our internal control over financial reporting is designed to
provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of our financial
reporting and the preparation of published financial statements in accordance
with generally accepted accounting principles.
Because
of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not
prevent or detect misstatements. Therefore, even those systems determined to be
effective can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to financial
statement preparation and presentation. Also, projections of any evaluation of
effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may
become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance
with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
Management
assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as

under the Exchange Act identified in connection with the evaluation of our

PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM
The
Board of Directors and Shareholders of MAXIMUS, Inc. We
have audited MAXIMUS, Inc.s internal control over financial reporting as of
September 30, 2007, based on criteria established in Internal
ControlIntegrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring
Organizations of the Treadway Commission the COSO criteria. MAXIMUS, Inc.s
management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over
financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal
control over financial reporting included in the accompanying Report on
Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an
opinion on the companys internal control over financial reporting based on our
audit. We
conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company
Accounting Oversight Board United States. Those standards require that we plan
and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective
internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material
respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control
over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists,
testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal
control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we
considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a
reasonable basis for our opinion. A
companys internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to
provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting
and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance
with generally accepted accounting principles. A companys internal control
over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that 1
pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately
and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the
company; 2 provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as
necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with
generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of
the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management
and directors of the company; and 3 provide reasonable assurance regarding
prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition
of the companys assets that could have a material effect on the financial
statements. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial
reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any
evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that
controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the
degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. In our opinion, MAXIMUS, Inc. maintained, in all material respects,
effective internal control over financial reporting as of September 30, 2007,
based on the COSO criteria. We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public
Company Accounting Oversight Board United States, the accompanying
consolidated financial statements of MAXIMUS, Inc., as of September 30, 2007
and our report dated December 3, 2007 except for Note 14d, as to which the
date is December 12, 2007 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon. s/ Ernst Young LLP McLean, Virginia
