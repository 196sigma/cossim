INDEPENDENT AUDITORS' REPORT
To the Board of Directors and Shareholders of
Century Aluminum Company   We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Century
Aluminum Company and subsidiaries the Company as of December 31, 1999 and
1998, and the related consolidated statements of operations, shareholders'
equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December
31, 1999. These consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the
Company management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these
consolidated financial statements based on our audits.
We conducted our audits in accordance with generally accepted auditing
standards. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material
misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting
the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes
assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by
management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.
We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
In our opinion, such consolidated financial statements present fairly, in
all material respects, the financial position of Century Aluminum Company and
subsidiaries as of December 31, 1999 and 1998, and the results of their
operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended
December 31, 1999 in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles.

1. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
Organization and Basis of Presentation -- Century Aluminum Company
Century or the Company is a holding company whose principal subsidiary is
Century Aluminum of West Virginia, Inc. Century of West Virginia, formerly
known as Ravenswood Aluminum Corporation, which operates a primary aluminum
reduction facility near Ravenswood, West Virginia. Century of West Virginia,
through its wholly-owned subsidiary, Berkeley Aluminum, Inc. Berkeley, holds
a 2667% interest in a partnership which operates a primary aluminum reduction
facility in Mt. Holly, South Carolina the Mt. Holly Facility and a 2667%
undivided interest in the property, plant and equipment comprising the Mt. Holly
Facility. As of December 31, 1999, the remaining interest in the partnership and
the remaining undivided interest in the Mt. Holly Facility are owned 5033% by
Alumax of South Carolina, Inc., a subsidiary of Alcoa ASC and 2300% by
Xstrata AG Xstrata, a publicly traded Swiss company. Glencore International
AG Glencore and, together with its subsidiaries, the Glencore Group is a
major shareholder of Xstrata. ASC manages and operates the facility pursuant to
an Owners Agreement, prohibiting the disposal of the interest held by any of the
owners without the consent of the other owners and providing for certain rights
of first refusal. Pursuant to the Owners Agreement, each owner furnishes its own
alumina, or alumina owned by an affiliate, for conversion to aluminum and is
responsible for its pro rata share of the operating and conversion costs. In
February 2000, the Company announced its intention to purchase an additional 23%
of the Mt. Holly Facility from Xstrata for approximately $95,000.
Prior to April 1996, the Company was an indirect, wholly owned subsidiary
of Glencore. In April 1996, the Company completed an initial public offering of
its common stock. At December 31, 1999, the Glencore Group owned 392% of
Century common shares outstanding.
On December 31, 1998, the Company acquired a cast aluminum plate business
located in Vernon, California, from Alcoa Inc. The business was named Century
Cast Plate, Inc. and operated as a wholly owned subsidiary of Century. The
business produced cast and machined aluminum plate.
On September 21, 1999, the Company completed the sale to Pechiney Rolled
Products, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company Pechiney, of certain
assets and the assumption of certain liabilities of Century of West Virginia
rolled products unit at Ravenswood, West Virginia the Rolling Business and
all of the issued and outstanding shares of common stock of Century Cast Plate,
Inc. together the fabricating businesses. The parties consummated the sale
pursuant to the Stock and Asset Purchase Agreement dated July 26, 1999 the
Purchase Agreement by and among Century, Century of West Virginia and
Pechiney. The aggregate purchase price for the fabricating businesses was
$248,000, and is subject to certain post-closing adjustments. The purchase price
was determined by arms-length negotiations between the parties. Century used a
portion of the purchase price to repay all of its outstanding bank indebtedness.
The Company historical results of operations included in the accompanying
consolidated financial statements may not be indicative of the results of
operations to be expected in the future.
Principles of Consolidation -- The consolidated financial statements
include the accounts of Century Aluminum Company and its subsidiaries, after
elimination of all significant intercompany transactions and accounts.
Berkeley interest in the Mt. Holly partnership is accounted for under the
equity method. There are no material undistributed earnings in the Mt. Holly
partnership.
Revenue -- Revenue is recognized when title passes to customers in
accordance with contract terms. Included in net sales are tolling fees that the
Company earned from smelting, casting and fabricating material supplied by
third-party customers. These fees are not related to primary aluminum shipments
and, as such, will not be present in future years due to the sale of the
fabricating businesses to Pechiney. Net sales includes tolling fees of $2,045 8,469 and $14,428 for the years ended December 31, 1999, 1998 and 1997,
respectively.

CENTURY ALUMINUM COMPANY
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS -- CONTINUED
Sales returns and allowances are treated as a reduction of sales and are
provided for based on historical experience and current estimates.
Cash and Restricted Cash Equivalents -- Cash and restricted cash
equivalents are comprised of cash and short-term investments having maturities
of less than 90 days at the time of purchase. The carrying amount of cash and
restricted cash equivalents approximates fair value.
Accounts Receivable -- The accounts receivable, trade are net of an
allowance for uncollectable accounts of $29 and $2,390 at December 31, 1999 and
1998, respectively.
Inventories -- Alumina and aluminum inventories are stated at the lower of
cost using the last-in, first-out LIFO method or market. The remaining
inventories operating and other supplies are valued at the lower of average
cost or market.
Property, Plant and Equipment -- Property, plant and equipment is stated at
cost. Additions, renewals and improvements are capitalized. Asset and
accumulated depreciation accounts are relieved for dispositions with resulting
gains or losses included in earnings. Maintenance and repairs are expensed as
incurred. Depreciation of plant and equipment is provided for by the
straight-line method over the following estimated useful lives                           
Buildings and  14 to 40 years
Machinery and   5 to 22 years   The Company periodically evaluates the carrying value of long-lived assets
to be held and used when events and circumstances warrant such a review. The
carrying value of a separately identifiable, long-lived asset is considered
impaired when the anticipated undiscounted cash flow from such asset is less
than its carrying value. In that event, a loss is recognized based on the amount
by which the carrying value exceeds the fair value of the long-lived asset. Fair
value is determined primarily using the anticipated cash flows discounted at a
rate commensurate with the risk involved.
Other Assets -- At December 31, 1999 and 1998, other assets consist
primarily of the Company investment in the Mt. Holly partnership, deferred
pension assets and deferred tax assets.
Income Taxes -- The Company accounts for income taxes using the liability
method, whereby deferred income taxes reflect the net tax effect of temporary
differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial
reporting purposes and the amounts used for income tax purposes. In evaluating
the Company ability to realize deferred tax assets, the Company uses judgment
in considering the relative impact of negative and positive evidence. The weight
given to the potential effect of negative and positive evidence is commensurate
with the extent to which it can be objectively verified. Based on the weight of
evidence, both negative and positive, including the lack of historical earnings,
if it is more likely than not that some portion or all of a deferred tax asset
will not be realized, a valuation allowance is established.
Interest Expense -- Net -- Interest earned on investments is netted with
interest incurred on indebtedness. Interest incurred in the construction of
qualifying assets is capitalized as a component of the construction costs.
Postemployment Benefits -- The Company provides certain postemployment
benefits to former and inactive employees and their dependents during the period
following employment, but before retirement. These benefits include salary
continuance, supplemental unemployment and disability healthcare. Postemployment
benefits are accounted for in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting
Standards SFAS No. 112, Employers' Accounting for Postemployment Benefits.
The statement requires recognition of the estimated future cost of providing
postemployment benefits on an accrual basis over the active service life of the
employee.

CENTURY ALUMINUM COMPANY
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS -- CONTINUED
Fixed-Price Commitments and Forward Contracts -- The Company has entered
into various fixed-price commitments to purchase alumina and primary aluminum
and to sell primary aluminum. The Company has also entered into forward primary
aluminum contracts to be settled in cash to manage the Company exposure to
changing primary aluminum prices. A change in market value of a forward contract
is recognized as a gain or loss in the period of change and is recognized in the
statements of operations as a gain or loss on forward contracts.
Financial Instruments -- The Company financial instruments principally
receivables, payables, debt and forward contracts are carried at amounts that
approximate fair value.
Concentration of Credit Risk -- Financial instruments, in addition to
forward contracts, which potentially expose the Company to concentrations of
credit risk, consist principally of cash investments and trade receivables. The
Company places its cash investments with highly rated financial institutions. At
times, such investments may be in excess of the FDIC insurance limit. With the
sale of the fabricating businesses to Pechiney, the Company significantly
reduced its customer base and thereby increased its concentrations of credit
risk with respect to trade receivables. The Company routinely assesses the
financial strength of its customers, but generally does not require collateral
to support trade receivables. As of December 31, 1999, the Company receivables
from a certain customer were approximately $30,000 or 78% of total trade
accounts receivable.
Use of Estimates -- The preparation of financial statements in conformity
with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make
estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and
liabilities and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of
the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses
during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.
Stock-Based Compensation -- The Company has elected not to adopt the
recognition provisions for employee stock-based compensation as permitted in
SFAS No. 123, Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation.
New Accounting Standards -- In June 1998, the Financial Accounting
Standards Board FASB issued SFAS No. 133, Accounting for Derivative
Instruments and Hedging Activities. SFAS No. 133 modified the accounting for
derivative and hedging activities and was initially effective for fiscal years
beginning after June 15, 1999. In April 1999, the FASB delayed the effective
date of SFAS No. 133 to fiscal years beginning after June 15, 2000. An Exposure
Draft was issued on March 3, 2000 which proposes certain amendments to SFAS No.
133. The Company continues to evaluate the potential impact SFAS No. 133 and its
proposed amendments will have on its results of operations and financial
position.
2. SALE OF FABRICATING BUSINESSES
On September 21, 1999, the Company and Century of West Virginia completed
the sale of their fabricating businesses to Pechiney. The transaction involved
the sale of certain assets and the assumption of certain liabilities and the
sale of all of the issued and outstanding shares of common stock of Century Cast
Plate. The aggregate purchase price for the fabricating businesses was $248,000
and the assumption of approximately $163,400 of current and noncurrent
liabilities, subject to certain post closing adjustments. As a result of this
transaction, the Company realized a gain of $41,130. Included in the gain are
the estimated net effects resulting from the curtailment and settlement of the
Company employee benefit plans associated with the fabricating businesses. The
gain is subject to adjustment based on the ultimate resolution of the post
closing adjustments which may affect the fabricating businesses' closing balance
sheet as of September 21, 1999.
In connection with the sale, Century of West Virginia and Pechiney entered
into a Metal Supply Agreement Metal Agreement dated as of September 21,
1999, which shall continue in effect until

July 31, 2003 with provisions for an extension. Pursuant to the Metal Agreement,
Pechiney has agreed to purchase and the Company has agreed to deliver
substantial quantities from 230 million pounds to 270 million pounds per
month of the molten aluminum produced at Century of West Virginia reduction
facility located in Ravenswood, West Virginia. Pricing for shipments to Pechiney
is based on a market index as defined in the Metal Agreement. In addition,
Pechiney is providing primary aluminum casting services to Century of West
Virginia in connection with the excess molten aluminum produced at the
Ravenswood, West Virginia reduction facility, which was not purchased by
Pechiney. In connection with the transaction, the Company and Pechiney have
entered into a Shared Facilities and Shared Services Agreement Shared Services
Agreement related to certain services, facilities, and related physical assets
that will be shared between the parties. Additionally, as part of the agreement,
the Company has agreed to indemnify Pechiney, up to certain limits, for certain
claims and environmental matters.

The Company has various operating lease commitments through 2003 relating
to machinery and equipment. Expenses under all operating leases were $1,077 1,839 and $1,504 for the years ended December 31, 1999, 1998 and 1997,
respectively.
There were no noncancelable operating leases as of December 31, 1999.
5. DEBT
On February 24, 1999, the Company entered into an agreement with
BankBoston, N.A. and the CIT Group/Business Credit, Inc. Bank Agreement to
provide up to $160,000 of revolving credit facilities and a $20,000 term loan to
refinance indebtedness, to finance certain capital expenditures and for other
general corporate purposes. The borrowing base for purposes of determining
availability was based upon certain eligible inventory and receivables. On
September 15, 1999, the Bank Agreement was amended to permit the sale of the
fabricating businesses to Pechiney and additionally required that on the closing
date the Company repay all amounts outstanding under the revolving credit
facilities see Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. On September
21, 1999, the Company repaid its outstanding debt under the revolving credit
facilities. The Company and its lenders have agreed to reduce the revolving
credit facilities from $160,000 to $75,000 and to establish new financial
covenants and other terms. The facility may not be used until such time as new
covenants and other terms are established.
The Company anticipates that the facility will provide for various
restrictive covenants, including the following: i standard restrictions on
dispositions of property and assets except in the ordinary course of business,
ii restrictions on the incurrence of indebtedness and liens and the making of
capital expenditures and investments, iii a prohibition on the payment of
dividends except dividends up to $5,000 per year, iv a prohibition on change

On January 30, 1996 Century of West Virginia and Berkeley entered into a
bank revolving credit facility Prior Facility with BankAmerica Business
Credit, Inc. The Prior Facility provided for a revolving credit facility that
consisted of borrowings and letters of credit up to $150,000 in the aggregate,
based on availability. The borrowing base for purposes of determining
availability under the Prior Facility was based upon certain eligible inventory
and receivables.
The variable interest rate on the borrowings under the Prior Facility was
71% on December 31, 1998. Borrowings of $89,389 as of December 31, 1998 were
collateralized by Century of West Virginia and Berkeley inventory and
receivables and were guaranteed by the Company.

7. PENSION AND OTHER POSTRETIREMENT BENEFITS
Pension Benefits
The Company maintains noncontributory defined benefit pension plans
covering substantially all of its employees. For salaried employees, plan
benefits are based primarily on years of service and average compensation during
the later years of employment. For hourly employees, plan benefits are based
primarily on a formula that provides a specific benefit for each year of
service. The Company funding policy is to contribute annually an amount based
upon actuarial and economic assumptions designed to achieve adequate funding of
the projected benefit obligations and to meet the minimum funding requirements
of ERISA. Plan assets consist principally of U.S. equity securities, growth
funds and fixed income accounts. As explained in Note 12, the Company agreed to
make additional contributions to the hourly plan in connection with the initial
public offering of the Company common stock. In addition, the Company provides
supplemental executive retirement benefits for its executive officers.

Other Postretirement Benefits OPEB
In addition to providing pension benefits, the Company provides certain
healthcare and life insurance benefits for substantially all retired employees.
The Company accounts for these plans in accordance with SFAS No. 106,
Employers' Accounting for Postretirement Benefits Other Than Pensions. SFAS
No. 106 requires the Company to accrue the estimated cost of providing
postretirement benefits during the working careers of those employees who could
become eligible for such benefits when they retire. The Company funds these
benefits as the retirees submit claims.

and 1997, respectively. The rates were assumed to remain at 600% for 2000 and
thereafter.
A one-percentage-point increase in the assumed rate of inflation in future
medical costs would increase the postretirement benefit obligation at December
31, 1999 by $5,178 and would increase aggregate 1999 service and interest cost
by $2,660. A one-percentage-point decrease in the assumed rate of inflation in
future medical costs would decrease the postretirement benefit obligation at
December 31, 1999 by $4,186 and would decrease aggregate 1999 service and
interest cost by $2,069. At December 31, 1999, the defined benefit pension plan
for salaried employees had a projected benefit obligation of $6,486 and plan
assets of $5,085.
The Company sponsors a tax-deferred savings plan under which eligible
employees may elect to contribute specified percentages of their compensation
with the Company providing matching contributions of 60% of the first 6% of a
participant annual compensation contributed to the savings plan. One half of
the Company contribution is invested in the common stock of Century and one
half of the Company contribution is in cash. Company contributions to the
savings plan were $585, $774 and $806 for the years ended December 31, 1999,
1998 and 1997, respectively.
8. SHAREHOLDERS' EQUITY
Preferred Stock -- Under the Company Restated Certificate of
Incorporation, the Board of Directors is authorized to issue up to 5,000,000
shares of preferred stock, with a par value of one cent per share, in one or
more series. The authorized but unissued preferred shares may be issued with
such dividend rates, conversion privileges, voting rights, redemption prices and
liquidation preferences as the Board of Directors may determine, without action
by shareholders.
9. STOCK BASED COMPENSATION
1996 Stock Incentive Plan -- The Company adopted the 1996 Stock Incentive
Plan the Stock Incentive Plan for the purpose of awarding performance share
units and granting qualified incentive stock options and nonqualified stock
options to salaried officers and other key employees of the Company. The Stock
Incentive Plan has a term of ten years from its effective date. The number of
shares available under the Stock Incentive Plan is 1,200,000. Granted stock
options vest one-third on the grant date and an additional one-third on each of
the first and second anniversary dates. The Company awarded 460,000 performance
share units at the time of the initial public offering for no consideration. The
performance share units represent the right to receive common stock, on a
one-for-one basis on their vesting dates. The value of the performance share
units, $13 per share, is being charged to compensation expense over their five
year vesting period, which is one-third at the end of each of the third, fourth
and fifth anniversary dates. During 1999, 153,333 of the performance shares
became vested and were converted to Common Stock. The Stock Incentive Plan, as
presently administered, provides for additional grants upon the attainment of
certain established performance goals. In 1999, the Company recognized $1,623 of
expense related to the Stock Incentive Plan. The performance share units do not
affect the issued and outstanding shares of common stock until conversion at the
end of the
31

CENTURY ALUMINUM COMPANY
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS -- CONTINUED
vesting periods. However, the performance share units are considered common
stock equivalents and therefore are included, using the treasury stock method,
in average common shares outstanding for diluted earnings per share
computations.
The Company applies APB Opinion 25 and related interpretations in
accounting for the 1996 Stock Incentive Plan. Accordingly, no compensation cost
has been recognized for the stock option portions of the plan. Had compensation
cost for the Stock Incentive Plan been determined based on the fair value at the
grant dates for awards under the plan consistent with the method of SFAS No.

non-qualified stock options to non-employee directors. The number of shares
available under this plan is 200,000, of which options for 83,000 shares have
been awarded. The initial options vest one-third on the grant date and an
additional one-third on each of the first and second anniversary dates.
Subsequent options vest one-fourth each calendar quarter. Each option granted
under this plan will be exercisable for a period of ten years from the date of
grant.

12. CONTINGENCIES AND COMMITMENTS
Environmental Contingencies
The Company operations are subject to various environmental laws and
regulations. The Company has spent and expects to spend in the future,
significant amounts for compliance with those laws and regulations.

CENTURY ALUMINUM COMPANY
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS -- CONTINUED
In addition, past manufacturing activities have resulted in environmental
impacts requiring remediation. Pursuant to certain environmental laws, the
Company, regardless of fault, may be liable for the costs of remediation of
contaminated property or for the amelioration of damage to natural resources.
Although the Company believes, based upon information currently available to
management, that it will not have liabilities in this regard which are likely to
have a material adverse effect on the Company, there can be no assurance that
future remedial requirements at currently and formerly owned or operated
properties or adjacent areas will not result in a material adverse effect on the
Company financial condition, results of operations or liquidity.
The 1990 amendments to the Clean Air Act impose stringent standards on
aluminum industry air emissions. These amendments will affect the operations of
the Company facilities. Technology-based standards relating to smelters and
carbon plants have been promulgated. However, the Company cannot predict with
certainty the total amount of environmental expenditures the Company will incur
to comply with these standards.
Pursuant to an Environmental Protection Agency EPA order issued in 1994
under Section 3008h the 3008h order of the Resource Conservation and
Recovery Act RCRA, Century of West Virginia is performing remediation
measures at a former oil pond area and in connection with cyanide contamination
in the groundwater. Century of West Virginia also conducted and submitted to the
EPA an RCRA facility investigation RFI evaluating other areas that may have
contamination exceeding certain levels. The EPA has advised Century of West
Virginia that it may not comment on the RFI until the third quarter of 2000.
After the RFI is complete, Century of West Virginia will have 60 days within
which to submit a corrective measures study CMS to the EPA proposing means
of remediating areas that may require cleanup. If any cleanup is required, EPA
would issue a subsequent order. Century of West Virginia believes this process
will not be completed before the fourth quarter of 2000. At this time, the
Company is unable to determine if any cleanup measures may be required. However,
the Company is aware of some environmental contamination at Century of West
Virginia, and it is likely cleanup activities will be required in two areas of
the facility. Century of West Virginia believes a significant portion of this
contamination is attributable to the operations of a prior owner and will be the
financial responsibility of that owner, as discussed below.
Prior to the Company acquisition of the Century of West Virginia
facility, Kaiser Aluminum & Chemical Corporation Kaiser owned and operated
the facility for approximately thirty years. Many of the conditions which
Century of West Virginia investigated under the 3008h order exist because of
activities which occurred during Kaiser ownership and operation. With respect
to those conditions, Kaiser will be responsible for the costs of required
cleanup under the terms of the Kaiser Purchase Agreement. In addition, Kaiser
retained title to certain land within the Century of West Virginia premises and
retains full responsibility for those areas. Under current environmental laws,
the Company may be required to remediate any contamination which was discharged
from areas which Kaiser owns or previously owned or operated. However, if such
remediation is required, the Company believes that Kaiser will be liable for
some or all of the costs thereof pursuant to the Kaiser Purchase Agreement.
In connection with the sale to Pechiney of the fabricating businesses, the
Company and Century of West Virginia provided Pechiney with certain
indemnifications. Those include the indemnification rights Century of West
Virginia and the Company, respectively, have under the Kaiser Purchase Agreement
with respect to the real property transferred to Pechiney and the Company
Cast Plate, Inc., Stock Purchase Agreement with Alcoa. The Pechiney Purchase
Agreement provides further indemnifications which are limited, in general, to
pre-closing conditions which were not disclosed to Pechiney or to off site
migration of hazardous substances from pre-closing acts or omissions of Century
of West Virginia. Environmental indemnifications under the Pechiney Purchase
Agreement expire September 20, 2005; they are payable only to the extent they
exceed $2,000.

The Company is aware of two areas of contamination at its previously owned
Virgin Islands Alumina Company Vialco facility. At the first of these areas,
the Company has removed contaminated soils and has disposed of such soils in
approved facilities. In addition, it has begun a bioremediation program that it
believes will fulfill the remaining legal requirements with respect to such
soils. In the second area, the Company believes that a substantial amount of the
contamination originated from an adjacent refinery owned by Hess Oil Virgin
Islands, Inc. HOVIC. The Company further believes that the vast majority of
any contamination that did not originate from HOVIC was caused by releases on
the property that predated Vialco ownership and will not be the legal
responsibility of Vialco. Pursuant to the Acquisition Agreement by which Vialco
sold the premises to St. Croix Alumina, LLC, a subsidiary of Alcoa Alumina and
Chemicals LLS St. Croix, Vialco retained liability for environmental
conditions existing at the time of the sale only to the extent such conditions
arose from operation of the facility by Vialco. In addition, indemnification
arises only if the conditions require remediation or give rise to claims under
the laws in effect at the time of sale. Finally, St. Croix may not request
indemnity from Vialco until St. Croix has spent $300 on such environmental
conditions and Vialco indemnity is capped at $18,000. Management of the
Company does not believe that the retained liability, if any, will have a
material adverse effect on the Company financial condition, results of
operations, or liquidity.
It is the Company policy to accrue for costs associated with
environmental assessments and remedial efforts when it becomes probable that a
liability has been incurred and the costs can be reasonably estimated. The
aggregate environmental related accrued liabilities were $900 and $1,400 at
December 31, 1999 and 1998, respectively. All accruals have been recorded
without giving effect to any possible future insurance or Kaiser indemnity
proceeds. With respect to ongoing environmental compliance costs, including
maintenance and monitoring, such costs are expensed as incurred.
Because of the issues and uncertainties described above, and the Company
inability to predict the requirements of the future environmental laws, there
can be no assurance that future capital expenditures and costs for environmental
compliance will not have a material adverse effect on the Company future
financial condition, results of operations, or liquidity. Based upon all
available information, management does not believe that the outcome of these
environmental matters will have a material adverse effect on the Company
financial condition, results of operations, or liquidity.
Legal Contingencies
Century of West Virginia is a named defendant along with other companies
in approximately 2,363 civil actions brought by individuals seeking to recover
compensatory and/or punitive damages in connection with alleged asbestos-related
diseases. All plaintiffs have been employees of independent contractors who
claim to have been exposed to asbestos in the course of performing services at
various facilities, including the Century of West Virginia facility. The cases
are typically resolved based upon factual determinations as to the facilities at
which the plaintiffs worked, the periods of time during which work was
performed, the type of work performed, and the conditions in which work was
performed. If the plaintiffs' work was performed during the period when Kaiser
owned the Century of West Virginia facility, Kaiser has retained responsibility
for defense and indemnity pursuant to the Kaiser Purchase Agreement. If a
plaintiff is shown to have worked at the Century of West Virginia facility after
the time Century of West Virginia purchased the facility from Kaiser, Kaiser
assumes the defense and liability, subject to a reservation of rights against
Century of West Virginia. The Company believes it is unlikely that existing or
potential plaintiffs were exposed to asbestos at the Century of West Virginia
facility after Century of West Virginia purchased the facility from Kaiser.
There are currently several actions pending by individuals who claim exposure
after Century of West Virginia assumption of the premises. While the impact of
the asbestos proceedings is impossible to predict, the Company believes that the
ultimate resolution will not have a material adverse effect on the Company
financial condition, results of operations, or liquidity.

CENTURY ALUMINUM COMPANY
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS -- CONTINUED
The Company has pending against it or may be subject to various other
lawsuits, claims and proceedings related primarily to employment, commercial,
environmental and safety and health matters. Although it is not presently
possible to determine the outcome of these matters, management believes their
ultimate disposition will not have a material adverse effect on the Company
financial condition, results of operations, or liquidity.
In August 1999, an illegal, one-day work stoppage temporarily shut down one
of the Company four production lines at the Century of West Virginia facility.
The cost of this work stoppage is estimated to be approximately $10,000
including equipment damaged as a result of the production line shutdown. The
Company has filed a claim with its insurance carrier for business interruption
and equipment damage relative to the work stoppage.
Commitments
The Company and a public utility have a fixed price power supply agreement,
covering the period from July 1, 1996 through July 31, 2003.
On January 23, 1996, the Company and the Pension Benefit Guaranty
Corporation PBGC entered into an agreement the PBGC Agreement which
provided that the Company make scheduled cash contributions to its pension plan
for hourly employees in 1996, 1997, 1998 and 1999. The Company made its
scheduled contributions for each of the years. The Company has granted the PBGC
a first priority security interest in i the property, plant and equipment at
its Century of West Virginia facility and ii all of the outstanding shares of
Berkeley. In addition, Century must grant the PBGC a first priority security
interest in the first $50,000 of the property, plant and equipment of any
business or businesses that the Company acquires. The Company, at its
discretion, may, however, substitute Berkeley undivided interest in the Mt.
Holly Facility in lieu of any such after-acquired property, plant and equipment
as well as the shares of Berkeley.
Other
Century of West Virginia hourly employees, which comprise 83% of the
Company workforce are represented by the United Steelworkers of America and
are currently working under a four year labor agreement effective June 1, 1999.
13. FIXED-PRICE COMMITMENTS AND FORWARD CONTRACTS
The Company produces primary aluminum products and manages risk through the
issuance of fixed-price commitments and financial instruments.
The Company had fixed price commitments to sell 1244 million pounds of
primary aluminum at December 31, 1999 and 5439 million pounds of primary
aluminum, aluminum scrap and sheet and plate products at December 31,1998. Of
the total fixed-price sales commitments, 683 million pounds and 346 million
pounds at December 31, 1999 and 1998, respectively, were with the Glencore
Group. The Company had no fixed-price commitments to purchase aluminum at
December 31, 1999. The Company had fixed-price commitments to purchase 1908
million pounds of aluminum and alloy raw materials at December 31, 1998. Of the
total fixed-price purchase commitments, 1621 million pounds at December 31,
1998 were with the Glencore Group.
In order to manage the Company exposure to fluctuating commodity prices,
the Company enters into forward sales and purchase contracts for primary
aluminum that will be settled in cash. The Company had forward sales contracts
for 600 million and 656 million pounds of primary aluminum to be settled in
cash, primarily with the Glencore Group, at December 31, 1999 and 1998,
respectively. At December 31, 1998, the Company had forward purchase contracts,
primarily with the Glencore Group, for 180 million pounds. There were no
forward purchase contracts as of December 31, 1999. Forward sales contracts at
December 31, 1999
37
39
CENTURY ALUMINUM COMPANY
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS -- CONTINUED
are scheduled for settlement at various dates in 2000 and 2001. Based on market
prices at December 31, 1999, the forward sales contracts could be settled by the
Company paying approximately $1,700. The actual settlement will be based on
market prices on the respective settlement dates.
The Company entered into a long-term supply agreement for 9360 million
pounds of alumina annually, beginning January 1, 1996. The Company will pay a
fixed price for alumina with annual price increases of approximately 25%
through 2001. Pricing for the years 2002 through 2006 will be subject to
agreement between the parties.
In connection with the sale of the fabricating businesses see Note 2 to
the Consolidated Financial Statements, the Company entered into a Molten
Aluminum Purchase Agreement the Metal Agreement with Pechiney, that shall
continue in effect until July 31, 2003 with provisions for extension. Pursuant
to the Metal Agreement, Pechiney has agreed to purchase and the Company has
agreed to deliver, on a monthly basis, at least 230 million pounds and no more
than 270 million pounds of molten aluminum. The selling price is based on a
quoted average primary aluminum market price as reported for the month
immediately preceding the month of delivery.
Although the Company has not materially participated in the purchase of
call options, in cases where Century sells forward primary aluminum, it may
purchase call options to preserve the opportunity to benefit from price
increases significantly above the forward sales prices. In addition, in cases
where the Company purchases forward primary aluminum, it may purchase put
options to protect itself from price decreases.

brazing sheet for sale to automobile manufacturers, heat treated and non-heat
treated plate for sale to aerospace and defense manufacturers, heavy gauge,
wide-leveled coil for sale to heavy truck, truck trailer, marine and rail car
manufacturers and sheet and coil for sale to building products manufacturers.
The accounting policies of the segments are the same as those described in
