MANAGEMENT REPORT ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING  Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15f and 15d-15f under the Securities Exchange Act. Under the
supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting based on the framework in
Internal Control Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission COSO. As a result of this evaluation, our management concluded that our internal control over financial
reporting was not effective as of December31, 2005.  Our
internal control over financial reporting includes policies and procedures that pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect transactions and dispositions of assets, provide reasonable assurances
that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures are being made in accordance with authorizations of our
management and directors; and provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisitions, use or disposition of our assets that could have a material effect on our financial statements.  Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial
reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risks that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with
the policies or procedures may deteriorate.  Effective internal
controls are necessary for us to provide reliable financial reports. If we cannot provide reliable financial reports, our business and operating results could be harmed. We have in the past discovered, and may in the future discover, areas of our
internal controls that need improvement.  As of
December31, 2005, management identified two deficiencies in the Companys internal control over financial reporting that each constitute a material weakness. The first is a material weakness in the Companys ability to apply
generally accepted accounting principles as they relate to the recognition of revenue on transactions that contain complex and non-standard terms. In the fourth quarter of 2005, we incorrectly recorded approximately $1 million of revenue in our
initial consolidated trial balance which resulted in an audit adjustment. The revenue was associated with two non-standard software license transactions with respect to which the customers had the option to purchase additional license rights during
a specified period of time in the future at a significant discount. We ultimately determined that the revenue related to the significant discounts offered to the customers on the options should be deferred until the options were exercised or expire
in 2006.  The second deficiency was the fact that our controls
over the accounting for income taxes did not operate effectively. This was related to our ability to make accurate estimates impacting our tax provision. In connection with its evaluation of our internal control over financial reporting as of
December31, 2004, management concluded that there was a significant deficiency arising from insufficient technical review and supervision of tax decisions, including various estimates. Management determined, based upon certain adjustments to
our tax provision that were required in the fourth quarter of 2005 that were significant but not material, that this deficiency had not been effectively remediated as of December31, 2005. Due to these adjustments, the potential for further
misstatements and the fact that the significant deficiency was not remediated after one year management deemed the control deficiency to be a material weakness. 
Because of the material weaknesses described above, management has concluded that we did not maintain effective internal control over financial
reporting as of December31, 2005, based on criteria in Internal Control Integrated Framework issued by the COSO.  Our managements assessment of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December31, 2005 has been audited by
Deloitte Touche LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in their report which expressed an unqualified opinion on managements assessment and an adverse opinion on the effectiveness of our internal control
over financial reporting as of December31, 2005 which appears on page 38 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM  To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of Pegasystems Inc.:  We have audited managements assessment, included in the accompanying Management Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting, that Pegasystems Inc. and subsidiaries the Company did
not maintain effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2005, because of the effect of the material weaknesses identified in managements assessment based on criteria established in Internal Control 
Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. The Companys management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the
effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on managements assessment and an opinion on the effectiveness of the Companys internal control over financial reporting based on our
audit.  We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards
of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board United States. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all
material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, evaluating managements assessment, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control, and performing
such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinions.  A companys internal control over financial reporting is a process designed by, or under the supervision of, the companys principal executive
and principal financial officers, or persons performing similar functions, and effected by the companys board of directors, management, and other personnel to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and
the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A companys internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that 1pertain to the
maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; 2provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation
of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and
3provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the companys assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.  Because of the inherent limitations of internal control over financial
reporting, including the possibility of collusion or improper management override of controls, material misstatements due to error or fraud may not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. Also, projections of any evaluation of the effectiveness
of the internal control over financial reporting to future periods are subject to the risk that the controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
A material weakness is a significant deficiency, or
combination of significant deficiencies, that results in more than a remote likelihood that a material misstatement of the annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected. The following material weaknesses have been
identified and included in managements assessment: 1the Companys controls over the accounting for software revenue recognition did not operate effectively. Specifically, the Companys ability to apply generally accepted
accounting principles as they relate to the recognition of revenue on transactions that contain complex and non-standard terms resulted in the improper recording of a total of approximately $1 million of revenue in the fourth quarter of 2005 that
resulted in an audit adjustment and 2the Companys controls over the accounting for income taxes did not operate effectively. In connection with the Companys evaluation of its internal control over financial reporting as of
December31, 2004, a significant deficiency was identified arising from insufficient technical review and supervision of tax decisions, including various estimates. At December31, 2005, based upon certain adjustments 
38 Table of Contents
to the tax provision that occurred in the fourth quarter of 2005 that were significant but not material, it was apparent that a significant deficiency still
existed in this area. Due to these adjustments, the potential for further misstatements and the fact that the significant deficiency was not remediated after one year, management deemed the control deficiency to be a material weakness. These
material weaknesses were considered in determining the nature, timing, and extent of audit tests applied in our audit of the consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended December31, 2005, of the Company and this report does
not affect our report on such financial statements.  In our
opinion, managements assessment that the Company did not maintain effective internal control over financial reporting as of December31, 2005, is fairly stated, in all material respects, based on the criteria established in Internal
Control Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Also in our opinion, because of the effect of the material weaknesses described above on the achievement of the objectives of the
control criteria, the Company has not maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of December31, 2005, based on the criteria established in Internal Control Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of
Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission.  We have
also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board United States, the consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended December31, 2005, of the Company and our report dated
March3, 2006 expressed an unqualified opinion on those financial statements.  /s/DELOITTE TOUCHE LLP Boston, Massachusetts

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM  To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of Pegasystems Inc.:  We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Pegasystems
Inc. and subsidiaries the Company as of December31, 2005 and 2004, and the related consolidated statements of income, stockholders equity and comprehensive income, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period
ended December31, 2005. These financial statements are the responsibility of the Companys management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audits.  We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public
Company Accounting Oversight Board United States. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a
test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial
statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.  In our opinion, such consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December31, 2005 and 2004, and the results of its operations and its
cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December31, 2005, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.  We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board United States, the
effectiveness of the Companys internal control over financial reporting as of December31, 2005, based on the criteria established in Internal Control Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations
of the Treadway Commission and our report dated March3, 2006 expressed an unqualified opinion on managements assessment of the effectiveness of the Companys internal control over financial reporting and an adverse opinion on the
effectiveness of the Companys internal control over financial reporting because of material weaknesses.  /s/DELOITTE TOUCHE LLP Boston, Massachusetts

SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES  a Business
We develop, market, license and support software to
manage complex, changing business processes. We provide implementation, consulting, training, and technical support services to facilitate the use of our software.  b Management estimates and reporting  The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of
America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues
and expenses during the periods presented. Actual results could differ from those estimates. Significant assets and liabilities with reported amounts based on estimates include trade and installment accounts receivable, long term license
installments, deferred income taxes and deferred revenue.  c Principles of consolidation  The
consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Pegasystems Inc. and its wholly owned subsidiaries, Pegasystems Limited a United Kingdom company, Pegasystems Company a Canadian company, Pegasystems Worldwide Inc. a United States
corporation, Pegasystems Pty Ltd. an Australian company, Pegasystems Investment Inc. a United States corporation and Pegasystems Private Ltd a Singapore company. All inter-company accounts and transactions have been eliminated in
consolidation.  d Foreign currency translation
The translation of assets and liabilities of our
foreign subsidiaries is made at period-end exchange rates, while revenue and expense accounts are translated at the average exchange rates during the period transactions occurred. The resulting translation adjustments are reflected in accumulated
other comprehensive income. Realized and unrealized exchange gains or losses from transactions and adjustments are reflected in other income expense, net, in the accompanying consolidated statements of income.  e Revenue recognition  Software revenue is recognized in accordance with Statement of Position
SOP 97-2, Software Revenue Recognition, as amended. We generally have multiple element arrangements including software licenses, professional services, maintenance and training. We do not have vendor specific objective evidence of fair
value for the software license and, therefore, allocate the arrangement fee to each of the elements based on the residual method in accordance with Statement of Position 98-9 Modification of SOP 97-2, Software Revenue Recognition, with Respect
to Certain Transactions. We determine fair value for the non-license elements as the price for such elements when sold separately. Revenue from arrangements in which the fair value of one or more undelivered elements is unknown is deferred
until the fair value of those elements is known and the residual value of the license can be determined.  Perpetual license fees are recognized as revenue when the software is delivered provided all other revenue recognition criteria are met. Term software
license fees are generally payable on a monthly basis under license agreements that generally have a five-year term and may be renewed for additional years at the customers option. The present value of future term license payments is generally
recognized as revenue upon customer acceptance, provided that no significant obligations or contingencies exist related to the software, other than maintenance support, provided all other revenue recognition criteria are met. In certain
circumstances, such as when license fees are not fixed or determinable, revenue from such licenses is recognized over the term of the agreement as payments become due, or ratably over the term of the license when payments are made in advance. Our
standard license terms provide that the software is accepted upon delivery. 
45 Table of Contents PEGASYSTEMS INC.  NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTSContinued 
Services revenue is comprised of fees for software implementation, consulting, maintenance and
training services. Implementation and consulting services do not generally involve producing new software or customizing or modifying the licensed software, but rather involve helping customers deploy the software to their specific business
processes. As the services provided are not essential to the functionality of the software and are described in the agreement such that the total price of the arrangement would be expected to vary as the result of the inclusion or exclusion of the
services, we account separately for the services element of the arrangement. Revenue for time and material projects is recognized as services are provided. Revenue for fixed-price services projects is recognized as the services are provided based
upon the hours incurred at amounts equal to direct costs incurred, up to the amounts billed to date, resulting in no gross profit recognized at that point. Generally, when the fixed-price services project is complete, the remaining revenue and gross
profit associated with the fixed-price services project is recognized. Maintenance revenues are recognized ratably over the related contract period, generally twelve months. Training revenue is recognized as the services are provided.  f Cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments

We consider debt securities with maturities of three months or less, when purchased, to be cash
equivalents. Auction rate securities have been classified as short-term investments. Purchases and sales of securities are recorded on a trade-date basis. Interest is recorded when earned. All of our investments are classified as available-for-sale
and are carried at fair value with unrealized gains and losses recorded as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income. We determine the appropriate classification of our investments in debt securities at the time of purchase and
re-evaluate such determination at each balance sheet date. There have been no reclassifications between available-for-sale and held-to-maturity investment categories. Our investments in government sponsored enterprises include debt securities issued
by the Federal Home Loan Bank System, the Federal National Mortgage Association Fannie Mae, the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation Freddie Mac, and the Federal Farm Credit Banks. Investments in government sponsored enterprises are not backed
by the full faith and credit of the U.S. Government. As of December31, 2005, remaining maturities of marketable debt securities ranged from January 2006 to July 2008. As of December31, 2004, remaining maturities of marketable debt
securities ranged from January 2005 to May 2007. Proceeds from sales of available-for-sale auction rate securities during 2005 were $145 million, with no gross realized gains or losses. Proceeds from available-for-sale securities that matured or
were called during 2005 were $12 million with a gross realized loss of $18 thousand and no gross realized gains. Specific identification of the individual securities was used to determine the basis on which the gain or loss was calculated.
In November 2005, the FASB issued FSP FAS 115-1 and FAS 124-1,
The Meaning of Other-Than-Temporary Impairment and Its Application to Certain Investments FSP 115-1, which provides guidance on determining when investments in certain debt and equity securities are considered
impaired, whether that impairment is other-than-temporary, and on measuring such impairment loss. FSP 115-1 also includes accounting considerations subsequent to the recognition of an other-than-temporary impairment and requires certain disclosures
about unrealized losses that have not been recognized as other-than-temporary impairments. FSP 115-1 is required to be applied to reporting periods beginning after December15, 2005. We have applied FSP 115-1 as of December31, 2005.
The following table shows the gross unrealized losses and fair
value of our investments, with unrealized losses that are not deemed to be other-than-temporarily impaired, aggregated by investment category and length of time that individual securities have been in a continuous unrealized loss position at
December31, 2005.  in thousands

on our investments in commercial paper, government sponsored enterprises, corporate bonds and municipal bonds were caused by interest rate increases. Because we have the ability and intent to hold those investments until a recovery of fair value,
which may be maturity, we do not consider those investments to be other-than-temporarily impaired at December31, 2005.

g Concentration of credit risk  Financial instruments that potentially subject us to a concentration of
credit risk consist of short-term cash investments, trade accounts receivable and license installments receivable. We record long-term license installments in accordance with our revenue recognition policy, which results in long-term installment
receivables from customers due in periods exceeding one year from the reporting date, primarily from large organizations with strong credit ratings. We grant credit to customers who are located throughout the world. We perform credit evaluations
of customers and generally do not request collateral from customers. Future installments due under term licenses as of December31, 2005 are as follows:  Years ending December31 Licenseinstallments inthousands 2006 26,537 2007 17,981 2008 9,211 2009 2,457 2010 2,085 2011 and thereafter 3,643 61,914 Deferred license interest income 4,006 Total license installments receivable, net 57,908  h Equipment
and improvements, net of accumulated depreciation and amortization  Equipment and improvements are recorded at cost. Depreciation and amortization are computed using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets, which are three years for equipment, including
software, and five years for furniture and fixtures. Leasehold improvements are amortized over the lesser of the life of the lease or the useful life of the asset. Repairs and maintenance costs are expensed as incurred.  i Impairment of long-lived assets  We evaluate our long-lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes
in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of such assets may not be recoverable. Impairment is generally assessed by comparison of undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by an asset to its carrying value, with the exception that
goodwill impairment is assessed by use of a fair value model. If such assets are considered to be impaired, the impairment to be recognized is measured by the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds its fair value. There were no
impairments in 2005, 2004, and 2003.  j Research and
development and software costs  Research and
development costs, other than certain software related costs, are expensed as incurred. Capitalization of computer software developed for resale is accounted for in accordance with FASB Statement No86, Accounting for the Costs of Computer
Software to Be Sold, Leased, or Otherwise Marketed. Accordingly, capitalization of software costs begins upon the establishment of technical feasibility, generally demonstrated by a working model or an operative version of the computer software
product. Such costs have not been material to date and, as a result, no internal costs were capitalized during 2005, 2004, and 2003. Amortization of capitalized software is included in the cost of software license. No amortization expense for
internally developed capitalized software costs was charged to cost of software license during 2005, 2004, and 2003.

customer accounted for more than 10% of our total revenue. In 2003, two customers accounted for approximately 15% and 12% of our total revenue, respectively. At December31, 2005, one customer accounted for approximately 19% of outstanding
trade receivables and one other customer represented 13% of long and short-term license installments. At December31, 2004, two customers represented 19% and 13% of outstanding trade accounts receivable, respectively. At December31, 2004,
three customers represented 17%, 14% and 13% of short and long term license installments, respectively.  m Stock options  We periodically grant stock options for a fixed number of shares of common stock to employees, directors and non-employee contractors with an exercise
price greater than or equal to the fair market value of the shares at 
49 Table of Contents PEGASYSTEMS INC.  NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTSContinued 
the date of the grant. We account for stock option grants to employees and directors using the intrinsic value method. Under the intrinsic value method,
compensation associated with stock option awards to employees and directors is determined as the difference, if any, between the current fair value of the underlying common stock on the date compensation is measured and the price the employee or
director must pay to exercise the award. The measurement date for employee awards is generally the date of grant. Stock option awards granted to non-employee contractors are accounted for using the fair value method. Under the fair value method,
compensation associated with stock option awards to non-employee contractors is determined based on the estimated fair value of the award itself, measured using either current market data or an established option pricing model.  At December31, 2005, we had four stock-based employee compensation
plans, which are described more fully in Note 4. No stock-based employee compensation expense was recorded in 2005, 2004 or 2003, as all options granted under those plans had an exercise price equal to or greater than the market value of the
underlying common stock on the date of grant and were granted only to employees and directors. The following table illustrates the effect on net income and earnings per share if we had applied the fair value method to stock-based employee
compensation:  in thousands, except per share amounts

The fair value of

For the portion of
pro-forma compensation expense disclosed above relating to the Stock Purchase Plan, the weighted average fair values of the options feature implicit in our Stock Purchase Plan offerings in 2005, 2004, and 2003 were $191, $215 and $182,
respectively.  The effects on 2005, 2004, and 2003 pro-forma
net income and earnings per share of the estimated fair value of stock options and estimated dilutive shares are not necessarily representative of the effects on the results of operations in the future. In addition, the estimates made utilize a
pricing model developed for traded options with relatively short lives; our option grants typically have a life of up to ten years and are not transferable. 
50 Table of Contents PEGASYSTEMS INC.  NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTSContinued 
Therefore, the actual fair value of a stock option grant may be different from our estimates. We believe that our estimates incorporate all relevant
information and represent a reasonable approximation in light of the difficulties involved in valuing non-traded stock options.  In December 2004, the Financial Accounting Standards Board FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No123R,
Share-Based Payment SFAS 123R. This Statement is a revision of SFAS No123, Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation, and supersedes Accounting Principles Board Opinion No25, Accounting for Stock Issued to
Employees, and its related implementation guidance. SFAS 123R focuses primarily on accounting for transactions in which an entity obtains employee services in share-based payment transactions. The Statement requires entities to recognize stock
compensation expense for awards of equity instruments to employees based on the grant date fair value of those awards with limited exceptions. The company is required to adopt SFAS 123R on January1, 2006.  On April6, 2005, in response to the issuance of SFAS 123R, the
Compensation Committee of our Board of Directors approved accelerating the vesting of out-of-the-money, unvested stock options held by certain current employees, excluding officers as defined under Section16a of the Securities
Exchange Act of 1934. Unvested options having an exercise price greater than $700 per share, representing the right to purchase a total of approximately 16million shares, became exercisable as a result of the vesting acceleration. All other
terms and conditions in the original grants remain unchanged. The acceleration of vesting did not result in the recognition of compensation expense for the year ended December31, 2005 as the exercise price was in excess of the fair market
value on the date of modification resulting in no intrinsic value under APB25. The pro-forma results reported for 2005 in this footnote to the financial statements include approximately $4 million of pro-forma compensation expense resulting from the
vesting acceleration. The decision to accelerate vesting of these options was made primarily to reduce compensation expense that would otherwise be recognized after the adoption of SFAS 123R.  On December8, 2005, the Compensation Committee of our Board of
Directors approved a stock option grant to certain eligible employees. All eligible employees received fully vested options with an exercise price 20% greater than the stock price on the date of grant. The stock option grant did not result in
recognition of compensation expense for the year ended December31, 2005 as the exercise price was in excess of the fair market value on the date of grant resulting in no intrinsic value under APB 25. The 2005 pro-forma results reported in
footnote 1m to the financial statements include approximately $38 million of pro-forma compensation expense related to this stock option grant. The decision to grant stock options that were immediately vested and with an exercise price 20%
greater than the stock price on the date of grant was made primarily to reduce compensation expense that would otherwise be recognized after the adoption of SFAS 123R. We estimate that the future maximum compensation expense that would have been
recorded related to this stock option grant based on adopting SFAS 123R on January1, 2006, was approximately $4 million.  Effective January1, 2006, we adopted the provisions of SFAS 123R using the modified prospective approach. SFAS 123R requires that a company
recognize stock compensation expense for awards of equity instruments to employees ratably over the service period. In addition, SFAS 123R requires that excess tax benefits related to stock compensation expense be reported as a financing cash inflow
rather than as a reduction of taxes paid in cash flow from operations. The impact of the adoption of SFAS 123R is estimated to result in an after tax compensation expense for unvested stock options outstanding at December31, 2005 of
approximately $05 million in 2006. 
51 Table of Contents PEGASYSTEMS INC.  NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTSContinued 
n Fair value of financial instruments  The principal financial instruments held consist of cash equivalents,
investments, accounts receivable and accounts payable, capital lease obligations, and license installment receivables arising from license transactions. The carrying values of cash equivalents, investments, accounts receivable and accounts payable
approximate their fair value due to the relatively short-term nature of the accounts. Using current market rates, the fair value of license installment receivables approximates carrying value at December31, 2005 and 2004.  o Acquired technology and goodwill  Intangible assets are recorded at cost and principally represent technology
acquired in business combinations or from third parties. Amortization is provided on a straight-line basis over the assets estimated useful lives. As of December31, 2005 and 2004, intangible assets consisted of $14 million of technology
acquired in a business combination with a net carrying value of $29 thousand and $04 million and accumulated amortization of $14 million and $10 million, respectively. Amortization expense for this acquired technology was $04 million, $04
million, and $04 million for the years ended December31, 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. We expect to recognize approximately $29 thousand of amortization expense related to those assets in 2006.  Goodwill represents the residual purchase price paid in a business
combination after all identified assets have been recorded. Goodwill is not amortized, but is tested annually for impairment by comparing estimated fair value to its carrying value. During the first quarter of 2003, we made a claim against 155,760
common shares in escrow from the acquisition of 1mind Corporation 1mind. In April 2003, the shares were returned, retired and cancelled. This resulted in a $09 million reduction of goodwill and additional paid in capital.  p Deferred taxes  Deferred taxes are provided for differences in the bases of our assets and
liabilities for book and tax purposes and loss carry forwards based on tax rates expected to be in effect when these items reverse, and credit carry forwards. Valuation allowances are provided to the extent it is more likely than not that some
portion of the deferred tax assets will not be realized, or will be charged to asset or equity accounts when realized.  q Other recent pronouncement  In May 2005, the FASB issued SFAS No154, Accounting Changes and Error Corrections SFAS 154,which replaces
APB Opinion No20 Accounting Changes and SFAS No3, Accounting Changes in Interim Financial Statements An Amendment of APB Opinion No28. SFAS 154 provides guidance on the accounting for
and reporting of accounting changes and error corrections. It establishes retrospective application, or the latest practicable date, as the required method for reporting a change in accounting principle and the reporting of a correction of an error.
SFAS 154 is effective for accounting changes and corrections of errors made in fiscal years beginning after December15, 2005. We have adopted SFAS 154 as of January1, 2006 and do not expect it to have a material impact on our
consolidated results of operations and financial condition.

2. VALUATION AND QUALIFYING ACCOUNTS  We maintain allowances for bad debts based on factors such as the composition of accounts receivable, historical bad debt
experience, and current economic trends. These estimates are adjusted periodically to reflect changes in facts and circumstances. Our allowance for doubtful accounts was $04 million at December31, 2005, 2004 and 2003. The following reflects

customer industry and other known factors. These estimated amounts are deferred or reserved until the related elements of the agreements are completed and provided to the customer or the dispute is resolved. Our allowance for credit memos was $05
million at December 2005, $06 million at December31, 2004 and $08 million at December31, 2003. The following reflects the activity of the allowance for credit memos for each of three years ended December31, 2005:  in thousands

53 Table of Contents PEGASYSTEMS INC.  NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTSContinued 
During the years ended December31, 2005, 2004 and 2003, we recorded disposals of approximately
$07 million, $74 million and $07 million, respectively, of computer equipment, furniture and fixtures, leasehold improvements, and purchased software. Nearly all of the assets written off during 2005, 2004, and 2003 were fully depreciated,
resulting in immaterial losses on disposal.  During 2005, the
Company capitalized certain costs totaling $03 million associated with computer software developed for internal use. The capitalization and amortization of these costs are in accordance with AICPA Statement of Position SOP 98-1,
Accounting for the Costs of Computer Software Developed or Obtained for Internal Use. This software was not completed or placed in service as of December31, 2005 and is included in Capital in Progress. Accordingly, no
amortization was taken during 2005. After the software is placed in service, it will be amortized over 3 years in accordance with the Companys depreciation and amortization policy.  4. STOCKHOLDERS EQUITY  a Preferred stock  We have authorized 1,000,000 shares of preferred stock, which may be issued from time to time in one or more series. Our stockholders have given our Board
of Directors the authority to issue the shares of preferred stock in one or more series, to establish the number of shares to be included in each series and to fix the designation, powers, preferences and rights of the shares of each series and the
qualifications, limitations or restrictions thereof, without any further vote or action by the stockholders. The issuance of preferred stock could decrease the amount of earnings and assets available for distribution to holders of common stock, and
may have the effect of delaying, deferring or defeating a change in control of the Company. We have not issued any shares of preferred stock through December31, 2005.  b Common stock  We have 70,000,000 authorized shares of common stock at $01 par value, of which 35,565,918 shares were issued and outstanding at December31, 2005.
At the end of 2004, our Board of Directors authorized the
repurchase of up to $10 million of our outstanding common stock. The purchases may be made from time to time on the open market or in privately negotiated transactions. Under the Share Repurchase Program, shares may be purchased in such
amounts as market conditions warrant, subject to regulatory and other considerations. During 2005, we repurchased 957,112 shares for $59 million under the Share Repurchase Program, all in open market purchases. The Share Repurchase Program expires
on June30, 2006. 
54 Table of Contents PEGASYSTEMS INC.  NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTSContinued 
The Share Repurchase Program may be suspended or discontinued at any time without prior notice. Our

All shares were purchased pursuant to the Share Repurchase Program.  c 1994 Long-term incentive plan  In 1994, we adopted a 1994 Long-Term Incentive Plan the 1994 Plan to provide employees, directors and consultants with opportunities to
purchase stock through incentive stock options and non-qualified stock options. In addition to options, eligible participants under the 1994 Plan may be granted stock appreciation rights, restricted stock and long-term performance awards. The
Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors Compensation Committee administers the 1994 Plan. Generally, the exercise price of options granted under the plan was equal to the fair market value of the underlying common stock on the
date of grant. Options granted under the 1994 Plan generally vest over four years and expire no later than ten years from the date of grant. As of December31, 2005, options to purchase an aggregate of 65million shares of common stock
were outstanding under the 1994 Plan. We do not intend to issue any additional options or make any other awards under the 1994 Plan in the future.  d 1996 Non-employee director stock option plan 
In 1996, we adopted a 1996 Non-Employee Director Stock Option Plan the Director Plan, which provides for the grant to non-employee
Directors of the Company of options to purchase shares of our common stock. Originally, the Director Plan provided for the grant to non-employee Directors on the date he or she first became a Director an option to purchase 30,000 shares of common
stock at a price equal to the fair market value thereof on the date of grant, such options to vest in equal annual installments over five years. In 1999, the Director Plan was amended to provide for ithe grant to non-employee Directors on
the date he or she first became a Director an option to purchase 30,000 shares of common stock at a price per share equal to the fair market value thereof on the date of grant, such options to vest in equal annual installments over three years and
iithe grant to each non-employee Director at the time of the regular meeting of the Board of Directors following the annual shareholders meeting commencing in 2000, a fully vested option to purchase 10,000 shares of common stock at a price
per share equal to the fair market value thereof on the date of grant. At December31, 2005, under the Director 
55 Table of Contents PEGASYSTEMS INC.  NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTSContinued 
Plan there were outstanding options to purchase an aggregate of 250,000 shares. The Compensation Committee administers the Director Plan. No options were
granted under the Director Plan in 2005 and we do not intend to issue any options under the Director Plan in the future.  e 1996 employee stock purchase plan  In 1996, we adopted a 1996 Employee Stock Purchase Plan the Stock Purchase Plan pursuant to which our employees were entitled to purchase up
to an aggregate of 10million shares of common stock at a price equal to 85% of the fair market value of the common stock on either the commencement date or completion date for offerings under the plan, whichever is less. During 2005, we
amended the Stock Purchase Plan to provide that for each offering period beginning on May1, 2005 or later employees are entitled to purchase shares of common stock at a price equal to 95% of the fair market value on the completion date of the
offering period. As of December31, 2005, there had been thirteen offerings under the plan and approximately 07million shares had been issued there under. The Stock Purchase Plan is tax qualified and as of December31, 2005 no
compensation expense related to shares issued under the plan had been recognized for financial statement purposes.  f 2004 Long-term incentive plan  In 2004, we adopted the 2004 Long-Term Incentive Plan the 2004 Plan to provide employees, non-employee directors and consultants with
opportunities to purchase stock through incentive stock options and non-qualified stock options. In addition to options, eligible participants under the 2004 Plan may be granted stock purchase rights and other stock-based awards. As of
December31, 2005, a total of 7million shares of common stock had been authorized under the 2004 Plan, approximately 32million shares were subject to outstanding options and approximately 37million shares were available for
issuance. Our Board of Directors has made a commitment to provide our non-employee directors with annual option grants. The Compensation Committee administers the 2004 Plan. Generally, the exercise price of options granted under the plan is equal to
the fair market value of the underlying common stock on the date of grant. Options granted under the 2004 Plan generally vest over five years and expire no later than ten years from the date of grant.

with an exercise of warrants issued as part of the consideration for our acquisition of 1mind Corporation in 2002. These warrants were exercised by two former stockholders of 1mind. The consideration for these exercises was paid in the form of the
surrender of 3,774 shares of our common stock under the warrants as a net exercise, which shares were valued at a total of $27 thousand, based on the average closing price of our common stock over the ten consecutive trading days ending on the third
trading day prior to the date of exercise.  In February 2004,
we issued 33,287 shares of our common stock in connection with the exercise of warrants issued as part of the consideration for our acquisition of 1mind Corporation in 2002. These warrants were exercised by four former stockholders of 1mind. The
consideration for these exercises was paid in the form of the surrender of 2,967 shares of our common stock under the warrants as a net exercise, which share were valued at a total of $31 thousand, based on the average closing price of our common
stock over the ten consecutive trading days ending on the third trading all day prior to the date of exercise.  As of December31, 2005, there were outstanding warrants to purchase 42,036 shares of our common stock with a weighted average fair value of $254
per share and a weighted average exercise price of $651 per share.  Shares
reserved  As of December31, 2005, 14,017,233 shares
were reserved for future issuance for stock options and warrants, including 6,520,678 shares for the 1994 Plan, 250,000 shares for the Director Plan, 264,519 shares for the Stock Purchase Plan, 6,940,000 shares for the 2004 Plan, and 42,036 shares
for warrants.

operating leases is recognized on a straight-line basis to account for scheduled rent increases. The excess of expense over current payments is recorded as deferred rent and included in other long-term liabilities. As of December31, 2005,
deferred rent of $11 million was included in other long-term liabilities. Total rent expense under operating leases was approximately $37 million, $42 million, and $39 million, for the years ended December31, 2005, 2004, and 2003,
respectively.  Subsequent to year-end, the Company entered into
a purchase commitment with a partner for contracted resources at a cost of $07 million per year for the next three years for a total commitment of $21 million.  We are a party in various contractual disputes, litigation and potential claims arising in the ordinary course of business.
We do not believe that the resolution of these matters will have a material adverse effect on our financial position or results of operations.  6. INCOME TAXES  The components of income before provision benefit for income taxes are as follows for the years ended December31,:  2005

23 321 190  During 2005, we
engaged outside tax experts to review certain significant tax positions previously taken by the Company. Certain of these projects were completed during the third and fourth quarters of 2005. Specifically, during the third quarter of 2005, we
completed a study of our deferred tax liabilities primarily related to term license installments, which resulted in an increase of our deferred tax liabilities. In addition, in the fourth quarter of 2005, we completed a study of our
extra-territorial income exclusions, which resulted in a decrease of our reserve for tax uncertainties related to this item. As a result of these projects and other considerations, we reduced our valuation allowances by $31 million, as we
determined that a change in the estimates in utilization of credit carry-forwards was necessary. During the fourth quarter of 2005, we recorded a net income tax benefit of $21 million due primarily to changes in estimates upon completion of the
study of benefits related to extra-territorial income exclusions, recording of tax refunds and overpayments, and changes in deferred tax items. These fourth quarter 2005 entries also significantly decreased the effective tax rate for 2005 compared
to the statutory rate. We expect the remaining income tax projects to be completed during the first half of 2006 and any additional adjustments resulting from their completion will be recorded at that time.

Our effective income tax rate for 2005 was below the statutory federal income tax rate primarily due
to a $31 million reduction in our valuation allowances due to a change in estimate relating to utilization of credit carry-forwards. Our effective tax rate was further reduced because we recorded $09 million of benefits primarily related to tax
refunds and overpayments, $07 million of benefits related to current period extra-territorial income exclusions, a $03 million reduction in reserve for tax uncertainties related to extra-territorial income exclusions, $03 million of estimated
federal research and experimentation credit, a $02 million benefit from foreign activities, and $02 million of net benefit from state income taxes primarily due to state income tax credits. These factors were partially offset by a $36 million
increase to our deferred tax liabilities primarily related to term license installments, a $02 increase in reserve for tax uncertainties related to tax credits, and $01 million of permanent differences primarily related to non-deductible meals and
entertainment expenses.  Deferred income taxes at
December31, 2005 and 2004 reflect the net tax effects of net operating loss and tax credit carry forwards and temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial statement purposes and the amounts used
for tax purposes. The components of our net deferred tax assets liabilities are as follows as of December31,:  2005 2004 inthousands Software revenue 22,903 26,055 Depreciation 879 795 Accruals and reserves 2,464 3,399 Unrealized loss on investments 406 175 Net operating losses carried forward 11,255 17,107 Tax credits 8,025 7,045 Net deferred tax assets 126 2,466 Less valuation allowances 1,048 4,281 Net deferred income taxes 922 1,815 Reported as Current deferred tax liability, included in accounts payable and accrued expenses 412 335 Long-term deferred income taxes 510 1,480 Net deferred income taxes 922 1,815  A valuation allowance
has been provided for certain deferred tax assets since it is uncertain we will realize the entire benefit of the assets. The decrease in the valuation allowance during 2005 was due to a change in the estimate of the utilization of credit carry
forwards. Included in the valuation allowance at December31, 2005 was approximately $04 million related to acquired tax loss and credit carry forwards, which if utilized will reduce goodwill. These acquired tax benefits are subject to
limitation by the provisions of Section382 of the Internal Revenue Code. Also included in the valuation allowance at December31, 2005 was approximately $05 million related to tax benefits generated on the exercise of stock options,
which will be recorded directly to equity when realized.  At
December31, 2005, we had alternative minimum tax AMT, and research and experimentation RE net credit carry forwards for federal and state purposes of approximately $80 million, available to offset future
taxable income. The carry forward period for the AMT credit is unlimited. The RE credit carry forwards generally expire between 2006 and 2025.

As of December31, 2005, we had available U.S. net operating loss carry forwards of
approximately $285 million. The operating loss carry forwards expire between 2006 and 2020. These carry forwards may be used to offset future income taxes payable at the federal and state levels, if any, and are subject to review by the U.S.
Internal Revenue Service and various state taxing authorities.  The Company has provided reserves for certain tax matters, both domestic and foreign, which it believes could result in additional tax being due. Any additional assessment or reduction of these contingent liabilities will be reflected in
the Companys effective tax rate in the period that additional facts become known. The reserve for tax uncertainties totaled approximately $2 million as of December31, 2005 and 2004.  The FASB has issued two FASB Staff Positions FSP that provide
accounting guidance on the effects of the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004 the Act that was signed into law on October22, 2004. The Act provides a deduction for income from qualified domestic production activities, which will
be phased in from 2005 through 2010. The Act also creates a temporary incentive for U.S. corporations to repatriate foreign subsidiary earnings by providing an elective 85 percent dividends received deduction for certain dividends from controlled
corporations. The deduction is subject to a number of limitations and requirements, including a specific domestic reinvestment plan for the repatriated funds. 
In December 2004, the FASB issued FASB Staff Position No109-1, Application of FASB Statement No109 SFAS 109, Accounting for Income
Taxes, to the Tax Deduction on Qualified Production Activities Provided by the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004 FSP 109-1, which clarifies that the manufacturers deduction provided for under the Act should be accounted for as a special
deduction in accordance with SFAS 109 and not as a tax rate reduction. In addition, on January19, 2005, the U.S. Treasury published Notice 2005-14 providing guidance on the implementation of the manufacturers deduction. Based on our
current understanding of the Act, we believe that there is no current tax benefit.  The FASB also issued FASB Staff Position No109-2, Accounting and Disclosure Guidance for the Foreign Earnings Repatriation Provision within the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004 FSP 109-2. The Act introduces
a temporary special dividends received deduction on the repatriation of certain foreign earnings to a U.S. taxpayer, provided certain criteria are met. The FSP 109-2 provides accounting and disclosure guidance for the repatriation provision. On
January13, 2005, the U.S. Treasury published Notice 2005-10 providing guidance on the implementation of the repatriation deduction. No foreign dividends were repatriated during 2005, prior to the expiration of the foreign earnings repatriation
provision of the Act on December31, 2005.  As of
December31, 2005, a provision had not been made for the U.S. or additional foreign taxes on $44 million of undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries that could be subject to taxation if remitted to the U.S., because we plan to keep these
amounts permanently reinvested overseas.  7. EMPLOYEE BENEFIT PLAN
We sponsor a 401k defined contribution retirement plan
for qualifying employees pursuant to which the company makes discretionary matching profit sharing contributions. Company contributions under the plan totaled approximately $06 million in 2005, $06 million in 2004, and $06 million in 2003.

UNRESOLVED STAFF COMMENTS  Not applicable.  Item2
CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES  a Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures. Our management, with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer, or
CEO, and Chief Financial Officer, or CFO, evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as defined in Rules 13a-15e and 15d-15e under the Securities Exchange Act as of December31, 2005. In designing and evaluating
our disclosure controls and procedures, our management recognized that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving their objectives, and our management necessarily applied
its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible controls and procedures. Based on this evaluation, our CEO and CFO concluded that, as of December31, 2005, our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective as of
that date, for the reasons described below.  Consistent with our sales strategy of selling smaller initial licenses to target accounts, and then focusing on opportunities for larger follow-on sales after the customer has realized business value from our software, we are increasingly
offering our customers an option as part of the initial license agreement to purchase additional software products or additional license rights in the future at discount. These options may allow the customer to extend the use of previously delivered
software for additional users, for different purposes, or in a different environment, or may allow the customer to purchase additional, not previously delivered software. While these options are frequently similar in structure, they sometimes have
unique features as a result of negotiations with the customer. During the fourth quarter of 2005, the Companys revenue accounting staff was not sufficiently versed in interpreting the accounting literature as it related to one variation of
these options. As a result, two contracts which contained this variation were not properly accounted for in our initial consolidated trial balance. This error was first noted and brought to the attention of management by our independent registered
public accounting firm in connection with their audit of our 2005 financial statements.  Specifically, the two contracts initially allowed the customer to use the software in a non-production environment and, in each case,
provided the customer with an option, for an additional fee, to use the same software in a production environment. The discounts on the options for expanded use in a production environment were more than insignificant and incremental to the discount
on the initial license. Since the options related to software delivered at the time of the initial license, the company initially concluded that delivery was complete and the exercise of the option by customer would constitute purchases of
additional copies of products already licensed by and delivered to the customer under the same arrangement, which would not require accounting for the options as a separate element. However, because the license for use in a production environment is
not effective until the option is exercised by the customer, and is different than the license for use in a non-production environment, the option does not represent additional copies of products licensed by the customer and therefore the option
should be accounted for as a separate element. Upon determination that an undelivered element existed as of December31, 2005, the Company determined it was appropriate under generally accepted accounting principles to defer a total of $10
million of revenue, representing the incremental discount associated with the options, until the options are exercised or expire in 2006.  In addition, management had identified a significant deficiency as of December31, 2004 related to insufficient technical review and
supervision of tax decisions including various estimates. The Company made meaningful progress addressing the deficiency during 2005. We added additional technical resources to assist in the preparation and review of our tax decisions. We also
improved the underlying tax preparation and review procedures. Nonetheless, as of December31, 2005, management determined, based upon certain adjustments to our tax provision that were required in the fourth quarter of 2005, that were
significant but not material, that a significant deficiency still existed in this area. Due to these adjustments, the potential for further misstatements and the fact that the significant deficiency was not remediated after one year, management
deemed the control deficiency to be a material weakness. 
63 Table of Contents
The accounting issues related to these material weaknesses have been resolved and our
financial statements in this Annual Report on Form 10-K and previous filings reflect the appropriate accounting.  We have determined that, under the Public Company Accounting Oversight Boards Auditing Standard No2 and the prior relevant
professional auditing standards, the deficiencies described above reflect material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting. That Standard defines a material weakness as a significant deficiency, or a combination of
significant deficiencies, that results in there being a more than remote likelihood that a material misstatement of the annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected.  To address the material weakness described above relating to
revenue recognition, we intend to assess the expertise of our staff responsible for revenue recognition and address any identified deficiencies. In particular, we plan to improve our ability to identify when customer contracts contain non-standard
features. We also intend to improve our research protocol so that we more fully understand the applicable accounting for such features.  To address the material weakness described above relating to tax decisions, we will augment the review and supervision procedures recently
adopted e.g. retention of third party expertise to conduct quarterly and year-end review of our tax decisions and estimates, with additional training and use of enhanced tax preparation software.  b Managements report on Internal Control over
Financial Reporting and Attestation of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm. The report of our management regarding internal control over financial reporting and the attestation report of our independent registered public accounting
firm are included in Item8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K starting on page 36.  c Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting. No change in internal control over financial reporting as defined in
Rules 13a-15f and 15d-15f under the Securities Exchange Act occurred during the fiscal quarter ended December31, 2005 that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial
reporting.  ITEM9B
