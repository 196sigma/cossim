These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audits.

December 31, 2002, 2001, and 2000
NOTE 1 - SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
The significant accounting policies and practices followed by Brass Eagle Inc. Brass Eagle are as follows Description of Business: Brass Eagle is a leading manufacturer of paintball markers, paintballs, protective eyewear, hoppers and other paintball accessories. Brass Eagle sells its products through major domestic and international retailers and paintball specialty stores. 
Principles of Consolidation: The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Brass Eagle Inc., its wholly-owned subsidiaries and its investments in affiliates that are greater than fifty percent. All significant inter-company accounts and transactions have been eliminated.
Revenue Recognition and Warranty: Brass Eagle recognizes revenue upon shipment of product. Brass Eagle products provide for warranties ranging from 3 months to 12 months. The accrued warranty obligation is provided at the time of product sale based on management estimates, which are developed from historical information and certain assumptions about future events, which are subject to change.
Cash and Cash Equivalents: Cash includes cash, time deposits, and highly liquid investments with original maturities of 3 months or less.
Accounts Receivable: Accounts receivable is comprised of amounts billed to customers net of an allowance for uncollectible amounts. The allowance for doubtful accounts is estimated by management and is based on specific information about customer accounts, past loss experience and general economic conditions. An account is charged off by management when deemed uncollectible, although collection efforts may continue.
Inventories: Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market. Cost is determined using the first-in, first-out FIFO method.
Property and Equipment: Property and equipment are stated at cost. Expenditures for repairs and maintenance are charged to expense as incurred and expenditures for additions and improvements, which significantly extend the lives of assets, are capitalized. Upon sale or other retirement of depreciable property, the cost and accumulated depreciation are removed from the related accounts and any gain or loss is reflected in operations.
Assets are depreciated over the estimated useful life of the assets, ranging from three to thirty-nine years, using the straight-line method. Amortization of leasehold improvements is based on the shorter of the lease term or the useful life, using the straight-line method.
Pre-opening costs: Pre-opening costs are expensed as incurred. Pre-opening costs associated with the opening of Challenge Park Extreme in 2000 are included in selling and marketing and general and administrative expenses for the year ended December 31, 2000. These costs were approximately $349.
Stock Based CompensationEmployee compensation expense under stock options is reported using the intrinsic method. No stock-based compensation cost is reflected in net income, as all options granted had an exercise plan equal to or greater than the market price of the underlying common stock at date of grant. The following table illustrates the effect or net income and earnings per share if expense was measured using the fair value recognition provisions of FASB Statement No. 123, Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation 2002

4 years The weighted average fair value of options granted in the years ended December 31, 2002 through 2000 were $433, $242 and $231, respectively.
The proforma effects of applying SFAS 123 are not indicative of future amounts. Additional awards in future years are anticipated.
Goodwill: Goodwill, including the Brass Eagle name and goodwill associated with the JT USA, L. P. and CM Support acquisitions are stated at amortized cost. These assets were being amortized over the useful life of the assets, primarily 15 to 20 years on a straight-line basis. Accumulated amortization was $4,490 and $4,490 as of December 31, 2002 and 2001, respectively. Adoption of SFAS 142 resulted in the cessation of goodwill amortization in 2002.
Financial Instruments: Brass Eagle adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standards SFAS No. 133, Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities as amended on June 29, 2000, on January 1, 2001. Brass Eagle entered into an interest rate swap to convert a portion of the floating rate debt to a fixed rate. Brass Eagle formally assesses, both at the hedge inception and on an ongoing basis, whether the derivative used in the hedging transaction is highly effective in offsetting changes in the cash flows of the hedged item. Adoption of SFAS No. 133 on January 1, 2001 resulted in recording the fair value of the interest rate swap of $518 $321 net of the tax effect and $889 $540 net of the tax effect as a liability in the balance sheet on December 31, 2002, 2001 and respectively. The offsetting adjustment is reported in the statement of other comprehensive income.
The remaining portion of the long-term debt outstanding is floating rate debt, the carrying value of which approximates fair value.
Advertising Costs: Advertising costs are expensed as incurred. Advertising costs included in selling and marketing expenses were $645, $754 and $539 for the years ended December 31, 2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively.
Shipping Revenues and Costs: Brass Eagle adopted Emerging Issues Task Force EITF No. 00-10 Accounting for Shipping and Handling Fees and Costs. This guidance requires that all amounts billed to a customer in a sales transaction related to shipping and handling, which represents revenue earned for the goods provided, be classified as revenue. This guidance also permits costs incurred related to shipping and handling to be classified as selling expenses if the amounts are disclosed. Brass Eagle has elected not to reclassify the amounts of shipping and handling costs it incurs to cost of sales, but has outlined the impact of such amounts in the below table as allowed under EITF No. 00-10 2002
2001
2000 Shipping and handling costs included in selling expenses
1,517
1,656
943 Income Taxes: The provision for income taxes includes federal and state taxes currently payable and deferred taxes arising from temporary differences between the financial statement and tax basis of assets and liabilities using current tax rates.
Use of Estimates in the Preparation of Financial Statements: The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from these estimates. Significant estimates include the allowance for doubtful accounts, warranty reserve and reserve for slow moving inventory.

The Senior Credit Facility, dated June 30, 2000 and modified on February 1, 2001, December 31, 2001 and September 10, 2002, is comprised of a $125 million revolving credit facility with a seasonal increase to $175 million $43 million outstanding at December 31, 2002, a $20 million term loan and a $280 million term loan used for the acquisition of substantially all the assets of JT USA, L.P. The funds available under the revolving credit facility are limited to eligible accounts receivable and inventory, as defined, up to a maximum of $125 million seasonal increase to $175 million from October 15 to January 15. The credit facility is secured by all tangible and intangible assets of Brass Eagle, exclusive of its investment in Challenge Park Xtreme, LLC.

At December 31, 2002 approximately 16% of the accounts receivable balance served as collateral for the line of credit bo
rrowings outstanding.
The $280 million term loan requires quarterly principal payments of $14 million and matures in June 2005 $140 million outstanding as of December 31, 2002. The $20 million term loan requires quarterly principal payments of $02 million and matures in September, 2003 $06 million outstanding as of December 31, 2002

The agreement also limited 2001 capital expenditures to $45 million, excluding the purchase of the Nittan as
sets, and limited capital expenditures to $45 million in 2002. Brass Eagle was in compliance with these covenants at December 31, 2002.

Amounts contributed by Brass Eagle to the plan amounted to $135, $132 and $93 in 2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively.

Brass Eagle has 840,076 options outstanding at December 31, 2002, 700,507 of which are held by Brass Eagle employees. The remaining 139,569 options were granted to Daisy employees, including approximately 111,655 options held by the estate of Marvin Griffin, former Chairman of the Board of Directors of Brass Eagle. Options totaling 605,600 are outstanding from grants under Brass Eagle 1997 Stock Option Plan. The remaining 234,476 shares were granted under plans established by Daisy prior to the reorganization. The options granted under the Daisy plans were converted to options to purchase Brass Eagle common stock effective with the reorganization. 
The 1997 stock option plan, as amended on December 18, 2000, has reserved 607,700 shares to be granted to key employees and consultants at the discretion of the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors. No options may be issued for less than the fair market value of Brass Eagle common stock at the date of grant. Options granted under the plan are exercisable at such times and upon such terms as the Compensation Committee shall determine. All options granted under the plan to date vest equally over a four-year period. The options under this plan expire ten years after the date of grant.
On November 19, 1999, Brass Eagle re-priced options granted in 1999 and 1998 from $1525 and $1550 a share to $800 a share. No compensation expense was recorded at that time because the modified exercise price equaled or exceeded the fair market value of Brass Eagle common stock on the re-pricing date. In accordance with FASB Interpretation Number 44, the re-pricing of the options changed the re-priced options from fixed to variable. As a result, compensation expense is recognized based on fluctuations in the market price of Brass Eagle stock above $8 per share.

NOTE 16 - BASIC AND DILUTED EARNINGS PER SHARE
Basic earnings per share has been computed by dividing net income by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the period. Diluted earnings per share has been computed by dividing net income by the basic shares outstanding plus the dilutive effect on common stock equivalents. Certain stock options granted in 2002, 1999 and 1998 are anti-dilutive and for purposes of calculating the diluted earnings per share these options have been excluded. These shares may become dilutive in the future.
A reconciliation of the numerators and denominators of the basic earnings per share and diluted earnings per share for the years ended December 31, 2002, 2001, and 2000 are presented below. 2002
