WPS RESOURCES CORPORATION AND 
WISCONSIN PUBLIC SERVICE CORPORATION
E.  NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
NOTE 1--Summary of Significant Accounting Policies
a Nature of Operations--WPS Resources Corporation the
Company is a holding company. Approximately 92% and 97%
of the Company 1995 revenues and assets, respectively, are
derived from Wisconsin Public Service Corporation WPSC,
an electric and gas utility. The Company primary business
is the supply and distribution of electric power and natural
gas in its franchised service territory. The Company also
markets natural gas and energy-related services in
nonregulated markets and has made several energy-related
investments.
The preparation of the Company financial statements in
conformity with generally accepted accounting principles
requires management to make estimates and assumptions that
affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and
the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the
date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of
revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual
results could differ from those estimates.
b Acquisitions--In the fourth quarter of 1995, WPS Energy
Services, Inc. ESI acquired interests in a producing gas
reserves operation and in a gas marketing operation. The
acquisitions have been accounted for under the purchase
method of accounting. The price paid in excess of the fair
value of identifiable assets acquired for the gas marketing
operation is being amortized over a five-year period.
c Consolidation--The consolidated financial statements include
the Company and its wholly-owned subsidiaries, ESI,
WPS Power Development, Inc. PDI, WPSC, and WPSC
wholly-owned subsidiary, WPS Leasing, Inc. All significant
intercompany transactions and accounts have been eliminated.
d Commodity Hedging Agreements--One of the Company
subsidiaries, ESI, enters into various agreements to hedge
against price fluctuations in the cost of gas to be
purchased for delivery under its fixed price gas sales
contracts. The intent of this program is to lock in margins
on gas sales contracts. Gains and losses on these
agreements are recognized as decreases or increases in the
cost of gas when the related designated gas purchase takes
place.
-47      The agreements outstanding at December 31, 1995, hedge
anticipated gas purchases through October 1996. The value
of notional volumes of gas under such agreements using
year-end market prices was $84 million as of
December 31, 1995.
e Utility Plant--Utility plant is stated at the original cost
of construction which includes an allowance for funds used
during construction AFUDC. Approximately 50% of retail
jurisdictional construction work in progress CWIP,
except for major new generating facilities which earn AFUDC
on the full amount, is subject to AFUDC using a rate based
on WPSC s overall cost of capital. For 1995, the retail
AFUDC rate was approximately 103%.
AFUDC is recorded on wholesale jurisdictional electric CWIP
at debt and equity percentages specified in the Federal
Energy Regulatory Commission FERC Uniform System of
Accounts. For 1995, this rate was approximately 59%.
Substantially all of WPSC utility plant is subject to a
first mortgage lien.
f Property Additions, Maintenance, and Retirements of Utility
Plant--The cost of renewals and betterments of units of
property as distinguished from minor items of property is
capitalized as an addition to the utility plant accounts. 
The cost of units of property retired, sold, or otherwise
disposed of, plus removal costs, less salvage, are charged
to the accumulated provision for depreciation. No profit or
loss is recognized in connection with ordinary retirements
of utility property units. Maintenance and repair costs and
replacement and renewal costs associated with items not
qualifying as units of property are generally charged to
operating expense. 
Nonutility property follows a similar policy with the
exception of gains and losses which are recognized in
connection with ordinary retirements.
In October 1993, WPSC sold, at cost, a 32% interest in a
combustion turbine to a municipality for $78 million.
g Depreciation--Straight-line composite depreciation expense
is recorded over the estimated useful life of utility
property and includes estimated salvage and cost of removal. 
These rates have been approved by the Public Service
Commission of Wisconsin PSCW. Effective January 1,
1994, depreciation rates were revised based on new estimates
which decreased annual depreciation expense from the 1993
level by approximately $58 million. This decrease was
considered in setting customer rates effective January 1,
1994. These rates remained in effect for 1995.

1995        1994       1993
Annual composite 
depreciation rates
Electric               343%       341%       389%
Gas                 346%       337%       381%
Nonutility property is depreciated using straight-line
depreciation, with depreciation lives ranging from five to
ten years.
h Nuclear Decommissioning--Nuclear decommissioning costs are
accrued over the estimated service life of the Kewaunee
Nuclear Power Plant Kewaunee, currently recovered from
customers in rates, and deposited in external trusts. Such
costs totaled $90 million, $40 million, and $24 million
for 1995, 1994, and 1993, respectively. In July 1994, the
PSCW issued a generic order covering utilities with nuclear
generation. This order standardizes the escalation
assumptions used in determining nuclear decommissioning
liabilities. The undiscounted amount of WPSC
decommissioning costs estimated to be expended between the
years 2014 to 2050 are $785 million. Long-term after-tax
earnings of 55% are assumed. As of December 31, 1995, the
accumulated provision for depreciation and decommissioning
included accumulated provisions for decommissioning totaling
$821 million. 
WPSC share of Kewaunee decommissioning costs is estimated
to be $155 million in current dollars based on a site-
specific study performed in 1992 using immediate
dismantlement as the method of decommissioning. This
estimate is in accordance with a generic decommissioning
order from the PSCW. As of December 31, 1995, the external
trusts totaled $821 million. Unrealized gains in the
qualified trust are reflected, net of tax, in the trust with
the offset to the decommissioning reserve, since
decommissioning expense will be recognized as the gains are
realized. For the nonqualified trust, unrealized gains are
reflected in the trust, net of tax, with the offset an
increase to stockholders' equity. 
Depreciation expense includes decommissioning costs
recovered in customer rates and a charge to offset earnings
from the external trusts. Trust earnings totaled
$48 million, $24 million, and $35 million for the years
ended December 31, 1995, 1994, and 1993, respectively.
i Nuclear Fuel--The cost of nuclear fuel is amortized to
electric production fuel expense based on the quantity of
heat produced for the generation of electric energy by
Kewaunee. The costs amortized to electric fuel expense
which assume no salvage values for uranium or plutonium
include an amount for ultimate disposal and are recovered
through current rates. As required by the Nuclear Waste
Policy Act of 1982, a contract has been signed with the
-49      Department of Energy DOE for the ultimate storage of the
fuel, and quarterly payments based on generation are being
made to the DOE for fuel storage. Interim storage space for
spent nuclear fuel is provided at Kewaunee, and expenses
associated with this storage are recognized as current
operating costs. Currently, there is on-site storage
capacity for spent fuel through the year 2013. As of
December 31, 1995 and 1994, the accumulated provisions for
nuclear fuel totaled $1428 million and $1365 million,
respectively.
j Cash and Equivalents--The Company considers short-term
investments with an original maturity of three months or
less to be cash equivalents.
k Revenue and Customer Receivables--WPSC accrues revenues
related to electric and gas service, including estimated
amounts for service rendered but not billed.
As of December 31, 1995, energy conservation loans to
customers amounting to $32 million are included in customer
receivables and in investments and other assets. 
Automatic fuel adjustment clauses are used for FERC
wholesale-electric and Michigan Public Service Commission
MPSC retail-electric portions of WPSC business. The
PSCW retail-electric portion of the business uses a cost
variance range approach. This range is based on a specific
estimated fuel cost for the forecast year. If WPSC actual
fuel costs fall outside this range, a hearing may be held
and an adjustment to future rates may result. WPSC has a
purchased-gas-adjustment clause which allows it to pass on
to all classes of gas customers changes in the cost of gas
purchased from its suppliers, subject to PSCW and MPSC
review. 
WPSC is required to provide service and grant credit to
customers within its defined service territory and is
precluded from discontinuing service to residential
customers during certain periods of the year. WPSC
continually reviews its customers' credit-worthiness and
obtains deposits or refunds deposits accordingly. WPSC is
permitted to recover bad debts in utility rates. 
Approximately 11% of WPSC total revenues are from
companies in the paper products industry.         
l Regulatory Assets and Liabilities--WPSC is subject to the
provisions of Statement of Financial Accounting Standard
SFAS No. 71, Accounting for the Effects of Certain Types
of Regulation. Regulatory assets represent probable future
revenue, such as demand-side management DSM, associated
with certain incurred costs which will be recovered from
customers through the ratemaking process. Regulatory
liabilities represent costs previously collected that are
refundable in future customer rates. The following
-50      regulatory assets and liabilities were reflected in the
Consolidated Balance Sheets as of December 31      
Thousands                      1995        1994

Total                        $ 49,924      $ 65,995
As of December 31, 1995, most of WPSC regulatory assets
are being recovered through rates charged to customers over
periods ranging from two to ten years. WPSC does not begin
recovering environmental remediation costs before cash
payments are made. Pursuant to a PSCW rate order, effective
January 1, 1995, WPSC began recovering approximately
$236 million of regulatory assets per year.
Based on prior and current rate treatment of such costs,
management believes it is probable that WPSC will continue
to recover from ratepayers the regulatory assets described
above.
See notes 1n and 1o for specific discussion of
pension and deferred tax regulatory liabilities, and
note 7 for discussion of environmental-remediation
deferred costs.
m Investments and Other Assets--Investments in affiliates and 
other investments are immaterial and their income is
included in other income and deductions using the equity
method of accounting. Other assets include prepaid pension
assets, operating deposits for jointly-owned plants, the
cash surrender value of life insurance policies, and the
long-term portion of energy conservation loans to customers.
n Employee Benefit Plans--WPSC has non-contributory retirement
plans covering substantially all employees under which
annual contributions are made to an irrevocable trust
established to provide retired employees with a monthly
payment if conditions relating to age and length of service
have been met. The plans are fully funded, and no
contributions were made in 1995, 1994, or 1993. Prior to
January 1, 1993, the PSCW required the recognition of the
funded amounts for ratemaking purposes. Concurrent with a
rate order, effective January 1, 1993, WPSC began recovering
-51      pension costs in customer rates under SFAS No. 87,
Employers' Accounting for Pensions, and began returning to
ratepayers, over five years, the cumulative excess of
amounts recovered from customers over SFAS No. 87 costs.
The following table sets forth the plans' funded status and
expense income.

WPSC also offers medical, dental, and life insurance
benefits to employees, retirees, and their dependents. The
expenses for active employees are expensed as incurred. 
Prior to 1993, WPSC expensed amounts related to post-
retirement health and welfare plans to the extent that such
amounts were funded to external trusts.
Effective January 1, 1993, and concurrent with a rate order,
WPSC adopted SFAS No. 106, Employers' Accounting for Post-
Retirement Benefits Other Than Pensions, which requires the
cost of post-retirement benefits for employees to be accrued
as expense over the period in which the employee renders
service and becomes eligible to receive benefits. In
adopting SFAS No. 106, WPSC elected to recognize the
-52      transition obligation for current and future retirees over
20 years.
Since 1981, WPSC has been funding amounts to irrevocable
trusts as allowed for income tax purposes. These funded
amounts have been expensed and recovered through customer
rates. The non-administrative plan is a collectively
bargained plan and, therefore, is tax exempt. The
investments in the trust covering administrative employees
are subject to federal unrelated business income taxes at a
396% tax rate, while the non-administrative trust is tax
exempt.
The tables below set forth the plans' accrued post-
retirement benefit obligation APBO and the expense
provisions.

Prior service cost not yet recognized     2,027      -      - 
Accrued post-retirement 
benefit obligation            $ 19,748  $ 12,859 $ 5,915
Service cost                $  4,392  $  4,853  $  4,379 
Interest cost                  9,833    8,830    8,248 
Actual return on plan assets         20,918    946   3,993
Net amortization and deferral         17,809    1,774   1,394 
Post-retirement benefit cost        $ 11,116  $ 10,963  $ 10,028 
The assumed before tax expected long-term return on
investments and the discount rate used to measure the APBO
under SFAS No. 106 are consistent with rates used to
calculate the pension plans' funded status and expense under
SFAS No. 87. Only the administrative plan is subject to
federal income taxes which are reflected in the expense and
funding status. The assumed health care cost trend rates
for 1996 are 100% for medical and 85% for dental,
decreasing to 60% and 50%, respectively, by the year 2006. 
Increasing each of the medical and dental cost trend rates
by 10% in each year would increase the total APBO as of
December 31, 1995 by $211 million and the total net
periodic post-retirement benefit cost for the year then
ended by $40 million.
As of December 31, 1995, WPSC had approximately 1,100
retirees eligible to receive health care benefits.
-53      Concurrent with a rate order which was effective January 1,
1994, WPSC adopted SFAS No. 112, Employers' Accounting for
Post-Employment Benefits, which establishes accounting and
reporting standards for post-employment benefits other than
those covered by SFAS Nos. 87 and 106. In connection
therewith, WPSC expensed in 1994 the transition obligation
of $18 million and recovered this cost through its customer
rates.
WPSC has a leveraged Employee Stock Ownership Plan and Trust
ESOP that held 2,191,873 shares of Company common stock
market value of approximately $745 million at
December 31, 1995. At that date, the ESOP also had loans
guaranteed by WPSC and secured by common stock.
Principal and interest on the loans are to be paid through
WPSC contributions and through dividends on Company common
stock held by the ESOP. Shares in the ESOP are allocated to
participants as the loans are repaid. Tax benefits from
dividends paid to the ESOP are recognized as a reduction in
WPSC cost of providing service to customers. The PSCW has
allowed WPSC to include in cost of service an additional
employer contribution to the plan. The net effect of the
tax benefits and of the employee contribution is an
approximately equal sharing of benefits of the program
between customers and employees.
o Income Taxes--Effective January 1, 1993, WPSC adopted the
liability method of accounting for income taxes as
prescribed by SFAS No. 109, Accounting for Income Taxes. 
Under the liability method, deferred income tax liabilities
are established based upon enacted tax laws and rates
applicable to the periods in which the taxes become payable. 
The adoption of this accounting standard had an
insignificant impact on the Company net income. The
excess deferred income taxes, resulting from taxes provided
at rates greater than current rates, and the previously
unrecorded deferred income taxes, have been recorded as a
net regulatory liability to be refunded to customers in
future years. Such net regulatory liability totaled
$309 million as of December 31, 1995.
The effective income tax rates are computed by dividing
total income tax expense, including investment tax credit
restored, by the sum of such expense and net income. 
Previously deferred investment tax credits are being
restored over the life of the related utility plant. The
components of income tax expense are set forth in the tables
on the following page.

NOTE 2--Short-Term Debt and Lines of Credit 
To provide short-term borrowing flexibility and security for
commercial paper outstanding, the Company and its subsidiaries
maintain bank lines of credit. Most of these lines of credit
require a fee.

WPSC share of direct expenses for these plants is included in
the corresponding operating expenses in the consolidated
statements of income, and WPSC has supplied its own financing for
all jointly-owned projects.  NOTE 4--Long-Term Debt
Sinking fund requirements on first mortgage bonds may be
satisfied by the deposit of cash or reacquired bonds with the
trustee and, for certain series, by the application of net
expenditures for bondable property in an amount equal to 166-2/3%
of the annual requirements.
All series requiring the deposit of cash or reacquired bonds for
sinking fund purposes have been satisfied to maturity. For those
series requiring unpledged property to satisfy sinking fund
requirements, the Company has adequate unpledged property to
satisfy the requirement for at least ten years. 
In 1998, $50 million of 5-1/4% bonds will mature.
-56   Historically, gains or losses resulting from the settlement of 
long-term debt obligations have been deferred as required by
regulators.
NOTE 5--Common Equity 
Effective in September 1994, the Company assumed responsibility
for the Dividend Reinvestment and Stock Purchase Plan DRP. 
On September 18, 1995, the DRP was substantially revised and
renamed the Stock Investment Plan SIP. Prior to September
1994, WPSC issued new shares to meet DRP requirements. During
1993, 50,818 new shares of common stock were issued under the
DRP. In April 1993, WPSC stopped issuing common stock under the
DRP and began purchasing common stock on the open market for
these requirements. The SIP purchases common stock on the open
market for shareholder and employee purchases.
At December 31, 1995, the Company had $3080 million of retained
earnings available for dividends; however, WPSC is restricted by
a PSCW order to paying normal common stock dividends of no more
than 109% of the previous year common stock dividend without
PSCW approval. Also, Wisconsin law prohibits WPSC from making
loans to the Company and its subsidiaries and from guaranteeing
their obligations. On January 15, 1996 a special common stock
dividend of $11 million was declared by WPSC to be paid to the
Company. The special dividend allows WPSC equity
capitalization ratio to remain at approximately 54%, as approved
by the PSCW for ratemaking. The dividend was paid to the Company
in January 1996.
NOTE 6--Fair Value of Financial Instruments
The following methods and assumptions were used to estimate the
fair value of each class of financial instruments for which it is
practicable to estimate that value   Cash, Short-Term Investments, Energy Conservation Loans, Notes
Payable, and Outstanding Commercial Paper: The carrying amount
approximates fair value due to the short maturity of those
investments and obligations.
Nuclear Decommissioning Trusts: The value of WPSC nuclear
decommissioning trust investments are recorded at market value.
Long-Term Debt, Preferred Stock, and ESOP Loan Guarantees: The
fair value of WPSC long-term debt, preferred stock, and ESOP
loan guarantees are estimated based on the quoted market price
for the same or similar issues or on the current rates offered to
WPSC for debt of the same remaining maturity.

NOTE 7--Commitments and Contingencies 
Coal Contracts
To ensure a reliable, low-cost supply of coal, WPSC entered into
certain long-term contracts that have take-or-pay obligations
totaling $2389 million from 1996 through 2016. The obligations
are subject to force majeure provisions which provide WPSC other
options if the specified coal does not meet emission limits which
may be mandated in future legislation. In the opinion of
management, any amounts paid under the take-or-pay obligations
described above would be legitimate costs of service subject to
recovery in customer rates.
Purchased Power
WPSC has several take-or-pay contracts related to purchased
power, for either capacity or energy. These contracts total
$292 million through April 1997. Management expects to recover
these costs in future customer rates.
Gas Costs
WPSC also has natural gas supply and transportation contracts
that require total demand payments of $3583 million through
October 2003. Management believes that these costs will be
recoverable in future customer rates.
ANR Pipeline Company ANR, WPSC primary pipeline supplier,
filed with the FERC for approval to recover a portion of certain
take-or-pay costs it incurred from renegotiating its long-term
gas contracts. As a result of the filing, ANR was allowed to
recover a portion of these costs from its customers. WPSC began
paying its share of these take-or-pay costs to ANR in 1989,
thereby enabling it to recover these costs directly from
customers through its purchased-gas-adjustment clause. In March
1991, the FERC approved a settlement under which WPSC will pay
ANR monthly take-or-pay amounts. Additional take-or-pay claims
by ANR may be filed with FERC. To date, the PSCW has granted WPSC
-58   recovery of all ANR take-or-pay costs. All current direct bill
take-or-pay liabilities have been satisfied.
In April 1992, the FERC issued Order No. 636 Order which
requires natural gas pipelines to restructure their sales and
transportation services. As a result of this Order, WPSC was 
obligated to pay for a portion of ANR transition costs incurred
to comply with the Order. At December 31, 1995, WPSC has paid in
full the liability for these transition costs. Though there may
be additional costs, which could be significant, the amount and
timing of these costs are unknown at this time. Management
expects to recover these costs in future customer rates.
WPSC will be billed $20 million in 1996 for its allocable share
of ANR above-market costs of gas purchases from the Dakota
Gasification Plant. WPSC is protesting the legality of these
costs which could total $272 million through 2009. WPSC
recovers these costs in its purchased gas adjustment clause.
Nuclear Liability
The Price-Anderson Act provides for the payment of funds for
public liability claims arising out of a nuclear incident. In
the event of a nuclear incident involving any of the nation
licensed reactors, WPSC is subject to a proportional assessment
which is approximately $327 million per incident, not to exceed
$41 million per incident, per calendar year. These amounts
represent WPSC 412% ownership share in Kewaunee.
Nuclear Plant Operation
Due primarily to tube degradation in the steam generators of the
jointly-owned Kewaunee Nuclear Power Plant and the current
economics of the power generation market, it may not be cost
effective to continue operating Kewaunee until the expiration of
the operating license in 2013. The owners of Kewaunee continue
to evaluate whether to invest the approximate $100 million to
replace the steam generators. Should the owners decide to retire
Kewaunee early, management believes that all Kewaunee costs will
be recoverable in customer rates.
Clean Air Regulations
In 1990, the Federal Clean Air Act Amendments Act were signed
into law. The Act requires WPSC to meet new emission limits for
sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxide in 1995 Phase I and in the
year 2000 Phase II. Since Wisconsin had already mandated
reduced sulfur dioxide emissions by 1993, which were lower than
the federal levels mandated for 1995, WPSC was already working on
lowering emissions. WPSC has complied cost effectively with both
the Federal and Wisconsin sulfur dioxide laws primarily through
fuel-switching. WPSC has been in compliance with the Wisconsin
sulfur dioxide limits and the Federal Phase II limits since 1994.
The final Federal regulations for nitrogen oxide are not known at
this time; however, based on draft rules, WPSC expects to make
-59   additional capital expenditures in the range of $30 million to
$50 million between 1996 and 1999 for Wisconsin and Federal air
quality compliance. Management believes that all costs incurred
to comply with these laws will be recoverable in future customer
rates.
Manufactured Gas Plant Remediation
WPSC is currently investigating the need for environmental
cleanup of eight manufactured gas plant sites which it previously
operated. WPSC engaged an environmental consultant to develop
cleanup cost estimates for the seven sites at which either a
Phase I or Phase II site investigation had been completed. The
estimated cleanup cost ranges in current dollars for each of the
seven sites are:  Green Bay from $41 to $53 million,
Two Rivers from $39 to $40 million, Oshkosh from $33 to $45
million, Marinette from $56 to $68 million, Sheboygan I from
$27 to $39 million, Sheboygan II from $122 to $134 million,
and Stevens Point from $14 to $19 million. The estimates
assume excavation of contaminated soils, thermal treatment of
soils, disposal of treatment residuals, on-site groundwater
extraction, and treatment and post-cleanup monitoring for 25
years. The cost estimate for six of the sites Green Bay,
Two Rivers, Oshkosh, Marinette, Sheboygan I, and Sheboygan II
assume, in addition to those items noted previously, removal and
disposal of contaminated river sediments. The consultant has yet
to perform a detailed investigation of the Menominee site, and
comparable information on this site is not available. WPSC used
the estimate for the Stevens Point site as a basis for making a
projection of $15 million to $19 million on cleanup costs at
the Menominee site. Both sites are relatively small and are not
located adjacent to rivers.
The range of future investigation and cleanup costs for all eight
sites is estimated to be from $347 million to $417 million. 
Remediation expenditures would be made over the next 33 years. 
WPSC has recorded a liability with an offsetting regulatory asset
of $417 million, which represents WPSC current estimate of
cleanup costs for all eight sites. The liability represents a
$148 million increase from the December 31, 1994 estimate of
$269 million, as a result of new information obtained in the
1995 studies. Based on discussions with regulators and a recent
rate order in Wisconsin, management believes that these costs,
but not the carrying costs associated with amounts expended, will
be recoverable in future customer rates after amounts are
expended.
As additional investigations and initial remedial actions are
completed, these estimates may be adjusted, and these adjustments
could be significant. Other factors that can affect these
estimates are changes in remedial technology and regulatory
requirements. The estimates presented above do not take into
consideration any recovery from insurance carriers or other third
parties which WPSC is pursuing. Due to the anticipated
regulatory treatment, adjustments to the estimated liability do
not have an immediate impact on net income.
-60   Long-Term Power Supply 
In November 1995, WPSC signed a 25-year agreement to purchase
power from Polsky Energy Corporation Polsky, an independent
power producer proposing to build a cogeneration facility and
sell the electrical power to WPSC. Polsky is in the second stage
of a two-stage Certificate of Public Convenience and Necessity
CPCN permitting process prescribed by the PSCW. Construction
of the Polsky project is contingent upon PSCW determination in
stage two of the CPCN process that WPSC will need the electric
capacity which would be provided by the proposed plant. A recent
WPSC load forecast suggests the capacity may not be needed. A
final decision is expected in 1997. If the PSCW approves the
Polsky project, it will be accounted for as a capitalized lease. 
This would result in the Company recording a plant asset of
approximately $110 million, with an offsetting amount of
long-term debt.
Future Expenditures
Management estimates 1996 utility plant construction expenditures
to be approximately $788 million. DSM expenditures are
estimated to be $258 million, of which approximately
$150 million will be deferred and amortized over the next ten
years consistent with rate recovery.

ITEM 8.  FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA
WISCONSIN PUBLIC SERVICE CORPORATION
M. REPORT OF INDEPENDENT PUBLIC ACCOUNTANTS To Wisconsin Public Service Corporation We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets and
consolidated statements of capitalization of Wisconsin Public Service 
Corporation a Wisconsin corporation and subsidiary as of December
31, 1995 and 1994, and the related consolidated statements of income
and retained earnings and cash flows for each of the three years in
the period ended December 31, 1995. These financial statements are
the responsibility of the Company management. Our responsibility is
to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our
audits.
We conducted our audits in accordance with generally accepted auditing
standards. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit
to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements
are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a
test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the
financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting
principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well
as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We
believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to
above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position
of Wisconsin Public Service Corporation and subsidiary as of December
31, 1995 and 1994, and the results of their operations and their cash
flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31,
1995 in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles.
As discussed in notes 1n and 1o to the consolidated financial
statements, effective January 1, 1993, Wisconsin Public Service
Corporation changed its method of accounting for post-retirement
benefits other than pensions and income taxes. Milwaukee, Wisconsin,
