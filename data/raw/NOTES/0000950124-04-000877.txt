Evaluation of disclosure controls and
procedure The Company maintains a set of disclosure
controls and procedures and internal controls designed to ensure
that information required to be disclosed in its filings under
the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 is recorded, processed,
summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the
Securities and Exchange Commissions rules and forms. Based
on their evaluation as of the end of the period covered by this
Annual Report on Form10-K, the Companys Chief
Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded
that the Companys disclosure controls and procedures as
defined in Rules13a-15e and 15d-15e under the
Securities Exchange Act of 1934 the Exchange Act are effective
to ensure that information required to be disclosed by the
Company in reports that it files or submits under the Exchange
Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the
time periods specified in Securities and Exchange Commission
rules and forms. 18 Table of Contents
