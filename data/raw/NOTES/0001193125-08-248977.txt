CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm The Board of Directors and Stockholders Sonic Foundry, Inc. We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance
sheets of Sonic Foundry, Inc. and subsidiary a Maryland Corporation the Company as of September 30, 2008 and 2007, and the related consolidated statements of operations, stockholders equity, and cash flows for each of the three years in
the period ended September 30, 2008. Our audits of the basic financial statements included the financial statement schedule listed in the index appearing under . These financial statements and financial statement schedule are the
responsibility of the Companys management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audits. We
conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board United States. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements
are free of material misstatement. The Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. Our audits included consideration of internal control over financial reporting as a
basis for designing audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Companys internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such
opinion. An audit also includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the
overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. In our opinion, the consolidated
financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Sonic Foundry, Inc. as of September 30, 2008 and 2007, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in
the period ended September 30, 2008 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Also in our opinion, the related financial statement schedule, when considered in relation to the basic financial
statements taken as a whole, presents fairly, in all material respects, the information set forth therein. /s/ GRANT THORNTON LLP

Basis of Presentation and Significant Accounting Policies Business Sonic Foundry, Inc. the Company is in the business of providing enterprise solutions and services for the web
communications market. Principles of Consolidation The accompanying consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its subsidiary. All significant intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated. In 2008, 2007 and 2006, net loss equaled comprehensive
loss as there were no items of comprehensive income. Use of Estimates In preparing financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America US GAAP, management is required to make estimates and assumptions that affect the
reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expense during the period. Actual results could differ from
those estimates. Revenue Recognition General
Revenue is recognized when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, delivery occurs or services are rendered, the sales price is fixed or determinable
and collectibility is reasonably assured. Revenue is deferred when undelivered products or services are essential to the functionality of delivered products, customer acceptance is uncertain, significant obligations remain, or the fair value of
undelivered elements is unknown. The Company does not offer customers the right to return product, other than for exchange or repair pursuant to a warranty or stock rotation. The Companys policy is to reduce revenue if it incurs an obligation
for price rebates or other such programs during the period the obligation is reasonably estimated to occur. The following policies apply to the Companys major categories of revenue transactions. Products Products are considered delivered, and revenue is recognized, when
title and risk of loss have been transferred to the customer. Under the terms and conditions of the sale, this occurs at the time of shipment to the customer. Product revenue currently represents sales of our Mediasite recorder and Mediasite related
products such as server software revenue. Services We sell
support contracts to our customers, typically one year in length and record the related revenue ratably over the contractual period. Our support contracts cover phone and electronic technical support availability over and above the level provided by
our distributors, software upgrades on a when and if available basis, advance hardware replacement and an extension of the standard hardware warranty from 90 days to one year. The manufacturer we contract with to build the units performs hardware
warranty service. We also sell installation, training, event webcasting, and customer content hosting services. Revenue for those services is recognized when performed in the case of installation, training and event webcasting services and is
recognized ratably over the contract period for content hosting services. Service amounts invoiced to customers in excess of revenue recognized are recorded as deferred revenue until the revenue recognition criteria are met. 
46 Table of Contents Sonic Foundry, Inc. Annual Report on Form 10-K For the Year Ended September 30, 2008
Revenue Arrangements that Include Multiple Elements Revenue for transactions that include multiple elements such as hardware, software, installation, training, and post customer support is allocated to each element based on vendor-specific objective evidence of the
fair value VSOE in accordance with Statement of Position SOP 97-2, Software Revenue Recognition, and SOP 98-9, Modification of SOP 97-2. Revenue is recognized for each element when the revenue recognition criteria have
been met for that element. VSOE is based on the price charged when the element is sold separately. If VSOE of fair value does not exist for all elements in a multiple element arrangement, revenue is allocated first to the fair value of the
undelivered elements and the residual revenue to the delivered elements. The Company recognizes revenue for delivered elements only when all of the following criteria are satisfied: undelivered elements are not essential to the functionality of
delivered elements, uncertainties regarding customer acceptance are resolved, and the fair value for all undelivered elements is known. For revenue
arrangements with multiple elements outside the scope of SOP 97-2, the Company accounts for the arrangements in accordance with Emerging Issues Task Force EITF Issue 00-21, Revenue Arrangements with Multiple Elements, and allocates the
arrangements fees into separate units of accounting based on fair value. The Company supports fair value of the elements based upon the prices the Company charges when it sells similar elements separately. Reserves We record reserves for stock rotations, price adjustments,
rebates, and sales incentives to reduce revenue and accounts receivable for these and other credits we may grant to customers. Such reserves are recorded at the time of sale and are calculated based on historical information such as rates of
product stock rotations and the specific terms of sales programs, taking into account any other known information about likely customer behavior. If actual customer behavior differs from our expectations, additional reserves may be required. Also,
if we determine that we can no longer accurately estimate amounts for stock rotations and sales incentives, we would not be able to recognize revenue until resellers sell the inventory to the final end user. Shipping and Handling The Companys shipping and handling costs billed
to customers are included in other revenue. Costs related to shipping and handling are included in cost of revenue and are recorded at the time of shipment to the customer. Concentration of Credit Risk and Other Risks and Uncertainties The Companys cash and cash equivalents are
deposited with two major financial institutions. At times, deposits in these institutions exceed the amount of insurance provided on such deposits. The Company has not experienced any losses on such amounts and believes that it is not exposed to any
significant credit risk on these balances. We perform ongoing credit evaluations of our customers financial condition and generally do not require
collateral. We maintain allowances for potential credit losses and such losses have been within our expectations. We had billings for Mediasite product and support services as a percentage of total billings to one distributor of approximately 44% in
2008 and 46% in 2007. There were no customers with billings over 10% in 2006. Cash and Cash Equivalents The Company considers all highly liquid investments purchased with an original maturity of three months or less to be cash equivalents. Cash equivalents include amounts
invested in certificates of deposit of $65 and $10 million at September30, 2007 and 2006. There were no amounts invested in certificates of deposit at September30, 2008. 
47 Table of Contents Sonic Foundry, Inc. Annual Report on Form 10-K For the Year Ended September 30, 2008
Trade Accounts Receivable The majority of the Companys accounts receivable are due from entities in, or distributors or value added resellers to, the education, corporate and government sectors. Credit is extended based on evaluation of
a customers financial condition and, generally, collateral is not required. Accounts receivable are due within 30 days and are stated at amounts due from customers net of an allowance for doubtful accounts. Accounts outstanding longer than the
contractual payment terms are considered to be past due. The Company determines its allowance by considering a number of factors, including the length of time trade accounts receivable are past due, the Companys previous loss history, the
customers current ability to pay its obligation to the Company, and the condition of the general economy and the industry as a whole. The Company writes-off accounts receivable when they become uncollectible, and payments subsequently received
on such receivables are credited to the allowance for doubtful accounts. Interest is not accrued on past due receivables. Inventory Valuation
Inventory consists of raw materials and supplies used in the assembly of Mediasite recorders and finished units. Inventory of completed units and
spare parts are carried at the lower of cost or market, with cost determined on a first-in, first-out basis. Inventory consists of the following in
thousands:  September30 2008
2007
Raw materials and supplies 10 10
Finished goods 320 194 330 204 Software Development Costs Internal software development costs are capitalized after technological feasibility is established. The capitalized cost is then amortized on a straight-line basis over the estimated product life, or on the ratio of
current revenue to total projected product revenue, whichever is greater. To date, the period between achieving technological feasibility, which the Company has defined as the establishment of a working model which typically occurs when the beta
testing commences, and the general availability of such software has been short and software development costs qualifying for capitalization have been insignificant. Accordingly, the Company has not capitalized any internal software development
costs. 
48 Table of Contents Sonic Foundry, Inc. Annual Report on Form 10-K For the Year Ended September 30, 2008
Property and Equipment Property and equipment are recorded at cost and are depreciated using the straight-line method for financial reporting purposes. The estimated useful lives used to calculate depreciation are as follows:  Years
Leasehold improvements
5to10years
Computer equipment
3to5years
Furniture and fixtures
7years
Impairment of Long-Lived Assets In accordance with the provisions of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards SFAS No144, Accounting for the Impairment of Long-lived Assets, the Company reviews long-lived assets, including
property and equipment, capitalized software development costs and other intangibles for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. Goodwill is reviewed for impairment annually.
Recoverability of an asset is measured by comparing its carrying value to the expected undiscounted cash flows. An impairment is measured by the amount by which the carrying value of the related asset or group of assets exceeds the expected
undiscounted cash flows. As of September30, 2008 the Company has recognized no such losses. Advertising Expense Advertising costs included in selling and marketing, are expensed when the advertising first takes place. Advertising expense was $306, $246 and $114 thousand for years
2008, 2007, and 2006, respectively. Research and Development Costs Research and development costs are expensed in the period incurred. Income Taxes Deferred income taxes are provided for temporary differences between financial reporting and income tax basis of assets and liabilities, and are measured using currently
enacted tax rates and laws. Deferred income taxes also arise from the future benefits of net operating loss carryforwards. A valuation allowance equal to 100% of the net deferred tax assets has been recognized due to uncertainty regarding the future
realization of these assets. Fair Value of Financial Instruments The Company financial instruments consist primarily of cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, accounts payable and debt instruments. The book values of cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, debt
and accounts payable are considered to be representative of their respective fair values. The carrying value of capital lease obligations, including the current portion, approximates fair market value as the fixed rate approximates the current
market rate of interest available to the Company. Stock-Based Compensation Effective October1, 2005, the Company adopted the provisions of SFAS No123R, Share-Based Payment an Amendment of FASB Statement Nos. 123 and 95 SFAS 123R for its stock option plans. The Company
previously accounted for these plans under the recognition and measurement principles of Accounting Principles Board Opinion No25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees APB 25 and related interpretations and disclosure requirements
established by SFAS No123, Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation SFAS 123, as amended by SFAS No148, Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation Transition and Disclosure. 
49 Table of Contents Sonic Foundry, Inc. Annual Report on Form 10-K For the Year Ended September 30, 2008
The Company adopted SFAS 123R using the modified prospective method. Under this transition method, compensation cost
recognized for the years ended September30, 2008, 2007 and 2006 include the cost for all stock options granted prior to, but not yet vested as of October1, 2005. This cost was based on the grant-date fair value estimated in accordance
with the original provisions of SFAS 123. The cost for all share-based awards granted subsequent to September30, 2005, represents the grant-date fair value that was estimated in accordance with the provisions of SFAS 123R. Results for prior
periods have not been restated. Compensation cost for options will be recognized in earnings, net of estimated forfeitures, on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period. Stock-based compensation expense in the table below does not
reflect any income tax effect, which is consistent with the Companys treatment of net deferred tax assets and offsetting valuation allowance. Upon
the adoption of SFAS 123R, the Company changed its option valuation model from the Black-Scholes model to a lattice valuation model for all stock options granted subsequent to September30, 2005. The lattice valuation model is a more flexible
analysis to value options because of its ability to incorporate inputs that change over time, such as actual exercise behavior of option holders. The Company uses historical data to estimate the option exercise and employee departure behavior in the
lattice valuation model. Expected volatility is based on historical volatility of the Companys stock. The Company uses historical data to estimate option exercise and employee termination within the valuation model. The Company considers all
employees to have similar exercise behavior and therefore has not identified separate homogenous groups for valuation. The expected term of options granted is derived from the output of the option pricing model and represents the period of time that
options granted are expected to be outstanding. The risk-free rate for periods the options are expected to be outstanding is based on the U.S. Treasury yields in effect at the time of grant. The fair value of each option grant is estimated using the assumptions in the following table:  Years Ended September30 2008

Per Share Computation Basic and diluted net loss per share information for all periods is presented under the requirements of SFAS No128, Earnings per Share. Basic earnings per share has been computed using the weighted-average
number of shares of common stock outstanding during the period, less shares that may be repurchased, and excludes any dilutive effects of options and warrants. If the Company had reported net income during the periods presented below, diluted net
income per share would have been computed using common equivalent shares related to outstanding options and warrants to purchase common stock. The numerator for the calculation of basic and diluted earnings per share is net income loss. The

Recent Accounting Pronouncements In September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No157, Fair Value Measurements SFAS 157, which provides enhanced guidance for using fair value to measure assets and liabilities. The standard applies
whenever other standards require or permit assets or liabilities to be measured at fair value. The Standard does not expand the use of fair value in any new circumstances. In February 2008, the FASB issued FASB Staff Position No157-2,
Effective Date of FASB Statement No157, which defers the effective date for all nonfinancial assets and nonfinancial liabilities, except those that are recognized or disclosed at fair value in the financial statements on a recurring basis
that is, at least annually, to fiscal years beginning after November15, 2008. Early adoption is permitted. The adoption of this standard is not expected to have a material effect on the Company results of operations or financial position.
In February 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No159, The Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities SFAS159
including an Amendment of SFAS 115, which permits but does not require the Company to measure financial instruments and certain other items at fair value. Unrealized gains and losses on items for which the fair value option has been elected are
reported in earnings. This statement is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after November15, 2007. The adoption of this standard is not expected to have a material effect on the Companys results of
operations or financial position. In December 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No141 revised 2007, Business Combinations SFAS 141R, which
establishes principles and requirements for how an acquirer recognizes and measures in its financial statements the identifiable assets acquired, the liabilities assumed, and any noncontrolling interest in an acquiree, including the recognition and
measurement of goodwill acquired in a business combination. SFAS 141R is effective for fiscal years beginning on or after December15, 2008. Earlier adoption is prohibited. The adoption of this standard is not expected to have a material
effect on the Company results of operations or financial position. In December 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No160, Noncontrolling Interests in
Consolidated Financial Statements SFAS 160 an amendment of ARB No51. SFAS 160 amends ARB No51 to establish accounting and reporting standards for the noncontrolling interest in a subsidiary and for the
deconsolidation of a subsidiary. It clarifies that a noncontrolling interest in a subsidiary, which is 
51 Table of Contents Sonic Foundry, Inc. Annual Report on Form 10-K For the Year Ended September 30, 2008
sometimes referred to as minority interest, is an ownership interest in the consolidated entity that should be reported as equity in the consolidated
financial statements. Among other requirements, this statement requires consolidated net income to be reported at amounts that include the amounts attributable to both the parent and the noncontrolling interest. It also requires disclosure, on the
face of the consolidated income statement, of the amounts of consolidated net income attributable to the parent and to the noncontrolling interest. SFAS 160 is effective for fiscal years beginning on or after December15, 2008. Earlier adoption
is prohibited. The adoption of this standard is not expected to have a material effect on the Company results of operations or financial position. In
April 2008, the FASB issued FASB Staff Position 142-3, Determination of the Useful Life of Intangible Assets FSP FAS 142-3, which amends the list of factors an entity should consider in developing renewal or extension assumptions in
determining the useful life of recognized intangible assets under FAS No142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets. The new guidance applies to 1intangible assets that are acquired individually or with a group of other assets and
2intangible assets acquired in both business combinations and asset acquisitions. Under FSP FAS 142-3, entities estimating the useful life of a recognized intangible asset must consider their historical experience in renewing or extending
similar arrangements or, in the absence of historical experience, must consider assumptions that market participants would use about renewal or extension. FSP FAS 142-3 will require certain additional disclosures beginning October1, 2009 and
prospective application to useful life estimates prospectively for intangible assets acquired after September20, 2009. The Company is in the process of evaluating the impact that the adoption of FSP FAS 142-3 may have on its financial
statements and related disclosures. In May 2008, the FASB issued Statement No162, The Hierarchy of Generally Accepted Accounting Principles
SFAS 162. SFAS 162 identifies the sources of accounting principles and the framework for selecting the principles to be used in the preparation of financial statements of non-governmental entities that are presented in conformity with
GAAP. SFAS 162 directs the GAAP hierarchy to the entity, not the independent auditors, as the entity is responsible for selecting accounting principles for financial statements that are presented in conformity with GAAP. SFAS 162 is effective 60
days following the SECs approval of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board amendments to remove the GAAP hierarchy from the auditing standards. SFAS 162 is not expected to have a material impact on our financial statements. 
Reclassifications Certain reclassifications have been made

Liquidity The Company has incurred losses from operations in each
of the last three fiscal years. In response to the recurring operating losses, the Company initiated cost reduction efforts in January 2008.These efforts achieved a 24% reduction in quarterly operating expenses. The Company anticipates
operating expenses to remain at or near these reduced levels in fiscal 2009. Although the Company anticipates growth in billings in fiscal 2009, it believes its cash position is adequate to accomplish its business plan through at least the next
twelve months even if billings remain unchanged and therefore has no plans to seek additional debt or equity financing or to issue additional shares previously registered in its available shelf registration. On May 2, 2007, the Company entered into a Loan and Security Agreement the Loan Agreement with Silicon Valley Bank providing for a credit facility in the
form of a $3,000,000 secured revolving line of credit and a $1,000,000 term loan. The Loan Agreement was modified on December 17, 2007 and March 31, 2008 and was amended and restated on June 16, 2008. We may evaluate further operating or capital
lease opportunities to finance equipment purchases in the future and may utilize the Companys revolving line of credit to support working capital needs, if the Company deems it advisable to do so. While the Company anticipates limited use of
the line of credit and that it will be in compliance with all provisions of the agreement, there can be no assurance that the existing Loan Agreement will remain available to the Company nor that additional financing will be available or on terms
acceptable to the Company.  4.
Credit Arrangements On May2, 2007, the Company and its
wholly-owned subsidiary, Sonic Foundry Media Systems, Inc. collectively, the Companies entered into a Loan and Security Agreement the Loan Agreement with Silicon Valley Bank providing for a credit facility in the form of
a $3,000,000 secured revolving line of credit and a $1,000,000 term loan. The ability to borrow up to the maximum $3,000,000 amount of the revolving line of credit is determined by applying an applicable percentage to eligible accounts receivable,
which, following the Loan Amendment, is reduced by a reserve equal to the balance of the term loan. At September 30, 2008, there was $23 million available under this credit facility for advances. Until the recent amendment on June16, 2008
Amended Agreement, the revolving line of credit was to accrue interest at a per annum rate equal to the greater of ione percentage point 1%above Silicon Valley Banks Prime Rate, or iiseven percent 7%.
The term loan accrues interest at a per annum rate equal to the greater of ione percent 1%above Silicon Valley Banks Prime Rate, or iieight and three quarters percent 875%. Interest on the revolving line of credit
and interest on the term loan is payable monthly. Until the Amended Agreement, the revolving line of credit matured in April 2009, at which time all outstanding borrowings and any unpaid interest thereon must be repaid, and all outstanding letters
of credit must be cash collateralized. Until the amended agreement, principal on the term loan was to be repaid in thirty-six 36equal monthly installments, and will be repaid in full on May1, 2010. At September30, 2008, a balance
of $556 thousand was remaining on the term loan with no outstanding balance on the revolving line of credit.

the Companies to maintain certain of their depository, operating and securities accounts with Silicon Valley Bank, maintain a tangible net worth covenant, and maintain a ratio of quick assets to current liabilities minus deferred revenue. The Loan
Agreement also contains certain other restrictive loan covenants, including covenants limiting the Companies ability to dispose of assets, make acquisitions, be acquired, incur indebtedness, grant liens, make investments, pay dividends, and
repurchase stock. The Loan Agreement contains events of default that include, among others, non-payment of principal or interest, inaccuracy of any
representation or warranty, violation of covenants, bankruptcy and insolvency events, material judgments, cross defaults to certain other indebtedness, and material adverse changes. The occurrence of an event of default could result in the
acceleration of the Companies obligations under the Loan Agreement. Pursuant to the Loan Agreement, the Company and its wholly-owned subsidiary
pledged as collateral to the Bank substantially all non-intellectual property business assets, and entered into an Intellectual Property Security Agreement with respect to intellectual property assets. On December17, 2007, the Companies executed the First Loan Modification Agreement the December 2007 Agreement with Silicon Valley Bank. 
The December 2007 Agreement, among other things, a removed a sub-limit of maximum indebtedness under the revolving line of credit of $1,000,000 prior to completion
of a collateral audit; b modified certain covenants including a reduction of the tangible net worth covenant as of September30, 2007 from $8,000,000 to $5,500,000; and c adjusted the definition of Eligible Accounts to, among other things,
iinclude certain international accounts up to a maximum of $750,000, iiadjust the concentration limit with respect to a certain Account Debtor and iiiremove the ineligibility of accounts reflected in deferred revenue.
On March31, 2008, the Companies entered into a letter agreement dated March25, 2008 the March 2008 Agreement with Silicon Valley
Bank. The March 2008 Agreement reduced the tangible net worth covenant as of March31, 2008 from $5,500,000 to $2,800,000, plus, in each case, fifty percent 50%of the Companys net income and new equity or subordinated debt as
defined. On June16, 2008, the Companies entered into the Amended Agreement with Silicon Valley Bank. Under the Amended Agreement, the revolving
line of credit will accrue interest at a per annum rate equal to the following: iduring such period that Sonic Foundry maintains an Adjusted Quick Ratio as defined of greater than 200 to 100, the greater of one percentage point
10%above Silicon Valleys prime rate, or seven percent 70%; or iiduring such period that Sonic Foundry maintains an Adjusted Quick Ratio equal to or less than 200 to 100, the greater of one and one-half percent
15%above Silicon Valleys prime rate, or seven and one-half percent 75%. Under the Amended Agreement, the term loan will continue to accrue interest at a per annum rate equal to the greater of ione percentage point
10%above Silicon Valleys prime rate; or iieight and three quarters percent 875%. Further, under the Amended Agreement, ithe tangible net worth covenant has been removed, iia covenant relating to EBITDA
EBITDA Covenant has been added; however, the EBITDA Covenant will not have to be satisfied provided that Sonic Foundry maintains an Adjusted Quick Ratio as defined greater than or equal to 175 to 100; iiia reserve equal to
the outstanding balance of the term loan will apply against borrowing availability during each 6six-month period the Company maintains less than $200,000 of EBITDA; and ivthe maturity of both the term loan and the revolving line of

Stock Options and Employee Stock Purchase Plan The Company
maintains a qualified employee stock option plan under which the Company may grant options to acquire up to 70million shares of common stock. The Company also maintains a non-qualified plan under which 38million shares of common stock
can be issued and a non-employee directors' stock option plan under which 500thousand shares of common stock may be issued to non-employee directors. In addition, the Company has 640thousand options outstanding pursuant to a previous
non-employee directors stock option plan. Each non-employee director who is re-elected or who is continuing as a member of the Board of Directors on the annual meeting date and on each subsequent meeting of stockholders is granted options to
purchase 20thousand shares of common stock. Each option entitles the holder to purchase one share of common stock at the specified option price. The
exercise price of each option granted under the plans was set at the market price of the Company common stock at the close of trading on the respective grant date. Options vest at various intervals and expire at the earlier of termination of
employment, discontinuance of service on the board of directors, ten years from the grant date or at such times as are set by the Company at the date of grant.

The significant components of the deferred tax accounts recognized for financial reporting purposes are as follows
in thousands:  September30 2008 2007 Deferred tax assets Net operating loss and other carryforwards 33,750 30,666 Common stock warrants 1,769 1,520 Allowance for doubtful accounts 59 105 Other 67 19 Total deferred tax assets 35,645 32,310 Deferred tax liabilities Amortization of goodwill and other intangibles 1,108 852 Net deferred tax liabilities 1,108 852 Valuation allowance 34,537 31,458 Net deferred tax assets   At September30, 2008, the Company had net operating loss carryforwards of approximately $85 million for both
U.S. Federal and state tax purposes, which expire in varying amounts between 2013 and 2028. Utilization of the Companys net operating loss may be subject to substantial annual limitation due to the ownership change limitations provided by the
Internal Revenue Code and similar state provisions. Such an annual limitation could result in the expiration of the net operating loss carryforwards before utilization. In addition, the Company has research and development tax credit carryforwards
of approximately $561 thousand, which expire in varying amounts beginning 2011. The Companys net deferred tax asset has been offset by a valuation allowance of the same amount. The valuation allowance has been recorded due to the uncertainty
of realization of the deferred tax asset. In June 2006, the Financial Accounting Standards Board FASB issued Financial Interpretation
FIN 48 No48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes - An Interpretation of FASB Statement No109. FIN 48 clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in an entitys financial statements in
accordance with SFAS No109, Accounting for Income Taxes, and prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attributes for financial statement disclosure of tax positions taken or expected to be taken on a tax return. Under FIN 48, the
impact of an uncertain income tax position on the income tax return must be recognized at the largest amount that is more-likely-than-not to be sustained upon audit by the relevant taxing authority. An uncertain income tax position will not be
recognized if it has less than a 50% likelihood of being sustained. Additionally, FIN 48 provides guidance on derecognition, classification, interest and penalties, accounting in interim periods, disclosure and transition. The Company adopted the provisions of FIN 48 on October1, 2007. The total amount of unrecognized tax benefits as of the date of adoption was not significant. As
such, there are no unrecognized tax benefits included in the balance sheet that would, if recognized, affect the effective tax rate. The Companys
practice is to recognize interest and/or penalties related to income tax matters in income tax expense. The Company had no accruals for interest and penalties on the Companys Balance Sheets at September30, 2008 and 2007, and has not
recognized any interest or penalties in the Statement of Operations for the years ended September30, 2008, 2007, or 2006. The Company is subject to
taxation in the U.S. and various state jurisdictions. All of the Companys tax years are subject to examination by the U.S. and state tax authorities due to the carryforward of unutilized net operating losses.

Savings Plan The Companys defined contribution 401k
savings plan covers substantially all employees meeting certain minimum eligibility requirements. Participating employees can elect to defer a portion of their compensation and contribute it to the plan on a pretax basis. The Company may also match
certain amounts and/or provide additional discretionary contributions, as defined. The Company made discretionary contributions of $293, $260 and $168 thousand during the years ended September30, 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively. 
In March 2008, the Companys stockholders approved the 2008 Sonic Foundry Employee Stock Purchase Plan Stock Purchase Plan, which allows for the issuance of
500thousand shares of common stock. There were no shares issued under the plan for the year ended September30, 2008. All employees of the Company who have completed ninety days of employment are eligible to participate in the Stock
Purchase Plan, provided the employee would not hold 5% or more of the total combined voting power or value of the Company. Shares may be purchased at the end of a specified period at the lower of 85% of the market value at the beginning or the end
of the specified period through accumulation of payroll deductions.  9.
Related-Party Transactions The Company incurred fees of $249, $241
and $153 thousand during the years ended September30, 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively, to a law firm whose partner is a director and stockholder of the Company. The Company had accrued liabilities for unbilled services of $86 thousand at
September30, 2007 to the same law firm. There were no unbilled services at September30, 2008. The Company recorded Mediasite product and
customer support revenue related to $580, $583 and $602 thousand of billings during the years ended September30, 2008, 2007 and 2006 to Mediasite KK, a Japanese reseller in which the Company has an equity interest. Mediasite KK owed the
Company $108 and $132 thousand on such billings at September30, 2008 and 2007, respectively. During 2007, the Company entered into two transactions
with an entity in which a member of the Companys Board of Directors is a significant shareholder. The transactions included billings of $236 thousand for the Companys products and services in exchange for advertising services. The
Company recognized $137 thousand of revenue during the year ended September30, 2007 and deferred $99 thousand of revenue at September30, 2007. The deferral was recognized in full in 2008. No sales were recorded during the years ended
September30, 2008 and 2006. During the years ended September30, 2008, 2007 and 2006, the Company had a loan outstanding to an executive
totaling $26. The loan is collateralized by company stock.  10.
Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets The Company accounts for
goodwill and other intangible assets in accordance with SFAS No142 Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets. SFAS No142 requires that goodwill and intangible assets that have indefinite useful lives not be amortized but, instead, tested at
least annually for impairment. We assess the impairment of goodwill and capitalized software development costs on an annual basis or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the fair value of these assets is less than the carrying
value. If we determine that the fair value of goodwill is less than its carrying value, based upon the annual test or the existence of impairment, we
would then measure impairment based on a comparison of the implied fair value of goodwill with the carrying amount of goodwill. To the extent the carrying amount of goodwill is greater than the implied fair value of goodwill, we would record an
impairment charge for the difference. 
59 Table of Contents Sonic Foundry, Inc. Annual Report on Form 10-K For the Year Ended September 30, 2008
On July1, 2008, the Company performed its annual goodwill impairment test and tested goodwill recognized in
connection with the acquisition of Mediasite and determined it was not impaired. Subsequent impairment charges for Mediasite or other acquisitions, if any, will be reflected as an operating expense in the statement of operations.

CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
Based on evaluations as of the end of the period covered by this report, our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, with the
participation of our management team, have concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures as defined in Rules 13a-15e, and 15d-15e under the Securities Exchange Act were effective. Limitations on the effectiveness of Controls and Permitted Omission from Managements Assessment Our internal control over financial reporting is designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of
financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. All internal control systems, no matter how well designed, have inherent limitations, including the possibility of human error and the
circumvention or overriding of controls. Accordingly, even effective internal controls can only provide reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement preparation. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are
subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. Managements Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting Our management is responsible for establishing
and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as such term is defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15f. 
61 Table of Contents Sonic Foundry, Inc. Annual Report on Form 10-K For the Year Ended September 30, 2008
Under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our principal executive officer and
principal financial officer, we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting based on the framework in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations
of the Treadway Commission. Based on this evaluation, our management believes that, as of September30, 2008, our internal control over financial
reporting was effective based on those criteria. Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting During the period covered by this report, we have not made any change to our internal control over financial reporting that has materially affected, or is reasonably
likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.  ITEM9B.
